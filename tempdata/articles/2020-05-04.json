Nearly 150 of them faced prosecution, while the rest escaped with warnings. \u201cWe did see at the weekend that it can be easy to start slackening off,\u201d Bloomfield said The breaches included two separate incidents on Sunday in which people out fishing required rescue by helicopter. Fishing by boat is a banned activity under the current rules. Bloomfield said the \u201creal test\u201d of how well New Zealanders were observing the rules will come later in the week, when lockdown breaches since last Monday would become apparent, based on the virus\u2019 incubation period. Ardern\u2019s cabinet was due to make a decision next Monday about whether the lockdown rules should be eased further. A lower alert level, if imposed, would likely be implemented next Wednesday. One measure she will be considering in her decision will be the speed of the country\u2019s contact tracing, which was criticised early on in the pandemic. But another will be New Zealanders\u2019 behaviour to date. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the number of cases or the pattern,\u201d said Bloomfield, \u201cBut the level to which people are taking seriously the expectations, particularly around physical distancing, hygiene measures and not really squandering the advantage we\u2019ve created for ourselves.\u201d",

However, this is also what helped to make the diagnosis as the case was so striking.\u201d</p> \n<p>Malara was looking at the lungs of Italy\u2019s \u201cpatient 1\u201d, the first confirmed case of domestic transmission of the virus in a country where it would go on to kill nearly 29,000 people. Until that day, Malara said, the coronavirus seemed like something that was so remote, only happening in China and other Asian countries as the rest of the world watched from a distance.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes, we had guidelines and we spoke about it, but nobody could ever have imagined that it would spread so much in Italy,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Testing at the time was only for those who had returned from China, and Malara had to bend the guidelines to order a Covid-19 swab for Maestri. When the result came back it prompted both the closure of the hospital\u2019s emergency wing and a government order to quarantine the entire town south of Milan, marking Europe\u2019s first coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>Maestri had had symptoms typical of coronavirus \u2013 a fever, cough and shortness of breath \u2013 for about 10 days before he first visited the hospital. An initial X-ray showed there was slight pneumonia on his right lung. He was given antibiotics and asked if he wanted to stay in hospital, but he declined. His symptoms worsened and a few hours later he returned and was immediately admitted and given oxygen therapy. Malara was called by her colleagues for advice during Maestri\u2019s CT scan.</p> \n<p>Another detail that prompted the test emerged during a conversation with Maestri\u2019s wife, who was eight months pregnant. Maestri had told doctors several times that his last trip abroad was to New York in September but his wife then recalled that a few weeks earlier he was at a dinner with a colleague who had recently returned from China. The colleague did not present any symptoms at the time and tested negative for the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c534e97c31291326ba61ad7471c5fc51d60b4221\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c534e97c31291326ba61ad7471c5fc51d60b4221/0_0_4782_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A patient in a biocontainment unit is carried on a stretcher from an ambulance into the Columbus Covid 2 hospital in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A patient in a bio-containment unit is carried on a stretcher from an ambulance into the Columbus Covid 2 hospital in Rome.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The diagnosis caught the whole of Italy off-guard, despite the country\u2019s first cases being detected in late January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive in Rome. During the intervening period, life had mostly carried on as usual. There was the occasional report of an Italian \u201cpossibly\u201d having the virus, only for it to turn out to be a false alarm.</p> \n<p>Two days after Codogno was quarantined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread\">nine other Lombardy towns went into lockdown</a>, along with one in the Veneto region, where Italy\u2019s first coronavirus death occurred.</p> \n<p>Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, said in the week after the diagnosis that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-may-have-been-in-italy-for-weeks-before-it-was-detected\">the virus may have been</a> circulating in the quarantined areas of northern Italy for weeks before it was detected by Malara\u2019s test.</p> \n<p>Maestri recovered, as did his wife and the two Chinese visitors. Malara has spoken to Maestri over the phone, and said he is doing well. He became a father a few weeks ago. But tragically, before he was discharged from hospital his father died of Covid-19 in his hometown of Castiglione d\u2019Adda.</p> \n<h2>The horror of the outbreak is revealed</h2> \n<p>On 3 March, Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda, one of the 10 quarantined towns, <a href=\"https://video.lastampa.it/cronaca/costantino-pesatori-il-sindaco-di-castiglione-d-adda-siamo-soli-la-gente-muore-e-non-ci-sono-medici/110755/110763\">posted a video appeal for help</a>. Up until that point, most people in Italy were still very confused about the largely unknown threat, at that time mainly known in the west through reports from China. The virus was killing people and beginning to overwhelm hospitals, but the early deaths seemed to reflect a similar pattern: older people with underlying health issues. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e63dde2b505f5737e03cf62e8863fb1872133b8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e63dde2b505f5737e03cf62e8863fb1872133b8/138_46_1860_1116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/a-warning-to-europe-italy-struggle-to-convince-citizens-of-coronavirus-crisis\">leaders of some </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/a-warning-to-europe-italy-struggle-to-convince-citizens-of-coronavirus-crisis\">towns and cities</a> were encouraging citizens to fight against the fear \u2013 by going to bars, restaurants and shops \u2013 Pesatori knew better.</p> \n<p><strong>\u201c</strong>I knew straight away how serious it was because from the day the epidemic was discovered in Codogno people in my town were dying,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you consider two or three people a day dying in a town of 4,600, this is not normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pesatori\u2019s plea revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/this-is-surreal-italian-towns-struggle-under-coronavirus-lockdown\">details of the virus\u2019s devastating impact</a>, which until then had mostly been under the radar. Eighteen people died in the town within less than a fortnight, including a 55-year-old man with no known underlying illnesses. With three of the town\u2019s five doctors quarantined and two in hospital, there was nobody to tend to those who were sick at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation was really worrying,\u201d Pesatori said. \u201cI understood that this was something new and difficult to manage, but many mayors were without support and because people elsewhere didn\u2019t understand how serious things were, they felt they were free to carry on as normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two military doctors were sent to the town on 11 March, two days after the whole of Lombardy was quarantined, a move that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/leaked-coronavirus-plan-to-quarantine-16m-sparks-chaos-in-italy\">prompted thousands to flee south</a>. It was also the day Italy became the first country to enforce a nationwide lockdown. By that stage, 827 people in Italy had died and more than 12,000 were infected. It was a move many had believed could never be ordered in a democracy without the means to coerce its citizens, but within weeks it was replicated across the continent and worldwide as the number of deaths rose.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3502d6140ac83e4386e01838c546da04afdce6f4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3502d6140ac83e4386e01838c546da04afdce6f4/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police stop cars trying to enter or leave the cordoned area in Casalpusterlengo, northern Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police stop cars trying to enter or leave the cordoned area in Casalpusterlengo, northern Italy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Furlan/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As Pesatori struggled to help his citizens, his family was struck: his mother, who died on 25 March, is among the town\u2019s 76 fatalities.</p> \n<p>\u201cI learned through all of this that you have to hold your nerve,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite my pain I had to look forward, for our future generation but also to ensure health is protected.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although people are still in hospital, both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-italy-lombardy-province-at-centre-of-outbreak-offers-glimmer-of-hope\">emergency and contagion rate have subsided</a>. \u201cBut the virus is still circulating, and so we can\u2019t completely drop our guard,\u201d said Pesatori.</p> \n<p>While attention was focused on Codogno during the first two weeks of its confirmed outbreak, a more discrete drama was unfolding in Bergamo, a province north of Milan. The first case of coronavirus was detected at a hospital in Alzano Lombardo on 23 February, but Bergamo only went into lockdown with the rest of the Lombardy region on 8 March. It quickly became Italy\u2019s most severely affected province.</p> \n<h2>No more beds in Bergamo</h2> \n<p>\u201cThere are no more beds here.\u201d These were the last words Ettore Consonni, 61, a retired warehouse worker, heard before slipping into a coma at a hospital in Bergamo.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c600c3816338a60e707a9bd4dd12a829cf59b792\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c600c3816338a60e707a9bd4dd12a829cf59b792/281_110_2029_1219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ettore Consonni.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ettore Consonni.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Giorgio Ruta</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Consonni was admitted on 4 March, not long after returning from the Dominican Republic where he and his wife celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary.</p> \n<p>Back in Italy, he began developing the Covid-19 symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. A test confirmed the worst.</p> \n<p>At that stage of the outbreak, well-resourced hospitals across Lombardy and in the second worst-affected region of Emilia-Romagna were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/italian-hospitals-short-beds-coronavirus-death-toll-jumps\">struggling to cope</a>, with intensive care beds dwindling as the infection spread.</p> \n<p>In an attempt to manage the emergency, sick people were placed in operating rooms or hospital corridors, while others were airlifted on military planes to southern Italy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"798e5e85a15954e22eb2feb18c954fb6a8869834\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/798e5e85a15954e22eb2feb18c954fb6a8869834/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Military and medical personnel and police transport coffins in Ponte San Pietro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Military and medical personnel and police transport coffins in Ponte San Pietro.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Cozzoli/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When Consonni awoke after 23 days in a coma, he was in Sicily.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought it was a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell asleep in Bergamo, my city in the extreme north, and I woke up in Palermo, in the deep south. I heard accents among the medical staff, but I thought it was simply the many Sicilian health professionals who work in Bergamo. Then they took me to the window and I saw it was no joke.\u201d</p> \n<p>Consonni shared a ward at the Benfratelli hospital with other patients from the north. \u201cThe doctors told me I almost died,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t remember anything from those days.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eventually discharged from intensive care, by early April he was breathing normally. A second test came back negative and on 21 April Consonni left hospital amid resounding applause.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have Sicily tattooed on my skin because I was given a second life here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Consonni arrived home to more applause from family and neighbours, despite noticing a peculiar look on their faces. \u201cI knew something really bad had happened. My wife sat me down and told me that my brother had died of Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<p>Consonni realised that while he was fighting for his life, life in Bergamo had descended into heartbreak. Doctors compared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war\">situation to war</a>, with one medic claiming that saving a life was decided by age and health conditions.</p> \n<p>The sirens never stopped, church bells rang for each of the dead. Coffins stacked up in churches and, with cemeteries full, some were taken by military truck for burial in neighbouring regions. The corpses of those who had died at home were kept in sealed-off rooms for days as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/generation-has-died-italian-province-struggles-bury-coronavirus-dead\">undertakers struggled to cope</a>.</p> \n<h2>Death at home: a daughter\u2019s story</h2> \n<p>\u201cHe died in my mother\u2019s arms as I was on the telephone, trying to get help,\u201d said Asia Marchesi, 24. \u201cWatching him struggling to breathe was like watching somebody drown.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179c8a807c8f8711f09f4ff2e8526f0645d4507f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179c8a807c8f8711f09f4ff2e8526f0645d4507f/8_24_987_592/500.jpg\" alt=\"A family photo of Asia Marchesi as a child with her father\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family photo of Asia Marchesi as a child with her father</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her father, Siro, is one of many who died at home, a silent toll which, as with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/italian-police-broaden-care-home-coronavirus-milan\">deaths in care homes</a>, has not been recorded in the official statistics.</p> \n<p>It is thought the 64-year-old may have contracted Covid-19 on 22 February, when he visited the emergency unit of a hospital in Bergamo city for a foot infection.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe had to take an antibiotic for that but it wasn\u2019t anything serious, after a week he was better,\u201d his daughter said.</p> \n<p>He then travelled to the family\u2019s second home in Liguria, but returned to Bergamo on 6 March after he started to feel unwell.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the moment he became ill the nightmare began.\u201d Asia Marchesi made frantic calls to helpline numbers and as she waited for a response, she could hear her father\u2019s breathing getting worse.

      "bodyText": "The first diagnosis Annalisa Malara, a 38-year-old anaesthetist at Codogno hospital in the northern Lombardy region, was horrified when she saw the image of the lungs of Mattia Maestri, an otherwise fit and healthy person of the same age, as he underwent a CT scan on the morning of 20 February. \u201cThe image was monstrous \u2013 within less than 48 hours his pneumonia had transformed from being something small into something devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the idea that this patient could be infected with such severity really threw me \u2013 he was young, healthy and athletic. However, this is also what helped to make the diagnosis as the case was so striking.\u201d Malara was looking at the lungs of Italy\u2019s \u201cpatient 1\u201d, the first confirmed case of domestic transmission of the virus in a country where it would go on to kill nearly 29,000 people. Until that day, Malara said, the coronavirus seemed like something that was so remote, only happening in China and other Asian countries as the rest of the world watched from a distance. \u201cYes, we had guidelines and we spoke about it, but nobody could ever have imagined that it would spread so much in Italy,\u201d she said. Testing at the time was only for those who had returned from China, and Malara had to bend the guidelines to order a Covid-19 swab for Maestri. When the result came back it prompted both the closure of the hospital\u2019s emergency wing and a government order to quarantine the entire town south of Milan, marking Europe\u2019s first coronavirus lockdown. Maestri had had symptoms typical of coronavirus \u2013 a fever, cough and shortness of breath \u2013 for about 10 days before he first visited the hospital. An initial X-ray showed there was slight pneumonia on his right lung. He was given antibiotics and asked if he wanted to stay in hospital, but he declined. His symptoms worsened and a few hours later he returned and was immediately admitted and given oxygen therapy. Malara was called by her colleagues for advice during Maestri\u2019s CT scan. Another detail that prompted the test emerged during a conversation with Maestri\u2019s wife, who was eight months pregnant. Maestri had told doctors several times that his last trip abroad was to New York in September but his wife then recalled that a few weeks earlier he was at a dinner with a colleague who had recently returned from China. The colleague did not present any symptoms at the time and tested negative for the virus. The diagnosis caught the whole of Italy off-guard, despite the country\u2019s first cases being detected in late January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive in Rome. During the intervening period, life had mostly carried on as usual. There was the occasional report of an Italian \u201cpossibly\u201d having the virus, only for it to turn out to be a false alarm. Two days after Codogno was quarantined, nine other Lombardy towns went into lockdown, along with one in the Veneto region, where Italy\u2019s first coronavirus death occurred. Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, said in the week after the diagnosis that the virus may have been circulating in the quarantined areas of northern Italy for weeks before it was detected by Malara\u2019s test. Maestri recovered, as did his wife and the two Chinese visitors. Malara has spoken to Maestri over the phone, and said he is doing well. He became a father a few weeks ago. But tragically, before he was discharged from hospital his father died of Covid-19 in his hometown of Castiglione d\u2019Adda. The horror of the outbreak is revealed On 3 March, Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda, one of the 10 quarantined towns, posted a video appeal for help. Up until that point, most people in Italy were still very confused about the largely unknown threat, at that time mainly known in the west through reports from China. The virus was killing people and beginning to overwhelm hospitals, but the early deaths seemed to reflect a similar pattern: older people with underlying health issues. While leaders of some towns and cities were encouraging citizens to fight against the fear \u2013 by going to bars, restaurants and shops \u2013 Pesatori knew better. \u201cI knew straight away how serious it was because from the day the epidemic was discovered in Codogno people in my town were dying,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you consider two or three people a day dying in a town of 4,600, this is not normal.\u201d Pesatori\u2019s plea revealed details of the virus\u2019s devastating impact, which until then had mostly been under the radar. Eighteen people died in the town within less than a fortnight, including a 55-year-old man with no known underlying illnesses. With three of the town\u2019s five doctors quarantined and two in hospital, there was nobody to tend to those who were sick at home. \u201cThe situation was really worrying,\u201d Pesatori said. \u201cI understood that this was something new and difficult to manage, but many mayors were without support and because people elsewhere didn\u2019t understand how serious things were, they felt they were free to carry on as normal.\u201d Two military doctors were sent to the town on 11 March, two days after the whole of Lombardy was quarantined, a move that prompted thousands to flee south. It was also the day Italy became the first country to enforce a nationwide lockdown. By that stage, 827 people in Italy had died and more than 12,000 were infected. It was a move many had believed could never be ordered in a democracy without the means to coerce its citizens, but within weeks it was replicated across the continent and worldwide as the number of deaths rose. As Pesatori struggled to help his citizens, his family was struck: his mother, who died on 25 March, is among the town\u2019s 76 fatalities. \u201cI learned through all of this that you have to hold your nerve,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite my pain I had to look forward, for our future generation but also to ensure health is protected.\u201d Although people are still in hospital, both the emergency and contagion rate have subsided. \u201cBut the virus is still circulating, and so we can\u2019t completely drop our guard,\u201d said Pesatori. While attention was focused on Codogno during the first two weeks of its confirmed outbreak, a more discrete drama was unfolding in Bergamo, a province north of Milan. The first case of coronavirus was detected at a hospital in Alzano Lombardo on 23 February, but Bergamo only went into lockdown with the rest of the Lombardy region on 8 March. It quickly became Italy\u2019s most severely affected province. No more beds in Bergamo \u201cThere are no more beds here.\u201d These were the last words Ettore Consonni, 61, a retired warehouse worker, heard before slipping into a coma at a hospital in Bergamo. Consonni was admitted on 4 March, not long after returning from the Dominican Republic where he and his wife celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary. Back in Italy, he began developing the Covid-19 symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. A test confirmed the worst. At that stage of the outbreak, well-resourced hospitals across Lombardy and in the second worst-affected region of Emilia-Romagna were struggling to cope, with intensive care beds dwindling as the infection spread. In an attempt to manage the emergency, sick people were placed in operating rooms or hospital corridors, while others were airlifted on military planes to southern Italy. When Consonni awoke after 23 days in a coma, he was in Sicily. \u201cI thought it was a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell asleep in Bergamo, my city in the extreme north, and I woke up in Palermo, in the deep south. I heard accents among the medical staff, but I thought it was simply the many Sicilian health professionals who work in Bergamo. Then they took me to the window and I saw it was no joke.\u201d Consonni shared a ward at the Benfratelli hospital with other patients from the north. \u201cThe doctors told me I almost died,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t remember anything from those days.\u201d Eventually discharged from intensive care, by early April he was breathing normally. A second test came back negative and on 21 April Consonni left hospital amid resounding applause. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Sicily tattooed on my skin because I was given a second life here.\u201d Consonni arrived home to more applause from family and neighbours, despite noticing a peculiar look on their faces. \u201cI knew something really bad had happened. My wife sat me down and told me that my brother had died of Covid-19.\u201d Consonni realised that while he was fighting for his life, life in Bergamo had descended into heartbreak. Doctors compared the situation to war, with one medic claiming that saving a life was decided by age and health conditions. The sirens never stopped, church bells rang for each of the dead. Coffins stacked up in churches and, with cemeteries full, some were taken by military truck for burial in neighbouring regions. The corpses of those who had died at home were kept in sealed-off rooms for days as undertakers struggled to cope. Death at home: a daughter\u2019s story \u201cHe died in my mother\u2019s arms as I was on the telephone, trying to get help,\u201d said Asia Marchesi, 24. \u201cWatching him struggling to breathe was like watching somebody drown.\u201d Her father, Siro, is one of many who died at home, a silent toll which, as with deaths in care homes, has not been recorded in the official statistics. It is thought the 64-year-old may have contracted Covid-19 on 22 February, when he visited the emergency unit of a hospital in Bergamo city for a foot infection. \u201cHe had to take an antibiotic for that but it wasn\u2019t anything serious, after a week he was better,\u201d his daughter said. He then travelled to the family\u2019s second home in Liguria, but returned to Bergamo on 6 March after he started to feel unwell. \u201cFrom the moment he became ill the nightmare began.\u201d Asia Marchesi made frantic calls to helpline numbers and as she waited for a response, she could hear her father\u2019s breathing getting worse. His GP visited and prescribed an antibiotic. Despite presenting all the symptoms and being immunosuppressed, no coronavirus test was done. He died on 13 March, and his body was kept at home for one-and-a-half days, covered with a sheet, while the family waited for a doctor to certify the death. As with many other deaths at home or in residential care, no postmortem test was done for Covid-19. Asia Marchesi struggled not to cry as she described her father. \u201cUntil the last moment, all he kept saying was: \u2018Asia, stop calling the doctors, I don\u2019t want to disturb them.\u2019\u201d She added: \u201cThere is some comfort that we were with him at the end, as so many people die alone in hospital, but he died such a terrible death. We felt abandoned.\u201d With funerals banned and physical distancing in place, she, her mother and two siblings who live nearby were unable to be physically comforted by relatives and friends, amplifying their grief. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even \u2026 receive a hug.\u201d Marchesi has joined NOI Denunceremo (We Will Denounce), a Facebook group for relatives of victims who are seeking justice. \u201cPeople have lost their loved ones unjustly,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if these are difficult economic times I do not want financial compensation as it won\u2019t bring my father back. What I want is for whoever made a mistake to take responsibility.\u201d Only ambulances in Milan In normal times Milan is Italy\u2019s business and fashion hub. The Lombardy capital started to empty out soon after the outbreak began in Codogno but it did not go into quarantine until 9 March. The only vehicles speeding through the normally clogged streets during lockdown have been ambulances, especially at night, when 33-year-old Matteo Derai joins the hundreds of volunteers responding to callouts. Eighty per cent of the calls during the peak were for suspected Covid-19. \u201cNobody is forcing me to do this, but above all in these moments we must be courageous,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly when my shift is over do I realise that I haven\u2019t slept for 24 hours.\u201d His partner, Fosca, is a nurse on maternity leave who cares for their newborn son, Tommaso. When Derai returns home, after shuttling suspected Covid-19 patients around hospitals, he lives with the fear of bringing the virus home to his family. \u201cRoughly eight out of 10 patients who I have seen were suspected cases of Covid-19,\u201d said Derai, who during the day works for a watch company. \u201cAnd often you have no idea what to expect when you reach their homes. When I did my job before the outbreak, I was full of adrenaline. Now I\u2019m fear-stricken. \u201cIf before the outbreak, I tried to support people emotionally as well, now, when you are so concerned about your own safety, you let this human connection slip.\u201d It has been common for first-responders to bring to hospitals relatives of patients already being treated for or dead from Covid-19. \u201cWe brought in patients who had already lost their loved ones to the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are well aware that they, too, will have to face the same sort of odyssey.\u201d One, Derai said, was a woman who had lost her husband. \u201cShe told us that what struck her most was the silence without him and that she may be heading towards the same destiny.\u201d He does not know whether the dozens of patients he brought to hospital lived or died.

Even if I knew it probably wasn\u2019t true.\u201d The uncertain future After almost two months under lockdown, the longest so far of any European country, Italy will begin slowly easing restrictions on 4 May. But as the health emergency subsides, the next major challenge will be the economic one. The forecast is bleak. Experts predict a crisis not seen in decades. While industry across the country will resume from Monday, most retailers will not reopen until 18 May, while bars and restaurants \u2013 the backbone of the economy of so many Italian towns \u2013 will stay closed until 1 June. Many small businesses may never reopen. Soemia Ira, 38, a street performer previously making a living in Catania, Sicily, has not worked since the lockdown began and has no idea what the future will hold. Her livelihood depends on a vibrant street culture. \u201cI live for gatherings,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout people around me, my work is over. I\u2019m at risk of extinction. \u201cI dedicated the last six years of my life to become a street performer, but Covid-19 may take it all away.\u201d The government has allocated \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.9bn) for workers at small companies, but this may not be enough. The first sign of economic upheaval came towards the end of March, when reports emerged of social unrest in Italy\u2019s poorer south and people stealing from supermarkets after they ran out of food and money. Red Cross volunteers now deliver food to those in need but the mafia has also reportedly been exploiting the situation by distributing food parcels to the poorest districts of southern Italy. Thousands in the months ahead risk unemployment. And with summer on its way the pandemic will have a devastating impact on tourism, a crucial contributor to Italy\u2019s economy, risking closure for hotels, bars, restaurants and tourist services. A few days into lockdown, people across Italy sang and played music from their balconies as they came together to say: \u201cAndr\u00e0 tutto bene\u201d (Everything will be all right). But lives have changed over the last few months, and a different saying is gathering momentum: \u201cNo,\u201d Ira said. \u201cEverything will not be all right.\u201d",

The longer the pandemic continues, Ugharte adds, the greater the physical and mental toll it will take.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese women are in a precarious state in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cEmotionally and psychologically, they\u2019ve suffered collateral damage from working in prostitution. But now they need money \u2013 and not just for themselves. A lot of the women send it back to their families in their home countries, and those families are also in a crisis situation because of the pandemic. At the moment, these women just can\u2019t see any way out of this.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the coronavirus\u2019s physical symptoms include fever and a cough, its defining psychological legacy is the sense of uncertainty and powerlessness that mingles with the fear and the boredom.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery time you turn on the TV, you hear about all the people who are dying and there\u2019s nothing you can do,\u201d says Paloma P\u00e9rez as she prepares to eat her latest doorstep lunch. \u201cThings seem to be getting a bit better, but it\u2019s always hanging over you and we know there\u2019s an economic crisis on the way.

It says demand in the Madrid region has tripled over the past few weeks and 85% of the requests it receives are for food, medicine, or assistance in covering basic living costs. It is one of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) striving to mitigate the socio-economic effects of the pandemic amid warnings that the poorest and most marginalised members of society will be the hardest hit by the virus in a country that has not yet fully recovered from the 2008 economic crisis. Spain\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government has announced a four-phase transition towards some kind of return to normality, and launched what it calls \u201cthe greatest mobilisation of resources in Spain\u2019s entire democratic history\u201d to help the country weather the pandemic. It has promised a \u20ac200bn relief package, including a moratorium on mortgage payments and utility bills, an easing of social security contributions, and a \u20ac440 payment to temporary workers whose contracts have been ended. Despite those initiatives, the economic damage caused by Covid-19 is becoming increasingly visible. In the first quarter of 2020, the Spanish economy shrank by a record 5.2%.

The 2008 crisis discriminated between rich and poor \u2013 this one doesn\u2019t.\u201d While it may be an egalitarian blight, Covid-19 is already being felt most keenly by the most marginalised of the marginalised \u2013 including sex workers and victims of trafficking. \u201cSome of our colleagues are in a horrific situation right now; some don\u2019t have money to buy food for their kids, let alone pay the rent,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Barrera, a spokeswoman for the Prostitutes\u2019 Collective of Seville. \u201cA lot of our colleagues are undocumented immigrants who have symptoms of the coronavirus but who are too scared to go to the doctor because they\u2019re worried about being reported to the authorities.\u201d Prostitution was decriminalised in Spain in 1995 and the sector is now thought to employ about 300,000 people. Idoia Ugarte, a lecturer in nursing who works with Doctors of the World in Castilla-La Mancha, the Spanish region with the most brothels, offers a similar assessment. Since the national state of emergency was declared, the NGO has been keeping in touch with sex workers by phone. While the women say the number of men seeking sex has fallen since the lockdown kicked in, demand has not disappeared. The problem is that many women are already so indebted to pimps, traffickers, or the brothels and clubs where they live and work, that they have no choice but to risk their health by continuing to have sex for money, even as the virus spreads. \u201cThe situation is fairly critical because if they get into more debt, the only way they have to pay it off is through prostitution,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re having to run a terrible risk.\u201d Ugarte and her colleagues welcome the government\u2019s recent announcement that sex workers and victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation will be offered support, emergency accommodation and access to the new benefit to be known as the minimum vital income while the crisis lasts. But they worry that the services will be hard for many affected women to access and could end up being little more than a sticking plaster. The longer the pandemic continues, Ugharte adds, the greater the physical and mental toll it will take. \u201cThese women are in a precarious state in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cEmotionally and psychologically, they\u2019ve suffered collateral damage from working in prostitution. But now they need money \u2013 and not just for themselves. A lot of the women send it back to their families in their home countries, and those families are also in a crisis situation because of the pandemic. At the moment, these women just can\u2019t see any way out of this.\u201d If the coronavirus\u2019s physical symptoms include fever and a cough, its defining psychological legacy is the sense of uncertainty and powerlessness that mingles with the fear and the boredom. \u201cEvery time you turn on the TV, you hear about all the people who are dying and there\u2019s nothing you can do,\u201d says Paloma P\u00e9rez as she prepares to eat her latest doorstep lunch. \u201cThings seem to be getting a bit better, but it\u2019s always hanging over you and we know there\u2019s an economic crisis on the way. Things are pretty bleak now.\u201d",

The president used a Fox News \u201cvirtual town hall\u201d on Sunday night to repeat his regular virus talking points, including that a vaccine was not far away, Covid-19 was China\u2019s fault and the economy would not only recover but \u201cgrow like crazy\u201d. \u201cWe are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year,\u201d Trump said.

The Associated Press said a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated 1 May found China held off informing the World Health Organization (WHO) that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad, and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply. Those conclusions were based on the 95% probability that China\u2019s changes in import and export behaviour were not within normal range, the report said. Asked about the the virus\u2019s origins, Trump again suggested it came from a Wuhan lab. \u201cI think they made a horrible mistake and they didn\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d he said.

Dozens of New Yorkers were fined for violating social distancing guidelines as they flocked to beaches and parks in balmy weekend weather. China reported three new coronavirus cases, versus two the day before. Japan\u2019s state of emergency is expected to be extended until the end of the month. France will not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus. New Zealand has reported no new coronavirus cases for the first time. South Korea plans to ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they \u201cfollow disinfection measures\u201d. Brazil has become the first country in Latin America to report more than 100,000 cases.

When your life is confined to the same four walls, with each journey to the kitchen an odyssey, the world outside takes on a whole new allure. I now find myself entranced by all the different varieties of privet hedge, intrigued by people\u2019s choice of gravel size and paving pattern, captivated by the clusters of cacti perched on windowsills. Front doors have become a new form of entertainment, as have the subtleties of window-mouldings and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architrave\">architraves</a>.

When your life is confined to the same four walls, with each journey to the kitchen an odyssey, the world outside takes on a whole new allure. I now find myself entranced by all the different varieties of privet hedge, intrigued by people\u2019s choice of gravel size and paving pattern, captivated by the clusters of cacti perched on windowsills. Front doors have become a new form of entertainment, as have the subtleties of window-mouldings and architraves. Who knew there could be so many varieties of mortar on a single street? There\u2019s nothing like six weeks of house arrest to give you an elevated awareness of your surroundings. And it\u2019s a phenomenon that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed at the nation\u2019s grand repository of objects, the Victoria and Albert. \u201cThe pandemic has this weird way of bringing to the fore objects you would never have thought about,\u201d says Brendan Cormier, senior design curator at the London museum. \u201cEverything becomes heightened.\u201d With future exhibitions on hold and collecting in limbo, Cormier has turned his team\u2019s attention to thinking about how the coronavirus has reframed the everyday, casting familiar objects in a very different light.

      "body": "<p>Curtis Jackson has downsized. The rapper/actor/businessman, better known as 50 Cent, used to live in a palace of a house formerly owned by Mike Tyson. Not any more. He has been in self-isolation for six weeks and is more than happy to make do with a three-bed apartment (on four floors, mind) in New York. He can\u2019t remember when he was last in one place for so long, he says, and is learning about himself. \u201cI\u2019ve become a bit more comfortable with being in my own space. I don\u2019t think being at home is a punishment.\u201d</p> <p>He bought the Tyson house after his triumphant first album; Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 shifted 12m copies in 2003, making it the bestselling album of the year. It was explosive \u2013 growling rap packed with threats, boasts and great songs such as In Da Club and Many Men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a6234db85c68e775fe933d2a656f54d5d107182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a6234db85c68e775fe933d2a656f54d5d107182/0_172_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mugshot from 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mugshot from 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Get Rich was really his life story. And what a story. His drug-dealing mother, Sabrina, was murdered when he was eight (drugged and gassed at 23 by an unknown killer in her home); he started selling drugs on the streets at 12, bought his first gun at 15 and was shot nine times at the age of 25 (including a bullet through the cheek that gives him his distinctive slur today). He was dropped by Columbia without releasing a record, signed up by Eminem and championed by Dr Dre. And then came that monster first album. Jackson hasn\u2019t repeated the success of his debut (although his second album, The Massacre, was also huge), but he has continued to hustle and find headline-grabbing ways of getting rich.</p> <p>For Jackson, it begins and ends with the money, right down to the name, which he appropriated from a dead gangster. When he bought the Tyson house, he says, he had been struggling to pay his $800-a-month rent bill for the apartment he shared with his then-partner and his first son, Marquise. \u201cThen I left for a tour of Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 and I came back with $38m [\u00a330m]. So getting that place was confirmation of success.\u201d But he got bored. \u201cYou may have 18 bedrooms, but you can only sleep on one bed. You have all that space, but you still can\u2019t walk around the house naked, \u2019cause you\u2019ve got staff. Going down the hall was like walking down the street.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson has just written a very readable book about how to do things his way. Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter is classic Fiddy \u2013 a self-help guide for aspiring bigwigs. By turns, he comes across as machiavellian (tips include pretending to drink on a night out with colleagues then exploiting the weaknesses they have drunkenly revealed), cynical (women just want him for his money), puritanical (he doesn\u2019t drink or take drugs), little-boy-lost (desperately seeking affirmation) and wise elder (telling readers of the need to constantly evolve to stay relevant). When he is not boasting, bullying or dissing, much of his advice is perfectly sensible \u2013 be true to yourself, don\u2019t make the same mistake twice and dress decently if you want to make an impression.</p> <p>I ask what he is wearing today. \u201cI don\u2019t even have all my clothes on yet.\u201d That\u2019s exciting, I say, tell me more. \u201cI\u2019m wearing an undershirt, like a white tank top, and black sweatpants.\u201d Hold on, I say: in your book, you suggest not looking your best for somebody shows a lack of respect. I know we are only talking on the phone, but \u2026 \u201cYeah, \u2019cause I\u2019m in quarantine in the house and that doesn\u2019t apply to quarantine.\u201d He laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f693ce25f94b73ceb2b626c49c60af1d96ea5dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f693ce25f94b73ceb2b626c49c60af1d96ea5dc/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"50 Cent, Eminem and Dr Dre in New York in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">50 Cent, Eminem and Dr Dre in New York in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has the pandemic affected him personally? \u201cI know three or four people who have passed from my old neighbourhood in Queens. In New York City, Queens always becomes the worst place.\u201d Why does he think that so many of the 63,000-plus people who have died in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds</a>? \u201cI don\u2019t think coronavirus is discriminating based on income. Hehehe!\u201d He giggles. But if you don\u2019t have money to self-isolate and have to go out to work to pay the bills, surely it leaves you more exposed to catching Covid-19? Jackson is not having any of it. \u201cIn my experience, you can\u2019t force people to work.\u201d But, he says, he sure is glad people in the service sector are still working. \u201cIf those people stayed home, it would have been hell. There would be no deliveries, no orders. You would have had to have stocked up already in your home.\u201d I sense that Jackson would find it impossible to look at any situation without putting himself at the centre of it.</p> <p>How does he feel Trump has dealt with the crisis?</p> <p>A voice on the line interjects. It is Amanda, Jackson\u2019s personal publicist. \u201cWe really need to bring it back to the book,\u201d she says. But Jackson is happy to talk Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s an awkward situation. If you respond too fast, you\u2019re wrong, because everyone would be kicking and screaming and saying you shut everything down. But if you shut it down late, you\u2019re wrong. So you can\u2019t win in that situation.\u201d He has sympathy for Trump? \u201cPeople hate him or love him. There\u2019s no in-between. And for me, I\u2019m looking at it and going: \u2018That\u2019s the exact position I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another thing he has in common with the president is his obsession with money. Jackson attributes his values to Sabrina, who taught him to hustle. \u201cMy decisions were pre-made for me. My mom having me at 15 was why we got into this lifestyle.\u201d Selling drugs was more rewarding than any alternative for Sabrina. \u201cShe did well before she got stuck in that dangerous lifestyle,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After her death, he moved in with his grandparents. They had eight children of their own, no money to spare and laid down strict rules. He adored them, but they could provide none of the luxuries his mother had been able to. \u201cThe only people I saw coming round who had nice things were from my mom\u2019s life. They had Cadillacs, expensive jewellery, everything that symbolised financial freedom.\u201d When he started selling drugs, he told his grandparents he was at after-school club. He has remained wedded to his love of nice things ever since. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want nice things in your life, I don\u2019t even want to know you.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI. Don\u2019t. Want. To. Know. You,\u201d he repeats. Jackson can be staggeringly absolutist.</p> <p>Yet he can also be surprisingly sweet. He talks of his mother and grandmother with such tenderness. Have any other women been as important in his life? \u201cNo. My grandmother took care of me. My mom is why I\u2019m here, period. How do you compare any woman to your mother and your grandmother? How can another person be that important?\u201d Perhaps a partner, I say. He sounds shocked. \u201cFor some people, I guess it\u2019s that way. But, no, not me.\u201d</p> <p>One of the book\u2019s recurrent themes is how adversity has strengthened him. \u201cWhen there are the setbacks, there are gonna be the get-backs,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re just born super-rich and you\u2019ve just been rich your whole life, you don\u2019t understand the significance of it. It\u2019s just where you are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adeaaade9b38d7e59523d6a07084ce95c5b430d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adeaaade9b38d7e59523d6a07084ce95c5b430d8/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On stage in Los Angeles in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage in Los Angeles in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackson often says he may not be the best rapper or actor, but he is authentic, and that\u2019s what his fans bought into. He talks of his \u201cdamage\u201d \u2013 and how he turned it into an asset. \u201cIn hip-hop, people are looking for the damage. And you come in and they look at you, and they can see the damage. They can see the experience, the story, why you are where you are. You can offer something unique.\u201d</p> <p>He is also aware damage has a shelf life. \u201cIt works for a while, but then as you continue to be successful you don\u2019t have that same damage.\u201d As Jackson repeatedly reminds me, he has sold 30m albums, but subsequent albums sold less and less well. So he took up acting (his first film was a thinly veiled biopic named after the first album; he has now appeared in 25 movies) and moved into business (his stake in the Vitaminwater maker Glac\u00e9au, which was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1bn in 2007, is reported to have earned him between $60m and $100m). So many stars are complacent about their success, he says. \u201cPeople have expiration dates. You can\u2019t see it, but their time\u2019s up and they almost implode in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson can be unforgiving. In fact, he prides himself on it. In the book, he tears a strip off his son Marquise for his sense of entitlement. Does he hope their relationship will improve? No, it is too late. \u201cI\u2019ve already tried so long with him. That sense of entitlement is scariest when it\u2019s someone you love. He still manages to feel deprived when he\u2019s had everything. You love the person, he\u2019s your child, and he looks at you as if you\u2019re the enemy. And, after a while, you go: this is not a kid, it\u2019s a grown man we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>After Marquise was pictured with the son of one of the men who allegedly plotted to shoot his father, Jackson tweeted: \u201cIf both these little niggas got hit by a bus, I wouldn\u2019t have a bad day.\u201d Did he mean it or was he having a 50 Cent moment? For the first time, he sounds hesitant. \u201cThat\u2019s, yeah, um, that was a 50 Cent moment \u2026\u201d He says he is trying his best to make sure his younger son, Sire, grows up with more boundaries. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m an artist. Why am I limited to what you feel should be said?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jackson has never been scared of making an enemy. I tell him that one of my favourite bits in the book is the section on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey\">Oprah Winfrey</a>. He was desperate to be on her show \u2013 not least to show his grandmother, who was a huge Winfrey fan, that he had made it. Yet Winfrey made it clear how much she disapproved of him \u2013 particularly the gun violence and misogyny in his lyrics. (In Get in My Car, he raps: \u201cI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind / I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car.\u201d)</p> <p>When he talks now about how he was snubbed by her when he first found fame, the wound still seems fresh. \u201cShe was completely against everything that was in my music,\u201d he says. \u201cSo she ain\u2019t never going to have me on that show. I\u2019m never going to reach that platform, which is confirmation of you being a huge success. So I just said: OK, if we can\u2019t be friends, then at least let\u2019s be enemies.\u201d He started a feud, said her fans were white and elderly and named his female dog Oprah.</p> <p>Did they ever become friends? \u201cLater we did.\u201d And did he ever say: Oprah, you had a point \u2013 my lyrics are misogynistic? Silence. I ask the question again. \u201cWell, no. Did you hear what I said? They are misogynistic, but the world is not under the same circumstances. Are you going to tell a painter what to paint? I\u2019m an artist. Why am I limited to what <em>you</em> feel should be said? In film and television, they will show art imitates life. Are you not aware of those situations taking place?\u201d He is perfectly calm, his tone unchanged, but I seem to have hit a nerve.</p> <p>His defence of his lyrics is eloquent and impassioned. Was this what he said to Oprah? \u201cNo. She never asked me the question in the way you did. The truth is, all things come from your experience. Like, I got shot nine times and I wrote music about it. Everyone writes something that can connect in a big way based on a painful moment, so you\u2019re saying we\u2019re not supposed to articulate or write it the way we experienced?\u201d</p> <p>Has his view of the world changed since then? \u201cYes, absolutely. If you stay the same, you\u2019re not growing as a person.\u201d In the book, he touches on how his sexual politics have evolved. He writes that, on hearing that the vice-president, Mike Pence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/mike-pence-doesnt-eat-alone-women-speaks-volumes\">never ate alone with a woman who was not his wife</a>, he had thought this seemed sensible. It was only when a friend explained this could mean Pence saw women purely as a threat or object of desire that Jackson reconsidered.</p> <p>Perhaps the most unlikely event in Jackson\u2019s action-packed life came when he filed for bankruptcy in 2015. It is surprising it is not mentioned in a book about overcoming adversity. Ah, he says, this is where normal people don\u2019t understand the nature of bankruptcy, because they can\u2019t imagine dealing in such vast fortunes. Again, he sees a parallel with Trump, whose companies filed for bankruptcy multiple times. \u201cBusinesspeople will do that in a heartbeat before losing money. Because it means they have the ability to be secure and invest again.\u201d He says even the judges ruling on the bankruptcy can\u2019t comprehend such money. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a judge who makes $125,000 a year. Hahaha!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f631b50184b5109e2113c92fbef247dbc386ebeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f631b50184b5109e2113c92fbef247dbc386ebeb/30_16_2828_1697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Nicholas Pinnock in the US drama For Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Nicholas Pinnock in the US drama For Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giovanni Rufino/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bankruptcy allowed him to start afresh \u2013 most notably as executive producer (and actor) on the successful American TV crime drama series Power. Soon after filing for bankruptcy, he tells me, he signed a $150m deal with a TV network.</p> <p>He says he wants for nothing these days, but is still a sucker for affirmation. I ask him if he is surprised to still be alive at the age of 44. \u201cA lot of my friends growing up, they\u2019re not here. It\u2019s easier to not think about those things.\u201d He prefers to think of legacy than longevity.</p> <p>Amanda has been telling me it is the final question for the past 20 minutes. Jackson has been more generous with his time, but she tells me this really is the final question. I am thinking of legacy. If there were one thing he could campaign for, some way in which he could change the US, what would it be? \u201cTaxes,\u201d he says without missing a beat. \u201cI don\u2019t like them. They want too much of the money back. Hehehehe!\u201d</p> <p>We say goodbye, and Jackson is still giggling at the thought of fighting for his tax-free utopia.</p> <p><em>Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter by Curtis Jackson (Amistad, an imprint of HarperCollins) is out in the UK on 14 May</em><br></p>",

So getting that place was confirmation of success.\u201d But he got bored. \u201cYou may have 18 bedrooms, but you can only sleep on one bed. You have all that space, but you still can\u2019t walk around the house naked, \u2019cause you\u2019ve got staff. Going down the hall was like walking down the street.\u201d Jackson has just written a very readable book about how to do things his way. Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter is classic Fiddy \u2013 a self-help guide for aspiring bigwigs. By turns, he comes across as machiavellian (tips include pretending to drink on a night out with colleagues then exploiting the weaknesses they have drunkenly revealed), cynical (women just want him for his money), puritanical (he doesn\u2019t drink or take drugs), little-boy-lost (desperately seeking affirmation) and wise elder (telling readers of the need to constantly evolve to stay relevant). When he is not boasting, bullying or dissing, much of his advice is perfectly sensible \u2013 be true to yourself, don\u2019t make the same mistake twice and dress decently if you want to make an impression. I ask what he is wearing today. \u201cI don\u2019t even have all my clothes on yet.\u201d That\u2019s exciting, I say, tell me more. \u201cI\u2019m wearing an undershirt, like a white tank top, and black sweatpants.\u201d Hold on, I say: in your book, you suggest not looking your best for somebody shows a lack of respect. I know we are only talking on the phone, but \u2026 \u201cYeah, \u2019cause I\u2019m in quarantine in the house and that doesn\u2019t apply to quarantine.\u201d He laughs. Has the pandemic affected him personally? \u201cI know three or four people who have passed from my old neighbourhood in Queens. In New York City, Queens always becomes the worst place.\u201d Why does he think that so many of the 63,000-plus people who have died in the US are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds? \u201cI don\u2019t think coronavirus is discriminating based on income. Hehehe!\u201d He giggles. But if you don\u2019t have money to self-isolate and have to go out to work to pay the bills, surely it leaves you more exposed to catching Covid-19? Jackson is not having any of it. \u201cIn my experience, you can\u2019t force people to work.\u201d But, he says, he sure is glad people in the service sector are still working. \u201cIf those people stayed home, it would have been hell. There would be no deliveries, no orders. You would have had to have stocked up already in your home.\u201d I sense that Jackson would find it impossible to look at any situation without putting himself at the centre of it. How does he feel Trump has dealt with the crisis? A voice on the line interjects. It is Amanda, Jackson\u2019s personal publicist. \u201cWe really need to bring it back to the book,\u201d she says. But Jackson is happy to talk Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s an awkward situation. If you respond too fast, you\u2019re wrong, because everyone would be kicking and screaming and saying you shut everything down. But if you shut it down late, you\u2019re wrong. So you can\u2019t win in that situation.\u201d He has sympathy for Trump? \u201cPeople hate him or love him. There\u2019s no in-between. And for me, I\u2019m looking at it and going: \u2018That\u2019s the exact position I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d Another thing he has in common with the president is his obsession with money. Jackson attributes his values to Sabrina, who taught him to hustle. \u201cMy decisions were pre-made for me. My mom having me at 15 was why we got into this lifestyle.\u201d Selling drugs was more rewarding than any alternative for Sabrina. \u201cShe did well before she got stuck in that dangerous lifestyle,\u201d he says. After her death, he moved in with his grandparents. They had eight children of their own, no money to spare and laid down strict rules. He adored them, but they could provide none of the luxuries his mother had been able to. \u201cThe only people I saw coming round who had nice things were from my mom\u2019s life. They had Cadillacs, expensive jewellery, everything that symbolised financial freedom.\u201d When he started selling drugs, he told his grandparents he was at after-school club. He has remained wedded to his love of nice things ever since. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want nice things in your life, I don\u2019t even want to know you.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI. Don\u2019t. Want. To. Know. You,\u201d he repeats. Jackson can be staggeringly absolutist. Yet he can also be surprisingly sweet. He talks of his mother and grandmother with such tenderness. Have any other women been as important in his life? \u201cNo. My grandmother took care of me. My mom is why I\u2019m here, period. How do you compare any woman to your mother and your grandmother? How can another person be that important?\u201d Perhaps a partner, I say. He sounds shocked. \u201cFor some people, I guess it\u2019s that way. But, no, not me.\u201d One of the book\u2019s recurrent themes is how adversity has strengthened him. \u201cWhen there are the setbacks, there are gonna be the get-backs,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re just born super-rich and you\u2019ve just been rich your whole life, you don\u2019t understand the significance of it. It\u2019s just where you are.\u201d Jackson often says he may not be the best rapper or actor, but he is authentic, and that\u2019s what his fans bought into. He talks of his \u201cdamage\u201d \u2013 and how he turned it into an asset. \u201cIn hip-hop, people are looking for the damage. And you come in and they look at you, and they can see the damage. They can see the experience, the story, why you are where you are. You can offer something unique.\u201d He is also aware damage has a shelf life. \u201cIt works for a while, but then as you continue to be successful you don\u2019t have that same damage.\u201d As Jackson repeatedly reminds me, he has sold 30m albums, but subsequent albums sold less and less well. So he took up acting (his first film was a thinly veiled biopic named after the first album; he has now appeared in 25 movies) and moved into business (his stake in the Vitaminwater maker Glac\u00e9au, which was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1bn in 2007, is reported to have earned him between $60m and $100m). So many stars are complacent about their success, he says. \u201cPeople have expiration dates. You can\u2019t see it, but their time\u2019s up and they almost implode in front of you.\u201d Jackson can be unforgiving. In fact, he prides himself on it. In the book, he tears a strip off his son Marquise for his sense of entitlement. Does he hope their relationship will improve? No, it is too late. \u201cI\u2019ve already tried so long with him. That sense of entitlement is scariest when it\u2019s someone you love. He still manages to feel deprived when he\u2019s had everything. You love the person, he\u2019s your child, and he looks at you as if you\u2019re the enemy. And, after a while, you go: this is not a kid, it\u2019s a grown man we\u2019re talking about.\u201d After Marquise was pictured with the son of one of the men who allegedly plotted to shoot his father, Jackson tweeted: \u201cIf both these little niggas got hit by a bus, I wouldn\u2019t have a bad day.\u201d Did he mean it or was he having a 50 Cent moment? For the first time, he sounds hesitant. \u201cThat\u2019s, yeah, um, that was a 50 Cent moment \u2026\u201d He says he is trying his best to make sure his younger son, Sire, grows up with more boundaries. Jackson has never been scared of making an enemy. I tell him that one of my favourite bits in the book is the section on Oprah Winfrey. He was desperate to be on her show \u2013 not least to show his grandmother, who was a huge Winfrey fan, that he had made it. Yet Winfrey made it clear how much she disapproved of him \u2013 particularly the gun violence and misogyny in his lyrics. (In Get in My Car, he raps: \u201cI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind / I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car.\u201d) When he talks now about how he was snubbed by her when he first found fame, the wound still seems fresh. \u201cShe was completely against everything that was in my music,\u201d he says. \u201cSo she ain\u2019t never going to have me on that show. I\u2019m never going to reach that platform, which is confirmation of you being a huge success. So I just said: OK, if we can\u2019t be friends, then at least let\u2019s be enemies.\u201d He started a feud, said her fans were white and elderly and named his female dog Oprah. Did they ever become friends? \u201cLater we did.\u201d And did he ever say: Oprah, you had a point \u2013 my lyrics are misogynistic? Silence. I ask the question again. \u201cWell, no. Did you hear what I said? They are misogynistic, but the world is not under the same circumstances. Are you going to tell a painter what to paint? I\u2019m an artist. Why am I limited to what you feel should be said? In film and television, they will show art imitates life. Are you not aware of those situations taking place?\u201d He is perfectly calm, his tone unchanged, but I seem to have hit a nerve. His defence of his lyrics is eloquent and impassioned. Was this what he said to Oprah? \u201cNo. She never asked me the question in the way you did. The truth is, all things come from your experience. Like, I got shot nine times and I wrote music about it. Everyone writes something that can connect in a big way based on a painful moment, so you\u2019re saying we\u2019re not supposed to articulate or write it the way we experienced?\u201d Has his view of the world changed since then? \u201cYes, absolutely. If you stay the same, you\u2019re not growing as a person.\u201d In the book, he touches on how his sexual politics have evolved. He writes that, on hearing that the vice-president, Mike Pence, never ate alone with a woman who was not his wife, he had thought this seemed sensible. It was only when a friend explained this could mean Pence saw women purely as a threat or object of desire that Jackson reconsidered. Perhaps the most unlikely event in Jackson\u2019s action-packed life came when he filed for bankruptcy in 2015. It is surprising it is not mentioned in a book about overcoming adversity. Ah, he says, this is where normal people don\u2019t understand the nature of bankruptcy, because they can\u2019t imagine dealing in such vast fortunes. Again, he sees a parallel with Trump, whose companies filed for bankruptcy multiple times. \u201cBusinesspeople will do that in a heartbeat before losing money. Because it means they have the ability to be secure and invest again.\u201d He says even the judges ruling on the bankruptcy can\u2019t comprehend such money. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a judge who makes $125,000 a year. Hahaha!\u201d Bankruptcy allowed him to start afresh \u2013 most notably as executive producer (and actor) on the successful American TV crime drama series Power. Soon after filing for bankruptcy, he tells me, he signed a $150m deal with a TV network. He says he wants for nothing these days, but is still a sucker for affirmation. I ask him if he is surprised to still be alive at the age of 44. \u201cA lot of my friends growing up, they\u2019re not here. It\u2019s easier to not think about those things.\u201d He prefers to think of legacy than longevity. Amanda has been telling me it is the final question for the past 20 minutes. Jackson has been more generous with his time, but she tells me this really is the final question. I am thinking of legacy. If there were one thing he could campaign for, some way in which he could change the US, what would it be? \u201cTaxes,\u201d he says without missing a beat. \u201cI don\u2019t like them. They want too much of the money back. Hehehehe!\u201d We say goodbye, and Jackson is still giggling at the thought of fighting for his tax-free utopia.

      "body": "<p>More than a million renters in Britain risk losing their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected by an immediate rent freeze, according to a thinktank.</p> \n<p>Calling on the government to suspend all private rents for three months as an emergency measure to protect those most at risk, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said 1.2 million people living in privately rented homes could fall into severe financial hardship otherwise.</p> \n<p>These people are among 5.6 million it identified who will miss out from the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme, due to having their hours cut or being made redundant rather than being furloughed. It also includes people ineligible for the self-employed income protection scheme.</p> \n<p>More than a month into lockdown job losses are mounting across Britain as the country slides into the deepest recession for at least a century. While ministers have launched an unprecedented package of financial aid to cushion the blow, including these wage subsidies, millions still risk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/millions-uk-slip-through-coronavirus-pay-wage-safety-net-self-employed-wage-subsidy\">slipping through gaps in the safety net</a>.</p> \n<p>Urging the government to take further steps to support those facing financial hardship as the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbates existing inequalities between homeowners and renters, NEF said renters who lost their jobs would need to rely on universal credit benefits.</p> \n<p>However, it warned that a single, full-time minimum wage worker on universal credit could face a 45% reduction in their income. For those living in London, this would leave just \u00a355 a week (\u00a3238 a month) to pay for all essentials outside rent, such as food and utility bills. It said average bills in Britain, before food costs, are estimated to be around \u00a3237 a month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cfdf0e57-592b-4f76-ad35-f210d0c08493\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H3d6rAA8hCA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Private renters were already financially vulnerable prior to the pandemic, with a third of disposable income on average spent on rent, compared with 17% of income spent by homeowners on mortgage costs. According to government figures, <a href=\"file:///Users/richardpartington/Downloads/SN07096.pdf\">more than a third of private renters</a> live in relative poverty.</p> \n<p>Renters\u2019 unions have called on the government to suspend rents for the duration of the coronavirus crisis, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/millions-having-to-choose-between-paying-landlord-or-eating-research-suggests-coronavirus\">research carried out for the Guardian by Opinium</a> revealed millions are having to choose between paying landlords or putting food on the table.</p> \n<p>Around 6.2 million adults are in work and live in privately rented accommodation across the UK. Although most stand to benefit from the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme or support package for the self-employed, the foundation found that 1.2 million would slip through the safety net.</p> \n<p>However, the leftwing thinktank said even furloughed private renters could struggle.

      "bodyText": "More than a million renters in Britain risk losing their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected by an immediate rent freeze, according to a thinktank. Calling on the government to suspend all private rents for three months as an emergency measure to protect those most at risk, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said 1.2 million people living in privately rented homes could fall into severe financial hardship otherwise. These people are among 5.6 million it identified who will miss out from the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme, due to having their hours cut or being made redundant rather than being furloughed. It also includes people ineligible for the self-employed income protection scheme. More than a month into lockdown job losses are mounting across Britain as the country slides into the deepest recession for at least a century. While ministers have launched an unprecedented package of financial aid to cushion the blow, including these wage subsidies, millions still risk slipping through gaps in the safety net. Urging the government to take further steps to support those facing financial hardship as the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbates existing inequalities between homeowners and renters, NEF said renters who lost their jobs would need to rely on universal credit benefits. However, it warned that a single, full-time minimum wage worker on universal credit could face a 45% reduction in their income. For those living in London, this would leave just \u00a355 a week (\u00a3238 a month) to pay for all essentials outside rent, such as food and utility bills. It said average bills in Britain, before food costs, are estimated to be around \u00a3237 a month. Private renters were already financially vulnerable prior to the pandemic, with a third of disposable income on average spent on rent, compared with 17% of income spent by homeowners on mortgage costs. According to government figures, more than a third of private renters live in relative poverty. Renters\u2019 unions have called on the government to suspend rents for the duration of the coronavirus crisis, after research carried out for the Guardian by Opinium revealed millions are having to choose between paying landlords or putting food on the table. Around 6.2 million adults are in work and live in privately rented accommodation across the UK. Although most stand to benefit from the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme or support package for the self-employed, the foundation found that 1.2 million would slip through the safety net. However, the leftwing thinktank said even furloughed private renters could struggle. According to the report, a worker on median wages would see their disposable income drop by 16% on average, leaving less than half their salary remaining to meet all other costs of living. Ministers have announced some measures to protect private renters during the Covid-19 outbreak, including a temporary ban on evictions. Housing benefit has been increased marginally and landlords have been asked to show compassion by agreeing affordable repayment plans. However, the report warned that limited action had been taken on rents, which are still legally owed, meaning millions could still face severe financial hardship. Alongside an immediate suspension on rents, NEF said that payment of residential mortgages should also be frozen to protect landlords from a gaping hole in rent income. To prevent a further knock-on impact for high street banks and other major mortgage lenders, it said the Bank of England could be used to provide low-cost loans. Joe Beswick, head of housing and land at the foundation, said: \u201cIf we are to avoid an eviction crisis from rent arrears following the public health crisis, we must suspend the obligation to pay rent immediately. \u201cMany of those in the private rented sector, a group who were already economically vulnerable before this crisis, are falling through the cracks of the government\u2019s support systems.\u201d",

Australian prime ministers have attended New Zealand\u2019s cabinet meetings before, but Ardern said her attendance at Tuesday\u2019s meeting was \u201cwithout precedent\u201d. \u201cIt highlights what\u2019s happened with cooperation at the state level and the mutual importance of both countries\u2019 economies to each other,\u201d she said. Australian officials said Tuesday\u2019s meeting would also consider the CovidSafe tracing app. Ardern said on Monday New Zealand had already been in touch with officials in Singapore, the originators of the contact-tracing app that Australia has largely replicated. She said New Zealand was interested in pursuing technological solutions to managing the pandemic, but wasn\u2019t relying on them, because there were \u201cno silver bullets\u201d. Ardern said in late April community transmission had ceased in New Zealand. But she said isolated cases would continue to pop up and would continue \u201cbeing stamped out\u201d until a vaccine was found. Morrison and the state premiers will meet twice this week to consider easing some of the restrictions imposed in Australia to flatten the curve of infections, with announcements expected on Friday. Morrison has been keen to project that Australia is now on a path to easing some of the restrictions, and has also pressed for school students to return to classroom learning. The states have hastened slowly on reopening schools, with Victoria refusing to switch course until the state has conducted mass testing over the next week. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, launched a swingeing political attack on the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, on Sunday, accusing him of taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education. Tehan withdrew his comments a couple of hours later after Victoria queried whether he had overstepped the mark, and announced it would close a school campus because a teacher had returned a positive test for Covid-19. The federal education minister later blamed the outburst on \u201cfrustration\u201d. The closure of schools has been a persistent source of tension between the jurisdictions, but Andrews told reporters in Melbourne on Monday the national cabinet continued to work well, was taking the advice of \u201cexperts\u201d and would not let \u201cpersonal frustrations\u201d get in the way of good decision-making. \u201cComments were made yesterday morning, a statement was issued, that was the end of the matter as far as I was concerned ... while they were out doing that, I tell you what we were doing \u2013 testing 13,000 people,\u201d Andrews said Monday morning. He told reporters he had not heard from Tehan, but was \u201cnot particularly worried\u201d about him either. Andrews also confirmed there was a new cluster of Covid-19 infections at a meat processing facility in Victoria.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Staying at home inflates energy bills Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray disseminating Monday\u2019s news by various electronic means. More than a million renters in Britain risk losing their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected from severe financial hardship by an immediate rent freeze, the New Economic Foundation thinktank is arguing. It identified the tenants as among 5.6 million who will miss out on the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme, due to having their hours cut, being made redundant rather than furloughed, or being ineligible for self-employed income protection. British households\u2019 energy bills are set to rise by a third \u2013 \u00a332 per month on average \u2013 because of people staying in lockdown and working from home. Usage of home appliances has soared, according to research from comparethemarket.com. Donald Trump has told Fox News he feels confident there will be a vaccine by the end of the year. His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has, meanwhile, made confusing and muddled comments in which he said there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the virus came from a Chinese laboratory. \u201cLook, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade,\u201d he said. But when reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the scientific consensus \u2013 that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified \u2013 Pompeo replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u201d The governments of Australia and New Zealand are in the early stages of considering allowing unquarantined travel between the two countries as they continue a staged relaxation of social distancing. New Zealand has recorded its first day without recording a new case since before it entered lockdown. In Britain the death toll has risen to 28,446, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. This puts the UK just behind Italy on 28,884 and the US, which has reported 67,680 deaths. Stay close to our live blog for developments. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Pair on murder charge \u2013 Two teenagers have been charged with the murder of David Gomoh, 24, the NHS worker killed outside his home in east London a few days before he was due to attend the funeral of his father. Muhammad Jalloh, 18, from Stratford, in Newham, and a 16-year-old boy, from Telford, in Shropshire, were both charged with murder on Sunday. They were also charged with conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm in connection with an alleged incident against a different person shortly before Gomoh was found stabbed on 26 April. Both will appear at Thames magistrates court on Monday. * * * Limited help for universities \u2013 The government has refused a long-term government bailout of universities in England, though \u00a32.6bn in tuition fees will be paid early and ministers have pledged to allow full fees to be charged as long as high standards of online teaching are maintained during coronavirus restrictions. University leaders had asked the government for billions of pounds to make up for lost international student and research revenue. * * * Shots over the DMZ \u2013 North and South Korea briefly exchanged gunfire across the demilitarised zone on Sunday, officials from the South have said. South Korea\u2019s military confirmed it found four bullets lodged in the outer wall of a guard post and that its forces fired 10 warning shots towards North Korea, as well as broadcasting a warning about breaching the two countries\u2019 2018 agreement to cease hostile activities at the DMZ. Speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, a South Korean military official said the shots did not seem to have been intentional and were fired in thick fog, possibly during a weapons check on the North\u2019s side. The exchange came a day after North Korea broadcast images of Kim Jong-un in public after a 20-day absence amid intense speculation about his health. * * * Not just old hat \u2013 A battered bowler hat from the James Bond film Goldfinger has been valued at up to \u00a330,000 on the TV show Antiques Roadshow. The steel-rimmed hat and weapon belonged to hitman Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata, in the 1964 film. The owner said he was a big 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law, a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia. The studio gave him Oddjob\u2019s bowler hat \u2013 but removed the metal rim. Coronavirus Extra From Colonel Tom Moore knitted dolls, VE Day bunting and amigurumi knitting projects to \u201cscrub\u201d bags and face mask adapters, Britain is in the thrall of a crafting revolution, the likes of which has not been seen since the second world war, writes Zoe Wood. In Australia, global ground zero of toilet-roll panic buying, attention is turning to a rethinking of public lavatories \u2013 from sensor taps and handle-free doors to completely self-sanitising cubicles \u2013 to minimise the spreading of germs. Jeffrey Frankel of Project Syndicate warns of the \u201cdevastating scenario\u201d of a W-shaped recession-recovery economic cycle, and explains two mistakes that could bring it about: declaring victory over Covid-19 too quickly and abandoning fiscal stimulus too soon. Today in Focus podcast: Global race for face masks The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask. Samanth Subramanian explores the newly distorted marketplace for masks and what some will do to get them. Lunchtime read: 50 Cent on \u2018setbacks and getbacks\u2019 Curtis Jackson was shot nine times before becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest rappers. He discusses growing up, getting rich and the art of the hustle.

The former England cricket captain Charlotte Edwards has voiced her fears about the potential impact on the women\u2019s game of the postponement of the Hundred.

      "body": "<p>Everyone can see it now. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a> has worn away the thin veneer of prosperity that covered the rusty and battered British state \u2013 revealing that, whatever exceptional wealth exists in our society, it is useless in a crisis. What is the point of wealth if a country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/nearly-half-of-british-doctors-forced-to-find-their-own-ppe-new-data-shows\">cannot provide protective equipment</a> for its own doctors and nurses?</p> <p>The virus itself is only the official cause of what is on course to be the highest death toll in Europe: there are other underlying conditions, including the incompetence of this government and the self-destructive austerity imposed by its predecessors. But even if the government had locked down sooner, many never stood a chance. The poor, the underpaid and the disempowered have neither the labour rights nor the ability to protect themselves from the virus by self-isolating or defying employers who have not extended sufficient protection. The disparities are already coming into focus. People in deprived areas are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\">dying at twice the rate </a> of those in affluent ones. Black and ethnic minority people, who are more likely to be employed in high-risk key worker roles, are dying at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">higher rates</a> than the overall population. Many of these deaths have been the result of brutal structural inequality.</p> <p>This fatal systemic imbalance in our society can be seen most starkly by examining the deaths of care and health workers. Consider the case of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/20/health-workers-killed-virus-line-duty/\">Abdul Gellaledin</a>, an ambulance care assistant in Kingston, south-west London. His job was to take patients from their homes, and care and nursing homes, to hospital and back. His family told me that he had been worried since the start of the pandemic: many of the patients he and his colleagues were transporting lived in care homes where the virus was spreading, and his requests for any form of protective gear had been refused by his employers.</p> <p>One day in March, he was sent with one colleague to pick up a patient from hospital. They found the patient unaccompanied in a wheelchair, and coughing. When they raised concerns, they were told by a nurse she had tested negative for Covid-19. They took her home, only to realise that she needed to be carried upstairs as she had no carer at the time; Gellaledin tried to avert his face while the patient coughed. They were not told that any physical assistance would be required, and were consequently unprepared; they were also not told that another ambulance crew had already declined the assignment on the grounds it was not safe. The patient later tested positive.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\"> On 9 April</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">Gellaledin died of coronavirus</a>. He was 53.</p> <p>Gellaledin\u2019s death is the result of a number of converging trends that have been growing for decades, and which have disproportionately claimed the lives of those at the sharp end of society\u2019s inequalities. The ambulance he staffed was outsourced to a private company to help an underfunded NHS ambulance service \u2013 an arrangement that persists even after <a href=\"https://www.nhsforsale.info/transport-services/ambulance-services/\">other private companies have been stripped of their contracts for poor performance after undercutting competitors on pricing</a>.

      "bodyText": "Everyone can see it now. The coronavirus pandemic has worn away the thin veneer of prosperity that covered the rusty and battered British state \u2013 revealing that, whatever exceptional wealth exists in our society, it is useless in a crisis. What is the point of wealth if a country cannot provide protective equipment for its own doctors and nurses? The virus itself is only the official cause of what is on course to be the highest death toll in Europe: there are other underlying conditions, including the incompetence of this government and the self-destructive austerity imposed by its predecessors. But even if the government had locked down sooner, many never stood a chance. The poor, the underpaid and the disempowered have neither the labour rights nor the ability to protect themselves from the virus by self-isolating or defying employers who have not extended sufficient protection. The disparities are already coming into focus. People in deprived areas are dying at twice the rate of those in affluent ones. Black and ethnic minority people, who are more likely to be employed in high-risk key worker roles, are dying at higher rates than the overall population. Many of these deaths have been the result of brutal structural inequality. This fatal systemic imbalance in our society can be seen most starkly by examining the deaths of care and health workers. Consider the case of Abdul Gellaledin, an ambulance care assistant in Kingston, south-west London. His job was to take patients from their homes, and care and nursing homes, to hospital and back. His family told me that he had been worried since the start of the pandemic: many of the patients he and his colleagues were transporting lived in care homes where the virus was spreading, and his requests for any form of protective gear had been refused by his employers. One day in March, he was sent with one colleague to pick up a patient from hospital. They found the patient unaccompanied in a wheelchair, and coughing. When they raised concerns, they were told by a nurse she had tested negative for Covid-19. They took her home, only to realise that she needed to be carried upstairs as she had no carer at the time; Gellaledin tried to avert his face while the patient coughed. They were not told that any physical assistance would be required, and were consequently unprepared; they were also not told that another ambulance crew had already declined the assignment on the grounds it was not safe. The patient later tested positive. On 9 April, Gellaledin died of coronavirus. He was 53. Gellaledin\u2019s death is the result of a number of converging trends that have been growing for decades, and which have disproportionately claimed the lives of those at the sharp end of society\u2019s inequalities. The ambulance he staffed was outsourced to a private company to help an underfunded NHS ambulance service \u2013 an arrangement that persists even after other private companies have been stripped of their contracts for poor performance after undercutting competitors on pricing. This race to the bottom meant that, when Gellaledin asked for personal protective equipment (PPE), he was not even given gloves, says his family. His employer, Falck UK Ambulance Services, is the British arm of the Danish group Falck. According to the company\u2019s 2018 annual report, profitability had improved in its ambulance business unit as a result of \u201cefficiency and cost-optimisation initiatives and an improved contract portfolio\u201d. The CEO of Falck UK, Mark Raisbeck, maintains that: \u201cAll of our crews, including Abdul, have at all times been issued with PPE in full compliance with Public Health England guidelines.\u201d He adds that it is \u201ccurrently undertaking a full investigation in partnership with our NHS colleagues\u201d.

There was no mention of Gellaledin\u2019s cause of death at the end of 11 days in a medically induced coma. There comes a point when we must stop and appraise what it means to be a civilised country, what it means to be a wealthy one. That point is when a man who is carrying the aged, the sick and the vulnerable has to keep showing up to work despite worrying that he is not receiving basic protection in a pandemic.

The economic prosperity we have in the UK has been accumulated through years of aggressive liberalisation and privatisation, sacrificing the health, safety, dignity and lives of others. To Britain\u2019s vulnerable precariat, this has been apparent for a long time. To them, the crisis was always here.

Higher death rates due to lungs and hearts weakened by dirty air is the best understood. Pollutants also inflame lungs, potentially making catching the virus more likely and raising concern about rising pollution levels after lockdowns are lifted. Finally, particles of pollution might even help carry the virus further afield.</p> \n<p>The studies done so far around the world are mostly \u201cpre-prints\u201d \u2013 they have not yet been endorsed by independent scientists through the peer-review process. This involves several experts examining the work and requiring any flaws to be addressed but approval usually takes six months to two years.</p> \n<p>Researchers caution that plausibility is far from proof, and correlation does not necessarily mean causation, as many other factors may be important. But these initial findings do raise cause for concern \u2013 and may play a crucial role in helping us understand and combat the spread of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>One US study, by a well-respected group at Harvard University, found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds\">air pollution is linked to far higher Covid-19 death rates</a> across the nation.

      "bodyText": "In many respects, it makes perfect sense. Patients with severe Covid-19 are twice as likely to have had pre-existing respiratory diseases and three times as likely to have had cardiovascular problems. And decades of gold standard research have shown air pollution damages hearts and lungs. So is dirty air, which already kills at least 7 million people a year, turbo-charging the coronavirus pandemic? The overlap of highly polluted places, such as northern Italy, and pandemic hotspots is stark and preliminary studies point in this direction, while a link between the 2003 Sars outbreak and dirty air is already known. Confirming the impact of air pollution on the severity of Covid-19 could make a real difference by showing the response should be boosted in places with poor air quality. But doing the scientific studies required in the midst of a global pandemic and with imperfect data is difficult. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the evidence linking directly to mortality yet, but we know if you are exposed to air pollution you are increasing your chances of being more severely affected,\u201d said Dr Mar\u00eda Neira, director of public health at the World Health Organization (WHO). \u201cWe are starting to give messages to countries and regions saying, if you are starting to have cases, in those cities where you have a high level of pollution, reinforce your level of preparedness, because you might have a higher mortality.\u201d The principal risk of catching Covid-19 is contact with an infected person, and the quality of healthcare is vital in determining the outcome. But air pollution may be important in three ways, studies show. Higher death rates due to lungs and hearts weakened by dirty air is the best understood. Pollutants also inflame lungs, potentially making catching the virus more likely and raising concern about rising pollution levels after lockdowns are lifted. Finally, particles of pollution might even help carry the virus further afield. The studies done so far around the world are mostly \u201cpre-prints\u201d \u2013 they have not yet been endorsed by independent scientists through the peer-review process. This involves several experts examining the work and requiring any flaws to be addressed but approval usually takes six months to two years. Researchers caution that plausibility is far from proof, and correlation does not necessarily mean causation, as many other factors may be important. But these initial findings do raise cause for concern \u2013 and may play a crucial role in helping us understand and combat the spread of the pandemic. One US study, by a well-respected group at Harvard University, found that air pollution is linked to far higher Covid-19 death rates across the nation. Another, analysing European data, concluded that high levels of pollution may be \u201cone of the most important contributors\u201d to coronavirus deaths, while a third hinted at the link in England. In Italy, coronavirus was detected in air pollution samples by scientists investigating if this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected, though it remains unknown if the virus remains viable on pollution particles. New work, unreported until now, has revealed strong links in China, where the pandemic began, including a study of 324 cities, which took into account other factors such as travel patterns, weather, age, poverty and smoking. It found that places with modestly higher levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution (10 micrograms per cubic metre) in the five years before the pandemic had 22% more Covid-19 cases, while higher levels of small particle pollution saw a 15% rise. Another Chinese analysis of 120 cities now published in a journal also found a significant link, as do pre-prints linking air pollution to Covid-19 cases, death rates and the spread of disease. Elsewhere, in London, researchers identified a correlation between death rates and air pollution in different city boroughs, though confounding factors were not assessed. Given the massive annual death toll from air pollution, researchers have also been investigating if the temporary drop in air pollution during lockdowns might have saved lives. In China, scientists said a 25% drop in city air pollution during the lockdown might have prevented between 24,000 and 36,000 early deaths over a month. Another pre-print analysis concluded that city lockdowns \u201cbrought health benefits which outnumbered the confirmed deaths due to Covid-19 in China\u201d. An assessment of the first two weeks of lockdown in 27 countries estimated that 7,400 premature deaths had been avoided, mostly in China and India. In Europe, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) calculated there had been 11,000 avoided deaths from air pollution, including 1,700 in the UK, in the month up to 24 April. Lauri Myllyvirta, at CREA, said: \u201cAir pollution levels are plummeting as an unintended result of measures against the virus; this should not be seen as a \u2018silver lining\u2019.

      "body": "<p>Tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition.</p> \n<p>Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate \u2013 sometimes known as an immunity passport \u2013 proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased.</p> \n<p>The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people\u2019s identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood.</p> \n<p>Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests \u2013 proving whether someone has had the virus \u2013 or antigen tests, which show current infections.</p> \n<p>Digital identity experts say they are in the \u201cdiscovery stage\u201d of what could be tailored for the UK government, but developing a type of health certificate through app technology is gaining traction.</p> \n<p>The government is understood to be moving away from the phrase \u201cimmunity passport\u201d as evidence continues to emerge on exactly how immunity develops after someone has had Covid-19. The World Health Organization has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">issued a stark warning</a> over attempts to give people false assurance through a passport scheme.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Boris Johnson will call on countries to come together in a \u201ctruly global effort\u201d to defeat the coronavirus as he co-hosts a virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, and confirms the UK\u2019s promise of \u00a3388m funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments.<br><br>It comes ahead of the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">outlining a \u201croadmap\u201d out of lockdown</a>, including the need to tackle workers\u2019 fears of being in close proximity to others.</p> \n<p>Over the weekend, two firms made breakthroughs on developing antibody tests. The Swiss drugmaker Roche received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a test they have developed, while Quotient, in Edinburgh, says its screening machines have capacity for up to 36,000 antibody tests a day and produce results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy.</p> \n<p>These are lab-based tests, however, relying on blood to be taken by a medical professional and requiring large machines for analysis, taking time.</p> \n<p>The holy grail in antibody testing is a home pregnancy test-style kit that would provide almost instant results. So far none on the market, including 17.5m ordered by the government, have been demonstrated as sufficiently accurate. Typically these tests produce false negatives about half to 70% of the time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902YuSUZ1xW2uoR/\" data-alt=\"How the health passport works\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902YuSUZ1xW2uoR/\">How the health passport works</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Onfido, which is in talks with ministers, was founded by three former Oxford University students in 2012 and has worked with Monzo and Zipcar. It says it has the ability to roll out a system within months and could be the \u201clinchpin of the new normality\u201d and stimulating the economy.</p> \n<p>Their solution would embed Onfido technology within another organisation\u2019s app to establish someone\u2019s identity. The person would be asked to take a selfie and an image of their government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver\u2019s licence. The technology can determine whether the person\u2019s face matches their ID, and also if the ID is genuine. This creates a digital identity.</p> \n<p>They are then tested for coronavirus under a system endorsed by the government and the result is stored by another provider \u2013 in the UK this would most likely be the NHS. </p> \n<p>When the person goes to their workplace, they open the app, take a photo of their face and that unlocks a QR code.

      "bodyText": "Tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition. Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate \u2013 sometimes known as an immunity passport \u2013 proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased. The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people\u2019s identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood. Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests \u2013 proving whether someone has had the virus \u2013 or antigen tests, which show current infections. Digital identity experts say they are in the \u201cdiscovery stage\u201d of what could be tailored for the UK government, but developing a type of health certificate through app technology is gaining traction. The government is understood to be moving away from the phrase \u201cimmunity passport\u201d as evidence continues to emerge on exactly how immunity develops after someone has had Covid-19. The World Health Organization has also issued a stark warning over attempts to give people false assurance through a passport scheme. On Monday, Boris Johnson will call on countries to come together in a \u201ctruly global effort\u201d to defeat the coronavirus as he co-hosts a virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, and confirms the UK\u2019s promise of \u00a3388m funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments. It comes ahead of the prime minister outlining a \u201croadmap\u201d out of lockdown, including the need to tackle workers\u2019 fears of being in close proximity to others. Over the weekend, two firms made breakthroughs on developing antibody tests. The Swiss drugmaker Roche received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a test they have developed, while Quotient, in Edinburgh, says its screening machines have capacity for up to 36,000 antibody tests a day and produce results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy. These are lab-based tests, however, relying on blood to be taken by a medical professional and requiring large machines for analysis, taking time. The holy grail in antibody testing is a home pregnancy test-style kit that would provide almost instant results. So far none on the market, including 17.5m ordered by the government, have been demonstrated as sufficiently accurate. Typically these tests produce false negatives about half to 70% of the time. Onfido, which is in talks with ministers, was founded by three former Oxford University students in 2012 and has worked with Monzo and Zipcar. It says it has the ability to roll out a system within months and could be the \u201clinchpin of the new normality\u201d and stimulating the economy. Their solution would embed Onfido technology within another organisation\u2019s app to establish someone\u2019s identity. The person would be asked to take a selfie and an image of their government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver\u2019s licence. The technology can determine whether the person\u2019s face matches their ID, and also if the ID is genuine. This creates a digital identity. They are then tested for coronavirus under a system endorsed by the government and the result is stored by another provider \u2013 in the UK this would most likely be the NHS. When the person goes to their workplace, they open the app, take a photo of their face and that unlocks a QR code. That QR code would be scanned by reception using simple camera technology and on their system they would see the test result and a photo of the employee\u2019s face for a short time, allowing them to visually determine the identity of the person in front of them. The only technology a business would need to make this work would be a camera to take an image of the QR code as they arrive. No information about someone\u2019s name, date of birth, address would be visible to the person on reception, only that they are fit to go into work. There are remaining questions about the extent to which the presence of antibodies in the blood ensures immunity. Early reports of apparent Covid-19 reinfections in South Korea now appear to have been explained by a combination of false negative results and because the body\u2019s healing response can lead to infected cells from the lungs being expelled weeks after initial infection, causing people to test positive even though they are recovering. However, many experts still think it likely that immunity will wane over a period of months or years, potentially leaving people vulnerable \u2013 and some people could acquire more robust immunity than others. A government source said a form of certification system is \u201cstill on the table and being considered\u201d and that conversations around this concept fall under the government\u2019s \u201ctrack and trace\u201d plans.",

      "body": "<p>A global alliance of world leaders is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (\u00a36.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them.</p> \n<p>National prestige and huge profits are potentially at stake for the countries and firms that win the race for a vaccine that can take the world\u2019s economies out of lockdown, but there is a risk of uncoordinated duplication of research efforts slowing the process and adding to the cost.</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s fundraising summit comes after the concept was launched at a previous meeting on 24 April. Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization.</p> \n<p>The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit. But optimism that the US might relent and join the initiative had waned by Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Melinda Gates, a critic of the absence of US leadership on global health, has warned: \u201cIf there is Covid anywhere, there is Covid everywhere. If vaccinations are not distributed everywhere, relapses can occur everywhere\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK strongly supports the project and attended the 24 April event. Its prime minister Boris Johnson will tell the conference: \u201cThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus - we are in this together, and together we will prevail.\u201d</p> \n<p>The initiative is designed to broaden the work of an existing organisation, set up in 2017 in the wake of the Ebola outbreak, known as the Global Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations focused on vaccine research. The new body will have a remit to include testing and therapies for those with the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The leaders hope to follow the model of the Global Vaccine and Immunisation Alliance (Gavi), which has negotiated with companies that develop vaccines for 20 years, lowering the price by guaranteeing long-term markets and large volumes. Gavi has helped fund the immunisation of 20 million children worldwide.</p> \n<p>A global pandemic board, operating independently, but in partnership with the World Health Organization, will have the support of the G20 group of countries. Separate subgroups will be set up to coordinate work on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Sir Andrew Whitty, the former chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline, has agreed to be a special envoy for the group.</p> \n<p>The aim is to funnel research into five or six vaccines before moving towards mass manufacturing of the two that show the most promise. The WHO estimates as many as 89 vaccines are in development globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and some therapeutics in clinical trials. To hasten the process, the group aims to subsidise manufacture of drugs before final clinical trials are complete. The final costs could be as high as $40bn.</p> \n<p>The launch meeting last week agreed on the principles of Covid therapeutics research sharing and equitable distribution.</p> \n<p>A joint call for action that also backs the role of the WHO has been signed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, European council, president Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission. All three EU national leaders have experienced a surge in popularity since the crisis started, but now face the difficulty of managing an easing of the lockdown without a ready vaccine.</p> \n<p>Their pre-summit joint statement says the aim is to \u201cbring together the world\u2019s best \u2013 and most prepared \u2013 minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A global alliance of world leaders is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (\u00a36.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them. National prestige and huge profits are potentially at stake for the countries and firms that win the race for a vaccine that can take the world\u2019s economies out of lockdown, but there is a risk of uncoordinated duplication of research efforts slowing the process and adding to the cost. Monday\u2019s fundraising summit comes after the concept was launched at a previous meeting on 24 April. Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization. The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit. But optimism that the US might relent and join the initiative had waned by Monday morning. Melinda Gates, a critic of the absence of US leadership on global health, has warned: \u201cIf there is Covid anywhere, there is Covid everywhere. If vaccinations are not distributed everywhere, relapses can occur everywhere\u201d. The UK strongly supports the project and attended the 24 April event. Its prime minister Boris Johnson will tell the conference: \u201cThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus - we are in this together, and together we will prevail.\u201d The initiative is designed to broaden the work of an existing organisation, set up in 2017 in the wake of the Ebola outbreak, known as the Global Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations focused on vaccine research. The new body will have a remit to include testing and therapies for those with the disease. The leaders hope to follow the model of the Global Vaccine and Immunisation Alliance (Gavi), which has negotiated with companies that develop vaccines for 20 years, lowering the price by guaranteeing long-term markets and large volumes. Gavi has helped fund the immunisation of 20 million children worldwide. A global pandemic board, operating independently, but in partnership with the World Health Organization, will have the support of the G20 group of countries. Separate subgroups will be set up to coordinate work on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Sir Andrew Whitty, the former chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline, has agreed to be a special envoy for the group. The aim is to funnel research into five or six vaccines before moving towards mass manufacturing of the two that show the most promise. The WHO estimates as many as 89 vaccines are in development globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and some therapeutics in clinical trials. To hasten the process, the group aims to subsidise manufacture of drugs before final clinical trials are complete. The final costs could be as high as $40bn. The launch meeting last week agreed on the principles of Covid therapeutics research sharing and equitable distribution. A joint call for action that also backs the role of the WHO has been signed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, European council, president Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission. All three EU national leaders have experienced a surge in popularity since the crisis started, but now face the difficulty of managing an easing of the lockdown without a ready vaccine. Their pre-summit joint statement says the aim is to \u201cbring together the world\u2019s best \u2013 and most prepared \u2013 minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Friday Coalition credibility is only as strong as its weakest link \u2013 and right now that\u2019s Angus Taylor \u2018The fact this episode is still something to speculate about eight months later, that even the minister hasn\u2019t, or can\u2019t, fluently explain what happened, is a matter of concern. It goes to credibility.\u2019 Experience: we drove 25,000 miles home from New Zealand \u2018Crossing the Pakistan-Iran border was the only hairy moment. Tourists are given an armed escort but, as we passed through a military base on the way to the border, the guards were tense and warned that the Taliban were in the area. We passed them several times as our escort yelled at me to keep driving. It was a terrifying half-hour before they dropped us off, but it\u2019s the kind of experience that locals have daily.\u2019 My favourite game: Iverson stuns Kobe\u2019s Lakers in the 2001 NBA finals \u2018The 2001 Philadelphia 76ers are a tall tale that only grows unlikelier with time. The premise flatly stated is absurd: the Sixers built a ballclub around a 5ft 11in delinquent from Virginia Beach and it worked. Allen Iverson became the least conventional star ever to lead a team to the NBA finals and the Sixers became the ultimate underdog squad for the ultimate underdog city.\u2019 The Premier League\u2019s best young players of 2009-10 ... a decade later \u2018There is an assumption that footballers get better with age before peaking in their late twenties and regressing in their thirties. However, a look back at the best players aged 21 or under in the 2009-10 season shows that not every promising youngster is destined for greater things.\u2019 \u2018The audience booed, the cast fled\u2019 \u2013 playwrights relive their worst flops Alan Ayckbourn: \u2018The biggest failure I ever had was my first attempt at a musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice had just had two big successes with Joseph and Jesus Christ Superstar, and I was the golden boy of the West End at that point. So somebody had the bright idea of bringing the three of us together to adapt the stories of PG Wodehouse.\u2019 Saturday Blind date: \u2018I hope my lockdown haircut didn\u2019t count against me\u2019 \u2018My housemate played waiter in exchange for a cut of the food and an attempt to score a date with her housemate.\u2019 My favourite game: Liverpool v Wimbledon, 1988 FA Cup final \u2018Everything about the day was special. First, my dad drove us to the match; no getting the tube for this game. The brown Morris Marina was full of sweets and we arrived a mile or so away from the stadium in style. FA Cup finals were staged in searing heat back then and this was no exception. However, in what was an ominous signal for the result that followed, the Chewits melted in the car.\u2019 Tim Dowling: Oh no! I\u2019m being visited by ghosts of bosses past \u2018On my way back to the kitchen I find the tortoise lying on his back in a puddle of his own urine. He cranes his neck and fixes me with a look that says: please don\u2019t write about this. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I say, turning him over. Evidently he took a shortcut over brick edging and got unlucky.\u2019 Paul Heaton: \u2018Love feels like someone is hitting your heart with a cricket bat\u2019 \u2018One review said, \u201cYou know where he lives, now go and kill him.\u201d I was reading it in my house at the time. I went to the window, pulled the curtains to one side, checked the street and went back to picking my nose.\u2019 Neil Morrissey: \u2019I hated the press making me out to be a love rat\u2019 \u2018Maybe those relationships would have been different had they not been all over the papers, but no matter what happened, the press shouldn\u2019t have been hacking my phone or having private detectives follow me. I turned into a mistrusting, quieter, reticent person.\u2019 Sunday Betrayal and bombast: the surreal story of the Terry v Bridge scandal \u2018For Perroncel, a 33-year-old single mother who had broken no laws, the events of early 2010 would be a cruel tutelage in the way football and society treats women: the sex\u2011shaming, the humiliation, the public guillotine. The way they are regarded as male property, to be held and exchanged without agency. The way they are framed in terms of the male gaze, a framing that is then used against them.\u2019 \u2018I was a boy who wanted nothing so much as to join the police\u2019 \u2018The rest of my white liberal friends at university were having none of the police\u2019s public statements about changing and they certainly didn\u2019t share my vision of hope about the public drive towards diversity in the force. They repeatedly warned me about racism and homophobia still being rife. But I didn\u2019t let any of my friends shake my resolve. I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.\u2019 Britt Ekland on Peter Sellers: \u2018He was a very tormented soul\u2019 \u2018Sellers\u2019s former wife Britt Ekland has opened up about their troubled marriage, describing Sellers \u2013 who suffered from serious ill health as well as alcohol and cocaine dependency \u2013 as deeply controlling and mentally unstable, but unable to receive the medical treatment that he would have got today, partly because he was so valuable to the studios.\u2019 Denis Goldberg, the man who offered to sign his own death warrant to save Nelson Mandela \u2018Mandela\u2019s defiant speech from the dock was widely reported and made him a household name throughout the world.

It was a rare instance of the Senate majority leader overplaying his hand.</p> \n<p>It also showed that Donald Trump is not the only figure embodying liberal nightmares in the time of coronavirus.

On 12 March, just before Trump declared a national emergency, the senator flew back to Kentucky for a celebration for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/trump-seizing-courts-democratic-win-november-could-stop-him\">Justin Walker,</a> a young rightwing judge nominated to America\u2019s second highest court.

But it was skewed in favour of corporate executives and shareholders. Democrats refused it. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-bailout-mcconnell-congress.html\">A New York Times editorial </a>was headlined: \u201cThe Coronavirus Bailout Stalled.

Instead, he blamed Democrats for impeaching Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The coronavirus] came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial,\u201d McConnell told the <a href=\"https://www.hughhewitt.com/senate-majority-leader-mitch-mcconnell-5/\">conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt</a>. \u201cAnd I think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Opponents saw that as a feeble attempt to excuse the inexcusable.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/moevela?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Moe Vela,</a> a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, said: \u201cAlmost any good Mitch McConnell did by cooperating and collaborating on the legislative side is undone by his enabling of the president at a time when he could have been a real leader and called out the president on his lack of responsiveness and leadership.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because he had the chance to redeem himself from all the negative and enabling and divisiveness of the past several years as the majority leader and he didn\u2019t take it.</p> \n<p>Vela, a board director of <a href=\"https://transparentbusiness.com/\">TransparentBusiness,</a> added: \u201cMitch McConnell and Donald Trump are battling for who is the greatest hypocrite in our nation \u2013 it\u2019s like they\u2019re competing for the hypocrisy trophy. It\u2019s not about unity, it\u2019s not about bringing the American people together at a time of crisis. For McConnell and Trump, it\u2019s all about politics and power.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week McConnell retreated from his much-derided position on \u201cblue state bailouts\u201d and bankruptcy, indicating he would consider funds in the next relief bill for state and local governments struggling to pay police and firefighters.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question all governors, regardless of party, would like to have more money, I\u2019m open to discussing that,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/29/us/politics/ap-us-virus-outbreak-congress.html\">he said on Fox News Radio.</a></p> \n<p>But he sailed into fresh controversy by insisting that senators, unlike their counterparts in the House, return to work on Monday. Washington DC <a href=\"https://coronavirus.dc.gov/\">remains a virus hotspot.</a> At least one senator, eight Capitol police officers and 11 workers have tested positive. Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland warned that \u201cwithout effective safeguards in place, Mitch McConnell is endangering the lives of the staff\u201d.</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, condemned McConnell for priorities that include confirming Walker and demanded oversight hearings into the White House\u2019s \u201cdreadful response to this public health crisis\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-statement-on-senator-mcconnells-decision-to-reconvene-senate-to-confirm-more-unqualified-right-wing-judges-and-protect-big-businesses-over-workers\">Schumer said:</a> \u201cThe American people are demanding answers and solutions \u2013 Senator McConnell ought to focus the Senate\u2019s work on the crises caused by Covid-19, not rightwing judges or fulfilling his \u2018pre-existing partisan wishlist\u2019 of protecting big business from any harm done to the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another confrontation is looming, over the next stimulus package.

      "bodyText": "It was, New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo observed, \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time\u201d. Larry Hogan, his counterpart in Maryland, called it \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. Congressman Pete King of New York said it was the work of the \u201cMarie Antoinette of the Senate\u201d. It would be an understatement to say Mitch McConnell\u2019s suggestion that state and local governments should declare bankruptcy rather than seek more federal funding went down like a lead balloon. It was a rare instance of the Senate majority leader overplaying his hand. It also showed that Donald Trump is not the only figure embodying liberal nightmares in the time of coronavirus. When historians contemplate a death toll in the tens of thousands and an economy fallen off a cliff, they will pay close attention to the president\u2019s most important ally. \u201cI think Mitch McConnell is the guy to be watching and focusing on in terms of what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cHis messaging around the coronavirus has been tone deaf. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the fact that McConnell was remarkably brutal in pairing Americans into red and blue states at a time of national crisis \u2013 that is pretty shameless \u2013 but I think it was also politically inept because he\u2019s got his colleagues in tough races in blue states.\u201d McConnell\u2019s role in the pandemic drama has been criticised. On 12 March, just before Trump declared a national emergency, the senator flew back to Kentucky for a celebration for Justin Walker, a young rightwing judge nominated to America\u2019s second highest court. The ill-timed absence was noted. \u201c#WheresMitch?\u201d trended on Twitter. With the economy in a tailspin, Senate Republicans came up with emergency funding. But it was skewed in favour of corporate executives and shareholders. Democrats refused it. A New York Times editorial was headlined: \u201cThe Coronavirus Bailout Stalled. And It\u2019s Mitch McConnell\u2019s Fault.\u201d Democrats forced concessions in a record $2.2tn bill that increased support to workers and reduced handouts to business, though these still amounted to what critics called a $500bn \u201ccorporate slush fund\u201d. Trump was earning global opprobrium for his bungling of the pandemic, but it was apparently too late for McConnell to untether himself from the president, even if he so desired. Instead, he blamed Democrats for impeaching Trump. \u201c[The coronavirus] came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial,\u201d McConnell told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cAnd I think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment.\u201d Opponents saw that as a feeble attempt to excuse the inexcusable. Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, said: \u201cAlmost any good Mitch McConnell did by cooperating and collaborating on the legislative side is undone by his enabling of the president at a time when he could have been a real leader and called out the president on his lack of responsiveness and leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because he had the chance to redeem himself from all the negative and enabling and divisiveness of the past several years as the majority leader and he didn\u2019t take it. Vela, a board director of TransparentBusiness, added: \u201cMitch McConnell and Donald Trump are battling for who is the greatest hypocrite in our nation \u2013 it\u2019s like they\u2019re competing for the hypocrisy trophy. It\u2019s not about unity, it\u2019s not about bringing the American people together at a time of crisis. For McConnell and Trump, it\u2019s all about politics and power.\u201d Last week McConnell retreated from his much-derided position on \u201cblue state bailouts\u201d and bankruptcy, indicating he would consider funds in the next relief bill for state and local governments struggling to pay police and firefighters. \u201cThere\u2019s no question all governors, regardless of party, would like to have more money, I\u2019m open to discussing that,\u201d he said on Fox News Radio. But he sailed into fresh controversy by insisting that senators, unlike their counterparts in the House, return to work on Monday. Washington DC remains a virus hotspot. At least one senator, eight Capitol police officers and 11 workers have tested positive. Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland warned that \u201cwithout effective safeguards in place, Mitch McConnell is endangering the lives of the staff\u201d. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, condemned McConnell for priorities that include confirming Walker and demanded oversight hearings into the White House\u2019s \u201cdreadful response to this public health crisis\u201d. Schumer said: \u201cThe American people are demanding answers and solutions \u2013 Senator McConnell ought to focus the Senate\u2019s work on the crises caused by Covid-19, not rightwing judges or fulfilling his \u2018pre-existing partisan wishlist\u2019 of protecting big business from any harm done to the American people.\u201d Another confrontation is looming, over the next stimulus package. McConnell is insisting on protections for businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits as states reopen. Democrats warn workers\u2019 health could be jeopardised. Public Citizen, a corporate and government watchdog, tweeted: \u201cMcConnell is now refusing to pass ANY stimulus bill that doesn\u2019t include TOTAL LEGAL IMMUNITY for corporations that get people sick [with] the coronavirus. It\u2019s abhorrent. It\u2019s also totally impractical. How can we reopen the economy if companies have no incentive to keep us safe?\u201d Trump and McConnell appear bound together. Should the president lose in November, he could bring down Senate Republicans \u2013 perhaps even McConnell in Kentucky. Challenger Amy McGrath, a fighter pilot, outraised McConnell in the first three months of this year. Defeat would be an ignominious end to a divisive career. Kurt Bardella, a former senior adviser for the House oversight committee, said: \u201cHistory will not look back on Mitch McConnell kindly. He has been the most effective enabler of Donald Trump. \u201cEverything Trump has inflicted on the American people has been done with the blessing of McConnell. Through this entire coronavirus pandemic, McConnell has displayed he is a soulless person who is willing to let people suffer so he can continue to wield power.\u201d",

Governments and local municipalities would have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">recruit and train foot soldiers</a> to carry this out.<strong> </strong>While testing itself is not a solution, it is a crucial part of a package of public health interventions needed to keep identifying clusters of infection and breaking these apart.

href=\"http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2009/hca23-2009-07-07.pdf\">the Pape case</a> the high court had previously upheld the constitutional validity of

things such as the resurfacing of a local football oval.\u201d</p> <p>Twomey argued that although the Covid-19 pandemic and risk of recession does not affect the validity of the existing legislation allowing Sports Australia to make grants, the parliament could enact new legislation for sports grants as part of a stimulus package.</p> <p>\u201cBut it could also be argued that giving sports grants

provided\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn one such example where the landowner (the territory) was not consulted by the applicant, the project could not be supported due to the impact on other tenants in a

argued the \u201climited timeframe\u201d had resulted in some insufficiently scoped or costed applications, with organisations now seeking to revise the project scope or asking the ACT to top-up a

The inquiry had stalled for two months due to the outbreak of Covid-19, delaying expected appearances from Bridget McKenzie, and the secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, Phil Gaetjens. Although McKenzie continued to deny wrongdoing in a submission published on Thursday, the former sports minister is yet to front the inquiry to explain the prime minister\u2019s office\u2019s role in the program and a series of late changes to the list of approved projects, made after she gave sign-off on 4 April 2019. The future of the program is in doubt because the Beechworth Lawn Tennis Club has threatened \u2013 but not begun \u2013 legal action against it on the basis Sports Australia, and not McKenzie, had the power to make grants. Academics including Anne Twomey have also warned the program is not constitutional because the commonwealth has no authority to give sports grants. But Rumble argued that any \u201cdoubt about the constitutional power\u201d has now evaporated due to the \u201ccurrent economic crisis associated with the Covid-19 health crisis\u201d. Rumble called on the Morrison government to fund projects that scored well but were not awarded grants, because \u201cin the current economic crisis these projects are ideal candidates for stimulus support\u201d. In a scathing report, the auditor-general found McKenzie\u2019s office had run an assessment process separate to that conducted by Sports Australia, skewing $100m in grants to marginal and target seats. Twomey told Guardian Australia that in the Pape case the high court had previously upheld the constitutional validity of \u201cshort-term fiscal measures\u201d to combat the global financial crisis. But she said the sports grant legislation \u201cwas not enacted as a short-term fiscal stimulus in response to a national emergency\u201d. \u201cIt was general legislation which \u2026 may have been supported to a limited extent by the external affairs power \u2026 but could not constitutionally extend to things such as the resurfacing of a local football oval.\u201d Twomey argued that although the Covid-19 pandemic and risk of recession does not affect the validity of the existing legislation allowing Sports Australia to make grants, the parliament could enact new legislation for sports grants as part of a stimulus package. \u201cBut it could also be argued that giving sports grants to local clubs is not something that is peculiarly within the capacity or resources of the commonwealth.\u201d In its submission, the ACT noted that where it was the relevant landowner, applicants \u201crequired evidence of consent or support\u201d from the territory, but some ultimately successful applicants were \u201cawarded funding for works to territory facilities where consent was not requested or provided\u201d. \u201cIn one such example where the landowner (the territory) was not consulted by the applicant, the project could not be supported due to the impact on other tenants in a shared facility and limitations to disability access.\u201d The ACT government said it had warned Sport Australia, \u201cyet the project was awarded funding\u201d. According to program guidelines, a landowner consent form was mandatory for projects seeking funding of between $200,000 and $500,000, but optional for those seeking less than $200,000. The ACT government also argued the \u201climited timeframe\u201d had resulted in some insufficiently scoped or costed applications, with organisations now seeking to revise the project scope or asking the ACT to top-up a funding shortfall. In January Scott Morrison suggested unsuccessful clubs may yet receive funding. The sport minister, Richard Colbeck, said \u201cany future investment in community sport infrastructure will be considered as part of the budget process\u201d.",

He argued that he needed to <a href=\"https://faculty.ai/blog/data-can-save-us-from-covid-19/\">align Faculty\u2019s work</a> with that of the rest of government, including Sage. Faculty said he attended Sage as an observer.</p> <p>Faculty\u2019s work on the coronavirus response is only the latest government project it has secured under the Conservative administration.

They are worth around \u00a390,000, according to its most recent filings.</p> <p>In February this year it was announced that Agnew had become a minister in the Cabinet Office and Treasury and had taken ministerial responsibility for the GDS, which works with official bodies to use digital technology to improve public services.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said Agnew had had no role in awarding any contracts to Faculty while he had been a minister.

      "bodyText": "An artificial intelligence startup that was hired to work with Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign has been awarded at least seven government contracts worth almost \u00a31m in the space of 18 months. Faculty, which has links to senior Tory figures in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, is rapidly expanding its reach into various corners of Whitehall and last year was tasked with finding ways to apply artificial intelligence across government. A Cabinet Office minister, Theodore Agnew, who is responsible for the government department that promotes the use of digital technology within public services, is resisting calls to sell a \u00a390,000 shareholding in the company amid claims of a conflict of interest. On Friday it emerged that Faculty\u2019s chief executive, Marc Warner, attended a meeting of the government\u2019s scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage). Faculty\u2019s connections to the upper echelons of the government appear to run deep. The firm\u2019s first high-profile contract was supplying data science services to the Vote Leave campaign, which Cummings ran before becoming Boris Johnson\u2019s chief political adviser. Cummings has for years maintained a blog documenting among other things his enthusiasm for the disruptive potential of new technologies and artificial intelligence. Faculty is run by Marc Warner, whose brother Ben Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the data modelling for the Conservative party\u2019s general election campaign. Ben Warner is a former senior employee at Faculty and is also said to have worked on Vote Leave. Ben Warner hit the headlines when the Guardian revealed he and Cummings have been attending meetings of Sage, which provides advice to ministers on Covid-19. One Sage attendee told the Guardian that Warner was a regular participant in meetings and \u201cbehaved as Cummings\u2019 deputy\u201d. Faculty is working at the heart of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. It has been processing large volumes of confidential UK patient information in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d data-mining operation alongside Palantir, a US firm founded by the libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel. Marc Warner disclosed in an article in the Times that he too attended a critical meeting of Sage in March before the lockdown was imposed. He argued that he needed to align Faculty\u2019s work with that of the rest of government, including Sage. Faculty said he attended Sage as an observer. Faculty\u2019s work on the coronavirus response is only the latest government project it has secured under the Conservative administration. One early contract, for \u00a332,000, funded fellowships in 2018 to place data scientists in city governments to help solve local challenges. Faculty was at that time operating under its original name, Advanced Skills Initiative. Last year Faculty was awarded a \u00a3250,000 contract from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to run a cross-government review on the adoption of artificial intelligence, announced on the same day that the company rebranded as Faculty Science. Under the contract, Faculty worked with two government departments \u2013 the Office for Artificial Intelligence and Government Digital Service (GDS) \u2013 \u201cto identify the most significant opportunities to introduce AI across government with the aim of increasing productivity and improving the quality of public services\u201d. One of Faculty\u2019s shareholders is Lord Agnew, a financier who has been a government minister since 2017. He has owned shares in the firm for the past four years. They are worth around \u00a390,000, according to its most recent filings. In February this year it was announced that Agnew had become a minister in the Cabinet Office and Treasury and had taken ministerial responsibility for the GDS, which works with official bodies to use digital technology to improve public services. A government spokesperson said Agnew had had no role in awarding any contracts to Faculty while he had been a minister. However, Spotlight on Corruption, a watchdog group, has called on Agnew to sell his shareholding in Faculty, saying it raised questions over the government\u2019s rules on managing conflicts of interests. The government spokesperson replied that Agnew had followed the appropriate procedures by declaring his shareholding in House of Lords register of interests and under the ministerial code of conduct. Faculty said that while the GDS approved the overall budget for technology projects, it was not involved in the tendering or approval of specific contracts by individual departments. Last year Faculty also received two consultancy contracts worth \u00a3185,000 from GDS. In March it also secured a \u00a3125,000 contract to provide advice on bias mitigation in finance and recruitment to the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), a government-funded board of experts who have been tasked by ministers with making recommendations about the ethical implementation of new technologies. One of the CDEI board members is Faculty\u2019s chief commercial officer, Richard Sargeant. A Faculty spokesperson said Sargeant had recused himself from any discussions concerning the CDEI contract. A government spokesperson said Faculty was the highest-scoring bidder under a competitive tender. Faculty\u2019s government work with Palantir on Covid-19 is based out of NHSX, the digital technology arm of the health service. This work was awarded to Faculty in March under the government\u2019s fast-track procedures to respond to the pandemic, without any other firms being asked to bid for it. Instead of an open tender process, the Department of Health decided to extend a contract that had already been awarded to Faculty. The original contract was awarded after a competitive tender. Faculty said the extension of the contract built on its existing work with NHSX to create a new artificial intelligence laboratory. In addition, Faculty has been awarded a \u00a3264,000 contract from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on industry. In February 2018 it was reported that Faculty had a \u00a3600,000 contract from the Home Office to track terrorist videos online. Holly Searle, Faculty\u2019s head of PR and communications, said: \u201cFaculty has strong governance procedures in place to guard against conflicts of interest when competing for new work. All of its contracts with the government are won through the proper processes and in line with procurement rules.\u201d The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian, is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty.",

      "body": "<p>Spring, in the days of lockdown, continues obliviously \u2013 and reminds us how we depend on the natural world. For anyone with the luck to have a garden, the varied consolations of even a small patch of land will be clearer than ever. Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s fascinating book, written before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> crisis, brings indebtedness to nature into new focus and, during a time in which many of us are compelled by our phones and computers, extends the awareness \u2013 backed up by compendious and elegant research \u2013 of how mentally enriching it is to swap screen for green.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith is a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, married to celebrated garden designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/10/gardens-great-plains-tom-stuart-smith\">Tom Stuart-Smith</a>. Their style of gardening is a sympathetic collaboration with nature, eschewing high-handed interventions. An early photograph \u2013 in 1988 \u2013 shows them surveying newly dug beds in their Hertfordshire garden. Nothing much is growing \u2013 apart from the baby in Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s arms \u2013 and they are at a momentary standstill, lost in thought. The photo makes the point: gardens begin \u2013 and continue \u2013 in the mind.</p> <p>The book begins with the moving story of Stuart-Smith\u2019s grandfather, Ted, whose submarine ran aground in the Dardanelles in 1915 and who became a prisoner in Turkey\u2019s brutal camps. He returned a haunted wraith, wearing \u201ca battered old raincoat with a Turkish fez on his head\u201d. His fianc\u00e9e, Fanny, restored him with sips of soup \u2013 but it was gardening that rescued him for the long haul. Ted is the first of many in the book for whom mental illness is relieved by gardening. Nature, Stuart-Smith reminds us, neither rejects nor judges.</p> <p>As a young woman, she dismissed gardening as \u201coutdoor housework\u201d. Now, she reports on how a long gardening session can leave you \u201cfeeling dead on your feet but strangely renewed inside \u2013 both purged and re-energised, as if you have worked on yourself in the process\u2026. gardening catharsis.\u201d Gardening can help with grief and be a way of making peace with mortality. It is a \u201cmeeting place between our innermost, dream-infused selves and the real physical world\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe, wrote Voltaire</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The neutrality of nurturing plants positively affects those who have themselves received little care, and Stuart-Smith enlightens us by explaining how caring is neurologically important. She visits exceptional therapeutic gardens including the <a href=\"https://insightgardenprogram.org/\">Insight Garden</a> project at San Quentin jail, <a href=\"https://www.horatiosgarden.org.uk/\">Horatio\u2019s Garden</a> for spinal-injury patients at Salisbury hospital, and a vegetable garden for recovering addicts in San Patrignano, Italy. Plants are easier to deal with than people (even if they have their own ways of answering back).</p> <p>This is not a book of effusions. It is attractive because quietly considered. It encourages us to garden \u2013 but gentle push never comes to shove. Stuart-Smith suggests that gardening, throughout history, has been civilising and about reciprocity \u2013 a mix of dream and slog. And there is no shortage of thinkers to stake her arguments. Freud was an avid orchid lover and cherished his garden in West Hampstead. Jung said: \u201cWe all need nourishment for our psyche. It is impossible to find such nourishment in urban tenements without a patch of green or a blossoming tree\u201d, and Donald Winnicott recklessly climbed a tree towards the end of his life (to the alarm of his wife) to do some tree surgery and create a better view.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith satisfyingly expands on Voltaire\u2019s \u201c<em>Il faut cultiver n</em><em>otre jardin</em>\u201d. Rejecting conventional formality, Voltaire planted thousands of trees on his land in eastern France and asserted: \u201cI have only done one sensible thing in my life \u2013 cultivate the ground. He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe.\u201d Sue Stuart-Smith renders a very special service with this book. Let\u2019s hope it reaches not only the converted but those who need it most.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac0943e17c10001926208f8d8a682eda64fe4434\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac0943e17c10001926208f8d8a682eda64fe4434/0_385_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Elation comes in many forms\u2019: Isabel Hardman in London\u2019s Richmond Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elation comes in many forms\u2019: Isabel Hardman in London\u2019s Richmond Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Natural Health Service</em> makes a robustly argued companion piece that has grown out of fragility \u2013 the work not of a psychiatrist but of a patient. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman\">Isabel Hardman</a>, assistant editor of the <em>Spectator</em>, has suffered from PTSD, been dogged by the Black Dog and had times when she has felt suicidal. In 2016, she knew something was wrong when words went on strike and \u201cobsessive, frightening thoughts settled like a parliament of rooks\u201d. It was, she has since discovered, the \u201cgreat outdoors which made me want to keep living\u201d. And while I wish she would not keep repeating \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d (a phrase that diminishes what it describes), there is no doubting the integrity of her experience.</p> <p>I respect her decision not to recount the terrible thing that happened to her, although it leaves one with a more than idle curiosity \u2013 knowing the details of an affliction can be part of assessing the cure. However, the book holds its own as an inquiry into nature as tonic. Elation comes in many forms: an unexpected orchid in a Glasgow car park, a shy kingfisher by the Thames, and Penny Black, a headstrong pony in Wimbledon. She writes about forest bathing and about walking, running and cold water swimming (she breaks the ice on the Serpentine \u2013 that most masochistic of life-affirmations). She never overstates her case. She acknowledges the need for more research, recognises the importance of placebos and remembers that each individual prescription will be different. These natural cures, she is especially keen to maintain, should be for everyone.

      "bodyText": "Spring, in the days of lockdown, continues obliviously \u2013 and reminds us how we depend on the natural world. For anyone with the luck to have a garden, the varied consolations of even a small patch of land will be clearer than ever. Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s fascinating book, written before the coronavirus crisis, brings indebtedness to nature into new focus and, during a time in which many of us are compelled by our phones and computers, extends the awareness \u2013 backed up by compendious and elegant research \u2013 of how mentally enriching it is to swap screen for green. Stuart-Smith is a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, married to celebrated garden designer Tom Stuart-Smith. Their style of gardening is a sympathetic collaboration with nature, eschewing high-handed interventions. An early photograph \u2013 in 1988 \u2013 shows them surveying newly dug beds in their Hertfordshire garden. Nothing much is growing \u2013 apart from the baby in Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s arms \u2013 and they are at a momentary standstill, lost in thought. The photo makes the point: gardens begin \u2013 and continue \u2013 in the mind. The book begins with the moving story of Stuart-Smith\u2019s grandfather, Ted, whose submarine ran aground in the Dardanelles in 1915 and who became a prisoner in Turkey\u2019s brutal camps. He returned a haunted wraith, wearing \u201ca battered old raincoat with a Turkish fez on his head\u201d. His fianc\u00e9e, Fanny, restored him with sips of soup \u2013 but it was gardening that rescued him for the long haul. Ted is the first of many in the book for whom mental illness is relieved by gardening. Nature, Stuart-Smith reminds us, neither rejects nor judges. As a young woman, she dismissed gardening as \u201coutdoor housework\u201d. Now, she reports on how a long gardening session can leave you \u201cfeeling dead on your feet but strangely renewed inside \u2013 both purged and re-energised, as if you have worked on yourself in the process\u2026. gardening catharsis.\u201d Gardening can help with grief and be a way of making peace with mortality. It is a \u201cmeeting place between our innermost, dream-infused selves and the real physical world\u201d. The neutrality of nurturing plants positively affects those who have themselves received little care, and Stuart-Smith enlightens us by explaining how caring is neurologically important. She visits exceptional therapeutic gardens including the Insight Garden project at San Quentin jail, Horatio\u2019s Garden for spinal-injury patients at Salisbury hospital, and a vegetable garden for recovering addicts in San Patrignano, Italy. Plants are easier to deal with than people (even if they have their own ways of answering back). This is not a book of effusions. It is attractive because quietly considered. It encourages us to garden \u2013 but gentle push never comes to shove. Stuart-Smith suggests that gardening, throughout history, has been civilising and about reciprocity \u2013 a mix of dream and slog. And there is no shortage of thinkers to stake her arguments. Freud was an avid orchid lover and cherished his garden in West Hampstead. Jung said: \u201cWe all need nourishment for our psyche. It is impossible to find such nourishment in urban tenements without a patch of green or a blossoming tree\u201d, and Donald Winnicott recklessly climbed a tree towards the end of his life (to the alarm of his wife) to do some tree surgery and create a better view. Stuart-Smith satisfyingly expands on Voltaire\u2019s \u201cIl faut cultiver notre jardin\u201d. Rejecting conventional formality, Voltaire planted thousands of trees on his land in eastern France and asserted: \u201cI have only done one sensible thing in my life \u2013 cultivate the ground. He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe.\u201d Sue Stuart-Smith renders a very special service with this book. Let\u2019s hope it reaches not only the converted but those who need it most. The Natural Health Service makes a robustly argued companion piece that has grown out of fragility \u2013 the work not of a psychiatrist but of a patient. Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of the Spectator, has suffered from PTSD, been dogged by the Black Dog and had times when she has felt suicidal. In 2016, she knew something was wrong when words went on strike and \u201cobsessive, frightening thoughts settled like a parliament of rooks\u201d. It was, she has since discovered, the \u201cgreat outdoors which made me want to keep living\u201d. And while I wish she would not keep repeating \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d (a phrase that diminishes what it describes), there is no doubting the integrity of her experience. I respect her decision not to recount the terrible thing that happened to her, although it leaves one with a more than idle curiosity \u2013 knowing the details of an affliction can be part of assessing the cure. However, the book holds its own as an inquiry into nature as tonic. Elation comes in many forms: an unexpected orchid in a Glasgow car park, a shy kingfisher by the Thames, and Penny Black, a headstrong pony in Wimbledon. She writes about forest bathing and about walking, running and cold water swimming (she breaks the ice on the Serpentine \u2013 that most masochistic of life-affirmations). She never overstates her case. She acknowledges the need for more research, recognises the importance of placebos and remembers that each individual prescription will be different. These natural cures, she is especially keen to maintain, should be for everyone. And she introduces us to a wonderful Nordic word to which we should all adhere: friluftsliv \u2013 the healing power of nature. \u2022 The Well Gardened Mind: Rediscovering Nature in the Modern World by Sue Stuart-Smith is published by HarperCollins (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "A tiny Brisbane company linked to coronavirus test scandals in Australia, Puerto Rico and the mainland United States says it is now attempting to fill international orders by manufacturing its own antibody tests, despite having no previous diagnostic experience and the tests being unsanctioned and unproven. Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd \u2013 a company run by convicted rapist Neran de Silva \u2013 made a series of promises to deliver huge quantities of Covid-19 tests to governments across the world, initially on the basis that it was able to re-sell equipment from a reputable Chinese manufacturer. When its deal with the Chinese manufacturer collapsed, Promedical continued to market its own branded test kits, which it falsely claimed had various approvals and said were obtained from an unnamed Australian supplier. But amid further questioning from Guardian Australia, the company now claims it is the physical manufacturer of its product, raising alarm at a time when experts say the supply of unapproved tests \u2013 or the manufacture of tests by unqualified companies \u2013 needs greater scrutiny. The company responded to suggestions it is ill-equipped to manufacture coronavirus tests by comparing its actions to other businesses that have upended their business models to assist with the pandemic response. \u201cFrom aeronautical companies manufacturing ventilators and major fashion houses producing face masks, to distilleries producing hand sanitiser, there is an incredibly strong drive to support local communities wherever possible,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. Only one Australian company, AusDiagnostics, has approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to manufacture Covid-19 testing. AusDiagnostics makes RNA Covid-19 tests and is headed by the Cambridge-educated molecular biologist and immunologist Keith Stanley. It has offices in London, Dallas and Auckland. Promedical is run by de Silva, who was convicted of rape in 2018 and was a one-time business associate of the government services minister, Stuart Robert, through a failed cryotherapy treatment business. De Silva claims on his LinkedIn page to have medical qualifications from the University of Queensland and Griffith University, but neither has any record of him in their online graduate verification systems. Before the pandemic, Promedical sold cryogenic treatment, massage therapy and erectile dysfunction machines. Promedical is under investigation by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration in relation to Covid-19 tests. The company\u2019s claims to be able to supply large quantities of tests at the height of the pandemic have been linked to collapsed deals being probed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the legislature of Puerto Rico. The latter deal, to supply 1m tests to Puerto Rico via a US intermediary and a small construction company in San Juan, was cancelled by the government at a critical time for the US external territory, which has desperately low testing rates. Last week Promedical suffered another setback: a key contractor disowned the company, claiming he was uncomfortable with what he had learned about its practices. Guardian Australia has obtained an email from Bradley Mayo, who had been handling Promedical\u2019s freight and logistics. He wrote: \u201cIn these unprecedented and extremely challenging times, the medical supply chain industry is volatile at best, with many opportunists who aim to use this time of crisis to \u2026 enrich themselves. \u201cAfter lengthy investigation and due diligence, I have decided to distance myself from Promedical.\u201d Guardian Australia revealed last week the Australian government entered a contract in March to buy 500,000 Covid-19 test kits from Promedical, which would import them from Chinese company Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Promedical was given approval by the TGA to supply the Wondfo test, but no others. Last month the company told Guardian Australia that it began receiving its first batch of deliveries of unsanctioned tests, supplied by an Australian company, within days of gaining that approval. Videos apparently showing those tests in a Brisbane warehouse were sent to the importers. Promedical repeatedly refused to name the test manufacturer, saying only that the supplier was Australian. But last week the company changed its story, after Guardian Australia learned it was importing chemical reagent, a key component for antibody tests, from South Korea. Promedical now says it is the manufacturer. \u201cPromedical follows strict guidelines as supplied by the TGA for all products supplied by Australian manufacturers,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cPromedical works with a number of different suppliers, however its final [test kit] is Australian. The TGA is aware of the suppliers Promedical works with, and details were included in all applications supplied to the governing body. \u201cPromedical takes responsibility for its [test kit] as the final manufacturer, in line with guidelines and responsibilities set out by the TGA. Promedical works closely with all regulatory bodies in Australia and overseas, including the TGA, to make a positive impact and provide a high-quality product to assist in managing the current health crisis.\u201d After initially being approached by Guardian Australia in relation to online claims it had approval from the TGA and the US Food and Drug Administration, Promedical removed those references from its websites. The company says it is now attempting to gain Australian and US approvals for its self-manufactured test. Last week the FDA allowed Promedical to begin to distribute serology tests in the US, based on the company\u2019s own claims its tests have been validated. The tests have not yet been reviewed or approved by the FDA. Peter Collignon, an infection diseases expert with the Australian National University, said that while accurate, rapid antibody tests were crucial in the fight against the pandemic, allowing unknown or inaccurate testing on to the market was extremely dangerous. Australian regulators needed to do more to place suppliers of testing kits under intense scrutiny, he said. \u201cThe trouble is that this is an emergency \u2026 we can\u2019t do things on the normal slow bureaucratic process, I fully accept that,\u201d Collignon said. \u201cBut equally we have to have a set of minimum of standards that they accept for both drugs and antibody tests. The post-marketing surveillance has to be more intense than normal because we need to rapidly remove these tests if they\u2019re not up to scratch.\u201d",

They (bosses) will want to know that they\u2019re not going to be held liable to horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they\u2019ve done everything in their power to keep their people safe. \u201cWhereas by contrast, you\u2019d want to see those employers who didn\u2019t take adequate steps face the consequences of that so the question of legal liability is extremely important.\u201d Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the public \u201cdeserve to be levelled with\u201d over a detailed plan for easing lockdown measures. She told BBC Breakfast: \u201cGovernment need to put in a range of measures \u2013 whether that is mass community testing, contact tracing, and also those things like potentially the face coverings.\u201d She said: \u201cBut also I think the public who have overwhelmingly stuck by these very tough lockdown rules over the last few weeks deserve to be levelled with and also want some hope for the future, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re urging the government to give much more detail, and face masks are one part of that.\u201d On Monday, Johnson will tell an international conference the coronavirus vaccine is \u201cthe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes\u201d. He will urge countries to pull together and share their expertise to beat the virus. The prime minister is co-hosting the virtual coronavirus global response international pledging conference. As well as the UK, eight other countries and organisations are also co-hosting the forum on Monday, which aims to bring in more than $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) in funding to support the global response. Johnson is expected to say: \u201cTo win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine.\u201d On Sunday night, the US president, Donald Trump, said he expected a vaccine to be developed before the end of the year, though experts worldwide said it may take 12-18 months. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and director of the Wellcome Trust, told the Today programme that finding a vaccine should not be the sole focus, as treatment was also important. He said people had thought a vaccine would be available for HIV decades ago but ultimately none had been developed and treatment has proved more effective.",

New rules for the program, released late on Friday, specify universities must count six months of revenue when calculating their projected downturn, a tweak that puts $1,500 fortnightly payments per worker out of their reach. On Monday, the University of Sydney, one of the last institutions still in contention for the funding, announced it is no longer eligible. The move follows a decision in April to exclude universities from the more generous threshold for charities to access the program, meaning they must show a full 50% drop in revenue or 30% for those with revenue of less than $1bn a year to qualify. On 24 April the government clarified that universities must count their commonwealth grants scheme funding towards their revenue, despite a change allowing other charities to leave out government grants. Under the new rules, while other organisations such as businesses and charities can calculate their losses over one month or one quarter in order to qualify, universities must show the required decline from 1 January to 30 June. The Innovative Research Universities executive director, Conor King, said after successive changes to jobkeeper it now appears \u201cno university can claim it\u201d. \u201cUniversities have turned with every twist of the knife, only to be left to heal ourselves each time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seems to be the final twist of the knife.\u201d \u201cThe lack of support will impact how well universities will function in 2021 and beyond.\u201d The University of Sydney vice-chancellor, Michael Spence, told staff on Monday he believed it qualified and had applied on the basis of \u201cthe significant loss of revenue from student suspensions and withdrawals in March for semester 1\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe government has changed this rule for universities and extended the period in which to demonstrate revenue loss \u2026 this means we will no longer be eligible to receive jobkeeper funding,\u201d he said. Spence reassured staff that anyone who was paid a salary top-up in April in anticipation of receiving jobkeeper funding in May will be allowed to keep the payment. A spokeswoman for La Trobe said the university believed it was eligible for jobkeeper based on a decline in projected GST turnover of more than 30% when comparing March 2020 with March 2019.

A court case brought by environmental groups in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/dutch-supreme-court-upholds-landmark-ruling-demanding-climate-action\">upheld by the supreme court last year</a> forced the government to act to reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020 at the latest. It is climate action under extreme duress.</p> <p>There are more than 1,500 climate lawsuits either complete or ongoing in the world, including similar cases in Ireland and Norway, but this is by far the most successful to date.

We would say: if you want a broad group to accept it, these are the right things. I got the sense they were willing to listen.\u201d</p> <p>Paul van der Zanden, a spokesperson for the economics and climate ministry, says: \u201cFinding social support was important for these 2020 climate goals. Urgenda gave a great help in the search for climate measures that citizens can take themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the ideas would have been sidelined for years without the push provided by the court decision. Jan Willem Erisman, a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam who works on emissions in agriculture and who contributed proposals to Urgenda, says: \u201cThe lawsuits are almost needed for the work to be considered by the government. Otherwise economic concerns get in the way, targets are set, we don\u2019t reach them, and then new targets get set.\u201d</p> <p>The Dutch climate agreement presented in the summer of 2019 was the product of cooperation between industry, the energy sector, unions, environmental groups and citizen groups.</p> <p>The Dutch government believes public and social support are essential for a successful climate policy, and it helps citizens to take climate measures themselves.

One coal-fired power plant will be closed outright, and two others built in 2016 will run at a minimal level. This alone will save 5-7.5mt of emissions. But several more public-facing measures from the Urgenda list were selected as well.

      "bodyText": "Last month the Dutch government announced a bold set of climate policies designed to reduce annual carbon emissions by nearly 10 megatons, comparable to the yearly output of Latvia. Several new coal power plants are to be closed or run at minimum capacity, a \u20ac3bn spending package will subsidise renewable energy projects and home refits, and there are a slew of smaller policy tweaks, for example on livestock numbers, reforestation and lowering the national speed limit. The middle of a public health crisis may seem like a strange time to make new climate commitments, but the Dutch government had little choice. A court case brought by environmental groups in 2014 and upheld by the supreme court last year forced the government to act to reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020 at the latest. It is climate action under extreme duress. There are more than 1,500 climate lawsuits either complete or ongoing in the world, including similar cases in Ireland and Norway, but this is by far the most successful to date. Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, says the Dutch case is the \u201cstrongest climate change decision ever issued by a court\u201d and the only one that has forced government policy. It has big implications not only for climate law but also for governments, most of whose climate policies are years behind their ambitious pledges.

      "body": "<p>Since taking office in March, Slovenia\u2019s rightwing prime minister, Janez Jan\u0161a, has been busy on Twitter. He has called critical journalists liars and \u201cpresstitutes\u201d, and said the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) should resign. On Wednesday, he retweeted an article suggesting press freedom advocates who had raised alarm about his actions had been using cocaine.</p> <p>Jan\u0161a, who has a Trump-like tendency to fire off inflammatory tweets and is a close ally of the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, took office after the country\u2019s previous prime minister, Marjan \u0160arec, resigned, hoping for early elections. Jan\u0161a was able to form a coalition with his Slovenian Democratic party and three other parties.</p> <p>In its first weeks, the government\u2019s attention has been largely focused on the response to coronavirus, and Slovenia has so far managed to keep numbers of infections and deaths low. However, critics fear Jan\u0161a, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">like his mentor Orb\u00e1n</a>, wants to use the coronavirus crisis for political advantage.</p> <p>He will also be able to act as an additional voice of support inside the EU for Orb\u00e1n and the Polish government, who want to ensure the union does not lecture member states on democracy and rule of law. Slovenia will hold the rotating EU presidency next year.</p> <p>The 61-year-old Jan\u0161a has made a very similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/hungary-viktor-orban-election-migration\">political journey to Orb\u00e1n</a>, starting out three decades ago as a pro-democracy fighter and gradually shifting further right over the years, picking up anti-migration and climate sceptic rhetoric along the way. Jan\u0161a\u2019s political campaigns have used xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech, said Boris Vezjak, a professor at the University of Maribor in Slovenia.</p> <p>Like Orb\u00e1n, he has been accused of backing cronyism and corruption. In 2013 he was sentenced to two years in prison for bribery, but his conviction was annulled by the constitutional court because of a lack of direct evidence and he was released after six months in jail. He denied all accusations.</p> <p>Jan\u0161a, who has had two brief previous spells as prime minister, is backed by a television network funded by Hungarian figures close to Orb\u00e1n, and the network\u2019s former director Ale\u0161 Hojs has been made Jan\u0161a\u2019s new interior minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53191692c5d4e3405bf070c5af54878749a398ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53191692c5d4e3405bf070c5af54878749a398ab/0_152_5502_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Ljubljana against Janez Jan\u0161a and his government last month over alleged corruption.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Ljubljana against Janez Jan\u0161a and his government last month over alleged corruption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ziga Zivulovic Jr./EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLike Orb\u00e1n, he is good at distracting from the abuse of resources with anti-Brussels and anti-migrant rhetoric,\u201d said Florian Bieber, a regional expert at the University of Graz. \u201cHe is also very thin-skinned.\u201d</p> <p>Jan\u0161a has picked up on some of Trump\u2019s talking points around the coronavirus, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJansaSDS/status/1247978340667006981?s=08\">calling for </a>the resignation of the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

      "bodyText": "Since taking office in March, Slovenia\u2019s rightwing prime minister, Janez Jan\u0161a, has been busy on Twitter. He has called critical journalists liars and \u201cpresstitutes\u201d, and said the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) should resign. On Wednesday, he retweeted an article suggesting press freedom advocates who had raised alarm about his actions had been using cocaine. Jan\u0161a, who has a Trump-like tendency to fire off inflammatory tweets and is a close ally of the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, took office after the country\u2019s previous prime minister, Marjan \u0160arec, resigned, hoping for early elections. Jan\u0161a was able to form a coalition with his Slovenian Democratic party and three other parties. In its first weeks, the government\u2019s attention has been largely focused on the response to coronavirus, and Slovenia has so far managed to keep numbers of infections and deaths low. However, critics fear Jan\u0161a, like his mentor Orb\u00e1n, wants to use the coronavirus crisis for political advantage. He will also be able to act as an additional voice of support inside the EU for Orb\u00e1n and the Polish government, who want to ensure the union does not lecture member states on democracy and rule of law. Slovenia will hold the rotating EU presidency next year. The 61-year-old Jan\u0161a has made a very similar political journey to Orb\u00e1n, starting out three decades ago as a pro-democracy fighter and gradually shifting further right over the years, picking up anti-migration and climate sceptic rhetoric along the way. Jan\u0161a\u2019s political campaigns have used xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech, said Boris Vezjak, a professor at the University of Maribor in Slovenia. Like Orb\u00e1n, he has been accused of backing cronyism and corruption. In 2013 he was sentenced to two years in prison for bribery, but his conviction was annulled by the constitutional court because of a lack of direct evidence and he was released after six months in jail. He denied all accusations. Jan\u0161a, who has had two brief previous spells as prime minister, is backed by a television network funded by Hungarian figures close to Orb\u00e1n, and the network\u2019s former director Ale\u0161 Hojs has been made Jan\u0161a\u2019s new interior minister. \u201cLike Orb\u00e1n, he is good at distracting from the abuse of resources with anti-Brussels and anti-migrant rhetoric,\u201d said Florian Bieber, a regional expert at the University of Graz. \u201cHe is also very thin-skinned.\u201d Jan\u0161a has picked up on some of Trump\u2019s talking points around the coronavirus, including calling for the resignation of the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Like Trump, he has also made vitriolic attacks on critical journalists, accusing public television of \u201cspreading lies\u201d. When in opposition, in 2016, he accused two female journalists of being \u201cwashed-up prostitutes\u201d. Since taking office in March, Jan\u0161a has attacked the investigative journalist Bla\u017e Zgaga, who criticised some government measures taken over coronavirus as unlawful. An official government account retweeted a claim that the journalist was an \u201cescaped psychiatric patient\u201d and said he was suffering from \u201cCovid-Marx/Lenin\u201d. Zgaga said the attacks had led to a wave of hate mail and threats. \u201cI have been under police protection before, I have been smeared before, but I have never experienced anything like this,\u201d he said. A consortium of press freedom associations, including Reporters without Borders, wrote an an open letter to V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the EU commission\u2019s vice-president for values and transparency, calling on her to take up the matter with the Slovenian government.

Then there is the rise in people needing food banks and in cases of domestic violence \u2013 both predictable results of lockdown. For those working at home with a secure income and a garden, it is much easier.</p> <p>Governments, careless of the contrasts between rich and poor, always want us to believe \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d. In the wake of the 2007-8 financial crisis we didn\u2019t buy it: we remained strongly aware of divided interests and circumstances. However, this time, despite the stark differences in people\u2019s experience, there is a strong feeling that we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\">really are in it together</a>. As with other great challenges, most notably the second world war, the present crisis has given rise to more neighbourliness, sociability and a desire to take care of each other.</p> <p>It may not yet be more than skin deep, but our society has begun to change. Street by street, up and down the country, schemes have been set up that are creating more cohesive communities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">WhatsApp groups</a>, set up to identify and provide support for the vulnerable, have brought neighbours together to help each other out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People seem to have become friendlier. Out exercising, they stop to talk as they rarely did before. Even class differences seem less of a barrier as we have become more aware of what really are, and are not, \u201cessential jobs\u201d. People obviously take pleasure in this newfound sociability \u2013 and it\u2019s not just sentiment: the appeal for 250,000 voluntary helpers to support the NHS and the vulnerable was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/a-million-volunteer-to-help-nhs-and-others-during-covid-19-lockdown\">oversubscribed several times over</a>.</p> <p>Nor has the government remained immune from this spirit. To support people who have lost earnings, it suddenly assumed responsibility for paying the wages of a large part of the labour force. Elsewhere, policy has undergone a complete volte face. The 2025 target for ending homelessness suddenly became an instruction to local authorities to house rough sleepers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">\u201cby the weekend\u201d</a>. And where previous governments have failed to tackle suicides and violent deaths in prisons, the government is planning to release <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">4,000 prisoners</a> early to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Similarly, despite having ignored the growth in food bank use, the government now has a scheme to deliver food parcels to the vulnerable.</p> <p>The point is not to suggest that the results of the pandemic are somehow balanced between good and bad. It is simply to recognise that, alongside the pain and damage, there has also been an increase in social cohesion, friendliness and mutual support. Although the gaps on supermarket shelves suggest there has been antisocial stockpiling, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000h7st\">a study of 30,000 people\u2019s purchases </a>showed stockpiling was rare: only about 6% of people hoarded hand sanitiser and 3% dry pasta. The problem was mainly that most of us bought just a little more<strong>.</strong></p> <p>To people like ourselves, immersed in research on the effects of reduced income differences between rich and poor, the increase in sociability looks familiar. Numerous studies show that community life is stronger in more equal societies. People become more public spirited, they trust each other more, are less out for themselves and more aware of the common good. They are more likely to help each other out, including elderly people, disabled people and those with mental illness. And instead of just looking socially upwards to the highest paid and down on the lowest, smaller income differences make it easier to see the real value of what people do. It is as if greater equality changes human nature.</p> <p>While some of what we have seen during the Covid-19 crisis seems to echo the social benefits enjoyed by more equal countries, greater equality is not the explanation: income differences in the UK are likely to have widened rather than narrowed during the crisis, as the low-paid lose sources of income while higher-earners who work at home continue to draw salaries. But other things can also make us feel we are all in it together. </p> <p>Just as income inequalities and social class differences are divisive and give rise to opposed interests and perspectives, being in the same predicament creates unity and shared interests.

      "bodyText": "For those who are cooped up in a flat at the moment with a baby and no garden, worrying about getting the government\u2019s 80% income replacement after losing your job, the lockdown must be almost intolerable. Then there is the rise in people needing food banks and in cases of domestic violence \u2013 both predictable results of lockdown. For those working at home with a secure income and a garden, it is much easier. Governments, careless of the contrasts between rich and poor, always want us to believe \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d. In the wake of the 2007-8 financial crisis we didn\u2019t buy it: we remained strongly aware of divided interests and circumstances. However, this time, despite the stark differences in people\u2019s experience, there is a strong feeling that we really are in it together. As with other great challenges, most notably the second world war, the present crisis has given rise to more neighbourliness, sociability and a desire to take care of each other. It may not yet be more than skin deep, but our society has begun to change. Street by street, up and down the country, schemes have been set up that are creating more cohesive communities. WhatsApp groups, set up to identify and provide support for the vulnerable, have brought neighbours together to help each other out. People seem to have become friendlier. Out exercising, they stop to talk as they rarely did before. Even class differences seem less of a barrier as we have become more aware of what really are, and are not, \u201cessential jobs\u201d. People obviously take pleasure in this newfound sociability \u2013 and it\u2019s not just sentiment: the appeal for 250,000 voluntary helpers to support the NHS and the vulnerable was oversubscribed several times over. Nor has the government remained immune from this spirit. To support people who have lost earnings, it suddenly assumed responsibility for paying the wages of a large part of the labour force. Elsewhere, policy has undergone a complete volte face. The 2025 target for ending homelessness suddenly became an instruction to local authorities to house rough sleepers \u201cby the weekend\u201d. And where previous governments have failed to tackle suicides and violent deaths in prisons, the government is planning to release 4,000 prisoners early to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Similarly, despite having ignored the growth in food bank use, the government now has a scheme to deliver food parcels to the vulnerable. The point is not to suggest that the results of the pandemic are somehow balanced between good and bad. It is simply to recognise that, alongside the pain and damage, there has also been an increase in social cohesion, friendliness and mutual support. Although the gaps on supermarket shelves suggest there has been antisocial stockpiling, a study of 30,000 people\u2019s purchases showed stockpiling was rare: only about 6% of people hoarded hand sanitiser and 3% dry pasta. The problem was mainly that most of us bought just a little more. To people like ourselves, immersed in research on the effects of reduced income differences between rich and poor, the increase in sociability looks familiar. Numerous studies show that community life is stronger in more equal societies. People become more public spirited, they trust each other more, are less out for themselves and more aware of the common good. They are more likely to help each other out, including elderly people, disabled people and those with mental illness. And instead of just looking socially upwards to the highest paid and down on the lowest, smaller income differences make it easier to see the real value of what people do. It is as if greater equality changes human nature. While some of what we have seen during the Covid-19 crisis seems to echo the social benefits enjoyed by more equal countries, greater equality is not the explanation: income differences in the UK are likely to have widened rather than narrowed during the crisis, as the low-paid lose sources of income while higher-earners who work at home continue to draw salaries. But other things can also make us feel we are all in it together. Just as income inequalities and social class differences are divisive and give rise to opposed interests and perspectives, being in the same predicament creates unity and shared interests. Hence the pandemic has brought us together in the same way that research shows greater equality does. Both make us feel we have more in common. Because greater equality is so enabling, it has been used to get people to pull together in difficult circumstances. In his 1958 essay on War and Social Policy, the pioneering researcher Richard Titmuss said that because \u201cthe cooperation of the masses was \u2026 essential [to the war effort], inequalities had to be reduced and the pyramid of social stratification \u2026 flattened\u201d. Egalitarian policies were therefore implemented to make people feel the burden of war was fairly shared. Income differences were reduced by taxation, essentials were subsidised, luxuries taxed and food and clothing were rationed. Another quite different example comes from the explorer Ernest Shackleton. During his exploration of Antarctica he \u201cloosened some traditional hierarchies to promote camaraderie\u201d, and distributed \u201cthe ship\u2019s chores equally among officers, scientists, and seamen\u201d. When we eventually emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, governments will still be faced with the climate crisis \u2013 putting us on the same planet, if not in the same boat together. But here too, inequality is a problem. International agreements are stymied between high- and low-income countries \u2013 one with primary responsibility for carbon emissions and the other in greater need of development. Given that the environmental footprint of the rich is massively larger than that of the poor, inequality also matters within countries \u2013 see the gilets jaunes opposition to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s fuel tax. In our 2009 book The Spirit Level, we demonstrated that greater equality not only improves social relations and wellbeing while reducing health and social problems, it also helps countries do better environmentally \u2013 leading to lower carbon emissions per $1 of GNP, more recycling, and business leaders increasingly engaged with environmental issues. Because the huge rise in inequality under Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s has not been reversed, Britain has become a more anti-social society. But for that, we would now be in better shape to face the Covid-19 pandemic and to transition to sustainability. Forced by the pandemic, the government has at last put human wellbeing before economic growth, and the Covid-19 crisis has reminded us all that we can be a more sociable and caring society, that we enjoy it and it makes society stronger.

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has extended the country\u2019s state emergency until the end of the month, amid warnings that relaxing physical distancing advice too soon could flood already crowded hospitals with coronavirus patients. Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures on 7 April, enabling local governors to request that people avoid unnecessary trips outside and that non-essential businesses close. The measures have since been expanded nationwide, but they are far less restrictive than those introduced in the US and parts of Europe, with no fines or other penalties for those who do not comply. The restrictions were due to end on Wednesday \u2013 the end of a series of public holidays known as Golden Week \u2013 but Abe said at a press conference on Monday they would remain in place in all regions until 31 May. He called on people to adopt \u201cnew lifestyles\u201d based around physical distancing, adding that the extension was \u201cdesigned for us to prepare for the next step and put an end to the state of emergency\u201d. His decision came after after government experts had warned that the number of new infections had not fallen enough to warrant a relaxation of social distancing measures, adding that a second wave of cases could put intolerable pressure on hospitals. The government is expected to urge residents in 13 high-risk prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka, to continue cutting person-to-person contact by 80% and exercise other strict social distancing measures. In prefectures that have recorded relatively few cases, restrictions on business operations and small gatherings will be relaxed, but residents will still be asked not to travel outside their home regions. Bars and nightclubs will be asked to remain shut. Museums, libraries, parks and other facilities are likely to be allowed to reopen provided preventive measures are in place. Local leaders have voiced concern that infections could spread if people stop practising physical distancing and start moving around again. The number of people to have contracted coronavirus in Japan stood at 15,789 on Sunday, according to the public broadcaster NHK, with 549 deaths. The figures include 712 infections and 13 deaths linked to the Diamond Princess cruise liner, which was quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo, in February. The number of daily cases in Tokyo appears to have stabilised since a peak of 201 on 17 April. Japan, though, has been criticised for conducting a comparatively low number of Covid-19 tests \u2013 1.3 per 1,000 people, compared with 12 in South Korea and 18 in the US, according to figures compiled by Our World in Data. It has generally been testing only those showing consistent symptoms of the virus in an attempt to relieve pressure on hospitals, but that approach has made it more difficult to identify, trace and isolate people who may be asymptomatic or who are displaying only mild symptoms. The Golden Week holidays have given an indication of how seriously Tokyoites are taking requests to voluntarily reduce contact with other people. While some central parts of the capital have been almost empty, suburban shopping areas, parks and out-of-town beaches are still busy. Some pachinko parlours have remained open, despite local authorities\u2019 threats to name them publicly. According to a recent survey by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, three-quarters of Japanese said they were going out less than usual, but only just over half felt they were reaching Abe\u2019s target of reducing contact with other people by 80%. \u201cThe message coming from the government is rather mild, apparently trying to convey the need to stay home while prioritising the economy,\u201d said Naoya Sekiya, a professor at Tokyo University who specialises in social psychology and risk communications. \u201cSince people lack a shared sense of crisis, instead of staying home they\u2019re hoping for the best and assuming they won\u2019t get infected.\u201d Concern is mounting about the damage the outbreak is inflicting on the world\u2019s third-biggest economy, which was heading for recession even before the crisis. Foreign tourism, a key component of Abe\u2019s economic policy, has plummeted by as much as 90%, while the virus\u2019s global spread has forced the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.",

\n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Covidsafe app legislation released</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has released draft legislation that will put in place privacy protections for the Covidsafe tracing app. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe draft bill I have released today will enshrine these protections in primary legislation and gives Australians confidence to download Covidsafe, continue the fight against Covid-19 and get our nation back to business as usual,\u201d said the attorney general <strong>Christian Porter</strong>. </p> \n  <p>He said the bill would put in place a \u201cclear process showing how the government would delete all Covidsafe data from the National Covidsafe Data Store once the pandemic is over\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the final step of our \u2018triple lock\u2019 of privacy protections, this draft bill will build upon the Biosecurity Determination and agreements with the states and territories to comprehensively guarantee that Australians\u2019 data is in safe hands when they download and use Covidsafe.</p> \n   <p>The draft bill clarifies the enforcement mechanisms for the penalties that are already in place against misuse of data from the Covidsafe app. Criminal offences under the bill can be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. </p> \n   <p>Individuals can also have their complaints heard by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner or the relevant state or territory privacy regulator if appropriate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More than 4 million people have now registered to use the app. </p> \n  <p>The legislation, <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Pages/COVIDSafelegislation.aspx\">which can be viewed here</a>, will be introduced in parliament on Wednesday. </p> \n  <p>The government says the legislation will \u201creinforce\u201d an earlier Biosecurity Act determination made by the health minister Greg Hunt that made it a criminal offence to collect, use or disclose Covidsafe app data for a purpose that is not related to contact tracing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

      "bodyText": "That concludes our coverage for the day. Thanks for reading. Stay safe. Kristy McBain has been confirmed as Labor\u2019s candidate for the upcoming by-election in Eden-Monaro. The contest was triggered by Mike Kelly\u2019s resignation. You can read my colleague Katharine Murphy\u2019s story on that news here. In a statement, the Bega Valley Shire mayor said tonight: I\u2019m honoured to be endorsed as the Labor candidate for the upcoming Eden-Monaro by-election. The last six months have been a tough time for communities right across Eden-Monaro, and people feel like they\u2019ve been forgotten. Our experience of the drought, the devastating bushfires and now Coronavirus has made me more determined than ever to stand up for our community. I was here during the bushfires. I saw the devastation first-hand. I saw how much being here mattered, I saw how much leadership matters \u2013 and how much national leadership matters. I was so proud of the people of our region and how they responded to such a huge threat and such terrible tragedy. I love these people and want to keep working for them, in the same way Mike Kelly worked tirelessly to deliver for the area. Our community can\u2019t be forgotten again \u2013 we need a strong voice in Federal Parliament. I want to be that voice. NSW state transport minister Andrew Constance and former Liberal senator Jim Molan are expected to contest preselection for the Liberal party. Let\u2019s wrap up some of the main developments of the day. The NZ PM Jacinda Ardern will join Australia\u2019s national cabinet meeting tomorrow The government released legislation for its Covidsafe tracing app Victoria recorded a spike in active cases following the emergence of a cluster at a meat processing facility in Melbourne A 15th person died at the Newmarch House nursing home in Sydney My colleagues Paul Karp and Josh Taylor are flipping through the Covidsafe app legislation now. This might derail the NRL\u2019s plans to restart the league on May 28. The government has released draft legislation that will put in place privacy protections for the Covidsafe tracing app. \u201cThe draft bill I have released today will enshrine these protections in primary legislation and gives Australians confidence to download Covidsafe, continue the fight against Covid-19 and get our nation back to business as usual,\u201d said the attorney general Christian Porter. He said the bill would put in place a \u201cclear process showing how the government would delete all Covidsafe data from the National Covidsafe Data Store once the pandemic is over\u201d. As the final step of our \u2018triple lock\u2019 of privacy protections, this draft bill will build upon the Biosecurity Determination and agreements with the states and territories to comprehensively guarantee that Australians\u2019 data is in safe hands when they download and use Covidsafe. The draft bill clarifies the enforcement mechanisms for the penalties that are already in place against misuse of data from the Covidsafe app. Criminal offences under the bill can be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. Individuals can also have their complaints heard by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner or the relevant state or territory privacy regulator if appropriate. More than 4 million people have now registered to use the app. The legislation, which can be viewed here, will be introduced in parliament on Wednesday. The government says the legislation will \u201creinforce\u201d an earlier Biosecurity Act determination made by the health minister Greg Hunt that made it a criminal offence to collect, use or disclose Covidsafe app data for a purpose that is not related to contact tracing. The federal sports minister, Richard Colbeck, was on Melbourne radio station 3AW earlier today, where he said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule out\u201d the possibility of the AFL grand final being played in front of a crowd. \u201cI\u2019d love to see that,\u201d Colbeck said, though he described it as \u201cless than a 50-50 chance\u201d, according to 3AW. The Victorian meat processing company where a cluster of Covid-19 cases has been confirmed insists its products remain safe to eat. The Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the facility began moving towards a shutdown when the outbreak was identified and is now closed, AAP reported. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk to the general community and it\u2019s not going to get out of control,\u201d he told reporters on Monday. The factory could not close immediately because of animal welfare issues, he said. The bulk of workers who tested positive over the weekend were asymptomatic and were in quarantine before receiving the result. Cedar Meats general manager Tony Kairouz said the company found out a staff member had Covid-19, after being admitted to Sunshine hospital for an unrelated matter on 27 April. Two days later, the company found out that four staff who worked in one area of the plant had the virus. All 350 onsite staff were tested for Covid-19 by 1 May. \u201cFor the past few days our focus has been 100 per cent inward - on closing down the processing side of our business, taking care of staff and animal welfare,\u201d Kairouz said in a statement on Monday. The company had not tried to hide the outbreak, he added. He told Melbourne radio 3AW earlier in the day that all the meat processed was in line with Australian food safety standards. The health department is working with the company, which has agreed to close its facility for 14 days and undergo a deep clean.. Sports-loving South Australians have been told to be patient, with a decision on relaxing restrictions on training expected by the week\u2019s end. Health chief medical officer Nicola Spurrier says although local training is not off the cards, South Australians need to wait until Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting for more information, AAP reports. \u201cYou need to be patient because we have one chance at this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more damaging to lift things too quickly and then have to shut things down again. \u201cWorking through all the ways to reduce the risk of transmission when people participate [in sport] and train is important.\u201d Premier Steven Marshall said the SANFL was in a good position to begin the season because it did not require players to travel interstate. \u201cWe\u2019d all like to see sports resume in SA,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetitions like the SANFL don\u2019t have games interstate so they can get back to training as soon as it\u2019s allowed.\u201d It comes as the state recorded its 12th consecutive day of no reported coronavirus cases, with the total remaining at 438. My colleague Paul Karp has been looking at the submissions to the so-called \u2018sports rorts\u2019 Senate inquiry, including the suggestion that the program could be saved from constitutional challenge by being rebadged as a coronavirus stimulus scheme. In case you doubted the authenticity of the text messages that many of you will have received today urging you to download the Covidsafe app. Thanks to Ben Smee for his efforts before the tea break. If you want to get in touch, you can email me at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. Thanks for the past two hours, I\u2019m passing the blog to Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will see you through to stumps. Go well. It has taken Labor\u2019s Stephen Jones several nanoseconds to bring up Liberal Eden-Monaro candidate Andrew Constance\u2019s comments about Scott Morrison earlier this year: that the PM \u201cgot the welcome he deserved\u201d during the bushfire emergency earlier this year. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee the pair will campaign shoulder-to-shoulder, or that there will even be a physical campaign, in Eden-Monaro. But expect to see that clip played about 2bn times between now and the byelection. Chief nursing officer, Alison McMillan, on the potential to allow international travel between Australia and New Zealand: Both countries are comparable in what we\u2019ve seen in our ability to prevent ... transmission. These discussions are preliminary and we would expect to see ongoing sustained reduction of the spread in both countries. My understanding is these negotiations are very early and we\u2019d need to consider them very carefully. A little smirk here from Zed, upon being told Andrew Constance has got the Eden-Monaro gig. And just as that last bit of news about Andrew Constance seeps through, Liberal senator Zed Seselja is live on the ABC being asked about the by-election. Zed tells Patricia Karvelas: \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t want to do is dictate to the NSW Liberal party who they should preselect.\u201d And the Liberals have picked Andrew Constance, the NSW transport minister for Eden-Monaro. Fascinating contest. Breaking. Labor preselects candidate Labor was expected to preselect. AAP has an interesting new report about potential legal action for anyone who booked travel and has been asked to take a voucher, rather than a refund. This follows some great work from my colleague, Christopher Knaus, on the subject. AAP reports: Australians whose travel plans were cancelled due to coronavirus and offered a voucher instead of a refund could join a legal fight. Tens of thousands of travellers have been short-changed by airlines, travel agents and tour companies, a lawyer says. Lawyer Andrew Paull said major travel industry players may have breached their legal obligations by putting in place travel voucher schemes amid the pandemic. \u201cWhat we have found is disappointingly, some of Australia\u2019s biggest travel companies, including Qantas and Jetstar, have been forcing their customers into taking severely restricted travel vouchers when those people are entitled by law to a full cash refund.\u201d The SA Premier, Steven Marshall, is the latest to the podium to provide a coronavirus update. South Australia has now had 12 days of no new cases, with just seven active cases remaining in the state. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the boffins at Liberal party headquarters created a meme that would save the Australian people and restore freedom to the galaxy Somehow I don\u2019t think this one (from a year ago today) is getting recycled this May the Fourth... The Australian chief nursing officer Alison McMillan is giving us the daily coronavirus update from Canberra. Here are the highlights: 4.5 million people have downloaded the CovidSafe app There are 6,825 coronavirus cases 95 people have died 28 people remain in intensive care Good afternoon! Ben Smee here, keeping you company from a sunny (but slightly cold) Brisbane for the next couple of hours. I\u2019m certainly no Amy Remeikis, who has put in another stellar shift, but at the very least hoping to get you through to knock off time without major incident. We are about to get a national update on the Covid situation, and I will leave you with Ben Smee for that. I\u2019ll be back early tomorrow \u2013 thank you again for joining me \u2013 and take care of you. Labor is calling for the aged care royal commission to investigate the Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House. The calls from opposition aged care spokeswoman Julie Collins come as the western Sydney facility recorded its 15th death on Monday afternoon, less than a month after a part-time care worker at the home was diagnosed with coronavirus on 11 April. Collins said: The residents of Newmarch House and their loved ones, and the staff at the facility, deserve answers about what has gone wrong. The royal commission has the necessary investigative powers to get to the bottom of what has happened, with concerning reports of infection control failures at Newmarch House. While the royal commission is rightly looking at aged care and Covid-19 more generally, a deeper investigation into what happened at this facility is warranted. All Australians must be assured we have the very best infection control practises in aged care. There are now 63 confirmed cases among staff and residents at Newmarch House, with a surge medical workforce operating a \u201cmini-hospital\u201d in the facility, according to the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck. On Saturday, the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, announced that a further infection control review of Newmarch launched after a wave of infections last week had shown breaches of safety protocol \u201camongst particularly the staff\u201d. As a result of that review, workers at Newmarch House will now be subject to daily coronavirus testing. A reminder that it is illegal for a business (or anyone, really) to deny you service or entry if you do not have the app. It does not stop you from getting Covid-19. It does not alert you to Covid-19 in your area. It helps authorities with contact tracing in the event of a positive diagnosis. This is not going anywhere soon, either. The latest Newmarch house death brings Australia\u2019s death toll to 96. Jacinda Ardern says NZ is interested to hear about Australia\u2019s work with the Covid tracing app \u2013 but that NZ is not relying on it as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d. But don\u2019t start dreaming of a New Zealand ski season just yet. Jacinda Ardern: I want to moderate expectations. The fact that we are in a position to have this conversation is a huge advantage to both of us. In terms of opening up further travel, Ardern says: At the moment we are focused on Australia but, it is fair to say, there would be, obviously, a special advantage for Pacific Islanders, but that\u2019s a conversation we need to have directly with them. There is huge risk if Covid-19 finds its way to Pacific Island nations untouched by Covid-19. I would want us to act cautiously and in unison with the leaders of those countries. Jacinda Ardern says her attendance at the Australian national cabinet tomorrow (via teleconference, which is how the leaders are meeting) is, to her knowledge, the first time something like this has occurred. Australian prime ministers have sat in on NZ cabinet meetings, but Ardern says this is an \u201cunprecedented gathering\u201d. New Zealand has been big on the concept of \u201cbubbles\u201d since it went into lockdown. In terms of this one \u2013 the trans-Tasman travel bubble \u2013 she doesn\u2019t expect it to be in the \u201cvery, very near future\u201d but sees \u201ca lot of opportunity\u201d. Ardern says there are a lot of advantages for New Zealand in a trans-Tasman travel line opening up \u2013 not just in terms of domestic tourism, but also business and trade and visits between family. But she is not talking weeks here. She doesn\u2019t expect this to happen for quite some time. Anglicare has confirmed the death of a 15th resident at its Newmarch aged care facility in Kingswood, western Sydney. From its statement: The person had no immediate family and was well cared for by the dedicated staff of Newmarch House. On behalf of our resident, we grieve for his death and we value that he was part of our Anglicare family while we cared for them. His passing highlights how terrible this virus is and how devastating it is for the elderly in our community. The impact of Covid-19 on older people is increasingly evident in Australia and internationally and this is extremely distressing for other residents, their families and members of the wider community. Anglicare appreciates the support of the commonwealth government in assisting us to source an infection control specialist who is currently onsite this week, monitoring and reviewing all current contamination and infection control procedures. We also appreciate government support in implementing the family support program, which will enable registered nurses to communicate regularly to families about their loved ones. Jacinda Ardern says next Monday, New Zealand will look at whether it can relax restrictions even further. It is Labour Day in Queensland, but of course there is no march. So, instead, union members are showing their support on their driveways and fences. Just a reminder \u2013 parliament is back next week, for a regular (non-Covid) sitting, where we will get a statement on the state of the budget. Also watch out to see what is tabled \u2013 don\u2019t be surprised if you see the unredacted royal commission into childhood abuse report in terms of the investigation into how George Pell handled abuse claims, released to the parliament after the Victorian authorities cleared it. And Josh Frydenberg will be the National Press Club\u2019s guest this Wednesday. Centrelink will soon stop backpaying jobseeker payment claims to a recipient\u2019s first contact with the agency, unwinding a policy change that eased access to welfare for the newly unemployed during the Covid-19 pandemic. From 8 May, the government will remove the \u201cintent to claim\u201d provisions that allow people claiming a Centrelink payment to be paid from the date they register with the agency, rather than from when they complete their application. The provision had been scrapped as part of budget savings in 2018 but was reintroduced in late March as Centrelink was swamped with a deluge of new jobseeker payment claims. The government insists the change was also temporary and that Centrelink claimants had been informed of the 8 May deadline. A spokesman for the government services minister, Stuart Robert, said: Services Australia has gone to significant lengths to directly contact all customers who lodged an intention to claim, either via phone, SMS, myGov letters or a combination, to ensure they knew how to complete their claim and to notify them of the 8 May deadline. Services Australia made more than 800,000 outbound calls to people who registered an intention to claim last month, and sent more than 1.2m MyGov messages, which noted the 8 May deadline. The ACT can\u2019t claim to be completely Covid free any longer \u2013 a returned traveller has tested positive for the virus. They all seem very polite? On the question of research Australian and international researchers have and are doing on bats, the science minister, Karen Andrews, says: What I can say is that currently there is no research being undertaken at the facility in July that has bats involved. But it also is very important for us to note that 75% of viruses do come from animals and bats are certainly one of the sources of that. And the classic example is the Hendra virus, which went from bats to horses to humans. So you cannot criticise it as a standalone batch of research, you actually have to look at it in context. And it\u2019s very important that we make sure that we have in place all of the tools that we can to make sure that we are doing the research properly and managing the risks. Karen Andrews says: Until we have a vaccine, life is not going to return to normal. So whilst we have seen easing of restrictions, particularly over the last weekend, we still have a long way to go and it\u2019s important that we all take baby steps. Karen Andrews says the CSIRO is testing two vaccines - one from the US and one from the UK. But she adds that it is at least 10 months away \u2013 at the very least \u2013 before there is reasonably a chance of a vaccine being made available. Of course they\u2019ll keep in touch. That\u2019s their job. This is the worst timeline\u2019s Tarantino films come to life I mean ... do we want to be a nation of stormtroopers? The Morrison government will consider whether \u201cpolicy adjustments\u201d are required when it begins reviewing its free childcare package this week. We asked the education minister, Dan Tehan, to shed light on what aspects he was looking at fixing. In a written response today, he said the government continued to engage with peak bodies across the childcare sector to resolve issues as they arise. A review of the package is currently being undertaken and will consider the extent to which the objectives of the package are being achieved and whether policy adjustments are required. As it stands, the overhaul of childcare funding is budgeted to remain in effect until late June, but the government was always planning to review how it was operating one month in. The shakeup has led to complaints from some families that they have struggled to access care for their children, while there have been a range of cases of services warning of funding shortfalls, including in the family daycare sector. Tehan defended the package, saying it had been put in place quickly because services had been experiencing mass withdrawals that threatened their ability to provide care and continuity of education. He said that as of 23 April, 96% of all childcare subsidy-approved services had kept their doors open. The minister pointed to several recent announcements, including Friday\u2019s move to expand eligibility for additional supplementary payments for providers not eligible for the jobkeeper wage subsidy. The Greens senator Dr Mehreen Faruqi has responded to that issue Paul just told you about: The government is bending over backwards to deny universities access to the jobkeeper wage subsidy. This is farcical and sinister stuff. Universities have been dealing with huge uncertainties for months now. Constantly shifting the goalposts is not only enormously unfair to them in this crisis, but reveals the Liberals\u2019 malice towards higher education. The clear intent to lock universities out of jobkeeper can only be explained by the Liberals\u2019 ongoing hostility to higher education and their commitment to starve universities of funding. The government is fully aware that up to 30,000 university jobs are on the line, but they just don\u2019t seem to care. In addition to jobkeeper, the government must back universities through a new package which would massively boost funding, save jobs and improve universities for staff and students. The Australian government\u2019s chief nursing and midwifery officer, Alison McMillan, will be giving today\u2019s national Covid-19 update. That will be at 3.30pm. University of Sydney vice-chancellor Michael Spence has complained to staff that the government has moved the goalposts for the $130bn jobkeeper program, making it ineligible for wage subsidies. In an all-staff email, Spence wrote: Late on Friday the government amended the criteria for universities to qualify for jobkeeper. For all organisations [with a turnover of $1bn or more] there is a one-month period in which they must be able to demonstrate a revenue loss of more than 50% when compared with the same period last year, to be eligible. We made our application on the basis of the significant loss of revenue from student suspensions and withdrawals in March for semester 1. The government has changed this rule for universities and extended the period in which to demonstrate revenue loss to a six-month period in order to qualify. This means we will no longer be eligible to receive jobkeeper funding. Spence reassured staff that anyone who was paid a top-up in anticipation of receiving jobkeeper funding would keep the payment. The Transport Workers Union is lobbying the government over an exclusion to the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy program. Apparently, the scheme does not allow companies owned by foreign governments to access the program, and this is particularly problematic in the aviation sector. Dnata, owned by the Emirates Group and which carries out 90% of catering needs of airlines in Australia, has told its 5,500 workers in Australia that they will not receive jobkeeper. For workers, that will mean the difference between a $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy and the less generous $1,100 fortnightly jobseeker payment. Michael Kaine, the TWU national secretary said: This is a devastating blow for thousands of workers in Australia who have been assuming up to now that their jobs were secure and their income was certain because of the jobkeeper payment. We are writing to the treasurer today to urgently examine this loophole and its unintended consequences. There are specific cases, such as the Emirates Group, where foreign governments still retain a big stake in their aviation sectors which now employ many workers in Australians. We are hopeful the Government can recognise this situation and rectify it ... \u201cNot only will this hurt workers in Australia it will also hamper efforts to get air travel back up and running when restrictions lift, impacting on our economy. Companies like Dnata carry out behind the scenes work at our airport which gets airlines into the sky. Their work is vital and thousands depend on it.\u201d Dan Tehan is playing it safe today, responding to Queensland\u2019s school opening announcement (for on-site learning) in a written statement (no chance for personal frustrations to slip in, that way). He said: Today\u2019s announcement that Queensland students will return to classroom learning is fantastic news for students, teachers, parents and principals. It is particularly good news for vulnerable, poor, remote and Indigenous students because they are the ones whose education suffers the most from remote learning. Our government has taken a consistent position to follow the expert medical advice and the expert medical advice has been consistent that schools are safe for students and teachers with the right protocols in place. Queensland has developed a plan that will see all year levels return to the classroom over a period of time and sets out sensible arrangements for students, teachers and parents to enable this to happen. Government services minister Stuart Robert says 4.44 million people have now downloaded the Covidsafe contact tracing app, but it\u2019s not yet being used by health officials. That is because the states and territories need to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the federal government essentially promising to use the data only for its intended purpose, as will be enshrined in the legislation to be introduced into parliament. Robert told 2GB\u2019s Ray Hadley it was a \u201cmatter of days\u201d until the app was fully operational: The back end is how state health officials access data. And as part of the triple privacy lock, we\u2019re legislating on the 12th of May, when parliament goes back. There is biosecurity advice that has gone in by the health minister, that\u2019s the second lock. And the third lock is the states\u2019 MoU with the commonwealth, which outlines T&amp;Cs by how they\u2019ll use the data.\u201d In the meantime, the app was still collecting the data for when it was needed, he said. It is going as fast as humanly possible and remember, the app\u2019s still operating in the background \u2013 it\u2019s doing the job. This is just access of state of health officials to augment the manual process. On other outstanding issues to do with the app, Robert\u2019s office told Guardian Australia that the source code for the app would be released \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, subject to advice. We understand, in the Australian community, there is great interest in the functionality of the Covidsafe app and the Australian government intends to release the source code in coming weeks, subject to final advice from cyber security agencies. There\u2019s no timeline on when the Google-Apple API might be implemented to fix issues with the iPhone version of the app, but Robert\u2019s office insists the app can be run in the background on iPhones and still operate, despite independent researchers suggesting it cannot work that way. This tweet, from our former foreign affairs minister and man in London, continues to age well: Get used to these figures: New Zealand is in stage-three lock downs (what Australia has now). If the situation in both countries continues \u2013 in terms of low case numbers \u2013 trans-Tasman travel is on the agenda. That will just take a tad bit longer. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to people \u2013 and you should expect it to continue, despite state government\u2019s best efforts to boost construction. From AAP: Home building approvals dipped by 4% in March as the nation braced for impact from the coronavirus pandemic and adjusted to social-distancing restrictions. Units and homes other than houses had the biggest fall, dropping 8.2% to 6,538, according to seasonally adjusted data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. There was a 1.2% drop in houses built to 8,520. There were 15,279 homes built in total. It\u2019s been a busy 12 hours for Scott Morrison Just further to that post comes this news from Katharine Murphy: New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern will join tomorrow\u2019s national cabinet meeting to discuss the Covid-19 response and the Australian Covidsafe app. So for everyone wondering when the roadmap for lifting restrictions coming, you\u2019ll have a much better idea on Friday. That\u2019s when the national cabinet will meet to discuss how to lift the restrictions, in terms of winding them back. \u201cTasmania will continue to march to the beat of its own drum\u201d on this, Peter Gutwein says. \u201cWe have an older and more vulnerable population.\u201d He says that from next Friday, he expects to be able to start talking about how to lift restrictions. All existing restrictions will remain in place in Tasmania until at least 15 May (next Friday). Tasmania\u2019s stricter aged care rules will remain in place for another week, before the state starts to transition to what the rest of the nation has (visits where safe). On Friday Scott Morrison gave an update of the number of employers enrolled in the jobkeeper program, but didn\u2019t know how many employees are receiving the payment. A spokesman for the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Guardian Australia that as of midday Friday the figure was \u201c740,871 employers covering more than 4.4m employees\u201d. The $130bn wage subsidy program can cover up to six million employees, but Morrison gave some pretty big hints if it falls short of that the program won\u2019t be expanded. He said: And at this point it is too early to make estimates about what the final reconciliation would be against the budgeted amount. And there are many calls, there are many calls on the budget in relation to Covid-19 and we do see some movement between jobseeker and jobkeeper. Remember the jobseeker payments, that costing related to the additional payment and there is also the uplift in costs for the commonwealth in relation to many other welfare payments that are happening at the moment as well, what\u2019s called the automatic stabilisers. So I can assure you the commonwealth will be footing \u2013 that is, the commonwealth taxpayer \u2013 will be footing a very big bill and they understand that. And that\u2019s why every single element of that we are considering very carefully and we\u2019ve set the parameters for jobkeeper and for jobseeker and we have no plans to change that, apart from the administrative changes like the ones the treasurer announced last week.\u201d Over in Tasmania, Peter Gutwein is giving an update. He says that the north-west additional restrictions have now been lifted \u2013 but the others remain in place. The statewide rules remain in place \u2013 if you don\u2019t need to go out, don\u2019t. The education department will spend more than $60,000 on the helpline it has set up for parents looking for free childcare during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to contract records.The government has previously said it was setting up a helpline \u2013 1800 291 041 \u2013 to give families advice on services that have capacity in their local area, including centre-based daycare, family daycare, outside school hours care and vacation care. A contract notice published on the AusTender website shows the department is set to provide $61,526 to the Australian Children\u2019s Education and Care Quality Authority to run the helpline. The contract is due to run for about six months. It follows reports of families having problems accessing the care they need, as some services impose limits on attendance due to the limited funding currently available under the childcare relief package or because they miss out on the jobkeeper wage subsidy. Services are allowed to restrict attendance based on the funding they have at their disposal, but with priority given to the children of essential workers or from vulnerable home environments. We reported last week that the education department had emailed childcare providers to warn their funding could be cancelled if they were found to be excessively limiting their capacity during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 a message that apparently didn\u2019t go down well with service operators, who say they have been struggling to make the numbers add up. The helpline for parents is separate from the education department line that is taking tips from parents and other childcare providers on services that may be suspected of artificially restricting capacity. The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll says of the 146 fines issued for ignoring physical distance rules on the weekend, included a group of people in their 20s who were having a party at an AirBnb home in Carrara twice (western Gold Coast). That resulted in $3,300 in fines. Signage is also going up at Burleigh Hill to stop people from gathering \u2013 but when people were asked to move away, they did. Oh \u2013 and I have had a few questions on this \u2013 if you are in Queensland and want to visit friends or family who live further than 50km away from you, you can. (As long as physical distancing is maintained.) The 50km travel radius is for recreation. Annastacia Palaszczuk says Queensland is looking at relaxing restrictions \u201cone step at a time\u201d. Cafes and restaurants are probably next. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a couple of steps, see how that goes,\u201d Palaszczuk says. The border restrictions will be reviewed \u201cevery month\u201d but \u201cat the moment there are no plans to change that\u201d because of community transmissions in NSW. Both Annastacia Palaszczuk and the Queensland education minister, Grace Grace have repeatedly mentioned that they have spoken to \u201call\u201d stakeholders when making the decision to reopen schools \u2013 which includes the Queensland Teachers\u2019 Union, which the LNP opposition and Peter Dutton accused of \u201cholding the state to ransom\u201d over schools. Palaszczuk says she has always listened to the health advice. \u201cI think everyone understands that we\u2019ve got to get the balance right. As I\u2019ve always said, I take the advice of Dr [Jeanette] Young and Dr Young is one of the most respected health medical officers in the nation. And if you\u2019re not listening to the experts, I don\u2019t know who you are listening to.\u201d People who are concerned about returning their children to school can continue remote learning, after speaking with their schools. So to recap, in Queensland: 11 May: Kindy students, prep students and years one, 11 and 12 students will return to on-site learning. 25 May: All other students (years two to 10) will return to school. The Queensland premier continues - on 25 May \u201cwe should, where practical, have all of our schools operating in Queensland\u201d. \u201cAnd of course, I say that with caution, because if there is any rise between now and May 25, we have to act cautiously.\u201d Annastacia Palaszczuk says to remember that \u201cevery state is different and every state has different levels of Covid-19 cases and they are at different stages., \u201cSo you can not compare different states together\u201d. Annastacia Palaszczuk says today (a public holiday in Queensland) is the day to talk about the \u201cback-to-school plan\u201d. \u201cThis has been an issue for a lot of people and I know it has been really tough on many parents at home, who have been juggling working and also juggling the balance of at home learning,\u201d she says. She says after \u201cextensive discussions\u201d from 11 May, kindy, prep and Year 11 and 12 will be going back to on-site learning. Meanwhile, if you get a chance, have a listen to the latest Full Story podcast: There have been some move to help temporary migrants who are stranded in Australia (and a reminder they still pay taxes), as Ben Doherty reported last week. The Refugee Council of Australia has written this open letter to the prime minister: We, the 186 organisations listed below, write to you to urgently address the gaps in the current Covid-19 responses and ensure that nobody is left behind. We welcome the Australian government\u2019s recognition of the needs within Australia and its action to minimise the health and economic impacts of the global pandemic. We need to ensure that all people in Australia are considered in Covid-19 policies and stimulus packages, especially the most vulnerable who currently are not able to access basic levels of support. Currently, there are highly vulnerable groups who have been left behind, including: \u2022 People seeking asylum on bridging visas. \u2022 Temporary visa holders including refugees, temporary migrant workers and international students. As Australia and the world suffers the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is clearer than ever that how we treat the most vulnerable in our society directly impacts the health and wellbeing of all of us. If anyone is left destitute, with no access to affordable medical help or unable to minimise the risk of catching the virus, all of us are at greater risk. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should access to a safety net or improved assistance during this time. We are in this together and there must be support for all who need it, regardless of visa status. You can find the whole letter here. Meanwhile, as AAP reports, new polling from refugee support group AMES Australia found more than two-thirds of migrants are worried about Covid-19 \u2013 a higher rate than other Australian residents. A separate YouGov poll found 57% of Australians were concerned. Nearly 70% of new migrants surveyed were worried about losing their job or being unable to pay rent or buy food, compared to just under half of Australian residents. Over on Sky News, minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure Alan Tudge said the government is not going to extend government support to people on temporary visas because it would cost an additional $20bn and the government wants to \u201cmaintain the expectation\u201d temporary visa holders should support themselves. He says those people who have lost their job and don\u2019t have family support in Australia are encouraged to go home. 13,000 tests in one day \u2013 Victoria\u2019s new record \u2013 is the biggest day of testing Australia has seen since the pandemic began. While Dan Andrews is speaking, the president of the royal Australian college of GPs is having to remind people that celebrities are not health experts. The college has also put out a factsheet on the Covidsafe app. Dan Andrews message in this press conference is \u2013 I\u2019m not thinking about Dan Tehan, but I am also quite happy for him to sit in the comments he made. Andrews says national cabinet continues to work well, and takes the advice of \u201cexperts\u201d \u2013 and is not letting \u201cpersonal frustrations\u201d get in the way of good decision-making. Andrews says other countries haven\u2019t had options available to them \u201cbecause it has just got away from them\u201d and he doesn\u2019t want to see Victoria go down that route. \u201cNaming it is not required for us to do our work,\u201d says professor Brett Sutton on why Victorian authorities are not naming the meat processing plant. He says schools are named because they are frequented by people that authorities can\u2019t immediately identify, unlike something like the meat works. The Victorian chief medical officer, professor Brett Sutton, says as soon as the meat processing plant cluster was identified, it was moved to essential workers only. He says there was not a risk to the public. Dan Andrews says the Australian public and Victorians do not need politicians fighting among themselves. \u201cWe have policy settings in place,\u201d he says. \u201cComments were made yesterday morning, a statement was issued, that was the end of the matter as far as I was concerned ... while they were out doing that, I tell you what we were doing \u2013 testing 13,000 people,\u201d Dan Andrews says of the \u201cancient history\u201d of Dan Tehan\u2019s comments on Insiders. He says he has not heard from Tehan, but is \u201cnot particularly worried\u201d about him either. Victoria\u2019s spike in cases (22 cases is a lot these days, and the biggest in Victoria in two weeks) can be put down to 19 cases at a meat processing plant. Daniel Andrews says it is a reminder of how quickly cases can add up. Some 56,000 people have come in to be tested since the tests were expanded Sunday week. Victorian premier Dan Andrews says the state recorded 22 cases from 13,000 tests yesterday, which is a great result. \u201cIf we follow the rules, if we stay the course, if we stay at home, then we will have options,\u201d he says. He then gives Dan Tehan a not-so-subtle nod by reminding people that \u201cjust because we might be personally frustrated\u201d it is no case to relaxing restrictions without evidence. Westpac has joined the list of big banks reporting profit slumps \u2013 the Westpac Banking Corporation says it anticipates a 70% drop in its first half cash profits to $993m. It\u2019s deferring its dividends. The bank has reported it has put 105,000 mortgage accounts on hold \u2013 that is $39bn in loans. Some 31,000 Australian business loans are also on hold \u2013 that\u2019s $8.2bn. Gladys Berejiklian said just one person in NSW had recorded positive for Covid-19 overnight but warned parents that case numbers would probably increase. She said schools would need to be closed for cleaning more frequently as they transitioned back to on-site learning: I anticipate it will happen more frequently but please have confidence we\u2019ve gone through the processes and we know what takes to keep everyone safe when this occurs. The deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth (who shares the jobs with Prof Paul Kelly) told the Nine network this morning there had been 12 new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. The national cabinet and its medical expert panel want to see a run of under-20 case days before getting serious about lifting restrictions. Here is his whole statement on that: After taking the weekend to contemplate a tilt for the seat of Eden Monaro, I have decided that I will not run as a candidate. In politics, ego can quickly skew decisions, and sometimes make you forget what is best for yourself, your family and what could be the best outcome for the people of Eden Monaro. I have always worked and strived for outcomes, not titles \u2013 making a difference, not just accepting the status quo, and in this time of self-contemplation, it is clear I can do more as NSW Deputy Premier, Leader of the NSW Nationals and as the Member for Monaro. My decision was difficult but at the heart of it, I love NSW, and the incredible job we have done so far and I want to be here to face the challenges ahead as we rebuild from drought, bushfires and COVID-19. I want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out, supported and encouraged me to go on this journey, but at the same time reaffirmed their support in whatever I decide. I especially want to thank Gladys Berejiklian for her gracious and gentle counsel, and my National Party colleagues who have supported me in every step of this decision making \u2013 I express my utmost gratitude. To the people of Eden Monaro, know that as the State Member I will continue to fight for you, regardless of boundaries, and as NSW Deputy Premier, I will continue to make our region the best it can be, for today and for our incredible tomorrow. The NSW deputy premier and Nationals leader, John Barilaro, has (officially) announced he won\u2019t be running for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro (yet). Not sure Australia will be thrilled at being namechecked here, to be honest. It\u2019s a long weekend in Queensland, which coincided with the relaxing of a few restrictions \u2013 people were allowed out to have picnics and go to the beach with members of their households, and travel 50km outside their home, which of course meant crowding on the beaches. Police issued 146 fines. Victoria is sticking to 11 May as its potential \u201cpivot\u201d day on restrictions, but it won\u2019t be going earlier. As AAP reports: Premier Daniel Andrew\u2019s cabinet has stood firm on their intentions to keep Victorians partially locked down. Whether this changes will heavily depend on how the fight against the pandemic moves forward this week. The state\u2019s testing blitz that aims to complete 100,000 tests before May 11 will help in making that decision. Victoria\u2019s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the more people were tested, the more the health department could know about the virus and how it spreads in the community. Anyone with even mild symptoms of coronavirus has been encouraged to get tested. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. A Sydney school has closed for intensive cleaning and contact tracing after a student tested positive to the coronavirus, AAP reports this morning. Warragamba public school will be \u201cnon-operational for on-site learning\u201d on Monday, with all students undertaking at home learning. Here are some of the key developments you might have missed yesterday: In the 24 hours up to Sunday afternoon 18 new cases were reported, pushing Australia\u2019s national total over 6,800. The national death toll from Covid-19 reached 95, after the death of an 83-year old in WA and a 76-year-old resident at the Anglicare-run nursing home, Newmarch House, in western Sydney. Some 4.25 million people have now registered for the CovidSafe app. A primary school in Melbourne will be closed for three days from Monday for cleaning and contact tracing after a teacher tested positive to Covid-19. The school\u2019s principal said the staff member was a music teacher who is experiencing mild symptoms and hasn\u2019t been in contact with students in person this year. Queensland police issued more than 30 infringement notices for breaches of coronavirus restrictions on the first day of easing such curbs that allowed residents to travel up to 50km from their home. South Australia recorded its 11th consecutive day of no new cases on Sunday, allowing the state government to give local councils the green light to reopen playgrounds and skate parks. The premier said he wanted to see regional tourism resume soon. We\u2019ll have rolling coverage of the day\u2019s events, as they happen. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

The attorney general, Christian Porter, has sought to allay privacy concerns about the app through release of the draft bill on Monday, as downloads of the app topped 4.5m. On Friday the national cabinet will meet to discuss easing Covid-19 related restrictions on economic and social life, which the federal government has repeatedly linked to Australians\u2019 willingness to download and use Covidsafe. On Monday it sent SMS messages suggesting the app will \u201chelp us to keep you safe and ease restrictions\u201d, and ministers have suggested community sport and professional football all hinge on its uptake. The Covidsafe app uses bluetooth to record the anonymised ID of anyone a user gets close to who also has the app. Users then consent to upload the information to a database accessible only to state and territory public health officials to determine who that person has contacted in the past 14 days in the event they are diagnosed with Covid-19. The draft legislation, which largely reproduces biosecurity orders designed to protect early users of the app before parliament returns on 12 May, creates a series of offences punishable by five years in prison, a $63,000 fine, or both for abuses of the data captured for any purpose other than authorised contact tracing. Uploading information without the users\u2019 consent; collection use or disclosure of the data except by public health authorities; and retaining data on a database outside Australia all attract the penalties. The bill would also make it an offence to require a person to download or use the app. Refusing to sell goods and services, discrimination in employment, or blocking entry to public premises because a person has not downloaded it would also be criminalised. On Friday Scott Morrison suggested that businesses, including cafes, would encourage their patrons to do so in a bid to restart the economy. In an attempt to allay privacy concerns the government has published a privacy impact assessment and indicated it will release the source code for the app, subject to the approval of the Australian Cyber Security Centre.

The bill states that it \u201ccancels the effect\u201d of any other law that might permit conduct that is otherwise prohibited. Downloads and use of the app are voluntary and the health minister, Greg Hunt, has suggested a target of 40% of the Australian population \u2013 or 10m downloads \u2013 would be considered a success. After health officials were unable to explain the basis of the target, the government has softened its language to merely suggest the more the better in terms of boosting Australia\u2019s capacity to trace close contacts of people diagnosed with Covid-19. On Wednesday the Covid-19 Senate committee inquiry will examine the Attorney General\u2019s Department, the Department of Health and the Digital Transformation Agency about Covidsafe.",

      "body": "<p>The final few snagging jobs were still in progress at the end of a lightning conversion of railway arches into an emergency morgue as the first bodies arrived.</p> <p>A smell of fresh paint hung in the air; a few toolboxes lay on the concrete floor. The nearby East London Mosque had transformed the space, normally used to store vehicles, into a Covid-19 mortuary in a little over a fortnight.</p> <p>Two coffins were unloaded from a van and wheeled on trolleys through to a refrigerated space at the back of the premises, containing metal racks capable of holding 24 corpses.

      "bodyText": "The final few snagging jobs were still in progress at the end of a lightning conversion of railway arches into an emergency morgue as the first bodies arrived. A smell of fresh paint hung in the air; a few toolboxes lay on the concrete floor. The nearby East London Mosque had transformed the space, normally used to store vehicles, into a Covid-19 mortuary in a little over a fortnight. Two coffins were unloaded from a van and wheeled on trolleys through to a refrigerated space at the back of the premises, containing metal racks capable of holding 24 corpses. There was room for dozens more if needed. The coffins contained the remains of two men of Moroccan descent who had died of coronavirus at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington. They had been brought to Whitechapel through the capital\u2019s unusually quiet streets by Haji Taslim Funerals, London\u2019s oldest Muslim funeral service, which is based at the mosque.

      "body": "<p>Narendra Modi\u2019s request was simple: to help combat the spread of coronavirus, people should download an Indian government-built smartphone app that helps identify their risk of catching and spreading the virus.</p> <p>\u201cAs more and more people use it, its effectiveness will increase,\u201d the prime minister said in a televised address last month.</p> <p>Within hours, the Aarogya Setu app became the fastest downloaded app on record, with 83 million users and counting.</p> <p>India was not the first country to deploy technology for coronavirus contact tracing \u2013 China, the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and multiple European countries have developed apps. But in a country with no meaningful anti-surveillance, privacy or data protection laws (the 1885 Telegraph Act is still in use) and a nationalist government with unprecedented snooping powers, many fear it has sinister implications.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus is a gift to authoritarian states including India,\u201d said the Indian author Arundhati Roy. \u201cPre-corona, if we were sleepwalking into the surveillance state, now we are panic-running into a super-surveillance state.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4e6d7db7f22631690a5ef101b4f0825a34b354d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e6d7db7f22631690a5ef101b4f0825a34b354d/2180_124_2356_2945/800.jpg\" alt=\"Arundhati Roy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arundhati Roy: \u2018We are panic-running into a super-surveillance state.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Jana/Hindustan Times/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since coronavirus took hold in early March, it has been met with mounting authoritarian measures by Modi\u2019s government. Journalists critical of the government have been hit with police charges while students who held anti-government protests last year are suddenly being rounded up under draconian terrorism laws. Meanwhile, with the entire country placed under a strict lockdown, the normal mechanisms of justice, accountability and democracy have been heavily eroded, with gatherings \u2013 and therefore protests \u2013 banned and the courts all but suspended, ensuring lawyers have been unable to file bail applications.</p> <p>Throughout April, Delhi police rounded up and detained student activists who helped organise massive protests against a citizenship law last year. Several of the female activists, one of whom is pregnant, have been accused of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to instigate deadly religious riots in Delhi in February, and were arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which is normally used in the context of terrorism. It means they can be held for six months with no charges and no bail.</p> <p>Authoritarian measures have also been increasing in the volatile region of Kashmir. In a single week, the police used the same terrorism law to arrest a number of journalists in cases collectively described by the Editors Guild of India as a \u201cgross misuse of power\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe excuse of the pandemic has meant the threshold for justifying arrests under terrorism laws, such as UAPA, has dropped further,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer. \u201cBut it has also become almost impossible to get a court hearing to determine whether an action is illegal or unconstitutional. So access to justice is now extremely limited.\u201d</p> <p>The app has fuelled concern that the pandemic is being used as a pretext to erode privacy and freedom of speech in the name of \u201cwinning the war\u201d against coronavirus. \u201cIn this context, the justification for restrictions on civil liberties is a lot more palatable to the public and it is less closely scrutinised,\u201d said Sidharth Deb, counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation, who wrote a paper on the app.</p> <p>Privacy violations and unprecedented surveillance have already been rife at the state level, from the personal details of everyone on quarantine lists in the state of Karnataka being published in the public domain to police tracking people in quarantine through GPS, drones and even geotagged selfies.</p> <p>The app presents similar issues, but on a scale that could affect hundreds of millions of people. All data used to calculate risk of infection, from age and address to travel history and \u2013 through the use of GPS and bluetooth \u2013 people that users have come into close contact with over the past 14 days, is sent to an external server under the control of the federal government. According to the terms of use, users are not allowed to give their phones to others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=India\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=India\">Graphic</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\">both</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\"> Bluetooth</a> and GPS makes the app far more invasive than its counterpart in Singapore. And when it comes to transparency around how the data will be handled and used, the Indian government has been far more opaque. Unlike in most other countries, there is no transparency on the limitations on the lifespan of database and no binding policy that it will not be repurposed after the pandemic. The app is equally vague about which government departments will have access to the Aarogya Setu database.</p> <p>Abhishek Singh, the chief executive of MyGovIndia, which developed Aarogya Setu, said the app had been built \u201cwith privacy as the core principle\u201d, with location data kept anonymised, all data of non-risk users deleted after 45 days, and high-risk users after 60 days.</p> <p>\u201cThe government of India will use information only for administering necessary medical interventions,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cData is not going to be used for any other purpose. No third party has access to data.\u201d</p> <p>But Deb said the app \u201cpresents a sweep of privacy related risks. This has the potential to be a permanent tool of surveillance and on top of it all, we don\u2019t have legislation or a law or even an oversight mechanism to hold the government accountable and preserve our right to privacy.\u201d</p> <p>Some see it as evidence of India looking to China\u2019s playbook, where technology was heavily deployed to monitor citizens under the guise of contact tracing. Indeed, downloading it could soon be the only way for people in India to freely leave the house, giving the government an unprecedented watch over its citizens. As of Friday, Aarogya Setu has been mandatory for all public, private and military employees.

      "bodyText": "Narendra Modi\u2019s request was simple: to help combat the spread of coronavirus, people should download an Indian government-built smartphone app that helps identify their risk of catching and spreading the virus. \u201cAs more and more people use it, its effectiveness will increase,\u201d the prime minister said in a televised address last month. Within hours, the Aarogya Setu app became the fastest downloaded app on record, with 83 million users and counting. India was not the first country to deploy technology for coronavirus contact tracing \u2013 China, the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and multiple European countries have developed apps. But in a country with no meaningful anti-surveillance, privacy or data protection laws (the 1885 Telegraph Act is still in use) and a nationalist government with unprecedented snooping powers, many fear it has sinister implications. \u201cThe coronavirus is a gift to authoritarian states including India,\u201d said the Indian author Arundhati Roy. \u201cPre-corona, if we were sleepwalking into the surveillance state, now we are panic-running into a super-surveillance state.\u201d Since coronavirus took hold in early March, it has been met with mounting authoritarian measures by Modi\u2019s government. Journalists critical of the government have been hit with police charges while students who held anti-government protests last year are suddenly being rounded up under draconian terrorism laws. Meanwhile, with the entire country placed under a strict lockdown, the normal mechanisms of justice, accountability and democracy have been heavily eroded, with gatherings \u2013 and therefore protests \u2013 banned and the courts all but suspended, ensuring lawyers have been unable to file bail applications. Throughout April, Delhi police rounded up and detained student activists who helped organise massive protests against a citizenship law last year. Several of the female activists, one of whom is pregnant, have been accused of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to instigate deadly religious riots in Delhi in February, and were arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which is normally used in the context of terrorism. It means they can be held for six months with no charges and no bail. Authoritarian measures have also been increasing in the volatile region of Kashmir. In a single week, the police used the same terrorism law to arrest a number of journalists in cases collectively described by the Editors Guild of India as a \u201cgross misuse of power\u201d. \u201cThe excuse of the pandemic has meant the threshold for justifying arrests under terrorism laws, such as UAPA, has dropped further,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer. \u201cBut it has also become almost impossible to get a court hearing to determine whether an action is illegal or unconstitutional. So access to justice is now extremely limited.\u201d The app has fuelled concern that the pandemic is being used as a pretext to erode privacy and freedom of speech in the name of \u201cwinning the war\u201d against coronavirus. \u201cIn this context, the justification for restrictions on civil liberties is a lot more palatable to the public and it is less closely scrutinised,\u201d said Sidharth Deb, counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation, who wrote a paper on the app. Privacy violations and unprecedented surveillance have already been rife at the state level, from the personal details of everyone on quarantine lists in the state of Karnataka being published in the public domain to police tracking people in quarantine through GPS, drones and even geotagged selfies. The app presents similar issues, but on a scale that could affect hundreds of millions of people. All data used to calculate risk of infection, from age and address to travel history and \u2013 through the use of GPS and bluetooth \u2013 people that users have come into close contact with over the past 14 days, is sent to an external server under the control of the federal government. According to the terms of use, users are not allowed to give their phones to others. The use of both Bluetooth and GPS makes the app far more invasive than its counterpart in Singapore. And when it comes to transparency around how the data will be handled and used, the Indian government has been far more opaque. Unlike in most other countries, there is no transparency on the limitations on the lifespan of database and no binding policy that it will not be repurposed after the pandemic. The app is equally vague about which government departments will have access to the Aarogya Setu database. Abhishek Singh, the chief executive of MyGovIndia, which developed Aarogya Setu, said the app had been built \u201cwith privacy as the core principle\u201d, with location data kept anonymised, all data of non-risk users deleted after 45 days, and high-risk users after 60 days. \u201cThe government of India will use information only for administering necessary medical interventions,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cData is not going to be used for any other purpose. No third party has access to data.\u201d But Deb said the app \u201cpresents a sweep of privacy related risks. This has the potential to be a permanent tool of surveillance and on top of it all, we don\u2019t have legislation or a law or even an oversight mechanism to hold the government accountable and preserve our right to privacy.\u201d Some see it as evidence of India looking to China\u2019s playbook, where technology was heavily deployed to monitor citizens under the guise of contact tracing. Indeed, downloading it could soon be the only way for people in India to freely leave the house, giving the government an unprecedented watch over its citizens. As of Friday, Aarogya Setu has been mandatory for all public, private and military employees. It will come pre-installed on all smartphones and may be used by the Delhi Metro to screen people who wish to use the service once lockdown is lifted. Just as surveillance has become more heavy-handed during the pandemic, so too have attacks on the media. After the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 24 March with just four hours notice, prompting negative media coverage, the supreme court issued a ruling that the media only publish the \u201cofficial version\u201d of events as put out in government bulletins. Then, on 1 April, the police filed a report against Siddharth Varadarajan, the editor of independent news outlet the Wire, for an article detailing allegations that the chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh had violated physical distancing rules at a religious gathering. The charges against Varadarajan include the transmission of obscene material. Varadarajan said it was \u201cundoubtedly\u201d part of an anti-democratic shift. \u201cAll the authoritarian impulses evident before are more pronounced today \u2013 intolerance of the media and free speech, tolerance of hate speech and religious polarisation, secrecy, lack of transparency and lack of communication,\u201d he said. Varadarajan\u2019s case is not an isolated one. Last week the Chhattisgarh police issued a notice against the local journalist Neeraj Shivhare for his story on a female labourer starving during the lockdown, accusing him of the \u201cpunishable offence\u201d of making \u201creaders afraid and scared and tarnishing the image of the administration\u201d during an epidemic. \u201cThe courts are not functioning as they should, so the police also know it is harder for journalists to get relief from this kind of harassment,\u201d said Varadarajan. \u201cAnd of course their hope is that the media sitting on the fence will look at our situation and say: \u2018Why take the risk of annoying the government?\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the course of a two-and-a-half-hour press briefing, the president claimed the country had \u201cflattened\u201d its coronavirus curve (despite official figures showing a relentless rise in cases), he spent several minutes assailing a national newspaper for what he said was unfair coverage, and he defended his attempt to seize control of the budget. But the leader extemporizing in front of the cameras was not Donald Trump. It was Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose relish for encounters with the press rivals that of his US counterpart. Amlo, as the Mexican leader is known, inaugurated a daily press 7am conference soon after taking power in 2018. It was a revolutionary move in a country where presidents have rarely faced close questioning. It also allowed Amlo to set the day\u2019s agenda, much as Trump has often dominated news cycles with his tweetstorms. As Covid-19 cases mount in Mexico, the sessions have drawn frequent comparisons to Trump\u2019s aborted coronavirus briefings, which similarly focused as much on personal promotion and attacks on enemies as on offering accurate information. But while Trump has now apparently cooled on daily appearances, Amlo has doubled down. The president announced plans for an additional session every evening in which he or his secretaries will speak for two hours after the existing briefing by the country\u2019s coronavirus czar Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell. The announcement prompted grumbling from members of the press corps, but it continues Amlo\u2019s long-established habit of at least offering the appearance of open government. \u201cIt works just like it works for Trump,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the quality of the communication is, it dominates the [news] cycle. That\u2019s all it\u2019s about. That\u2019s all it\u2019s supposed to be about.\u201d Just as Trump frequently picks sympathetic reporters from fringe media outlets, Amlo often courts supportive questions from figures such as Carlos Pozos, a mustachioed and bowtie-wearing YouTuber popularly known as Lord Molecule. He also takes more aggressive questions from mainstream reporters, although his verbose responses often evade an actual answer. Mostly, though, Amlo pontificates: part president, part partisan hack, part preacher. He addresses the pressing matters in Mexico\u2019s public, but not without trolling his opponents or detouring into diatribes on the supposed shortcomings of previous governments. He regularly invokes moral values and cites biblical scripture. He even pulled a pair of prayer cards out of his wallet, saying the images (and personal honesty) helped protect him against coronavirus. Amlo supporters delight in the president\u2019s tendency to pick fights with the press and excoriate enemies. \u201cThis is the charm for his followers,\u201d said Il\u00e1n Semo, historian at the Iberoamerican University. \u201cThey believe in him like they would a preacher.\u201d Just like their US counterparts, many Mexican journalists express mixed feelings over the presidential briefings. \u201cIt was a useful and novel method of presidential communication,\u201d Javier Garza, a journalist in the northern city of Torre\u00f3n, said of Amlo\u2019s morning press conferences. \u201cBut it\u2019s turned into a predictable spectacle without any value.\u201d Even if the briefings occasionally feel more like campaign events, \u201cthey\u2019re still a place to pose questions to the president,\u201d Garza said \u201cand the president has not tried to flee\u201d.",

Producing upbeat news reports can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2020/mar/21/wellbeing-and-the-news\">help children rebalance their world view</a> by becoming more aware of positive events. Our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Happy_News_Challenge\">Happy News activity</a> encourages children to script, report, and share their positive news.</p> <h4><strong>3) Create an authentic experience</strong></h4> <p>Why not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2018/sep/17/creating-a-newsroom-in-your-classroom\">transform your classroom into a newsroom</a>? Your students will gain team work, time-management, and critical thinking skills.</p> <p>There are plenty of free and easy ways to get that newsroom feel.

Of course, you can act as chief editor!</p> <p>Set students short tasks with tight deadlines for an authentic newsroom experience. Teachers are often amazed that NewsWise students are able to critically assess reports, research and script a balanced news story from scratch and rehearse and perform a news bulletin, all within a couple of hours.</p> <h4><strong>4) Immerse students in news</strong></h4> <p>Many children cannot access news at home, <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/family-news-literacy-report/\">particularly those in disadvantaged areas</a>. How can we expect children to write in the style of news reports without exposure to news media? Remember that your classroom might be the only source of news for your students.

Ask children to report on something happening at school (a guest visitor, a new \u2018vegan lunch day\u2019 in the canteen), or a local issue (shops closing in the high street, a new park). Ask children to write about a local perspective on a national or international issue (coronavirus, climate change, Brexit). Plan opportunities for your students to conduct real interviews \u2013 they could talk to anyone from the head teacher to a local MP! This is also a great opportunity to teach children about the importance of considering both sides of a story, and understanding the difference between fact and opinion.

Una vez m\u00e1s, la ausencia de una normativa para guiar y gestionar la transici\u00f3n nos est\u00e1 fallando en el campo clim\u00e1tico, adem\u00e1s de en las \u00e1reas de igualdad y justicia, y en la prevenci\u00f3n de la pr\u00f3xima cat\u00e1strofe.",

      "bodyText": "Carl and Kerry Humphreys were looking forward to celebrating the second anniversary of the opening of their sandwich shop and catering business when the coronavirus crisis struck and trade dried up almost overnight. Hubbubs was turning a small profit, providing takeaway coffee and buffet lunches to local businesses. It ran from a Basepoint business centre in Swindon, a shared office building managed by International Workplace Group (IWG), the world\u2019s largest flexible workspace provider. Desperately trying to cut costs, the Humphreys contacted IWG to ask for support, but initially did not receive any. \u201cTheir attitude towards helping us was not very good at all,\u201d says Carl. After several phone calls, IWG subsequently proposed a 50% discount on rent for April and May, provided Hubbubs extended its annual lease by three months. A similar offer has been made to many of IWG\u2019s tenants, who rent office space managed by the company under brand names including Basepoint, Regus and Spaces. Businesses have also been offered the option of paying half-rent for two months, and repaying the rest over the following year. These offers, described as \u201creasonable\u201d by the group\u2019s chief executive, Mark Dixon, have not stopped the criticism levelled at IWG by its tenants for its perceived lack of communication and support. Locked out of their offices owing to government travel restrictions, IWG\u2019s customers complain that requests for rent reductions or deferments were initially ignored as the group insisted full rent was due because its buildings remained open for key workers and to maintain customer services such as mail delivery and IT. More than 1,000 people have signed a petition calling for IWG to close all of its 312 UK centres and freeze all rent or memberships, or provide \u201csubstantial discounts\u201d. For James Vanner, a partner at the London law firm Vanner Perez Notaries which rents 50 sq metres of Regus office space, IWG\u2019s behaviour during the crisis amounts to \u201cunethical profiteering\u201d. He adds that he has tasked an agent with finding a new office. As recently as the start of March, IWG, previously known as Regus, was trumpeting a \u201ctransformational year\u201d and record profits. Now the group, which is headquartered in Switzerland and has more than 3,300 locations in 110 countries, is negotiating rental payments with its own landlords. One institutional landlord says IWG has failed to pay it any rent for the last quarter. Dixon insists the group has not been requesting rent reductions from its UK commercial landlords. \u201cWhat we are getting in some cases is deferments of rent, in a small number of cases. We are not asking for anything more than that,\u201d he says. Dixon describes the UK property industry\u2019s reaction as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is a time when businesses have to work together, it\u2019s not a time for conflict.\u201d The Monaco-based executive says he has spoken personally to hundreds of IWG customers and received \u201chundreds of thank you notes for helping\u201d, but criticises certain customers, who he says could afford to pay rent, for trying to \u201ctake advantage of a situation\u201d. The IWG board, including Dixon, who is also the group\u2019s biggest shareholder, have decided to take a 50% reduction in base salary and fees during the crisis. IWG\u2019s share price has tumbled 50% since the start of the year, supporting the view of some analysts about the dangers of the \u201cborrow long and lend short\u201d business model used by shared workspace providers. These firms, including the troubled US company WeWork, tend to sign long leases for buildings from their landlords, while renting out the space on much shorter terms to their customers. IWG noted this \u201cpotential mismatch\u201d between leases and contracts as a strategic risks in most recent full-year results, published in March. Mike Prew, an equity analyst at brokerage firm Jefferies, describes the share prices of IWG and its rival Workspace Group as the \u201ccanary in the mineshaft \u2013 or perhaps on the hot desk\u201d. IWG is exploring raising cash by selling some of the buildings it owns, which it gained through several acquisitions, and leasing them back. But Dixon insists these plans are \u201cnot imminent\u201d and date from \u201cwell before Covid-19\u201d. Challenges may remain for IWG and other shared workspace providers even as coronavirus restrictions are eased and some businesses can return to their offices. Peter Papadakos, head of European real estate at research firm Green Street Advisors, forecasts rising unemployment will lead to higher vacancy rates in office buildings over the next four years, leading commercial rents to fall by as much as 15%. He is concerned flexible workspace providers may be left exposed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a pretty aggressive flex office industry offering really good deals to attract companies back,\u201d he says.",

She\u2019s beautiful, upbeat and humorous and her father, Rahul, and I adore her.</p> <p>I desperately want to send her to school because without it she is home full-time and needs someone to care for her, all day every day, from the moment she gets up to the moment she sleeps, no weekends off. My last day off was before lockdown.</p> <p>So why are we not sending her to school? On the first day of the lockdown, I spoke to a school staff member on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, of course, but I wouldn\u2019t send her,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see how it can be safe.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the pupils, like Liora, don\u2019t have language, they can\u2019t speak or understand more than simple words such as food, drink, toilet.

They don\u2019t know how to wipe their noses, they are not able to wash their hands without help \u2013 and often resist it. They don\u2019t know how to social distance, they don\u2019t know anything about the pandemic. Many are also violent to parents and teachers and they are not able to stop biting, punching and kicking.

These are his words, not mine, because it will be impossible to keep them \u2013 and his staff \u2013 safe. He\u2019s having to turn desperate parents away, which he hates doing, as he knows how hard it is for us.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty glib, then, of the government to announce that all children meeting the vulnerable criteria will receive an education. Clearly he has no understanding that thousands of disabled children can\u2019t go to school, and thousands of families in utter crisis are having to care for their children full-time.

      "bodyText": "Every vulnerable child has access to school during lockdown, right? Our daughter, Liora Sarnaik, age 13, has an education and health care plan and a social worker, so meets the government\u2019s definition of vulnerable and should have been able to go to school when lockdown started. I actually thought I might be one of those people who work from home, learn how to bake a cake, sort through the attic, have Zoom chats. But Liora hasn\u2019t been at school. Today there are only 15 children attending Liora\u2019s excellent special needs school, Downs View in Brighton. Normally there are more than 100. Liora is not one of the 15: these are all children who live in residential care because their families have not been able to cope with caring for them. So they don\u2019t have a choice about going to school. Liora has three life-long conditions: uncontrolled epilepsy, a chronic kidney condition and autism. She can\u2019t speak and she\u2019s doubly incontinent. She\u2019s beautiful, upbeat and humorous and her father, Rahul, and I adore her.

A maintenance worker at the MoJ believed to be from Pakistan also died during that week, with the circumstances around his death unclear.</p> <p>Fearing that they were putting themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus, several cleaners refused to go to work at the MoJ\u2019s 14-storey headquarters in central London on Tuesday after the deaths, according to UVW.</p> <p>One of the cleaners was allegedly suspended later after criticising the response of OCS, the cleaning company, to coronavirus concerns following the death of Gomes. OCS did not comment on this specific point.</p> <p>The vast majority of civil servants are working from home but the cleaners \u2013 designated key workers \u2013 have purportedly been told to work in groups of two or three at the building.</p> <p>They have complained of not being provided with masks and having to commute to Westminster during peak times for their shifts.</p> <p>The cleaners, who are paid \u00a39.08 an hour, had been split into two groups to work on alternate days to limit the number of people on-site simultaneously but were back on the normal rota on 15 April, according to UVW, but OCS challenged this version of events.</p> <p>Fatima Djalo, an 55-year-old cleaner from Guinea Bissau, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no work to do. The buildings are empty. But we can\u2019t go home and we have to stay here if we want to get paid and pay our bills.</p> <p>\u201cThe bosses have fled, they\u2019re not here. Two colleagues died last week. We\u2019re trapped and we\u2019re really scared. Some people are shaking with fear.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Alberto, a 61-year-old cleaner from Brazil, said he was off work from 18 March to 19 April with suspected coronavirus and had been told he would only receive statutory sick pay of about \u00a3420.</p> <p>The MoJ has not been notified of any cleaners testing positive for coronavirus nor dying from it. OCS, which employs the outsourced cleaning staff, said it has no details about the cause of Gomes\u2019s death \u2013 he was thought to be in his 60s and had worked at the MoJ since February 2018.</p> <p>Kier, the company which provides maintenance staff, did not provide any details but confirmed its workers receive occupational sick pay.</p> <p>UVW said it suspects coronavirus was the cause of both deaths, and that about 70 security, maintenance and cleaning staff normally work at the MoJ.</p> <p>Petros Elia, a UVW representative, said: \u201cThe death of our member Emanuel is a tragedy. In the hours before his death he became so ill he was delirious with fever and on the brink of physical collapse. However, instead of seeking medical support or simply resting at home, he had continued to drag himself into work at the MoJ.\u201d</p> <p>He questioned why the cleaners have been told to continue to work at the near empty, \u201cbarely operational\u201d building despite the risk to themselves and their families.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also utterly hypocritical of the government to simultaneously insist on lockdown and social distancing whilst instructing its cleaners to unnecessarily continue to work,\u201d Elia added.</p> <p>An OCS spokesperson said: \u201cSadly, we can confirm an OCS colleague passed away at home last week, having been taken ill suddenly. At this stage, we have no details about his cause of death. Our deepest sympathies are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time.\u201d</p> <p>OCS said protective equipment including rubber gloves and aprons had been provided to cleaning staff but that masks were not required to be used, in line with Public Health England guidelines.</p> <p>Asked if OCS provides occupational sick pay, the spokesperson said that staff would receive \u201csick pay\u201d \u2013 believed to be the statutory \u00a396 a week, the legal minimum \u2013 \u201cfor any periods of sickness absence of self-isolation where working from home is not possible.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cShift patterns were adjusted initially to allow colleagues to travel to and from work outside rush-hour. However, in response to colleague requests, and in recognition that colleagues often have more than one job, the shift pattern was reverted to the usual working day pattern.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is understood that Kier had provided vehicles so public transport could be avoided. It also staggered shifts to reduce the number of people in the same place at the same time.</p> <p>An MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and friends of the two colleagues who have sadly died.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working closely with our contractors to ensure their staff have the necessary safety equipment and are complying with Public Health England advice. Our headquarters remains open for essential work that cannot be carried out from home and it\u2019s vital staff have a safe, clean environment to protect their health and the NHS.\u201d</p>",

Fearing that they were putting themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus, several cleaners refused to go to work at the MoJ\u2019s 14-storey headquarters in central London on Tuesday after the deaths, according to UVW. One of the cleaners was allegedly suspended later after criticising the response of OCS, the cleaning company, to coronavirus concerns following the death of Gomes. OCS did not comment on this specific point. The vast majority of civil servants are working from home but the cleaners \u2013 designated key workers \u2013 have purportedly been told to work in groups of two or three at the building. They have complained of not being provided with masks and having to commute to Westminster during peak times for their shifts. The cleaners, who are paid \u00a39.08 an hour, had been split into two groups to work on alternate days to limit the number of people on-site simultaneously but were back on the normal rota on 15 April, according to UVW, but OCS challenged this version of events. Fatima Djalo, an 55-year-old cleaner from Guinea Bissau, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no work to do. The buildings are empty. But we can\u2019t go home and we have to stay here if we want to get paid and pay our bills. \u201cThe bosses have fled, they\u2019re not here. Two colleagues died last week. We\u2019re trapped and we\u2019re really scared. Some people are shaking with fear.\u201d Carlos Alberto, a 61-year-old cleaner from Brazil, said he was off work from 18 March to 19 April with suspected coronavirus and had been told he would only receive statutory sick pay of about \u00a3420. The MoJ has not been notified of any cleaners testing positive for coronavirus nor dying from it. OCS, which employs the outsourced cleaning staff, said it has no details about the cause of Gomes\u2019s death \u2013 he was thought to be in his 60s and had worked at the MoJ since February 2018. Kier, the company which provides maintenance staff, did not provide any details but confirmed its workers receive occupational sick pay. UVW said it suspects coronavirus was the cause of both deaths, and that about 70 security, maintenance and cleaning staff normally work at the MoJ. Petros Elia, a UVW representative, said: \u201cThe death of our member Emanuel is a tragedy. In the hours before his death he became so ill he was delirious with fever and on the brink of physical collapse. However, instead of seeking medical support or simply resting at home, he had continued to drag himself into work at the MoJ.\u201d He questioned why the cleaners have been told to continue to work at the near empty, \u201cbarely operational\u201d building despite the risk to themselves and their families. \u201cIt is also utterly hypocritical of the government to simultaneously insist on lockdown and social distancing whilst instructing its cleaners to unnecessarily continue to work,\u201d Elia added. An OCS spokesperson said: \u201cSadly, we can confirm an OCS colleague passed away at home last week, having been taken ill suddenly. At this stage, we have no details about his cause of death. Our deepest sympathies are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time.\u201d OCS said protective equipment including rubber gloves and aprons had been provided to cleaning staff but that masks were not required to be used, in line with Public Health England guidelines. Asked if OCS provides occupational sick pay, the spokesperson said that staff would receive \u201csick pay\u201d \u2013 believed to be the statutory \u00a396 a week, the legal minimum \u2013 \u201cfor any periods of sickness absence of self-isolation where working from home is not possible.\u201d They added: \u201cShift patterns were adjusted initially to allow colleagues to travel to and from work outside rush-hour. However, in response to colleague requests, and in recognition that colleagues often have more than one job, the shift pattern was reverted to the usual working day pattern.\u201d It is understood that Kier had provided vehicles so public transport could be avoided. It also staggered shifts to reduce the number of people in the same place at the same time. An MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and friends of the two colleagues who have sadly died. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with our contractors to ensure their staff have the necessary safety equipment and are complying with Public Health England advice. Our headquarters remains open for essential work that cannot be carried out from home and it\u2019s vital staff have a safe, clean environment to protect their health and the NHS.\u201d",

Ryan Craig\u2019s monologue Proof of Life is directed by Harry Tennison and stars Zoe Zak as an intensive care doctor who is recording a message for a judgmental family member with whom she has an acrimonious relationship. It charts her quest for control and peace in her personal life at a time of huge professional stress, when sick patients have died alone without the comfort of their family\u2019s presence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8di_vFB4weQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8di_vFB4weQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Nal\u00e2n Burgess\u2019s comedy Good Connection? is directed by Hana Keegan and has an ultra-relatable scenario in which the fraught Anya (Olivia Dodd) finds her personal and professional lives colliding.

All she really wants is a Pret lunch and some time to herself.</p> <p>Burgess said that when theatres closed in mid-March it \u201cled to an abrupt end to rehearsals for a show we had been working on for weeks and a complete lifestyle change, trading in the rehearsal room for my bedroom: laptop life and even constructing a desk, the actor\u2019s nemesis.\u201d Like some of the other Virtual Collaborators, she has written one film and acted in another. \u201cDuring such an emotionally turbulent time, it has been so comforting to connect with other caged creatives, working on two projects, one as an actress and one pushing myself out of my comfort zone as a writer, happily occupying several hours of lockdown life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rubY_e_Vzm8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rubY_e_Vzm8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>How we spend the extra time that may have become available to us during lockdown is explored in A Birthday Wish, written by Frances McNamee and directed by Ellie Hurt.

For his series <a href=\"https://www.briancoyle.co.uk/we-will-not-be-silenced\">We Will Not Be Silenced</a>, playwright Brian Coyle is penning short monologues about life during the pandemic, which have been self-filmed by actors. Eight have been made so far. The writer and actor Jasmine Naziha Jones has dreamed up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiQqaV6zIh9l1L5PWuyORlg?view_as=subscriber\">Open Soap</a>, an improvised supermarket sitcom created by actors and comedians in isolation. \u201cSo far we have six episodes and enough submissions for a pretty wild story arc,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Me \u2026 Me actor Iniki Mariano recommends the benefits of collaborating remotely during the lockdown. \u201cWe truly are more powerful together. That idea you might have, that story you might have always wanted to tell, or that desire to make something even though you have no clue how to start, you don\u2019t have to do it alone \u2013 all you have to do is find another creative, and ask!\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiTjPOxyOVVWNAQ3KQHJmA/videos?view_as=subscriber\">Watch all of the Virtual Collaborators films</a></p></li> </ul>",

Ryan Craig\u2019s monologue Proof of Life is directed by Harry Tennison and stars Zoe Zak as an intensive care doctor who is recording a message for a judgmental family member with whom she has an acrimonious relationship. It charts her quest for control and peace in her personal life at a time of huge professional stress, when sick patients have died alone without the comfort of their family\u2019s presence. Nal\u00e2n Burgess\u2019s comedy Good Connection? is directed by Hana Keegan and has an ultra-relatable scenario in which the fraught Anya (Olivia Dodd) finds her personal and professional lives colliding. She attempts to be businesslike with colleagues while also Zooming her mum and sharing her space with her boyfriend (Priyank Morjaria). All she really wants is a Pret lunch and some time to herself. Burgess said that when theatres closed in mid-March it \u201cled to an abrupt end to rehearsals for a show we had been working on for weeks and a complete lifestyle change, trading in the rehearsal room for my bedroom: laptop life and even constructing a desk, the actor\u2019s nemesis.\u201d Like some of the other Virtual Collaborators, she has written one film and acted in another. \u201cDuring such an emotionally turbulent time, it has been so comforting to connect with other caged creatives, working on two projects, one as an actress and one pushing myself out of my comfort zone as a writer, happily occupying several hours of lockdown life.\u201d How we spend the extra time that may have become available to us during lockdown is explored in A Birthday Wish, written by Frances McNamee and directed by Ellie Hurt. In the lead role, Joseph Adelakun looks back on a day watching Power Rangers and eating cereal on his own. Shouldn\u2019t he be writing his novel, he asks, while also reflecting on his need for daily human interaction, even if it\u2019s just at the supermarket checkout. Samal was inspired to create the drama series when the Guardian invited her to contribute an idea to an article proposing an \u201caction plan for theatre\u201d after venues were closed by coronavirus. \u201cMental health is as important as physical in this trying time,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need to stay creative \u2013 that doesn\u2019t have to be alone. Technology can keep us collaborating remotely.\u201d Hers is one of an explosion of online theatre projects to have emerged in the last six weeks. For his series We Will Not Be Silenced, playwright Brian Coyle is penning short monologues about life during the pandemic, which have been self-filmed by actors. Eight have been made so far. The writer and actor Jasmine Naziha Jones has dreamed up Open Soap, an improvised supermarket sitcom created by actors and comedians in isolation. \u201cSo far we have six episodes and enough submissions for a pretty wild story arc,\u201d she says. Me \u2026 Me actor Iniki Mariano recommends the benefits of collaborating remotely during the lockdown. \u201cWe truly are more powerful together. That idea you might have, that story you might have always wanted to tell, or that desire to make something even though you have no clue how to start, you don\u2019t have to do it alone \u2013 all you have to do is find another creative, and ask!\u201d Watch all of the Virtual Collaborators films",

Julian Bird, chief executive of Solt and UK Theatre, encouraged theatregoers to consider donations in order to help the sector, and added the decision would have a \u201csevere impact\u201d on the 290,000 individuals working in the industry. The artistic director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, told the Guardian recently that some theatres had only days before they could go out of business and urged the government to offer more support to freelancers. Norris\u2019s comments followed those of the playwright James Graham who said an \u201caggressive government bailout\u201d was the way to ensure the sector survived Covid-19 and without one it would become more elitist and less accessible.

Less was known about the global pandemic; the data and scientific research showing how the two global crises are linked was not as clear is it is today. But the connections quickly became obvious to Atkin, founder of the climate newsletter and podcast Heated. \u201cBoth are global crises which threaten millions of lives with clear science on how to solve them which governments have been too slow to act on; the same people who promote climate denial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/climate-science-deniers-downplaying-coronavirus-pandemic\">are refusing to accept the science of coronavirus</a>, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a10d6246438033bb48d141b08909b8b0fd251491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a10d6246438033bb48d141b08909b8b0fd251491/0_231_2250_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Atkin, a former reporter at New Republic, launched Heated, a climate-focused newsletter and podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Atkin, a former reporter at New Republic, launched Heated, a climate-focused newsletter and podcast</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCoronavirus makes climate change worse, and vice versa,\u201d Atkin says from isolation in her apartment. \u201cWe can\u2019t do our research on climate because of it, we\u2019ve had to cancel the UN climate summit for international negotiations.\u201d Meanwhile, Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/trump-pollution-laws-epa-allows-companies-pollute-without-penalty-during-coronavirus\">loosened existing emission regulations</a> during the pandemic, yet studies are already finding that death rates are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d in areas with worse air pollution levels. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/halt-destruction-nature-worse-pandemics-top-scientists\">destruction of biodiversity makes pandemics more likely</a>. And just like with the impact of global heating, , the coronavirus is hitting black, brown and poor people the worst.</p> <p>The two things are so connected, Atkin repeats, that it\u2019s stupid to say they\u2019re not.</p> <p>Raised in New York and based in Washington DC, Atkin started reporting on the climate in 2013 after graduating in journalism from SUNY (the State University of New York) but three years in she was burnt out. \u201cI was forced to write in this really straight way with no emotion, just fact,\u201d she says of her time spent at the now closed liberal news site ThinkProgress and then a more conservative TV network. \u201cWe ran stories which focused on \u2018balance\u2019 in a bid not to alienate audiences.\u201d When facts were presented, it was to be done without emotion: the science shows we\u2019ll kill people if we don\u2019t do anything, we\u2019re not doing anything, end report.</p> <p>Climate-change deniers were also being given airtime on TV segments she was producing.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Emily Atkin, not sounding very apologetic, \u201cbut if you still refuse to see parallels between climate change and coronavirus then honestly you\u2019re just stupid.\u201d A few weeks ago, the 30-year-old journalist wasn\u2019t feeling so confrontational. Less was known about the global pandemic; the data and scientific research showing how the two global crises are linked was not as clear is it is today. But the connections quickly became obvious to Atkin, founder of the climate newsletter and podcast Heated. \u201cBoth are global crises which threaten millions of lives with clear science on how to solve them which governments have been too slow to act on; the same people who promote climate denial are refusing to accept the science of coronavirus, too. \u201cCoronavirus makes climate change worse, and vice versa,\u201d Atkin says from isolation in her apartment. \u201cWe can\u2019t do our research on climate because of it, we\u2019ve had to cancel the UN climate summit for international negotiations.\u201d Meanwhile, Donald Trump has loosened existing emission regulations during the pandemic, yet studies are already finding that death rates are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d in areas with worse air pollution levels. The destruction of biodiversity makes pandemics more likely. And just like with the impact of global heating, , the coronavirus is hitting black, brown and poor people the worst. The two things are so connected, Atkin repeats, that it\u2019s stupid to say they\u2019re not. Raised in New York and based in Washington DC, Atkin started reporting on the climate in 2013 after graduating in journalism from SUNY (the State University of New York) but three years in she was burnt out. \u201cI was forced to write in this really straight way with no emotion, just fact,\u201d she says of her time spent at the now closed liberal news site ThinkProgress and then a more conservative TV network. \u201cWe ran stories which focused on \u2018balance\u2019 in a bid not to alienate audiences.\u201d When facts were presented, it was to be done without emotion: the science shows we\u2019ll kill people if we don\u2019t do anything, we\u2019re not doing anything, end report. Climate-change deniers were also being given airtime on TV segments she was producing. She recalls being asked to rerecord a voiceover because she sounded \u201ctoo judgmental\u201d when stating what had been said by an interviewee wasn\u2019t scientifically correct. And, with editors regularly giving science and opinion equal value, all too often Atkin felt she was doing a disservice to her beat. \u201cI thought back to my journalism classes and how we were taught the first rule in the Society of Professional Journalists\u2019 code of ethics is to seek truth and report it.\u201d Atkin came to the realisation that when it comes to the climate crisis, showing what is true requires more than facts alone. \u201cThe truth is full of emotions, money and power,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about people dying while others profit, the impact on lives and culture and jobs.\u201d Atkin had told the climate story again and again but felt she was making little impact. \u201cIt seemed so irresponsible for me to be working as a journalist\u2026 without being explicit about what will happen if we don\u2019t lower carbon emissions, and fast.\u201d And so in September last year she left her reporting job at New Republic and launched Heated: a climate-focused newsletter which aimed at speaking directly to an ever-growing, but under-served, environmentally-conscious audience.

      "bodyText": "Fraudsters are flooding online auction sites with thousands of fake listings for camper vans and motorhomes, using the lockdown to trick people into handing over cash for vehicles they have not seen. An investigator behind an anti-fraud group set up to try to stop the criminal gangs that target vehicle buyers told the Guardian he has never seen so many fraudulent vehicle listings appear on eBay and other sites in such a short space of time. \u201cCriminals have realised that there is big demand from people stuck at home looking at buying motorhomes to be used when we are allowed out again,\u201d said the investigator, who works under the name Jack Buster. \u201cI\u2019d implore anyone who has been talking to a supposed seller in recent days to stop, and under no circumstances send them any money.\u201d Fraudsters use fake listings copied from legitimate adverts to attract buyers, then tell them that they will deliver the vehicle if they put the money into a holding account. Although they say the cash will not be released until the buyer has seen the vehicle and agreed to finalise the purchase, the money is taken straight away and the customer is left with nothing. The coronavirus pandemic has given fraudsters a new reason to ask for money ahead of delivery, as buyers are not able to get out to inspect vehicles. It has also made camper vans attractive to families who are looking for ways to safely take a summer break. The Guardian was contacted this week by Simon Barker, who said he had lost \u00a35,000 to \u201ca highly sophisticated fraud\u201d. He had spotted a motorhome on eBay and had emailed someone called Nathan Edgar Wright, who claimed to be selling the vehicle on behalf of his father in Ireland. Barker was told that owing to the lockdown the motorhome would be delivered by a transport company. The seller reassured him that if he paid using Paypal\u2019s pay after delivery service, he he would have five days to look over the vehicle before the money was released. \u201cHe then tried and failed to send me a Paypal invoice, at which point I was seemingly contacted by a representative from Paypal via a live chat window. It certainly looked very convincing,\u201d Barker said. \u201cHe gave me a reference and a bank account number to transfer funds to.

      "bodyText": "The fashion chain J Crew has became the first major US retailer to file for bankruptcy protection during the coronavirus shutdown. The New York-based brand\u2019s parent company made the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in a Virginian federal court to buy itself breathing space as it plans to hand control over to its lenders, in exchange for the cancellation of $1.65bn (\u00a31.3bn) of its debts. J Crew Group\u2019s chief executive described the move as a \u201cfinancial restructuring\u201d that would enable the business to thrive for years to come. Known for its preppy style and being a favourite of Michelle Obama, J Crew had been under pressure for some time as it struggled with debt and had fallen out of fashion with US shoppers, who turned to cheaper European rivals such as Zara and H&amp;M. In addition, its vast store network of more than 500 US outlets became a burden as consumers increasingly moved towards shopping online. The retailer\u2019s creditors, which include the hedge fund Anchorage Capital Group, Blackstone-owned GSO Capital Partners, and Davidson Kempner Capital Management, hold significant amounts of its debt and will take control of the company. The lenders will provide J Crew with about $400m of new financing during the bankruptcy proceedings. The retailer, which also owns the J Crew Factory and Madewell brands, became a consumer phenomenon, known for its aspirational look and, unusually for a mid-range clothing retailer, showing its products at New York fashion week. As its reputation grew beyond its 500 US stores, it expanded internationally, opening branches in Canada and the UK, where it has six outlets. J Crew will retain its Madewell brand and will continue to trade online during the bankruptcy proceedings, although some of its stores are not expected to reopen after coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The group\u2019s chief executive, Jan Singer, described the agreement with its lenders as \u201ca critical milestone in the ongoing process to transform our business\u201d.

Two of the golds were in Olympic-class boats and we\u2019re the first Asian rowing heavyweight men\u2019s group to win any medal. I try to keep rational. I tell the Chinese: \u2018You\u2019ve won one Olympic gold at a home Games. Don\u2019t say we\u2019re going to win five golds. I can guarantee we won\u2019t. Let\u2019s win one Olympic gold away from home. That would be a great step forward.\u2019 We\u2019ve got an opportunity of winning two but their ambition is a lot higher than I see their reality.</p> <p>\u201cBut people thought I was crazy in the UK when I said I\u2019m going to win Olympic gold. When I started we\u2019d won five gold medals from all sports. So you need ambition.

One of the minuses on the Chinese side is being in a permanent training camp. You can suffer mental staleness. The Brits are training at home on rowing machines so it may be a slight advantage for China currently. But will the missed training affect the Brits and Germans next year? Probably not.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because I have diabetes, I was told to isolate myself for 12 weeks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Redgrave is an ambassador and academy member for Laureus \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.laureus.com/sport-for-good\" title=\"\">organisation which uses sport</a> to bring about change and spread opportunity around the world. \u201cI share the same goal of wanting to help young people achieve. We remember what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdopyAFP0DI\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela said</a> 20 years ago at the first Laureus awards. He highlighted the power of sport to offer hope and change lives. I\u2019ve just been blown away by the depth of people involved.\u201d</p> <p>During the lockdown he has reflected on sport\u2019s role in our new world and believes that \u201cdespite Covid, sport still has a huge part to play. There is a bigger role for us as sportspeople. There are rumours in the UK that football is coming back behind closed doors. That\u2019s defeating the object of sport which should bring people together, and inspire them. This decision is just motivated by business. We should have more unity and stand up and ask: \u2018Is this the right thing?\u2019 We should set aside the commercial pressure of procuring TV revenue and think about what really matters.</p> <p>\u201cSport can make that leap and do the right thing. Coming out of Covid will change society and for the better. But we will slowly seep back to how we were before the crisis unless we remember those feelings we have when we clap the NHS workers every Thursday night.

That would be a great step forward.\u2019 We\u2019ve got an opportunity of winning two but their ambition is a lot higher than I see their reality. \u201cBut people thought I was crazy in the UK when I said I\u2019m going to win Olympic gold. When I started we\u2019d won five gold medals from all sports. So you need ambition. Hopefully China becomes a rowing powerhouse in Paris and LA [in 2028].\u201d It sounds as if the Chinese are enjoying a massive advantage over every major rowing nation? \u201cI would hope so,\u201d Redgrave says before laughing. \u201cBut there are pluses and minuses in every system. One of the minuses on the Chinese side is being in a permanent training camp. You can suffer mental staleness. The Brits are training at home on rowing machines so it may be a slight advantage for China currently. But will the missed training affect the Brits and Germans next year? Probably not.\u201d Redgrave is an ambassador and academy member for Laureus \u2013 the organisation which uses sport to bring about change and spread opportunity around the world. \u201cI share the same goal of wanting to help young people achieve. We remember what Nelson Mandela said 20 years ago at the first Laureus awards. He highlighted the power of sport to offer hope and change lives. I\u2019ve just been blown away by the depth of people involved.\u201d During the lockdown he has reflected on sport\u2019s role in our new world and believes that \u201cdespite Covid, sport still has a huge part to play. There is a bigger role for us as sportspeople. There are rumours in the UK that football is coming back behind closed doors. That\u2019s defeating the object of sport which should bring people together, and inspire them. This decision is just motivated by business. We should have more unity and stand up and ask: \u2018Is this the right thing?\u2019 We should set aside the commercial pressure of procuring TV revenue and think about what really matters. \u201cSport can make that leap and do the right thing. Coming out of Covid will change society and for the better. But we will slowly seep back to how we were before the crisis unless we remember those feelings we have when we clap the NHS workers every Thursday night. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m so proud of my daughter on the frontline.\u201d Laureus Sport for Good was established in 2000 with the aim of using the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of young people",

The trend was first seen in China, where <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\">one analysis</a> found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women. Since then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, South Korea and Italy, where men have accounted for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjgh/2020/03/24/sex-gender-and-covid-19-disaggregated-data-and-health-disparities/\">71% of deaths</a>.</p>\n    <p>So why are men more vulnerable?</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.</p>\n    <p>Early on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to the difference. Smoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.</p>\n    <p>Behavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/sites/default/files/assets/1/AssetManager/2010%20Hand%20Washing%20Findings.pdf\">less likely to wash their hands</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/01/30/hand-washing-soap-poll-survey\">less likely to use soap</a>, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.</p>\n    <p>However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Belarus has almost 17,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, giving it one of Europe\u2019s highest per capita infection rates.

This meant that as soon as news of a novel strain of coronavirus in mainland China started to spread, most people decided not to wait for official guidelines and began wearing masks, minimising social outings, and washing hands and homes with increased frequency and thoroughness.</p> <p>The government, on the other hand, prevaricated for reasons that were hardly connected to public health. Back in October 2019, citing colonial-era emergency laws, the authorities <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49931598\">banned</a> wearing a mask in public to prevent protesters hiding their identity as they took part in unauthorised marches (or authorised marched that got banned halfway through). But the administration wasn\u2019t willing to budge. It took a few contradictory press briefings before Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, accepted that surgical masks for preventing the spread of the coronavirus would be allowed \u2013 while maintaining that they would remain forbidden at protests.</p> <p>To some extent, the pandemic could have given the Hong Kong government the opportunity to reset the clock, concentrate on protecting public health, and move towards social reconciliation. This is not what\u2019s happened.</p> <p>Even as Hong Kong was recording growing numbers of new infections and life was being upended by the pandemic, the police kept making arrests and the courts kept putting activists on trial. Fifteen high-profile activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">were arrested</a> in April for illegal assembly in a march that took place last August that saw more than a million people take to the streets. Among them were pro-democracy veterans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">Martin Lee</a>, 81, a senior barrister who co-drafted the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, and who served as an elected legislator and as one of the founders of the Democratic party; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">Jimmy Lai, the founder and publisher of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily</a>; and <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2019/08/20/staff-member-uks-consulate-hong-kong-missing-10-days-mainland-china-business-trip/48582133841_9ed1aa2540_k/\">Figo Chan</a>, co-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, the group that had been leading authorised mass protests throughout 2019.</p> <p>In the same hours, the Liaison Office, Beijing\u2019s highest representative in Hong Kong, decided to make its position in the territory even more openly that of a de facto supervisor of the local administration by announcing that it was not bound by <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1521237-20200417.htm?archive_date=2020-04-17\">Article 22</a> of the Basic Law. Article 22 states that no department under the Chinese central and local government may interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs. The announcement seemingly undermined some of the main principles under which Hong Kong exists \u2013 such as the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d concept and the promise of a high degree of autonomy \u2013 but it didn\u2019t provoke street protests: the fear of a spread of coronavirus cases, and the impossibility of organising rallies or meetings, has meant that discontent has migrated online, mostly on social media. Since the end of March, social distancing has been enforced with a provision that forbids groups of more than four people gathering, making demonstrations almost impossible.</p> <p>But as the crackdown continues, an angry emoji can only go so far. Law Man-chung, an anti-government protester, saw his sentence of 200 hours of community service changed to <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1522526-20200424.htm\">20 days in prison</a> after the government appealed the original sentence for being \u201ctoo lenient\u201d.

It is hoped that such an event can be repeated once the coronavirus lockdowns and physical distancing measures are lifted. After the war, Sutherland, who was born in the nearby pub called the Boonaert or Boneyard, worked for what was the Imperial war graves commission as a gardener at Lijssenthoek cemetery, retiring in 1986. \u201cAll the old soldiers know Talbot House when they come and visit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like a home. The people come here and they feel home.\u201d Of Friday\u2019s walk, Sutherland added: \u201cI hope I can do it.\u201d",

Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights minister, criticised the fact that unions had been being given only 12 hours at the weekend to respond to the proposals.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe entire country wants the government to succeed, but this is not how to build confidence or trust,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe proposals talk about what they expect employers to \u2018consider\u2019, and say social distancing and handwashing \u2018should\u2019 happen, where possible, to help \u2013 with insufficient attention being paid to PPE. Taking the necessary steps to protect employees is not a matter of expectation or guidance, it is the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking at business department questions in a virtual Commons debate, McDonald asked for confirmation that risk assessments would be published, and lodged with the Health and Safety Executive.</p> \n<p>Amanda Solloway, the science minister, replied that her department was negotiating with employers and unions, to \u201ccome to a shared view\u201d about the issue. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson is preparing to set out on Sunday</a> how restrictions can be eased but before that business groups and trade unions have been sent draft guidelines for how to protect people if physical distancing rules cannot be followed.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade union body has warned the government\u2019s draft guidelines for getting employees back to work during the coronavirus crisis will put people\u2019s health at risk and cannot be supported in their current form. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), criticised the non-binding guidelines for letting employers decide what is safe when it comes to distance between workers, cleaning practices and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Labour threw its weight behind the TUC\u2019s concerns. Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights minister, criticised the fact that unions had been being given only 12 hours at the weekend to respond to the proposals. \u201cThe entire country wants the government to succeed, but this is not how to build confidence or trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proposals talk about what they expect employers to \u2018consider\u2019, and say social distancing and handwashing \u2018should\u2019 happen, where possible, to help \u2013 with insufficient attention being paid to PPE. Taking the necessary steps to protect employees is not a matter of expectation or guidance, it is the law.\u201d Speaking at business department questions in a virtual Commons debate, McDonald asked for confirmation that risk assessments would be published, and lodged with the Health and Safety Executive. Amanda Solloway, the science minister, replied that her department was negotiating with employers and unions, to \u201ccome to a shared view\u201d about the issue. Boris Johnson is preparing to set out on Sunday how restrictions can be eased but before that business groups and trade unions have been sent draft guidelines for how to protect people if physical distancing rules cannot be followed. Suggestions include physical shields, time limits on face-to-face meetings, and staggered shift times. In a letter to Alok Sharma, the business secretary, O\u2019Grady said unions would have \u201cno hesitation\u201d in telling their members that the guidelines cannot protect workers unless they were significantly strengthened \u2013 a move that could lead to many refusing requests to get back to work. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says: \u201cWorking people need to see that the government is genuinely committed to protecting their health and safety. At present, this guidance fails to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly and is an open goal to the worst of employers who want to return to business at usual \u2013 which will put their workforce at risk \u2026 \u201cWe want to be able to recommend the government\u2019s approach to safe working to our members and the wider workforce. As it stands, we cannot.\u201d Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said on Monday employees could return to work with physical shields to separate them from colleagues, personal protective equipment (PPE) and limits on time spent close to each other. He said there was a range of measures that could be used in workplaces where maintaining a two-metre distance between colleagues was not possible. Wallace told the BBC that supermarket shoppers were not two metres away from those working at the tills but were instead separated by physical shields. \u201cPotentially, shields or PPE is a way forward,\u201d he said. Wallace also highlighted the \u201cuse of time\u201d as another tool: \u201cYou could be closer than two metres but not for long,\u201d he said. According to sources who have seen the guidelines, other workplace measures include reduced hot-desking and staggered shift times.

      "bodyText": "More than 10 times as many people in Germany as thought may have been infected with coronavirus, researchers have said, as Italy led swathes of Europe out of lockdown and officials said the continent\u2019s outbreak was mostly past its peak. Researchers from Bonn University said on Monday that their preliminary study, based on fieldwork in the town of Gangelt in Heinsberg municipality, which had one of Germany\u2019s highest death tolls, showed the risk of infection by asymptomatic carriers. The researchers concluded from a random sample of 919 people that about 15% of Gangelt\u2019s population had been infected, with a fatality rate of 0.37%. Extrapolating nationwide, they said about 1.8 million people living in Germany may have contracted the virus, against 160,000 confirmed cases so far. About one in five of those who were infected showed no symptoms, they said, underlining the importance of physical distancing and basic hygiene to keep the disease at bay. \u201cEvery supposedly healthy person we encounter can unknowingly carry the virus,\u201d said Martin Exner, the head of the university\u2019s institute for hygiene and public health and a co-author of the study. \u201cWe must be aware of this and act accordingly.\u201d Research in France, where a Paris-area hospital has retested old samples from pneumonia patients, has found a Covid-19 case from 27 December, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases, and suggesting the virus was circulating in Europe earlier than previously thought. Yves Cohen, head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in the northern suburbs of Paris, said the man, who had not made any trips, was sick for 15 days and had infected his two children, but not his wife. \u201cHe was amazed. He didn\u2019t understand how he had been infected,\u201d he said. As millions of people in Italy and across the continent went back to work, the EU\u2019s agency for disease control said only five European countries were not yet showing a clear downward trend in their outbreaks. Second only to the US in its Covid-19 death tally of nearly 29,000, Italy sent more than 4 million construction and factory workers back to their jobs after reporting its lowest toll since the government imposed a national lockdown on 9 March. After nine weeks of confinement, the country\u2019s 60 million residents were finally free to stroll in streets and parks and to visit relatives. Restaurants reopened for takeaway orders, but bars will remain shut and masks are obligatory in public spaces indoors. Italy was the first western democracy to impose a strict nationwide lockdown and the long weeks of confinement appear to be weighing on the nation\u2019s psyche: a poll by the Piepoli Institute showed 62% of Italians thought they would need psychological support. Spain, with continental Europe\u2019s second highest death toll, also began cautiously easing its way out of 48 days of lockdown, with Spaniards allowed out to exercise for the first time on Saturday but with face masks mandatory on public transport. Small shops \u2013 including hairdressers \u2013 began receiving clients again by individual appointment on Monday, while bars and restaurants were allowed to start offering a takeaway service. About 10% of Greece\u2019s businesses, including barber shops and bookstores, also reopened on Monday. Portugal allowed small shops, hair salons and car dealers to resume business, with masks to be worn in stores and on public transport, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary partially reopened public spaces and selected businesses. In Germany, museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos also reopened their doors, while Austria sent senior high school students back to class to prepare for this month\u2019s graduation exams. Some Belgian office workers returned to work on Monday. \u201cIt appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,\u201d Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European parliament. Ammon said that of the 31 European countries the agency monitors, only Bulgaria was still recording an increase in cases, while Poland, Romania, Sweden and Britain \u2013 which has recorded Europe\u2019s highest rise in so-called \u201cexcess deaths\u201d above the five-year average \u2013 had seen \u201cno substantial changes in the last 14 days\u201d. Russia, which the agency does not study, is rapidly becoming Europe\u2019s blackspot, with officials in Moscow urging residents to stay at home in an effort to contain the growing daily tally of new cases. \u201cThe threat is apparently on the rise,\u201d the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, told citizens. Russia registered a near-record in new daily cases on Monday as the number of total infections exceeded 145,000, cementing the country\u2019s position as the top reporter of new cases in Europe. Health officials reported 10,581 new infections over the last 24 hours, only 52 less than Sunday\u2019s record. The country has so far recorded 145,268 cases and 1,356 deaths. In further developments: Coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million people and caused nearly 250,000 deaths worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV attacked the US secretary of state\u2019s \u201cinsane and evasive remarks\u201d on the origins of the pandemic. Mike Pompeo said there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d to show the virus originated in a lab in China. As Donald Trump presses states to reopen their economies, his administration is privately projecting daily deaths will almost double to about 3,000 by 1 June, according to an internal document seen by the New York Times. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, extended the country\u2019s national state of emergency to 31 May, adding that he would consider lifting it earlier if experts decided that was possible based on regional infection trends. World leaders, with the exception of Trump, stumped up nearly \u20ac7.4bn (\u00a36.5bn) to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies, pledging the money would also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries on time and equitably.",

      "bodyText": "More than 25 million people were affected by high levels of anxiety in late March as the decision to put the UK into lockdown triggered fears about health, job security and making ends meet among half the adult population. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said its regular update on wellbeing showed the number of people over 16 reporting deep levels of concern and stress had more than doubled since late 2019. According to the ONS, people\u2019s main concerns were personal wellbeing, their jobs and the impact of Covid-19 on their finances as normal working life was suspended for all but essential workers. Those who thought they would not be able to save any money over the following 12 months reported anxiety 33% higher than those who thought they would be able to. The release of the official wellbeing data comes as the government grapples with how to lift the restrictions, enforced from 24 March, and will add to concerns about the psychological impact of the lockdown. The ONS tracks wellbeing through a survey of around 1,500 people that asks people how anxious and happy they are on a scale of one to 10. Between 20 March and 30 March, the proportion of people registering high levels of anxiety (between six and 10 on the scale) stood at 49.6% of the adult population, or more than 25 million people , up from 21% at the end of 2019. Of those worried about the impact of coronavirus on their lives, the survey suggested about 5.3 million people were most concerned about the effect on their finances; 8.5 million were most concerned about their wellbeing, including boredom, loneliness and stress; and 6.2 million were most concerned about their jobs. Among other concerns cited were the effect of the lockdown on education, relationships and caring responsibilities. With stress levels rising, the number of people reporting a low happiness score of between zero and four stood at 20.7% in late March, compared with 8.4% in the final quarter of last year. With the lockdown now well into its second month, the ONS said there had been a drop-back in the numbers reporting high anxiety, although they remained well above pre-crisis levels. The average anxiety rating was 2.97 in the fourth quarter of 2019, increased to 5.18 in late March, and fell to 4.2 by mid-April. The ONS said those who had already been affected financially in late March were also reporting lower wellbeing; people whose household finances had been hit because of Covid-19 reported 16% higher anxiety on average. It added that people who rented and the self-employed were more likely to have had their household finances and their jobs negatively affected by the pandemic, through reduced income, having to use savings to cover living costs, reduced working hours, and the inability to save for the future. Lucy Tinkler, the head of the ONS\u2019s quality of life team, said: \u201cAll measures of personal wellbeing, which include anxiety and happiness, are at their worst levels since we began collecting data in 2011. \u201cThis was particularly the case for those who have already been financially affected, as well as those renting and the self-employed. The most recent data showed a slight improvement in anxiety compared to previous weeks, but remained much higher than before the pandemic.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On Friday health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the UK had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">achieved its target</a> of carrying out 100,000 tests per day. Of the reported 122,347 tests on 30 April, a total of 27,497 had simply been delivered to people\u2019s homes and 12,872 to other centres. Only a small proportion of those 40,000 tests sent out have been used so far. By Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/ministers-under-fire-as-covid-19-testing-drops-back-below-100000-daily-target\">the figure had dropped</a> to 76,496 to much disconcertion.</p> <p>Are people right to be worried about the number of tests available? There are valid concerns that while the tests are being delivered in high numbers, they may not all be usable. It is still unclear whether tests sent to care homes can be administered by staff, who are currently not registered to carry out nursing tasks. Some have even been sent tests without return envelopes. Despite some friction in the process of rolling out testing, the number of tests actually carried out is still a very impressive achievement.</p> <p>The real concern is our capacity to act on the results of the tests. Simply doing tests in response to demand will be inadequate. Instead we must use each result to find cases, trace those who have been in contact with a person who has tested positive and ensure that those infected, or potentially infected, self-isolate. Only these four steps used in conjunction will prevent a second wave of the virus and protect vulnerable people.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/28/nhs-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-ready-for-use-in-three-weeks-mps-told\">technology and apps</a> may well help, this exercise will require the mobilisation of thousands of workers to interview cases, identify contacts and take swabs.

      "bodyText": "On Friday health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the UK had achieved its target of carrying out 100,000 tests per day. Of the reported 122,347 tests on 30 April, a total of 27,497 had simply been delivered to people\u2019s homes and 12,872 to other centres. Only a small proportion of those 40,000 tests sent out have been used so far. By Sunday, the figure had dropped to 76,496 to much disconcertion. Are people right to be worried about the number of tests available? There are valid concerns that while the tests are being delivered in high numbers, they may not all be usable. It is still unclear whether tests sent to care homes can be administered by staff, who are currently not registered to carry out nursing tasks. Some have even been sent tests without return envelopes. Despite some friction in the process of rolling out testing, the number of tests actually carried out is still a very impressive achievement. The real concern is our capacity to act on the results of the tests. Simply doing tests in response to demand will be inadequate. Instead we must use each result to find cases, trace those who have been in contact with a person who has tested positive and ensure that those infected, or potentially infected, self-isolate. Only these four steps used in conjunction will prevent a second wave of the virus and protect vulnerable people. Although technology and apps may well help, this exercise will require the mobilisation of thousands of workers to interview cases, identify contacts and take swabs. Contact tracing is a skilled activity, usually done by specially trained nurses or environmental health officers, and we need to ensure that we have enough trained people to do this before we get to that part of the recovery phase. Once cases have been identified, self-isolation will be key to lowering the rate of transmission. People who test positive and those they have been in contact with will have to shut themselves off to the rest of the world for 14 days. For the minority who refuse to do this, strict sanctions may be needed. If testing is not followed up by contact tracing and self-isolation, we run the risk of a large outbreak, as happened in South Korea with Patient 31 and the Shincheonji church. This patient apparently continued to attend the church even though she had symptoms and went on to generate a cluster of more than 4,400 cases of Covid-19.

Bondholders had already backed the plan on Sunday, after rejecting it in a vote on Friday. The airline said it had secured written consent from the largest holders of the NAS07 bond after it improved some of the terms. It will hold another bondholder vote on 18 May, where the airline will have to formally secure 67% support. The lessors, who own Norwegian\u2019s aircraft, had also signed up to the plan, the carrier said minutes before the shareholder meeting began. \u201cWith the significant contributions from lessors and bondholders, the company expects to convert more than 10bn kroner in debt to equity.\u201d The share sale will start on Tuesday and is expected to be completed by 11 May. In recent years Norwegian transformed itself from a small local carrier into a pioneer of low-cost long-haul flights, for example to the US. It carries almost 6 million UK passengers each year from Gatwick, Edinburgh and Manchester airports to 30 destinations worldwide. Norwegian warned a week ago that virtually all of its 160 fleet would remain grounded until 2021, with just seven flying at the moment, mainly transporting essential cargo on state-subsidised domestic flights in Norway. It has temporarily laid off more than 80% of its workforce.",

Like everyone else, unions want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need to be confident that they won\u2019t put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk. The government needs to drop its laissez-faire approach and set out tough new measures to keep workers safe. \u2022 Frances O\u2019Grady is the TUC general secretary",

      "bodyText": "The head of the EU\u2019s agency for disease control has warned that the UK is one of five European countries failing to reduce active coronavirus infections, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s claims of success. Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), suggested on Monday that the UK had yet to progress as far as the majority of European countries in tackling the disease. In evidence to the European parliament\u2019s committee on public health, Ammon said Europe as a whole appeared to have passed the peak of infections on Saturday, with only Bulgaria still experiencing an increase in cases of infection. But she told MEPs that the UK, along with Poland, Romania and Sweden, stood out as showing \u201cno substantial changes in the last 14 days\u201d. \u201cAll the others, we really see this substantial decrease,\u201d Ammon said of the cumulative incidence rate, which provides a measure of the prevalence of active cases in the population. She did not offer any explanation of the differences. The ECDC monitors all 27 EU member states plus the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The agency reported that as of Monday there had been 1.2 million confirmed cases of infection, with 136,347 deaths within the territory it monitors. The UK has recorded 186,599 confirmed cases and 28,466 fatalities, a death count second only to Italy, according to the ECDC\u2019s latest data. Only the US has suffered more deaths. Last week, Johnson claimed that Britain had gone past the peak and was \u201con the downward slope\u201d. In the last week there has been a decrease of around 13% in the the number of people with Covid-19 in UK hospitals. There has also been a decrease in the number of deaths. The government has warned of the difficulties in making international comparisons, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, insisting that while the government \u201cwill have made mistakes\u201d the evidence will need to be assessed in the future. But Ammon\u2019s suggestion that the UK is yet to show the sustained improvement seen elsewhere in Europe offers some grounds for caution as Downing Street seeks to champion its efforts to reduce the rate of infection. It has been suggested in Whitehall that a better insight into the relative success of governments will be found in the increase of excess deaths during the pandemic, rather than just those officially recorded as being related to Covid-19. But an EU-backed project monitoring all excess deaths during the pandemic reported that England had seen the highest rise in deaths over the five-year average compared with Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Ammon, a former head of department for infectious disease epidemiology at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, said the lockdowns brought in by governments across Europe as a whole had reduced transmissions by 45% compared with 8 April. She warned, however, against any complacency and suggested that her agency had little confidence that the reporting of deaths and infections was complete. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s approach throughout this pandemic has been guided by the latest scientific evidence. \u201cWe have seen a marked decline in both daily confirmed cases and deaths in recent weeks and our published data clearly shows this. \u201cOther countries may be at different stages of the outbreak and there is variety in how they record and report deaths, so comparisons can be unhelpful, inaccurate and misleading\u201d. Researchers at the University of Bonn suggested on Monday that more than 10 times as many people in Germany had probably been infected with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, following a field trial in one of the worst-hit towns.",

The lowest estimate for the volume of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">mass testing required now to safely reopen</a> is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">500,000 tests a day</a>; a good target would be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/13/21215133/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-screening\">35m</a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/13/21215133/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-screening\"> a day.</a> (The US is currently <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">averaging 200,000 tests a day</a>). \u201cThink of it like this: if our goal was to eat an Italian dinner, we\u2019re currently stuck in traffic on the way to an Olive Garden,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even halfway to arriving at the worst place that technically qualifies.\u201d</p> <p>Which was why Oliver devoted the evening to ask: \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d First, there was a failure to deliver diagnostic tests, which tell you if you have the virus, when cases first appeared in the US in February. The CDC decided to make their own testing kits, but as they were shipped around the country, it was revealed that chemical contamination during manufacturing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">rendered the tests useless</a>. Even worse, the CDC took weeks to come up with a work-around.

It has been communicated very badly and we feel like we have been left in the dark. We found out about it on the news when Grant Shapps [the transport secretary] <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52519340\">announced it</a>. Are they going to send us a letter or knock on our doors to tell us to download it? Still, I will use the app, and encourage others to do so.\u201d</p> <h2>Natasha Batty, 35, educator</h2> <p>\u201cIt is important that we learn from other countries like Germany and South Korea which adopted a test, track and trace approach. Having a pilot on an island makes sense and, as we have a relatively low number of cases, it could be a safe place to do it. It will be the only way to get out of the lockdown which is causing many a great deal of economic hardship, isolation and stress.\u201d</p> <h2>Sally Wilson, 47, ice cream deliverer</h2> <p>\u201cIs the Isle of Wight a valid place to test anything to do with coronavirus? We have an elderly population and only 127 cases [as of Sunday], <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">the fifth lowest per capita in the country</a>. We have had no contact whatsoever about this. We don\u2019t know if this means we will effectively be guinea pigs for the easing of the nationwide lockdown. I\u2019m happy to try, but I don\u2019t know if the island is the best place for it.\u201d</p> <h2>Richard Quigley, 48, former Labour parliamentary candidate</h2> <p>\u201cI am supportive of trialling the technology but not if it requires the early lifting of lockdown or social distancing, which I\u2019m assured it will not. The efficacy of this app may soon be called into question if it does not register contact between people who have not been together long enough or by providing false positives if people are in close proximity but have a wall dividing them.\u201d</p> <h2>Melanie Jones, 71, former teacher</h2> <p>\u201cI have isolated since the day over-70s were told to and I only go out for short walks when no one is about using my access to webcam at the bay which shows the footfall at the time. I\u2019m afraid that if people have got an app they may think that since they are being tracked there is no need to worry about abiding by the lockdown.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Isle of Wight residents have complained they have been \u201cleft in the dark\u201d about trials of a pilot NHS coronavirus contact tracing app on the island as part of UK government plans to prevent a second wave of infections. The plans have nonetheless been welcomed in principle, although people are concerned that the app, which uses bluetooth technology to register contact between users when they come within about 2 metres of each other for at least 15 minutes, would only be truly effective after the lockdown has been eased. Willoughby Matthews, 21, furloughed outdoor activity instructor \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea, but there are fears it will be used as an excuse to lift the lockdown early here. It has been communicated very badly and we feel like we have been left in the dark. We found out about it on the news when Grant Shapps [the transport secretary] announced it. Are they going to send us a letter or knock on our doors to tell us to download it? Still, I will use the app, and encourage others to do so.\u201d Natasha Batty, 35, educator \u201cIt is important that we learn from other countries like Germany and South Korea which adopted a test, track and trace approach. Having a pilot on an island makes sense and, as we have a relatively low number of cases, it could be a safe place to do it. It will be the only way to get out of the lockdown which is causing many a great deal of economic hardship, isolation and stress.\u201d Sally Wilson, 47, ice cream deliverer \u201cIs the Isle of Wight a valid place to test anything to do with coronavirus? We have an elderly population and only 127 cases [as of Sunday], the fifth lowest per capita in the country. We have had no contact whatsoever about this. We don\u2019t know if this means we will effectively be guinea pigs for the easing of the nationwide lockdown. I\u2019m happy to try, but I don\u2019t know if the island is the best place for it.\u201d Richard Quigley, 48, former Labour parliamentary candidate \u201cI am supportive of trialling the technology but not if it requires the early lifting of lockdown or social distancing, which I\u2019m assured it will not. The efficacy of this app may soon be called into question if it does not register contact between people who have not been together long enough or by providing false positives if people are in close proximity but have a wall dividing them.\u201d Melanie Jones, 71, former teacher \u201cI have isolated since the day over-70s were told to and I only go out for short walks when no one is about using my access to webcam at the bay which shows the footfall at the time. I\u2019m afraid that if people have got an app they may think that since they are being tracked there is no need to worry about abiding by the lockdown.\u201d Some names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>Small businesses have rushed to apply for a new government-backed loan scheme, prompting one lender to warn that banks may struggle to cope with the demand.</p> <p>The bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-treasury-rushes-to-finalise-coronavirus-bounce-back-loan-scheme\">launched at 8.30am on Monday</a> and had received 79,500 applications by the afternoon, already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-treasury-rushes-to-finalise-coronavirus-bounce-back-loan-scheme\">exceeding the 52,807 applications</a> for the existing coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which started on 23 March.</p> <p>According to the latest available figures, Lloyds had received 17,000 BBLS applications by midday, Royal Bank of Scotland 22,000 by 2.30pm, and HSBC 34,500 by 4pm. Barclays was the only lender to confirm the number of approvals it had made for the 100% government-backed loans, totalling 6,000 and worth \u00a3200m, by mid-afternoon.</p> <p>The fast-track scheme offers loans worth up to \u00a350,000 to Britain\u2019s smallest businesses, which can apply through a simple online form. All banks offer the loans at an interest rate of 2.5% that kicks in after the first 12-month period, which is interest- and payment-free.</p> <p>Anne Boden, the chief executive of the digital lender Starling bank, which has applied to be a BBLS lender, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that there would be some concerns about how quickly banks could ramp up their lending to cope with demand. The CBILS has been criticised for slow processing of applications.</p> <p>Under that scheme, lenders have to send data manually to the British Business Bank \u2013 the state-backed institution managing the scheme \u2013 to process the government-back loans. Boden said this method was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. The British Business Bank is now working on a new digital platform to speed up the process, but that will not be ready for another six to seven weeks.</p> <p>\u201cMy greater concern at the moment is that the processes within all the banks won\u2019t take the strain of what\u2019s happening to process all these loans and bounce back that quickly,\u201d said Boden. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a scale problem here.\u201d</p> <p>Starling only started CBILS lending on Monday, despite having applied weeks ago to be included.</p> <p>Accredited BBLS lenders told the committee there had been a deluge of claims on Monday morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen applications at a rate of about 35 per minute,\u201d Matt Hammerstein, the head of Barclays UK bank, said. \u201cSo I think there will be extraordinary demand, recognising the severity and the breadth of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">impact of this [Covid-19] crisis</a> across smaller businesses.\u201d</p> <p>RBS\u2019s commercial banking chief, Paul Thwaite, said staff had worked incredibly hard to get the scheme up and running on Monday morning and that the number of call centre staff had been doubled to more than 500 to deal with demand.</p> <p>But MPs asked whether bank systems would be able to cope with the surge in demand, including those linked to the British Business Bank.</p> <p>Barclays customers were reported to be struggling to access applications on the bank\u2019s website. Hammerstein denied that the site was failing to cope, and said the bank\u2019s technical team was increasing the number of applications the online site could handle at any one time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK lenders have been accused of failing to distribute funds fast enough through existing government schemes. The latest figures showed that they approved less than 50% of the 52,807 CBILS applications.</p> <p>David Oldfield, the head of commercial banking at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs that his team also struggled to deal with the loan processing systems linked to the British Business Bank. Those systems were originally built for another government programme known as the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, which was not designed to handle such a surge in demand.</p> <p>The committee chair, the Conservative MP Mel Stride, warned that he would be drawing attention to banks that were \u201cslow off the mark\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Small businesses have rushed to apply for a new government-backed loan scheme, prompting one lender to warn that banks may struggle to cope with the demand. The bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS) was launched at 8.30am on Monday and had received 79,500 applications by the afternoon, already exceeding the 52,807 applications for the existing coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which started on 23 March. According to the latest available figures, Lloyds had received 17,000 BBLS applications by midday, Royal Bank of Scotland 22,000 by 2.30pm, and HSBC 34,500 by 4pm. Barclays was the only lender to confirm the number of approvals it had made for the 100% government-backed loans, totalling 6,000 and worth \u00a3200m, by mid-afternoon. The fast-track scheme offers loans worth up to \u00a350,000 to Britain\u2019s smallest businesses, which can apply through a simple online form. All banks offer the loans at an interest rate of 2.5% that kicks in after the first 12-month period, which is interest- and payment-free. Anne Boden, the chief executive of the digital lender Starling bank, which has applied to be a BBLS lender, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that there would be some concerns about how quickly banks could ramp up their lending to cope with demand. The CBILS has been criticised for slow processing of applications. Under that scheme, lenders have to send data manually to the British Business Bank \u2013 the state-backed institution managing the scheme \u2013 to process the government-back loans. Boden said this method was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. The British Business Bank is now working on a new digital platform to speed up the process, but that will not be ready for another six to seven weeks. \u201cMy greater concern at the moment is that the processes within all the banks won\u2019t take the strain of what\u2019s happening to process all these loans and bounce back that quickly,\u201d said Boden. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a scale problem here.\u201d Starling only started CBILS lending on Monday, despite having applied weeks ago to be included. Accredited BBLS lenders told the committee there had been a deluge of claims on Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen applications at a rate of about 35 per minute,\u201d Matt Hammerstein, the head of Barclays UK bank, said. \u201cSo I think there will be extraordinary demand, recognising the severity and the breadth of the impact of this [Covid-19] crisis across smaller businesses.\u201d RBS\u2019s commercial banking chief, Paul Thwaite, said staff had worked incredibly hard to get the scheme up and running on Monday morning and that the number of call centre staff had been doubled to more than 500 to deal with demand. But MPs asked whether bank systems would be able to cope with the surge in demand, including those linked to the British Business Bank. Barclays customers were reported to be struggling to access applications on the bank\u2019s website. Hammerstein denied that the site was failing to cope, and said the bank\u2019s technical team was increasing the number of applications the online site could handle at any one time. UK lenders have been accused of failing to distribute funds fast enough through existing government schemes. The latest figures showed that they approved less than 50% of the 52,807 CBILS applications. David Oldfield, the head of commercial banking at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs that his team also struggled to deal with the loan processing systems linked to the British Business Bank. Those systems were originally built for another government programme known as the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, which was not designed to handle such a surge in demand. The committee chair, the Conservative MP Mel Stride, warned that he would be drawing attention to banks that were \u201cslow off the mark\u201d.",

That was legendary. Gould was also a great talker \u2013 his conversations with Humphrey Burton are particularly revealing \u2013 and, in this Beethoven centenary year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPDBcdDGrnE\">his brief introduction to the performance of the D minor Sonata Op 31 No 2</a> is a good example of his erudite yet almost nonchalant style. It was apparently a boyhood accident that required Gould to sit on a low chair, now an exhibit in Ottawa\u2019s National Arts Centre. These recordings show how that sitting position influenced his technique, in tandem with his fingers\u2019 way of \u201cpulling down\u201d the keys rather than striking them, learned from his teacher Antonio Garcia Guerrero.

The superb 2019 world premiere of its orchestral version by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France is now available on-demand online and is a musical riot (at times almost literally). Three conductors marshal their forces through complex rhythmic layers, endings that are absurdly drawn out or appear at the wrong time and famous tunes that emerge rudely from unfamiliar surroundings only to become newly, shockingly beautiful. Flora Willson Adam\u2019s Passion (Arvo P\u00e4rt) This slo-mo collaboration between director Robert Wilson and composer Arvo P\u00e4rt, premiered in 2015 and filmed in a former submarine factory, might have been designed for our slo-mo existence. A naked man inches slowly towards a small piece of foliage which, after about half an hour, he places on his head. Picture an Antony Gormley figure brought to life, moving almost imperceptibly. Other figures glide in and out, poetically and mysteriously. All this is very beautiful, in a Wilson-esque fashion which may madden, but the unmissable treat is P\u00e4rt\u2019s haunting music: Adam\u2019s Lament, Miserere, Tabula Rasa and Sequentia, conducted by T\u00f5nu Kaljuste and performed by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and Tallinn Chamber Orchestra. Starring dancers Michalis Theophanous and Lucinda Childs. (Available on Marquee TV, currently offering 14 days free plus 30% off a year\u2019s subscription.) Fiona Maddocks Glenn Gould: Beethoven and Bach Thirty-eight years since the death of the pianist Glenn Gould, it sometimes seems that his idiosyncrasies risk being more noted than his musicianship. That was legendary. Gould was also a great talker \u2013 his conversations with Humphrey Burton are particularly revealing \u2013 and, in this Beethoven centenary year, his brief introduction to the performance of the D minor Sonata Op 31 No 2 is a good example of his erudite yet almost nonchalant style. It was apparently a boyhood accident that required Gould to sit on a low chair, now an exhibit in Ottawa\u2019s National Arts Centre. These recordings show how that sitting position influenced his technique, in tandem with his fingers\u2019 way of \u201cpulling down\u201d the keys rather than striking them, learned from his teacher Antonio Garcia Guerrero. The Beethoven interpretation won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, but Gould\u2019s characteristic clarity of line in Bach\u2019s Sixth Partita in E minor is exceptional. Rian Evans Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires (Op\u00e9ra National du Rhin) Astor Piazzolla\u2019s fierce, unclassifiable \u201ctango operita\u201d becomes a cabaret-cum-dance piece in Argentinian choreographer Matias Tripodi\u2019s mesmerising 2019 Strasbourg production. Using minimum props and the barest of stages, Tripodi jettisons some of the ornate symbolism with which Piazzolla and writer Horacio Ferrer saddle their heroine, in favour of a clear-minded approach to narrative and emotion in an interpretation that makes up in eroticism for what it sometimes lacks in genuine streetwise grit. The dancers of the Ballet de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra National du Rhin are very much the stars here, though Ana Karina Rossi sings Mar\u00eda\u2019s numbers with just the right mix of bravado and vulnerability as her life, death and eventual resurrection are observed by Alejandro Guyot\u2019s empathetic Duende and Stefan Sbonnik\u2019s more detached Singer. There\u2019s some tremendous bandoneon playing from Carmela Delgado, too. Tim Ashley Lockdown listening: classical music and opera to stream at home",

Now they\u2019re online.\u201d Those video art works include the challenging, such as Turner prize nominee Monster Chetwynd\u2019s The Call of the Wild, which follows a group of Edinburgh pattern-cutters as they travel to the Isle of Lewis while a death-metal style screech rings out. There are more whimsical projects, too, such as 2 Lizards videos by Meriem Bennani and Orian Barki, who are responding to the Covid-19 crisis in real time, via two animated lizards who comment on the crisis. Other work has accidentally dovetailed with the lockdown. Shana Moulton and Nick Hallett put their Whispering Pines 10 project, a series of videos about a woman living in seclusion, ongoing since 2002, online in response to the outbreak. Elsewhere, fourth plinth artist Heather Phillipson currently has video work on the Vdrome website, while LUX Gallery has put its exhibitions online and is streaming the work of Tanoa Sasraku. Cairns thinks the crisis could fundamentally change the way the public interact with art and make online videos a more attractive prospect for artists. \u201cThe dream used to be that your work was shown inside a gallery and the online work is a bit of a compromise,\u201d he says. \u201cI think people\u2019s appetites for video art will dramatically change after this and they\u2019re not going to shift back.\u201d London, who helped establish MoMA\u2019s video art collection in the 70s, believes that after the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions lift, video art could see a surge in popularity, as happened after the stock market crash in 1987, as galleries searched for new art forms to attract reticent buyers. \u201cThey took the plunge and started to host video art because they had nothing to lose,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter the crash you saw the Steve McQueens and the Isaac Juliens start to come through as the market took video art more seriously. It might happen again today.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, after another day dominated by the economic pain of the coronavirus. Hong Kong\u2019s economy has suffered its worst slump on record. GDP across the city state shrank by 5.3% in the first quarter of this year, extending its recession. The economy was 8.9% smaller than a year ago, as the pro-democracy protests and the US-China trade war also hit growth in recent months. Stock markets have dropped, after Donald Trump intensified his criticism of China over the coronavirus - and suggested he could impose new trade tariffs. Beijing has rejected the White House\u2019s claim that Covid-19 began in a Wuhan lab. America\u2019s manufacturing sector has been badly hit by the ongoing lockdowns, with new factory orders tumbling over 10% in March. The lockdown has also pushed US fashion retailer J Crew into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and prompted meat processing giant Tyson to warn of further disruption. Shares in US airlines have fallen after billionaire investor Warren Buffett revealed he has sold up. Investors in Norwegian Air have approved a rescue package. Goodnight. GW More bad news: America\u2019s General Electric is cutting as many as 13,000 jobs in its jet engine business. GE has announced it is accelerating its cost-cutting programme, and permanently reducing the Aviation division\u2019s global workforce by as much as 25% this year. The plan will include voluntary redundancies and compulsory layoffs, as the company reels from the shock of Covid-19. GE blamed the \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdeep contraction\u201d of the commercial aviation business, with GE Aviation CEO David Joyce telling staff that: \u201c[The] deep contraction of commercial aviation is unprecedented, affecting every customer worldwide. Global traffic is expected to be down approximately 80% in the second quarter.\u201d Although Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 only dropped 0.15% today, there are some chunky risers and fallers out there. The losers column is dominated by travel companies - with British Airways parent company IAG down 5% and easyJet losing 7.2%. Betting firm Flutter fell 4.9%, amid signs that UK sporting events will remain disrupted for some time. Top risers included pharmaceuticals firms Hikma (+5.8%) and GSK (+3.2%), and online grocer Ocado (+4.45% to a new closing high). Europe\u2019s stock markets have ended the day with solid losses. Worries that the US-China trade dispute might flare up again, amid Covid-19 recriminations, knocked all the major indices lower. After being on holiday on Friday, EU investors were also keen to catch up on last week\u2019s late selloff in London and New York. Here\u2019s the damage: German DAX: down 394 points or 3.9% at 10,466 French CAC: down 193 points or 4.2% at 4,378 Italian FTSE MIB: down 654 points or 3.7% at 17,035 Spanish IBEX: down 259 points or 3.6% at 6,673 The weak pound propped up major shares in London, though, where the FTSE 100 index only ended 9 points lower at 5,753. In New York, the Dow is still down - off 0.7% - but the technology-focused Nasdaq has gained 0.8%. Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA explains: \u2018Sell in May\u2019 continues as airlines get dumped, US-China tensions are back, and as the virus spread accelerates in some parts of the US as many states begin reopening. Reopening doubts are growing after President Trump had to acknowledge the virus was more lethal than initially thought. Trump, known for being overly optimistic, now sees the death toll from the coronavirus reaching as high as 100,000 in the US. The reason financial markets are not substantially lower is because tech giants are surging higher. Not everyone is Warren Buffett and will sit on a huge pile of cash. Investors are jumping out of airlines, financials and real estate and overloading on big-tech. Airlines might not see a return to prior crisis levels for a couple years and low interest rates are here for the foreseeable future. Good news for those nursing a sweet tooth through the lockdown -- high-end confectionery chain Hotel Chocolat is planning to reopen a few stores next week. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Hotel Chocolat is to reopen up to five stores next week \u2013 for takeaways only \u2013 after restarting production at its UK factory to help top up dwindling supplies. The specialist retailer and cafe operator said it will reopen first in Borough Market in London, serving hot chocolates, ice-creams and coffees, as it tests out new ways of working while protecting staff and customers from the spread of the coronavirus. The UK government has just reported that 6.3 million workers have been furloughed since the coronavirus crisis began. That\u2019s nearly a fifth of Britain\u2019s total workforce, I estimate (the employment total hit 33.07m in February). German car market are also feeling extremely worried about the future, due to the Covid-19 lockdown. A survey of the business climate in Germany\u2019s auto sector suffered its biggest slump in April, dropping from -13.2 to -85.4 -- the worst since the survey began in 1991. \u201cWe have never seen such bad figures for this key sector,\u201d said Klaus Wohlrabe, head of forecasting at Ifo, which produced the report. Bosses at German carmakers reported that orders, production expectations and export hopes all tumbled. More reaction to the tumble in demand for US factory goods: Here\u2019s Reuters take: New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in March and could sink further as disruptions from the novel coronavirus fracture supply chains and depress exports. The Commerce Department said on Monday factory orders dropped 10.3%. Data for February was revised down to show orders dipping 0.1% instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders tumbling 9.7% in March. Newsflash: America has suffered the biggest slump in factory orders on record. New factory orders fell by 10.3% in March. That\u2019s worst than expected, and the biggest decline on record. It tells us what we already knew -- America\u2019s economy is in a severe slump due to the global coronavirus pandemic, with weak demand from abroad and at home due to lockdowns and physical distancing. As feared, airline stocks are falling sharply after Warren Buffett revealed he\u2019d sold his stakes in the industry. American Airlines and SouthWest are down 6%, United has dropped 7% and Delta has lost 8%. Boeing is suffering too, down 4% as traders anticipate that demand for new planes will be weak for some time. The US stock market has opened lower, as fears of a new US-China trade war weigh on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped 1% in early trading, down 245 points at 23,478. That extends Friday\u2019s 622-point slide, meaning May has got off to poor start. Investors are anxious that the White House may impose new tariffs on China, given Donald Trump\u2019s latest criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis. Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at Kingswood, says the markets are returning to early after a sizzling rally in April. The sour market mood of the last couple of days has been triggered most obviously by the ratcheting up of tensions between the US and China. The US is now blaming China for a cover-up and even asserting the virus was developed in a Chinese lab. Trade tariffs, which were a major concern for the market for most of last year, are once again back in the headlines, with Trump now threatening to impose new tariffs on China. However, the latest market falls are also in part no real surprise given the strength of the rebound with markets gaining more than 25% in little more than a month. The recovery was the sharpest ever out of a bear market and has looked overdone. A stock market wobble is usually a busy time for Warren Buffett - the man who became super rich by being greedy when others are fearful (and vice versa). But not this time. Buffett told shareholders at his Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting that deal opportunities melted away after the US Federal Reserve announced its rescue packages last month. Buffett explained that the Fed\u2019s offers of huge, low-priced loans to help firms through the crisis meant his own chequebook wasn\u2019t needed. \u201cThere was a period right before the Fed acted, we were starting to get calls. They weren\u2019t attractive calls, but we were getting calls. And the companies we were getting calls from, after the Fed acted, a number of them were able to get money in the public market frankly at terms we wouldn\u2019t have given.\u201d This means Buffett is still sitting on a huge pile of cash - especially now he\u2019s sold his airlines shares. He reckons current valuations aren\u2019t attractive -- perhaps a sign that the market is going to head lower?... The covid-19 pandemic has pushed fashion chain J Crew to seek bankruptcy protection. Known for its \u2018preppy\u2019 range of mens and womenswear, J Crew has become the first major US retailer to be brought down by the virus. Demand for its sweaters, t-shirts, trousers and pencil skirts has slumped since shops were forced to close - and millions of Americans lost their jobs. Over in the US, meat processing giant Tyson Foods has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic will hurt its business this year. Tyson, a massive producer of chicken, beef and pork, has reported a 15% drop in profits in the last quarter - from $1.17 per share to $1. That\u2019s below forecasts. Tyson also told shareholders that its operations will be disrupted by the pandemic for some time: Given the nature of our business, demand for food and protein may shift amongst sales channels and experience short-term disruptions, but over time we expect worldwide demand to continue to increase. We are experiencing multiple challenges related to the pandemic. These challenges are anticipated to increase our operating costs and negatively impact our volumes for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Operationally, we have and expect to continue to face slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities from team member shortages or choices we make to ensure operational safety. The lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production we have experienced will likely continue in the short term until the effects of COVID-19 diminishes. Tyson has suspended operations at several plants in recent weeks, because workers contracted the virus. At one pork processing site in Indiana, almost 40% of staff were ill. Workers and unions have accused America\u2019s food industry of failing to protect workers, not supplying protective equipment, and covering up illnesses. Staff say they were unable to take time off when ill, because they wouldn\u2019t get paid - meaning viruses quickly spread across production lines. Shares are down 5% in pre-market trading. Feeling worried about life? You\u2019re not alone. More than 25 million people reported high levels of anxiety in late March as the decision to put the UK into lockdown triggered fears about health, job security and making ends meet among half the country\u2019s adult population. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said its regular update on wellbeing showed a more than doubling since late 2019 in the number of people over 16 reporting deep levels of concern and stress. More here: Shares in America\u2019s airlines are down over 10% in pre-market trading, after billionaire Warren Buffett revealed he\u2019d sold his stakes in the industry. On Saturday, Buffett said he\u2019d ditched his shares in Delta, American Airlines, Southwest and United following the Covid-19 pandemic. Buffett explained: \u201cWe made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. We will not fund a company \u2026 where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.\u201d Former American Airlines CEO Robert Crandall thinks Buffett is right. He told CNBC that the airline industry isn\u2019t \u2018investable\u2019 right now, and that it should be \u201csheltered\u201d so that it is there in future when people want to fly again. Norwegian Air\u2019s future is looking more secure this morning after investors backed an emergency rescue package. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The embattled carrier Norwegian Air will push ahead with its rescue plan and unlock government aid after winning support from shareholders, bondholders and aircraft lessors for a 10bn kroner (\u00a3770m) debt-for-equity swap. After a weekend of frantic talks, the airline\u2019s shareholders gathered at an emergency meeting in Oslo on Monday morning and voted 95% in favour of all proposals, including a 400m kroner share issue. The plan will hand majority ownership to the airline\u2019s creditors \u2013 bondholders and lessors \u2013 and leave shareholders with 5.2% of the company but there was no alternative, Norwegian\u2019s chief executive, Jacob Schram, said. Hong Kong\u2019s lurch deeper into recession hasn\u2019t brightened the mood in the markets. The main European indices are all sharply lower still, as investors worry about the escalating tensions between the US and China - and the threat of a new trade war. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has recovered some ground, but that\u2019s partly because the pound has dropped against the US dollar (down almost one cent to $1.242). That boosts multinationals. The FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK, is down 1.3%. [Reminder: European markets missed out on Friday\u2019s sell-off because they were closed for May Day]. Back in the UK, sugar and starch producer Tate &amp; Lyle has reported that sales were affected by the Covid-19 lock down. Sales of Tate &amp; Lyle\u2019s bulk sweeteners slumped by 26% in April, due to bars, cinemas, restaurants and sporting venues all shutting down. Volumes of the rather-unappetising sounding \u201cindustrial starch\u201d fell 9% -- due to \u201creduced demand for paper and packaging following the closure of schools, offices and a general decline in economic activity\u201d. But sales of \u2018food and beverage\u2019 products to consumers jumped 18% as people stocked up on staples (such as golden syrup and granulated sugar). Tate &amp; Lyle says: Earlier in the month, demand was strong for ingredients used in packaged and shelf-stable foods as consumers in North America and Europe filled their pantries for consumption at home. ING analyst Iris Pang fears that Hong Kong\u2019s recession will last longer than the Covid-19 pandemic. She suspects that the pro-democracy protests that gripped Hong Kong last year -- and badly damaged its tourism and retail sectors -- will return as the lockdown measures are eased. Last Friday, riot police clashed with demonstrators for the first time in several months - using pepper spray to disperse them from a shopping mall. Pang writes that such scenes could become more common again this year: Consumption contracted 10.3% YoY as opportunities for shopping and travel were severely curtailed during the Covid-19 outbreak. Investment contracted even more, by 13.9% YoY, as construction projects were delayed because outdoor work was prohibited. Even though the government spent money and imports dropped in 1Q20, this has not stopped the economy from contracting for three quarters in a row. Unlike other economies which may return to normal after Covid-19 subsides, Hong Kong has more challenges ahead. Pro-democracy protesters have returned to the streets and will affect shopping and catering businesses, as they did in the second half of 2019. It is expected that protests will become more violent and will increasingly hurt the retail sector. Unemployment has already gone up in retail and catering, and the protests mean that it will take longer for the unemployed to find another job in the same industry. This will lengthen the job search time and will therefore increase the unemployment rate. This chart shows that Hong Kong\u2019s economy has shrunk faster than in the global financial crisis of 2008, or after the Asia financial crisis a decade earlier: Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on Hong Kong\u2019s dire growth figures: Hong Kong\u2019s downturn is now the worst on record, extending the first recession seen in a decade as the coronavirus outbreak further battered an economy already weakened by political unrest. The city\u2019s economy contracted 8.9% in the first quarter from year-ago levels, according to advance government data. The decline surpasses the previous record of -8.3% in the third quarter of 1998 and a 7.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2009, the two worst quarterly readings in data back to 1974, according to the Census and Statistics Department Hong Kong. The latest decline also marks the third straight quarterly contraction for Hong Kong, the longest such stretch since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009. Hong Kong appears to have suffered its worst economic slump on record: Newsflash: Hong Kong\u2019s recession has deepened as the Covid-19 pandemic hits its economy. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP shrank by 5.3% in the first quarter of 2020, official figures show. That\u2019s a very sharp contraction, extending its economic downturn. On an annual basis, the City state\u2019s economy is now 8.9% smaller than a year ago - due to coronavirus shutdowns, last year\u2019s pro-democracy protests, and the US-China trade war (which may be flaring up again...) In a statement, Hong Kong\u2019s government said the pandemic had caused a \u201csevere contraction\u201d in global economy activity. It now fears the economy will shrink by 7% this year, and predicted that exports will remain under \u201cnotable pressure\u201d in the near term. France, Germany and the Netherland\u2019s manufacturing sectors also slumped last month, according to Markit\u2019s new survey of purchasing managers. They confirm the message from the \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs two weeks ago - activity contracted in April even faster than after the financial crisis: This has dragged the final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI down to 33.4, slightly worse than the flash reading of 33.6-- showing an extremely steep contraction (a reading of 50 would show activity was flat). Italy\u2019s factory sector also had a torrid April: Ouch. Spain\u2019s factory sector has suffered an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 slump last month. Output, new orders and purchasing activity all fell at a record pace last month, according the latest Spanish manufacturing PMI survey. Companies badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic are leading the fallers on the London stock market today. Travel firms are having a bad morning, with Intercontinental Hotels are down 6.5%, cruise operator Carnival down 65% and budget airline easyJet down 5%. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce are down 6.6%. That reflects rising concerns over the airline industry, after billionaire investor Warren Buffett revealed he\u2019s sold all his share in America\u2019s four largest US airlines. Top risers this morning include online grocer Ocado (+3.6%) and takeaway chain Just Eat (+2.1%), who are both in demand during the lockdown. China\u2019s Global Times, the state-controlled tabloid, has hit back at Washington\u2019s claims in an editorial today. It accuses US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of \u201cbluffing\u201d and trying to \u201cfool\u201d the American public, by claiming that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory in Wuhan. More here. European stock markets have opened in the red, as traders respond to the latest US criticism of China. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has dropped by 2.6%, with France\u2019s CAC and Germany\u2019s DAX both shedding 3%. Investors are scrambling to sell stocks having been on holiday last Friday (when the threat of a new US-China trade war emerged). In London, the FTSE 100 has dipped by 40 points, or 0.7%, to 5722. That\u2019s an eight-day low, meaning last week\u2019s brisk rally has been wiped out. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on factory output across Asia, new data shows. Data firm Markit has reported that manufacturing activity in India, Taiwan and South Korea slumped alarmingly last month, as the world economy lurched into recession: Worries about the global economy are weighing on the oil price this morning. US crude has dropped by 6% to $18.60 per barrel, while Brent crude is 1% lower at $26.19. The Trump administration is \u201cturbocharging\u201d an initiative to remove global industrial supply chains from China, according to Reuters this morning. They cite \u201cofficials familiar with U.S. planning\u201d, who say Washington wants US companies to move their supply chains away from China. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on [reducing the reliance of our supply chains in China] over the last few years but we are now turbo-charging that initiative,\u201d Keith Krach, undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment at the U.S. State Department told Reuters. \u201cI think it is essential to understand where the critical areas are and where critical bottlenecks exist,\u201d Krach said, adding that the matter was key to U.S. security and one the government could announce new action on soon. The threat of a new US-China trade war has knocked Asia-Pacific markets. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index slumped by almost 4%, after Donald Trump declared that new tariffs would be the \u2018ultimate punishment\u2019 for China. South Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 shed 3% and India\u2019s Sensex is down 5% (mainland China and Japan are both closed). Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says the Covid-19 \u2018blame game\u2019 is worrying the markets: Given it\u2019s a US election year this issue isn\u2019t likely to go away, especially as Joe Biden has suggested that Mr Trump is weak on China. However, on Thursday night and Friday it became a more immediate topic as the Washington Post reported that the US had held preliminary discussions to punish China for its role in the virus outbreak that included the possibility of the US cancelling its debt obligations with China. There was an immediate denial from Larry Kudlow who confirmed that the full faith and credit of US debt obligations is \u2018sacrosanct\u2019. Nevertheless, the risk of a cold war between the two nations seems to be building. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are jittery today after the White House intensified its criticism of China over the Covid-19 pandemic, fuelling fears of a new breakdown in relations between the two powers. Overnight, Donald Trump repeated his claim that the virus emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (something previously denied by China) and that Beijing couldn\u2019t \u201cput out the fire\u201d. He told Fox News: \u201cI think they made a horrible mistake and they didn\u2019t want to admit it... \u201cMy opinion is they made a mistake. They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out. It\u2019s like a fire. Trump also suggested that new tariffs on China could be the \u2018ultimate punishment for Beijing, as a penalty for bungling the coronavirus outbreak. Hours earlier, US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus outbreak originated in the laboratory -- without providing the proof to back up the claim. China seems likely to be a key issue in the US presidential election - especially as the president can\u2019t boast about the soaring stock market or the strongest economy in history. Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, writes: The US media is pointing to the growing possibility that China will be the focal point of the 2020 election campaign. Polls conducted by President Trump\u2019s campaign suggest that China will be an ongoing issue, according to Republican sources cited by Politico. The Democrats are examining a harder line on China to boost their chances. Either way, China will be in the US spotlight and not in a pleasant way. Fears of a new US-China trade war are overshadowing hopes that the global economy could tiptoe its way towards more normal conditions in the coming weeks. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to drop by 40 points, or over 0.5%, adding to Thursday and Friday\u2019s losses. There will be deeper sharper losses in continental Europe, where traders are playing catch-up after Friday\u2019s May Day holidays. Most countries have continues to report a slowdown in new cases and deaths from Covid-19 - with the global death toll now standing at over 247,000. Italy is starting to lift its lockdown today, but there is public disappointment and anger that travel is still restricted and some shops aren\u2019t allowed to open. The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for April: likely to confirm the worst downturn on record 9.30am BST: Hong Kong GDP for Q1 2020: likely to show another contraction 3pm BST: US factory orders: expected to fall around 10%",

Hancock had promised the UK would be carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of last month. It was announced on Friday that the target had been exceeded, but the number has since dropped back down. Another 288 die in Britain The UK death toll reaches 28,734 as 288 more people are confirmed to have died. Hancock says that is the smallest daily increase since the end of March, although he acknowledges that the daily reported rise in deaths tends to be lower on Mondays than later in the week. French hospital discovers case from December After retesting old samples from pneumonia patients, a French hospital discovers that it treated a man who had Covid-19 as early as 27 December; nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases. Millions of Italians allowed to return to work Millions of people are allowed to return to work in Italy as Europe\u2019s longest lockdown starts to ease. In all, 4.4 million Italians are able to return to work, and restrictions on movement are being eased. Italy\u2019s death toll far higher than reported Thousands of coronavirus-related deaths have never been officially attributed to the pandemic, says Italy\u2019s statistics bureau, Istat. In its first report of the impact on Italy\u2019s mortality rate, covering 86% of the population, it says that deaths were up 39% compared with the average of the previous five years. Internal report warns of anti-China sentiment An internal report warns that China faces a rising wave of hostility that could tip relations with the US into confrontation. According to Reuters, the report concludes that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest level since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. German cases vastly underestimated More than 10 times as many people in Germany have probably been infected than the number of confirmed cases, researchers from the University of Bonn conclude after a field trial in one of the worst hit towns. The preliminary study results, which have yet to be peer reviewed for publication in a scientific journal, serve as a reminder of the dangers of infection by unidentified carriers of the virus, the researchers say. Zimbabwe pleads for help to prevent \u2018catastrophe\u2019 The southern African nation is heading for a health and economic catastrophe because its debt arrears mean it cannot access foreign lenders, the finance minister warns in a letter to the IMF. Mthuli Ncube says Zimbabwe needs to start talks and normalise ties with foreign creditors to clear its decades-old arrears and unblock urgently needed funding. Austrian unemployment at all-time high The pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, according to official figures, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%. The blow to the economy dealt by the virus \u2013 and the lockdown brought in to combat it \u2013 means 571,477 people are out of work, Austria\u2019s AMS employment service says. World leaders pledge $8bn World leaders are promising $8bn (\u00a36.43bn) for the fight against the pandemic, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, says at the end of a pledging event she chaired. The EU will put \u20ac1bn (\u00a3877m) towards the global search for vaccines and treatment, while Norway and Germany also pledge significant funding for vaccine research and distribution.",

The NHS had about 8,000 ventilators available but the latest modelling, based on evidence from China, suggested that up to 30,000 would be needed, within a matter of weeks. During a conference call on Monday 16 March, dozens of manufacturers and medical device specialists were told the grim news and asked to launch a wartime-style effort \u2013 dubbed the ventilator challenge \u2013 to bridge the gap. Nearly seven weeks later, things look very different. The NHS has neither needed 30,000 ventilators, nor has it come close to calling on the 18,000 that health secretary Matt Hancock set as a revised target in early April. The inside story of what happened in this period is one of early panic and confusion, of companies with expertise clashing with those seizing the limelight with ambitions to innovate, of questionable designs, and the desperation of a government setting targets and then deciding it didn\u2019t need to meet them after all. The judgment as to whether ministers have made the right call will be made in the months to come. Either way, the clinicians and medical device experts who spoke to the Guardian say lessons have to be learned. The ventilator challenge began on Saturday 14 March, led by chief commercial officer, Gareth Rhys Williams, the civil servant who oversees state procurement. \u201cI got an email at midnight asking if I could call him [Rhys-Williams],\u201d said Nick Grey, a designer and inventor behind Worcestershire-based technology firm Gtech. \u201cHe said the PM had given him a special job: \u2018we\u2019re going to need up to 30,000 ventilators in two weeks, is that something you can help with?\u2019\u201d Building a modern high-quality machine from a standing start would, he believed, have been impossible.

Asking manufacturers to switch from cars or jet engines to specialist medical devices was unrealistic according to Craig Thompson, head of products at Oxfordshire firm Penlon, one of the few specialist ventilator firms in the country. But at this stage, according to Whitehall sources, ministers were desperate; they believed tens of thousands of people might require ventilation. Basic devices, however undesirable, might have to do. \u201cWe were of the view that we had to back every horse,\u201d said an adviser to a cabinet minister involved in the plans. The strategy was threefold; buy proven devices from the few small firms that made them, import some from overseas and, most importantly, look to the the ventilator challenge to deliver thousands more machines. Already though, some experts were concerned at how much credence was being given to the notion that non-specialist companies could build their own simple devices. \u201cThey [the government] were initially talking about a Manley-Blease-style ventilator,\u201d said a source at one specialist ventilator company. \u201cThey sent links to it.\u201d He was referring to a 1960s design by Roger Manley and the Blease Medical company, a major advance at the time but crude by modern standards.

Luckily for Covid-19 patients \u2013 not to mention the ministers overseeing the ventilator challenge \u2013 external factors came to the rescue. Only about half of Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care with breathing difficulties were being put on mechanical ventilators. Martin Allen, a consultant respiratory physician and board member of the British Thoracic Society, explained why. \u201cIn Wuhan, when they tried other ventilation strategies they failed.

What\u2019s been very noticeable is that we always seem to be one step behind on the policy. \u201cIf it\u2019s not ventilators it\u2019s tests, if it\u2019s not tests, it\u2019s PPE. It\u2019s an important lesson that we have to invest, to create overcapacity for these moments.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve really cut to the bone in this country far too much.\u201d",

Hair salons across Germany became the latest establishments to reopen their doors on Monday, answering a suppressed demand under lockdown for haircuts, as the country begins to gradually ease restrictions introduced in mid-March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Within hours of seating their first customers for a tint or a trim, many hairdressers and clients were starting to experience that reopening for trade did not necessarily mean business as usual. For one, salons have to abide by a series of new hygiene rules that will pose a challenge in particular to smaller businesses. Styling chairs have to be kept at a minimum distance of 1.5 metres from each other; washing hair before a cut is compulsory to help kill off possible viruses; magazines are not allowed in the waiting area, and customers can no longer expect a free coffee as they settle in. Face-to-face coiffeuring, such as beard trimming or eyebrow tinting, is banned. Hairdressers have to wear single-use aprons and disinfect their scissors and brushes between cuts. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work on top of the actual work,\u201d said Nuray Tanyel, who runs the small Mutter &amp; Tochter (Mother and Daughter) salon in the Bergmannkiez neighbourhood in Berlin.

In her small premises Tanyel can now only serve one customer at a time. \u201cIf it had been up to me, they might as well have kept us shut.\u201d Compulsory face masks for customers and stylists means visiting the hairdresser will become a less intimate ritual than it used to be. Jan Wellge booked a slot at Your Loving Nature for himself and his five-year-old daughter Sophie as soon as the government announced plans to reopen salons, in order to beat the rush: as of Monday there were no free slots at the salon until July. He conceded the masks, the lack of a friendly hug upon arrival and the hand-disinfecting rituals made it a more clinical experience than in the past. Nonetheless, Wellge, 39, said he was relieved to have his hair short again.

      "bodyText": "A Liberal senator has poured cold water on Scott Morrison\u2019s push for weapons inspector-style powers for the World Health Organization, arguing it could be counterproductive to focus on such reforms. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, a NSW senator with a long record of taking a hard line on Beijing, instead called on the Coalition government to lessen Australia\u2019s economic dependence on China and even to seek compensation for the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cThe push for an inspection regime is commendable, but it will be a \u2018herding cats exercise\u2019 especially given the UN veto power of China and Russia,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cIndeed, how many UN \u2018inspections\u2019 of totalitarian regimes have succeeded? Iraq? Iran? North Korea?\u201d Fierravanti-Wells said it could take years to advance the proposal on inspection powers and she was sceptical about the prospects of securing meaningful reforms. \u201cRather, it may be counterproductive to focus on this push and consequently delay focusing on those issues that are within our power to control, namely a plan for reparations and a plan to decouple from China,\u201d she said. The pointed comments come as the government is close to finishing a review on how Australia engages with a raft of international agencies including the WHO. This domestic \u201caudit\u201d is separate from Morrison\u2019s call for an independent international investigation into the origins of Covid-19 and its early handling \u2013 a move that has attracted fierce pushback from Beijing. Morrison has also sounded out a number of international allies on potential reforms to the WHO to ensure public health investigators could visit member countries to verify key facts about disease outbreaks, likening the powers to those of weapons inspectors dispatched by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the latest such call, the prime minister spoke to his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, on Sunday evening about the WHO. Hardliners within the Coalition hope the forthcoming review of Australia\u2019s international engagement will be an opportunity to wind back some funding and shift priorities \u2013 moves embraced over the past few years by Donald Trump, the US president. Fierravanti-Wells said there was growing scepticism in the Australian community about the effectiveness of the UN multilateral system, which she argued was \u201cmired by inefficiencies, duplication and undue political influences\u201d. She said the Covid-19 pandemic had demonstrated \u201cthat when push came to shove, countries made their own decisions\u201d. Referring to Morrison\u2019s comments to the Lowy Institute last year that freedom depended on dedication to national sovereignty, Fierravanti-Wells said that could only now be achieved through a serious reassessment of Australia\u2019s international engagement. \u201cFor a start, Australians will expect that it will not be \u2018business as usual\u2019 with the communist regime in China,\u201d she said. While Australia\u2019s policy is to support Taiwan\u2019s observer status at the WHO, she called on the government to go further and review the one-China policy \u201cand formally recognise Taiwan\u201d. Such a policy shift \u2013 in the unlikely event the government pursued it \u2013 would dramatically escalate tensions between Canberra and Beijing. Fierravanti-Wells, who served as minister for international development and the Pacific from February 2016 until August 2018 when she quit after backing Peter Dutton in the leadership spill, once caused a stir with her accusations about China saddling up Pacific countries with debts and building \u201croads to nowhere\u201d. At the time the Chinese foreign ministry hit back at the \u201cirresponsible remarks\u201d. Fierravanti-Wells said on Monday she had been \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d when she had issued those warnings in early 2018, but noted some of her Coalition colleagues were now becoming more concerned about China. \u201cI am pleased to see more colleagues finally speaking out, albeit somewhat opportunistically getting on the bandwagon,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose better late than never. Whether they will have the political stamina to sustain the push for reparations and decoupling from China remains to be seen.\u201d Fierravanti-Wells said the Australian government needed to be more strategic in how it committed taxpayer funding, and may need to consider a shift from multilateral efforts to greater bilateral engagements where it was in the national interest to do so. Priority should be given to building resilience in Pacific countries, she added. Morrison said last month that the report by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would be \u201ccoming back very soon\u201d and Australia was \u201calways going to consider where we put our funds and we always want value for money\u201d. Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, has argued Australia cannot afford to turn its back on global bodies, noting it needed international cooperation because it was not a superpower that could just throw its weight around. Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister, said last week he was sceptical of the government\u2019s review because centre-right and far-right parties around the world saw attacking the UN as \u201cgood raw meat to throw out to the would-be nationalist political constituencies within your countries in order to bolster your own domestic political base\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The federal and Victorian governments are in disagreement over whether it is safe for students and teachers to return to school, as a number of other states prepare for their students to come back to class. While New South Wales and Queensland are planning a phased return to on-site schooling, Victoria is holding steadfast against bringing students, other than those from essential workers, back into the classroom. The matter blew up on Sunday when federal education minister Dan Tehan was forced to withdraw comments he made on the ABC questioning Victorian premier Daniel Andrews\u2019 leadership over the split on the issue, stating Andrews should be listening to the national health panel, not just his chief health officer. Here\u2019s where the state and federal governments disagree: What is the federal advice? The advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, on which the Victorian chief health officer also sits, says there is \u201cvery limited evidence\u201d of transmission between children in a school environment. On Sunday, chief medical officer Brendan Murphy pointed to research about school transmissions of coronavirus both locally in NSW and in Europe. \u201cOur advice is transmission between children in schools is not well established,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in fact there is increasing data now, data from Europe and the NSW study, we think children are not high transmitters of the virus in the school environment.\u201d He said there is a potential risk for adults in the staffroom, and at drop-offs, and a range of mitigations have been recommended to reduce the risk. What does the NSW study say? The NSW study, released last month, assessed the initial 18 cases between March and April of teachers and students testing positive for coronavirus. The study looked at 735 students and 128 staff who were close contacts of the 18 cases. No teacher or staff member contracted coronvirus from those cases, and one child from a primary school and one child from a high school may have contracted coronavirus from one of the initial 18 cases. \u201cThe findings from this detailed investigation are preliminary. However, they do suggest that spread of Covid-19 within NSW schools has been very limited.\u201d What do international studies say? Murphy admits that studies have been limited, but has pointed specifically to studies out of Europe to support the AHPPC position. A study out of the Netherlands reported children are less likely to get infected from the virus from adults, and adults are much less likely to pass it on to children, except in a home environment. A UK study of a child who returned from the French Alps with coronavirus, and subsequently went to three schools while asymptomatic and did not transmit the virus argued it could lend evidence to the notion the transmission rate for children might be different to adults. An analysis of over 100 studies that have been done on coronavirus transmission stated there is limited evidence of children transmitting the virus, but more data is needed. \u201cThe role of children in transmission is unclear, but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection, and lower rates of children bringing infections into households,\u201d the analysis states. However, German research released last month suggested children can be as infectious as adults. Why does Victoria disagree with the federal government\u2019s position? Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton has said he doesn\u2019t disagree that infection rates among children are lower, but he viewed keeping schools closed as a measure to lower overall community transmission, particularly for teachers, staff and parents. \u201cI know there haven\u2019t been significant outbreaks in schools ... but again it may be that kids who are very minimally symptomatic could transmit to other children, and it can be a contribution to community transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve also been very clear that I don\u2019t see schools as a dangerous place to be, but to the extent that kids learning from home can contribute to suppressing transmission at a community level, I think that\u2019s a useful thing to consider.\u201d Andrews has said his decision on schools will be based on Sutton\u2019s advice and Sutton has refused to reconsider his advice on sending children back to school until the state of emergency is reviewed on 11 May. There have been indications that students in Victoria could stay learning from home for the entirety of term two. What is the AHPPC advice on schools? These are the seven principles from the AHPPC on schooling, agreed by all state and territory chief health officers: 1. Our schools are critical to the delivery of high-quality education for students and to give our children the best possible start in life. Our education systems are based on the recognition that education is best delivered by professional teachers to students in the classroom on a school campus. 2. It is accepted that during the Covid-19 crisis, alternative flexible, remote delivery of education services may be needed. 3. Our schools must be healthy and safe environments for students, teachers and other staff to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of education to students. 4. State and territory governments and non-government sector authorities are responsible for managing and making operational decisions for their school systems respectively, subject to compliance with relevant funding agreements with the commonwealth. 5. Decisions regarding the response to Covid-19 in the schooling sector must continue to be informed by expert, official, national and state-based public health and education advice, consistent with these national principles. 6. All students must continue to be supported by their school to ensure participation in quality education during the Covid-19 crisis. 7. The health advice consistently provided by the AHPPC is that attendance at a school campus for education represents a very low health risk to students. The advice also notes that appropriate practices must be employed at schools, like at other workplaces, to provide a safe working environment for school staff, including teachers, and that the specific AHPPC advice regarding school campuses should be followed. What can be done to protect teachers? The AHPPC has set out advice on what can be done at schools to protect everyone within the school, including staggering start and finish times, smaller classes, physical distancing in staff rooms, and cancelling of group work, school excursions and other activities where 1.5m physical distancing can\u2019t be enforced. The advice does not recommend use of personal protective equipment or temperature checks for students on entry into schools. Queensland is staggering its return of students over a couple of weeks, as well as implementing social-distancing measures. NSW is slowly phasing back classes, starting at one day per week, working towards five days per week. Why is the federal government pushing for schools to go back? Tehan and prime minister Scott Morrison have repeated that studies have shown the best place for a student to learn is in a classroom, and have raised concerns about the impact on learning for students should home-learning continue for the remainder of the term.",

      "bodyText": "The treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the current restrictions Australian governments have adopted to stop the spread of coronavirus \u2013 restrictions likely to taper down from this Friday \u2013 are resulting in a reduction in economic activity worth $4bn per week. Frydenberg will use a speech to the National Press Club on Tuesday to warn the economic shock associated with Covid-19 will be both profound and prolonged, with Treasury estimating a 10 to 12% fall in gross domestic product during the June quarter alone. According to a speech extract circulated in advance, Frydenberg will say the negative economic impact here would have been more profound if Australia had followed Europe in imposing broader lockdowns of all non-essential services. \u201cIf these restrictions were increased even further, akin to the eight week lockdown in Europe, then the adverse impact on GDP could double to 24%, or $120bn, in the June quarter. \u201cThis would have seen enormous stress on our financial system as a result of increased balance sheet impairments, widespread firm closures, higher unemployment and household debt. This was the cliff we were standing on.\u201d But he says for every extra week the current restrictions remain in place, Treasury estimates that we will see close to a $4bn reduction in economic activity from a combination of reduced workforce participation, productivity and consumption. The treasurer\u2019s speech to the National Press Club coincides with a meeting of the national cabinet to consider easing the current restrictions, one of two deliberations scheduled this week. It is expected governments will start easing the lockdowns later this week.

      "bodyText": "The government does not plan to extend daily Covid-19 testing to all aged-care staff across the country, despite the ramped-up tactic being used to contain an outbreak at a facility in Sydney. All staff at the Newmarch House aged care home now come under daily testing for the virus after a NSW Health review into a wave of infections last week had shown possible breaches of safety protocol \u201camongst particularly the staff\u201d. However, in all other aged-care facilities, the government only requires staff and residents to be tested for Covid-19 once \u201cthere are two or more people with fever and respiratory symptoms in the setting\u201d. If there are no reported symptoms in their facility, aged care workers are not required to get tested. While not explicitly calling for daily testing of every aged-care worker, leaders of organisations representing providers and older Australians have called for more frequent testing, and stressed the importance of training care workers about how to properly wear personal protective equipment amid reports there had been breaches. Their calls came as Labor pushed for the aged-care royal commission \u2013 which has already been extended to consider the impact of Covid-19 \u2013 to specifically investigate \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d at Newmarch House. On Monday afternoon, the 15th resident death at Newmarch House was announced, with 63 confirmed Covid-19 cases among staff and residents having developed since the first worker was diagnosed on 11 April after working six shifts with mild symptoms. Asked if he was considering enforcing daily testing of all workers in the sector, the aged-care minister, Richard Colbeck, told the Guardian his government had \u201cmade provisions allowing any staff member in an aged care facility to get tested for Covid-19 should they suspect they have symptoms or just for peace of mind\u201d. Labor\u2019s aged-care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, told the Guardian \u201cit is clear the government needs to do more to protect older Australians in aged care from coronavirus\u201d, citing \u201ctimely testing of staff and residents\u201d and ensuring all staff \u201chave access to personal protective equipment and are adequately trained.\u201d Industry groups are providing consultation over a national code for aged-care visitation announced by Colbeck on Friday. On 18 March the national cabinet announced rules placing strict limitations on the number of visitors allowed inside aged-care homes. The rules have meant visits are limited to two adult visitors at one time per day inside a resident\u2019s room, and as of 1 May, any worker or visitor to an aged care facility must have had a flu vaccine. However, some aged-care providers \u201cdecided to go further\u201d and went into \u201cpreventative lockdown\u201d because they felt they couldn\u2019t control an outbreak, according to the Aged and Community Services Australia CEO, Patricia Sparrow. She also told the Guardian that many aged-care providers were concerned about the cost of PPE to ensure safe visitation, and said ACSA was now focussing on making sure aged-care workers were trained to use PPE properly. \u201cPPE can be quite difficult to use. I know in hospitals they\u2019re doing daily training, it\u2019s not as easy to use as people think \u2026 so we\u2019re focussed pretty heavily on training staff.\u201d Sparrow said testing at aged-care homes is conducted by outside pathology providers and funded by the government, and that while increased testing \u201chas to be part of the answer going forward\u201d, \u201cwe would need support for that to continue\u201d. She said the sector was taking advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee that advises national cabinet, and said it would only call for daily testing of all aged carers if the committee recommended it. Ian Yates, chief executive of the Council on the Ageing, also said he would follow AHPPC advice on daily testing, but said \u201cthe strictest hygiene measures have to be in place at every aged care facility, even if there is no Covid happening\u201d. \u201cThere is a concern that complacency can slip in and the worst place for it to slip in is staff, because unlike visitors staff are circulating throughout the facility and they\u2019re there all day.\u201d Yates said he would be concerned if aged-care staff did not yet know how to properly wear PPE \u201cbecause if you have an outbreak it\u2019s too late to start training staff how to use it\u201d.",

Indeed, it has been suggested that gatherings could be limited to 10 people until next year, which, according to World Rugby\u2019s guidelines, could mean no competitive matches at all until 2021. If they are permitted, it is suggested they take place without large scale crowds, until a vaccine is readily available, which could take up to 18 months. \u201cLarge traditional crowds are unlikely in the absence of an effective and freely available vaccine for Covid-19,\u201d reads the document, compiled by Eanna Falvey, Prav Mathema, Mary Horgan and Martin Rafferty.</p> <p>After he was re-elected as World Rugby\u2019s chairman, Bill Beaumont explained how a bumper set of autumn fixtures was likely with the July tours certain to be cancelled and potentially rescheduled for October. Playing all matches behind closed doors would come as a financial hammer blow to the Rugby Football Union and the rest of the home nations, however. The RFU can generate around \u00a310m from Twickenham tests and the forecast \u00a350m losses over the next 18 months are based on the assumption that England\u2019s four November matches go ahead as planned.</p> <p>Premiership Rugby, meanwhile, has been working towards a best-case scenario of restarting in early July but the guidelines \u2013 designed to provide a framework for clubs and unions to be used alongside the advice of respective governments \u2013 warn against competitive matches until social distancing measures have been significantly relaxed. \u201cWe have outlined a graded return to match-play plan which runs parallel to reduction in [restrictions],\u201d the guidelines continue. \u201cWhen social distancing has been reduced to allow close contact and public gatherings of up to 250 people, match play is possible, but spectators will not be permitted to attend.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before competitive matches return however, World Rugby details a graduation process of clubs and unions returning to full contact training.

Premiership clubs have advised players to prepare for the first stage of training from 1 June but World Rugby advises against handshakes and hugging, while a distance of 1.5 metres should be kept between players and face masks should be worn when possible.</p> <p>When gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed, full squad training would be permitted but daily screening would be necessary and World Rugby warns \u201cif a player or staff becomes an infected person each other player and staff member would be close contacts and will require testing and quarantine\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Elite rugby matches are likely to be played behind closed doors until an effective coronavirus vaccine is freely available, according to guidelines released by World Rugby. The document, compiled by World Rugby\u2019s leading medical experts, raises the possibility of the autumn Tests, next year\u2019s Six Nations and even the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of South Africa being played in empty stadiums or in front of radically reduced attendances. The guidelines also advise that no competitive matches should even take place until governments allow gatherings of 250 people, casting major doubt on the completion of the 2019-20 Premiership season. On Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to announce a gradual easing of the lockdown but it is highly likely that only small gatherings will be allowed. Indeed, it has been suggested that gatherings could be limited to 10 people until next year, which, according to World Rugby\u2019s guidelines, could mean no competitive matches at all until 2021. If they are permitted, it is suggested they take place without large scale crowds, until a vaccine is readily available, which could take up to 18 months. \u201cLarge traditional crowds are unlikely in the absence of an effective and freely available vaccine for Covid-19,\u201d reads the document, compiled by Eanna Falvey, Prav Mathema, Mary Horgan and Martin Rafferty. After he was re-elected as World Rugby\u2019s chairman, Bill Beaumont explained how a bumper set of autumn fixtures was likely with the July tours certain to be cancelled and potentially rescheduled for October. Playing all matches behind closed doors would come as a financial hammer blow to the Rugby Football Union and the rest of the home nations, however. The RFU can generate around \u00a310m from Twickenham tests and the forecast \u00a350m losses over the next 18 months are based on the assumption that England\u2019s four November matches go ahead as planned. Premiership Rugby, meanwhile, has been working towards a best-case scenario of restarting in early July but the guidelines \u2013 designed to provide a framework for clubs and unions to be used alongside the advice of respective governments \u2013 warn against competitive matches until social distancing measures have been significantly relaxed. \u201cWe have outlined a graded return to match-play plan which runs parallel to reduction in [restrictions],\u201d the guidelines continue. \u201cWhen social distancing has been reduced to allow close contact and public gatherings of up to 250 people, match play is possible, but spectators will not be permitted to attend.\u201d Before competitive matches return however, World Rugby details a graduation process of clubs and unions returning to full contact training. When gatherings of 10 people are allowed, World Rugby advises that individual and a small group training would be allowed \u201cin a staggered manner according to a country\u2019s healthcare system and testing capacity\u201d. Premiership clubs have advised players to prepare for the first stage of training from 1 June but World Rugby advises against handshakes and hugging, while a distance of 1.5 metres should be kept between players and face masks should be worn when possible. When gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed, full squad training would be permitted but daily screening would be necessary and World Rugby warns \u201cif a player or staff becomes an infected person each other player and staff member would be close contacts and will require testing and quarantine\u201d.",

As the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, begins tentatively to reopen the economy, the employees of Ferrari and Lamborghini are returning to their factories, along with other workers in the manufacturing and construction industries. Shops will open in two weeks\u2019 time; bars and hairdressers in June. Italians are able to exercise freely at last, stroll through late spring sunshine and visit relatives.</p> <p>Given Italy\u2019s role as a pioneer in the grim endurance test of lockdown, this moment of release feels like a minor landmark. As the northern region of Lombardy became the early European centre of the coronavirus pandemic, its suffering opened a continent\u2019s eyes to the peril that it faced. Images of overwhelmed intensive care units and reports of dying health workers galvanised politicians across Europe. Restrictions were placed on populations that would have been flinched at in late February. On Sunday, Italy reported a daily death toll of 174, the lowest figure since 10 March, confirming that the worst is over for now.</p> <p>That downward trend justifies Mr Conte\u2019s relaxation of restrictions. But it may be that, as Europe enters the post-lockdown phase of the coronavirus crisis, Italy will have more cautionary tales to offer. The gradualism of Mr Conte\u2019s post-lockdown approach has prompted anger and anxiety as well as relief. One poll found <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/europe/259822-italy-begins-emerge-world-longest-nationwide-lockdown\" title=\"\">that 62% of Italians</a> think they will need psychological support in the coming period, as the government attempts to navigate a public health crisis and an economic meltdown at the same time.</p> <p>The scale of the prime minister\u2019s task is gargantuan. In the first quarter of the year, Italy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9ff5328-dbfc-3297-889e-8f0e9ad797fb\" title=\"\">economy shrank</a> by close to 5% \u2013 the steepest contraction ever recorded by the Office for National Statistics. Tourism, a vital source of revenue, is down by 95%. With the aviation industry on its knees, there is no likelihood of a significant upturn any time soon. The mood in the hospitality sector, at the back of the queue as the country tentatively opens up, is fearful and mutinous. In Florence and other cities, angry bar owners, restaurateurs and other small business owners <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/europe-s-wary-reopening-begins-with-apology-by-italian-leader?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">handed store</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/europe-s-wary-reopening-begins-with-apology-by-italian-leader?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">keys</a> over to local mayors, after learning that they would not be part of the first post-lockdown wave.</p> <p>Opposition MPs, led by the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, staged an occupation of parliament on 1 May, calling for a quicker exit from lockdown restrictions. Some members of Mr Conte\u2019s own coalition agree that the pace must be upped. Last week the ratings agency Fitch <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-29/italian-bonds-on-edge-after-fitch-s-out-of-cycle-downgrade?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">downgraded</a> Italian bonds to one level above junk status, making the huge and rising national debt less sustainable to maintain. Meanwhile, northern European states have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/eurozone-fails-to-agree-on-540bn-coronavirus-rescue-plan\" title=\"\">conspicuously reluctant</a> to share the burden by issuing mutualised debt in the form of so-called coronabonds.</p> <p>In a multifaceted crisis that is only reaching the end of its beginning, there will be no neat endings or satisfying story arcs. Back in March, there was admiration for the colourful displays of collective Italian defiance under lockdown. From the display of rainbow banners bearing the legend \u201ceverything is going to be fine\u201d to balcony singing, people found ways to express hope and solidarity. Italians are back in the streets. But in a context of psychological fragility and extreme economic distress, Mr Conte must now find a way to take the measures required to salvage businesses and livelihoods, while protecting his country from a second wave of infections and deaths. It is a dilemma that the British government will soon share.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are living in the night of the virus,\u201d wrote one academic, soon after Europe\u2019s first Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in Italy. \u201cLiving in the dark, because it\u2019s difficult to see what\u2019s happening out there, since we are shut up in our homes.\u201d On Monday Italians entered blinking into the light again, after nine weeks of more or less total confinement, enforced by a combination of fines and moral exhortation. As the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, begins tentatively to reopen the economy, the employees of Ferrari and Lamborghini are returning to their factories, along with other workers in the manufacturing and construction industries. Shops will open in two weeks\u2019 time; bars and hairdressers in June. Italians are able to exercise freely at last, stroll through late spring sunshine and visit relatives. Given Italy\u2019s role as a pioneer in the grim endurance test of lockdown, this moment of release feels like a minor landmark. As the northern region of Lombardy became the early European centre of the coronavirus pandemic, its suffering opened a continent\u2019s eyes to the peril that it faced. Images of overwhelmed intensive care units and reports of dying health workers galvanised politicians across Europe. Restrictions were placed on populations that would have been flinched at in late February. On Sunday, Italy reported a daily death toll of 174, the lowest figure since 10 March, confirming that the worst is over for now. That downward trend justifies Mr Conte\u2019s relaxation of restrictions. But it may be that, as Europe enters the post-lockdown phase of the coronavirus crisis, Italy will have more cautionary tales to offer. The gradualism of Mr Conte\u2019s post-lockdown approach has prompted anger and anxiety as well as relief. One poll found that 62% of Italians think they will need psychological support in the coming period, as the government attempts to navigate a public health crisis and an economic meltdown at the same time. The scale of the prime minister\u2019s task is gargantuan. In the first quarter of the year, Italy\u2019s economy shrank by close to 5% \u2013 the steepest contraction ever recorded by the Office for National Statistics. Tourism, a vital source of revenue, is down by 95%. With the aviation industry on its knees, there is no likelihood of a significant upturn any time soon. The mood in the hospitality sector, at the back of the queue as the country tentatively opens up, is fearful and mutinous. In Florence and other cities, angry bar owners, restaurateurs and other small business owners handed store keys over to local mayors, after learning that they would not be part of the first post-lockdown wave. Opposition MPs, led by the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, staged an occupation of parliament on 1 May, calling for a quicker exit from lockdown restrictions. Some members of Mr Conte\u2019s own coalition agree that the pace must be upped. Last week the ratings agency Fitch downgraded Italian bonds to one level above junk status, making the huge and rising national debt less sustainable to maintain. Meanwhile, northern European states have been conspicuously reluctant to share the burden by issuing mutualised debt in the form of so-called coronabonds. In a multifaceted crisis that is only reaching the end of its beginning, there will be no neat endings or satisfying story arcs. Back in March, there was admiration for the colourful displays of collective Italian defiance under lockdown. From the display of rainbow banners bearing the legend \u201ceverything is going to be fine\u201d to balcony singing, people found ways to express hope and solidarity. Italians are back in the streets. But in a context of psychological fragility and extreme economic distress, Mr Conte must now find a way to take the measures required to salvage businesses and livelihoods, while protecting his country from a second wave of infections and deaths. It is a dilemma that the British government will soon share.",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street is facing fresh calls for transparency about the expert advice it receives after it published the names of 50 experts who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which discusses how to handle the coronavirus epidemic. The list of names, which is not complete, was released after critics raised questions about the secrecy of Sage and the Guardian revealed that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, had played an active role in Sage meetings. The group\u2019s membership and the nature of its advice have come under scrutiny, with critics arguing that Britain has botched key aspects of its pandemic response even as ministers claimed they were following \u201cthe best science\u201d. The list contains the bulk of the Sage membership as well as the names of experts who sit on subgroups that specialise in issues such as outbreak modelling, behavioural science and the spread of infection in schools and hospitals. The list includes 24 instances of people asking for their names not to be made public, though some may be duplicates, as experts can sit on more than one group. Two members of Sage asked not to be named. Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, has warned that the purity of the scientific advice reaching the prime minister is being put at risk by the presence of political appointees such as Cummings. He said publication of the names was \u201ca good first step\u201d but not enough to reassure people. \u201cWhat we want to see is what Sage is discussing, what their advice is, what the advice of the scientists is as distinct from that of the strategy advisers. It\u2019s certainly a good step, but there\u2019s a lot more to be done,\u201d he said. On Monday, King convened the first open meeting of an \u201cindependent Sage\u201d group, with a dozen experts whose names were made public beforehand. Around half of the members of Sage are scientific advisers from government departments, public health officials and senior NHS staff, with the other half coming from universities, the list shows. The members include David Halpern, head of the Cabinet Office\u2019s behavioural insights team, or \u201cnudge unit\u201d, Prof Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, who attends as chair of the society\u2019s Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (Delve) Group, and Prof David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University. The government stated that while the meetings were \u201cregularly attended by officials from Her Majesty\u2019s government\u201d, their names were excluded from the publication list, though it did not explain why. The advisory group is co-chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer. The names were not made public before, Vallance has said, because of concerns over members\u2019 personal security and fears of outside influence. James Wilsdon, digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said publication of the names was \u201ca welcome step\u201d adding that \u201copenness and transparency must now become the default operating mode across the Sage process\u201d. \u201cToo much rests on the interpretation of evidence, dilemmas and uncertainties in this crisis for the process to take place behind closed doors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation of what some call \u2018post-normal\u2019 science, where the facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, stakes are high and decisions are urgent. \u201cWe need Sage to respond accordingly, start treating the public as grown-ups, and throw open its workings to wider engagement, debate and scrutiny,\u201d he added. Philip Bath, professor of stroke medicine at Nottingham University, said: \u201cIt is very important to see who is involved in Sage and its supporting groups so that the public know who is involved, their expertise and whether they are representative of the population in respect of geography and protected characteristics.\u201d He said he was struck by how many of the experts came from the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of London, Oxford and Cambridge, and why experts were not drawn from around the UK. He said the list should be improved by naming each expert\u2019s \u201cbase speciality\u201d, including for those who did not agree to be named. Derek Hill, an expert in medicine and medical device regulation at University College London, said that given the importance of medical devices in dealing with Covid-19, from personal protective equipment to temperature sensors to ventilators, Sage appeared to lack expertise on medical devices and the regulatory system. \u201cThis is very relevant as it impacts the risk associated with implementing some aspects of Sage advice, which should be captured in such advice. Such experts are likely to have an engineering background, and are likely to have experience in industries well as academia,\u201d he said.",

That\u2019s a second day where the headline total has fallen below 100,000, the target for the end of April.</li> \n   <li>The work and pensions secretary, <strong>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se</strong><strong> Coffey, </strong>has been updating MPs on her department\u2019s work in tackling the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. She said the \u201chidden heroes\u201d in her department had processed an extraordinary 1.8m new claims for universal credit (UC) since mid-March \u2013 as well as 250,000 claims for jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA), and 20,000 for employment support allowance (ESA).</li> \n   <li><strong>Councils could restrict access to rubbish tips by only allowing cars</strong> with particular number plates to visit on a given day, the local government secretary has said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Last week MPs on the Commons culture committee had a frustrating time at a hearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/tech-firms-criticised-for-lack-of-answers-on-covid-19-disinformation\">when they tried to get answers from representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter</a></strong> about what they were doing to halt the spread of disinformation about coronavirus.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that from tonight contact tracing will go live in the Isle of Wight. </strong>A new government app that will alert people if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus is being piloted on the island, and Hancock urged islanders to dowload it. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island, from tonight the contact tracing capability will go live and from tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be able to install the app.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Addressing islanders directly, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By downloading the app you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said he would hire more than the 18,000 contact tracers already being recruited if necessary.</strong> That was just the initial number being trained this month to operate contact tracing on a national basis, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no magic around the 18,000 figure, that is the initial scale that we think is necessary.</p> \n   <p>If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that is in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is \u2013 the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests \u2013 then we will adjust that figure.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said, although the contact tracing scheme would help the government to suppress the coronavirus, the national system did not have to be in place before lockdown measures could be eased.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We haven\u2019t said we can\u2019t make changes [to lockdown] before [contact tracing] is up and running. It is just that the test, track and trace system will help us get R [the reproduction number] down and the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 85,186 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. </strong>That means, for the second day in a row, the government has failed to hit the target of 100,000 tests a day set for the end of April.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said that it would take some time before scientists find out whether people who have had coronavirus develop immunity.</strong> But \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of people who have had it have antibodies, a precursor for immunity, he said. Hancock revealed that, as someone who has had the illness himself, he is taking part in trials to check his antibody levels. But he said he would not feel confident going into a crowded room because he could not assume he was immune. And he could not make policy yet on the basis that people with the antibody are immune, he said.

We had to contact IQVIA again who assured us someone would turn up to take our blood and swabs the next day. Again, they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bernie Spratt said: \u201cWe replied to the invitation on 23 April and were given a home visit date of 27 April when an IQVIA nurse would arrive and test us both. Nobody arrived so we phoned the study contact line and rebooked for Thursday the 30th. Once again nobody arrived so we re-booked for Saturday 2 May.

The Daily Express was one of a number of national newspapers to carry the prime minister\u2019s call for the world to work together to find a cure for Covid-19 on their front pages, with its headline reading: \u201cBoris leads \u00a36bn global race for vaccine.\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Paul Blomfield, Gove told parliament: \u201cWe will cooperate not just with our European neighbours but with other countries in the fight against Covid-19. He\u2019s right to say the prime minister is joining the call today in order to ensure that we can support the effort to secure a vaccine. The effort to secure a vaccine is necessarily an international one.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Blomfield asked Gove if, given the UK\u2019s involvement with the EU\u2019s initiative, the government would be joining the bloc\u2019s early warning and response system (EWRS) for pandemics, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/02/uk-seeks-access-to-eu-health-cooperation-in-light-of-coronavirus?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">The Guardian reported this weekend</a> that the British government was quietly seeking to access the EWRS, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit.<br>Gove dodged the question about the EWRS, but said: \u201cWe will of course look pragmatically at how we can co-operate with our European friends and partners. But participation in the EMA would involve, certainly at the moment, the acceptance of the ECJ (European court of justice) oversight and that\u2019s not something that the British people voted to do.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Commenting on Gove\u2019s response, Blomfield said. \u201cMichael Gove was right to recognise this international partnership to find a coronavirus vaccine as an EU initiative and not a Boris Johnson project as claimed by some of the Conservative press. But he should also pledge to join the EU\u2019s pandemic early warning system, as the NHS wants, and think again about leaving the European Medicines Agency.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T18:16:30.917Z\">at 7.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb049178f08a69c6c689ac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T16:57:25.843Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Given the lockdown still applies on the Isle of Wight, will it generate enough data for the app?</em></p> \n  <p>Hancock says he thinks it will.

Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As lockdown is eased, ensuring that those who could work from home reasonably productively are doing so should be a policy priority. It dampens the trade-off between the level of economic activity and the rate of virus transmission.

In a statement she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace</p> \n   <p>It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down. I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill health.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is important because the general secretary runs Labour HQ and Formby\u2019s resignation means that Sir Keir Starmer can now install one of his own allies in the post. Formby, who worked for Unite before becoming general secretary in 2018, was close to Jeremy Corbyn and his faction in the party. In the Conservative party a new leader is free to install his or her acolytes in top jobs at party HQ but in the Labour party the general secretary is more independent, and harder to move if he or she has the backing of the national executive committee. It took Corbyn more than two years to instal a general secretary viewed as a loyalist.</p> \n  <p>Paying tribute to Formby, Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for.</p> \n   <p>Jennie has led our party\u2019s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year.

In the letter to the complainant, who is not named in the report, Burns also suggested that he might raise the case in the Commons chamber using parliamentary privilege if his father did not get the money he felt was owed to him.</p> \n  <p>In his conclusion the standards committee said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Like the [parliamentary commissioner for standards], we are persuaded by the evidence that Mr Burns used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns\u2019 parliamentary duties. Mr Burns persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family\u2019s interests even during the course of the commissioner\u2019s investigation. He also misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the house authorities.</p> \n   <p>Parliamentary privilege, particularly the privilege of freedom of speech, is precious to our democracy. The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament\u2019s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism. Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests. We, like the commissioner, conclude that Mr Burns was guilty of abusing his privileged status in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burns told the committee that he accepted he should not have written the letter he did on Commons notepaper, but that he was under a \u201chuge amount of personal stress\u201d at the time.

Asked if he agreed, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the time for postmortem into this global pandemic viral spread is for once we all have as much data as possible, the testing around the world produces solid and realistic results about who is infected, how it acts with different people, and also when there\u2019s potentially a vaccine in place.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s the time to have those types of discussions.</p> \n   <p>By me speculating or talking about what I think about China or anyone else isn\u2019t going to help the fight against coronavirus in the UK right now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wallace rejected claims there was a blanket rule saying the over-70s have to rigorously self-isolate. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a blanket view of the over-70s. If you are over 70 and you have a range of conditions you are viewed as very highly clinically vulnerable and you should take extra measures.</p> \n   <p>If you are over 70 you should take extra precautions but it is not a blanket rule that if you are over 70 at the moment you are going to be treated differently from other people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wallace\u2019s comment is correct, but it is striking that six weeks into the lockdown, there is still confusion about what the rules actually say. The problem was also highlighted by this tweet at the weekend from <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, in response to the Sunday Times splash.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1256710939845558273\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sad to see another factually wrong &amp; misleading article on p1 of the Sunday Times. <br><br>The clinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for 12 weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over 70s. <br><br>I\u2019ve asked for an urgent correction. <a href=\"https://t.co/WGj1eOtqHl\">pic.twitter.com/WGj1eOtqHl</a></p>\u2014 Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1256710939845558273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The confusion arises because there are three groups of people covered by social distancing rules: non-vulnerable people; around 1.5m people described as \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d, who have been told to \u201cshield\u201d at home at least until the end of June; and the over-70s and other \u201cclinically vulnerable\u201d people.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19\">Special rules (pdf) </a>apply to the \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I strongly believe the public aren\u2019t stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media.

It includes the suggestion that employers should minimise the number of people using equipment, stagger shift times, reduce hot desking and maximise home-working.

The government will also bring forward \u00a32.6bn in tuition fees that universities would have received at the start of the next academic year, as well as \u00a3100m in research funding.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said just over 85,000 coronavirus tests took place yesterday. That\u2019s a second day where the headline total has fallen below 100,000, the target for the end of April. The work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has been updating MPs on her department\u2019s work in tackling the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. She said the \u201chidden heroes\u201d in her department had processed an extraordinary 1.8m new claims for universal credit (UC) since mid-March \u2013 as well as 250,000 claims for jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA), and 20,000 for employment support allowance (ESA). Councils could restrict access to rubbish tips by only allowing cars with particular number plates to visit on a given day, the local government secretary has said. Last week MPs on the Commons culture committee had a frustrating time at a hearing when they tried to get answers from representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter about what they were doing to halt the spread of disinformation about coronavirus. Now Julian Knight, the committee chair, has written to the three companies with a series of follow-up questions. In a statement he accused them of being \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d. Law centres and the not-for-profit legal advice sector have been given more than \u00a35m in emergency government funding to help those dealing with housing, debt, discrimination and employment problems during the coronavirus crisis. The Ministry of Justice says it is witnessing an increase in people seeking advice for social welfare cases in the pandemic and numbers are expected to increase demand on the legal support sector. The Access to Justice Foundation and the Law Centres Network will administer the funding and be overseen by the Community Justice Fund. The extra money will help provide vital legal advice throughout the crisis, increase capacity and deliver services remotely. The justice minister Alex Chalk said: \u201cLaw centres and charities in the advice sector play a vital role in helping people access justice and resolve their legal problems. That is why they should be supported to continue to operate safely and effectively during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThis additional \u00a35.4m support fund will help do just that \u2013 giving providers the support they need to boost remote capability and help as many people as possible during these challenging times.\u201d Ruth Daniel, chief executive of the Access to Justice Foundation, said:\u201cWe are delighted with this support for specialist social welfare legal advice agencies who are providing essential help to people and communities at this difficult time.\u201d The Law Centres Network chair, Helen Rogers, said: \u201cThe pandemic\u2019s uneven impact is a grim reminder of the deep inequality in our society that affects every aspect of life. This support recognises the key role of legal assistance in reducing inequality and bringing justice for all.\u201d For what felt like the first time in weeks, the government press conference was not dominated by questions about personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing. Here are the main points. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that from tonight contact tracing will go live in the Isle of Wight. A new government app that will alert people if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus is being piloted on the island, and Hancock urged islanders to dowload it. He said: Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island, from tonight the contact tracing capability will go live and from tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be able to install the app. Addressing islanders directly, he said: By downloading the app you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community. Hancock said he would hire more than the 18,000 contact tracers already being recruited if necessary. That was just the initial number being trained this month to operate contact tracing on a national basis, he said. He went on: There is no magic around the 18,000 figure, that is the initial scale that we think is necessary. If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that is in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is \u2013 the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests \u2013 then we will adjust that figure. He said, although the contact tracing scheme would help the government to suppress the coronavirus, the national system did not have to be in place before lockdown measures could be eased. He said: We haven\u2019t said we can\u2019t make changes [to lockdown] before [contact tracing] is up and running. It is just that the test, track and trace system will help us get R [the reproduction number] down and the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be. He said that 85,186 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. That means, for the second day in a row, the government has failed to hit the target of 100,000 tests a day set for the end of April. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said that it would take some time before scientists find out whether people who have had coronavirus develop immunity. But \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of people who have had it have antibodies, a precursor for immunity, he said. Hancock revealed that, as someone who has had the illness himself, he is taking part in trials to check his antibody levels. But he said he would not feel confident going into a crowded room because he could not assume he was immune. And he could not make policy yet on the basis that people with the antibody are immune, he said. (See 5.45pm and 5.47pm.) Van-Tam said the number of new cases of coronavirus was still too high. \u201cWe have to get the cases lower,\u201d he said. (See 5.19pm.) The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in prisons across England and Wales continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As at 5pm on Sunday, 357 prisoners have tested positive for the virus across 73 prisons, a 3% rise in the three days since the last update, while the number of infected prison staff rose by 6% to 395 workers across 67 prisons in the same period. A total of 13 prisoner and custody services have tested positive. The figures include those who have recovered. A total of 19 prisoners and six prison staff are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. There are 80,100 prisoners in England and Wales and around 33,000 staff in public-sector prisons. In the Commons MPs have been debating the lockdown restrictions, aka the Health Protections (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. Despite their extremely draconian nature, the regulations are secondary legislation, and they were introduced under a procedure that meant they became law before MPs had voted on them. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, used his speech to urge ministers to lift the current lockdown measures \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. He said: I hope that as ministers approach the second 21-day review they will do so always with a view to removing restrictions and removing these arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible. It will become even more important that we rely on common sense and voluntary cooperation rather than arbitrary rules. Referring specifically to the rules affecting the over-70s (see 9.43am), he went on: We have today the most healthiest, active elderly generation of all time and it would be tragic if government threatened this by trying to extend a so-called lockdown for those judged to be most at risk based on age. Why don\u2019t we just give them the best information and advice and let them limit their risk themselves? People involved in a study to track coronavirus in the general population have been reporting issues with testing, saying they have been booking appointments that no one turns up to. Some 20,000 households in England have been contacted to take part in a study which aims to improve understanding of infection levels and how many people may have immunity to the virus. All participants have to provide a nose and throat swab to test for whether or not they currently have the virus, while adults in some 1,000 of the households will provide a blood sample to find out what proportion of the population has developed antibodies to Covid-19. One of those selected, Will Murray, said: \u201cWe were meant to have appointments booked last week but no one turned up. We had to contact IQVIA again who assured us someone would turn up to take our blood and swabs the next day. Again, they didn\u2019t.\u201d Bernie Spratt said: \u201cWe replied to the invitation on 23 April and were given a home visit date of 27 April when an IQVIA nurse would arrive and test us both. Nobody arrived so we phoned the study contact line and rebooked for Thursday the 30th. Once again nobody arrived so we re-booked for Saturday 2 May. Saturday came and went and so I rang the study contact line again this morning and was told that the reason for the \u2018no shows\u2019 was that there were no test kits available in our area (Shipston on Stour).\u201d The study involves the University of Oxford, data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes. IQVIA have been fielding responses today on social media from people in a similar situation. The Office for National Statistics, which alongside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is leading the study, said: \u201cWe were aware of this issue via the social media activity and have been getting it sorted out this afternoon.\u201d It added that it already had some initial findings which had been shared with the government. Michael Gove has acknowledged that a new international effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, led by the EU, was not a Boris Johnson initiative, despite front-page reports today. The Daily Express was one of a number of national newspapers to carry the prime minister\u2019s call for the world to work together to find a cure for Covid-19 on their front pages, with its headline reading: \u201cBoris leads \u00a36bn global race for vaccine.\u201d Responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Paul Blomfield, Gove told parliament: \u201cWe will cooperate not just with our European neighbours but with other countries in the fight against Covid-19. He\u2019s right to say the prime minister is joining the call today in order to ensure that we can support the effort to secure a vaccine. The effort to secure a vaccine is necessarily an international one.\u201d Blomfield asked Gove if, given the UK\u2019s involvement with the EU\u2019s initiative, the government would be joining the bloc\u2019s early warning and response system (EWRS) for pandemics, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The Guardian reported this weekend that the British government was quietly seeking to access the EWRS, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit. Gove dodged the question about the EWRS, but said: \u201cWe will of course look pragmatically at how we can co-operate with our European friends and partners. But participation in the EMA would involve, certainly at the moment, the acceptance of the ECJ (European court of justice) oversight and that\u2019s not something that the British people voted to do.\u201d Commenting on Gove\u2019s response, Blomfield said. \u201cMichael Gove was right to recognise this international partnership to find a coronavirus vaccine as an EU initiative and not a Boris Johnson project as claimed by some of the Conservative press. But he should also pledge to join the EU\u2019s pandemic early warning system, as the NHS wants, and think again about leaving the European Medicines Agency.\u201d Q: Given the lockdown still applies on the Isle of Wight, will it generate enough data for the app? Hancock says he thinks it will. There is a busy hospital on the island. And new cases are occurring, he says. He says test, track and trace will be more effective when there are fewer cases. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. Q: Can you assure people from the Isle of Wight that there data will be safe? Yes, says Hancock. He says the app has been designed with privacy in mind. It has been signed off by the national cyber security centre. The data is stored on your phone, until it needs to contact other people. The highest level of privacy is built in, he says. Newton says the app itself does not hold personal information. He goes on: It is a very safe use of data and people should feel reassured by all the precautions that have been taken. Q: Last year you said there was a strong argument for making vaccines compulsory for children going to school. Would that apply to a coronavirus vaccine? Hancock says the public reaction to the lockdown suggests there would be \u201cvery, very high\u201d levels of take-up without compulsion. He does not rule anything out, he says. But he is proceeding on the basis that compulsion would not be necessary. Van-Tam says it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the first vaccines will be licensed for adults. He says it is the elderly, not children, who are mot at risk of death. Q: So what is your message to anti-vaxxers? Hancock says coronavirus shows how essential vaccines can be. Vaccines will only be licensed if they are safe. Q: What do you make of research suggesting a link between air pollution and susceptibility to coronavirus? Van-Tam says there is already extensive evidence that air pollution contributes to other illnesses. He has not looked at the link with coronavirus, but he finds the link entirely plausible. Q: You probably have antibodies. Would you feel happy going into a crowded room? Not yet, says Hancock. He says he hopes that people with antibodies will have a low rise of transmitting the disease, and a low risk of getting it. That is normally the case with coronaviruses. But he does not know yet. So he cannot base policy on that, he says. Q: How has your understanding of immunity developed? Hancock says there are surveys taking place looking at how many people have antibodies. The test shows if antibodies are there. The next phase will be to know what impact those have on someone not getting the illness again. The science on that is getting clearer, he says. Van-Tam says they need to find out if people to get antibodies after having the illness. Some research is underway. The \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people who have had Covid have antibodies in their bloodstream. Do those antibodies protect you from further infections? Van-Tam says we just don\u2019t know yet. But he says he hopes the answer will be yes. The next question is, how long do those antibodies last? With other coronaviruses, antibodies do not persist for years and years and years. He says we do not know yet if that is the case with Covid-19. But a \u201cmassive\u201d piece of work is underway to find out. He says they cannot make the science go any faster. They just have to be patient. But, when they do have the answers, antibody testing could be an essential part of the strategy. Hancock says he is in one of these trials. He had coronavirus. And his blood is regularly tested to see if he is developing antibodies. Q: How low do you have to get transmission rates? Hancock says he cannot put a figure on that. Q: Some Isle of Wight Radio listeners are worried social distancing will be lifted early on the island because of the pilot. Hancock says there are no plans to lift the social distancing measures early on the island. The plan is to ease the restrictions at the same pace everywhere, he says. Q: [From Isle of Wight radio] We ran a poll today showing 80% of listeners said they would install the app. But the island has an elderly population. Why was the island chosen? Hancock welcomes the 80% poll result. The more people download the app, the better, he says. But he accepts that not everyone has a smartphone on the Isle of Wight. But that is another reason for choosing the island, he says. If you tested it somewhere were everyone had a smartphone, that might be too easy, he says. Newton says the island is very suitable. Travel on and off the island is relatively restricted, he says. And he says some elderly people are tech-savvy. He also says people do not need the app to benefit. The people most likely to be mobile will be the people most likely to have a smartphone, he says. Q: The most successful contact tracing systems rely on people, as well as technology. Are you putting too much faith in an app? Hancock says he accepts that the part played by people, the contact tracers and members of the public, is vital. Prof John Newton from Public Health England agrees. He says \u201cshoe leather epidemiology\u201d, having people on the streets, is essential too. He says he hopes the Isle of Wight pilot will provide useful lessons. Q: Isn\u2019t it hard to pilot this when people are social distancing? Hancock does not accept that. There are still new cases, he says. So contact tracing can have an impact. Q: How will businesses be able to get PPE if the NHS also needs those supplies? Hancock says the government will make sure the NHS take priority. He says this factor will be taken into account as the government considers the way forward. Hancock says the government is making rapid progress in recruiting its 18,000 contact tracers. The first ones will start work this week, as they deal with the Isle of Wight. But there is no magic about 18,000, he says. If more are needed, the government will hire them. Hancock reads out a question from Conrad from Ashford. He asks if the aim is to suppress the virus, or to keep it at manageable levels. Hancock says the aim is to keep the numbers down. Test, track and trace becomes more effective these less transmission there is. The goal is not just to flatten the curve. It is to keep pushing it down. He says he wants to keep the reproduction number below 1. Hancock is now taking questions from members of the public. The first is from a man who asks what is being done to protect BAME workers in the NHS. Hancock says a disproportionate number of NHS and care workers from a BAME background have died. He pays tribute to them. He says a programme has been put in place to help address this. Van-Tam says the NHS is taking this \u201cincredibly seriously\u201d. A large programme of work has been put in place. He says the NHS will get to the bottom of this. But it is complicated, he says. He says different age cohorts are a factor. And underlying health factors. And deprivation. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, is going through the daily charts now. Here are the daily testing figures. Here are the figures for new cases. Van-Tam says new cases need to fall even lower. Here is the final slide, showing the global death comparison. Van-Tam stresses that these figures show numbers, not rates. They are not adjusted per head of population. Here is the government dashboard with latest UK data for coronavirus cases and deaths. Hancock confirms that the NHS contract tracing app will be trialled this week in the Isle of Wight. He appeals to anyone living on the island to download the app. By doing so, they will be protecting themselves and the whole community, he says. He says he is confident that people will help. He says he wants to hear how people find it. And he says this does not mean the end of social distancing. Hancock says another 288 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, taking the total to 28,734. He says that is the smallest daily rise since the end of March, although he acknowledges that after a weekend, the daily reported rise in deaths tends to be lower than later in the week. Hancock says just over 85,000 coronavirus tests took place yesterday. That\u2019s a second day where the headline total has fallen below 100,000, the target for the end of April. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is leading for the government at this afternoon\u2019s press conference. He has just started. He says he will be focusing mostly on the government\u2019s plans for test, track and trace. Here is the start of a Twitter thread from the FT\u2019s Chris Giles, who has been trying to model the total number of coronavirus-related deaths. Some rough sleepers may have to be put up in hostels or night shelters when lockdown measures begin to be eased, Housing minister Robert Jenrick said. He said he does not want to \u201close the opportunity that we have here and see those people drift back onto the streets when the lockdown starts to be eased in due course\u201d. But he said there is a limited capacity of \u201cgood quality move-on accommodation\u201d for the more than 5,000 rough sleepers currently being put up in places such as hotels. He said: \u201cWhat we will do in the days and weeks ahead is assess what the capacity is in accommodation of that nature, how we can build more capacity at pace, what other accommodation is available on an interim basis, some of which will, I think unfortunately, be more basic, such as hostels and night shelters, simply because there isn\u2019t sufficient of the type of accommodation we all want to be available, and then see how we can have a national strategy to try to move as many people as possible into that sort of accommodation and wrap care around them as well, because this is not simply a housing challenge, it\u2019s one of mental health and addiction as well.\u201d The work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has been updating MPs on her department\u2019s work in tackling the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. She said the \u201chidden heroes\u201d in her department had processed an extraordinary 1.8m new claims for universal credit (UC) since mid-March \u2013 as well as 250,000 claims for jobseekers\u2019 allowance (JSA), and 20,000 for employment support allowance (ESA). Job centres have been closed and turned into claim processing centres, Coffey said, and hundreds of civil servants have been redeployed from other departments. The number of new applications has now \u201cstabilised\u201d, at 20,000 to 25,000 a day. Coffey\u2019s shadow counterpart, Jonathan Reynolds, one of several opposition frontbenchers making their debut today, called for \u201clegacy benefits\u201d such as JSA and ESA to be increased for a year, to help claimants through the crisis, as UC has been. Coffey said that was not possible, saying that the complexity of the computer systems used to administer those benefits means that it takes \u201cquite some time\u201d to make changes \u2013 by which she said she meant months. Here are the latest figures on take-up of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme, the initiative that allows employees to be \u201cfurloughed\u201d on 80% of wages, up to \u00a32,500 per month. They mean that an extra 6.3m workers have, on a temporary basis, effectively been added to the government\u2019s payroll. In an article for the Guardian, Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine, says that increasing the amount of coronavirus testing to more than 100,000 tests per day (on one measure, for some of the time) is not by itself enough. He explains: The real concern is our capacity to act on the results of the tests. Simply doing tests in response to demand will be inadequate. Instead we must use each result to find cases, trace those who have been in contact with a person who has tested positive and ensure that those infected, or potentially infected, self-isolate. Only these four steps used in conjunction will prevent a second wave of the virus and protect vulnerable people. The full article is here. Matthew Gould, head of the NHS\u2019s digital arm, has defended his agency\u2019s choice of a \u201ccentralised\u201d contact-tracing app as opposed to the type of decentralised system chosen by many other European countries. Speaking over a videolink to MPs and peers on parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights, Gould, the head of NHSX, said: If the only thing we were optimising for [were privacy] it may well be that decentralised system would be the default choice but we are balancing privacy with the need for public health to get insight into what is happening.. [to learn] what contacts are most risky, what is the difference [in exposure] three days before symptoms or one day. A centralised system gives us the chance to get important data about the virus that will help us, he added. The type of system could be altered. \u201cJust because we have started down one route doesn\u2019t mean we are locked into it,\u201d Gould said. He acknowledged there could be difficulties on the island of Ireland where the government in Dublin has chosen a non-centralised system. \u201cWe are about interoperability,\u201d Gould insisted. \u201cThe French are taking a similar approach [to the UK]. It should not be possible to identify individuals from the data sent to the centralised system, Gould noted. \u201cWe have said very clearly that data will only be used for public health purposes. It will not be used for law enforcement.\u201d Elizabeth Denham, the UK information commissioner, denied that her office was compromised by having been involved at an early stage with NHSX as it developed the system. She told peers and MPs that her office would still be able to carry out its independent oversight responsibilities. Councils could restrict access to rubbish tips by only allowing cars with particular number plates to visit on a given day, the local government secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said: My view has been that local councils should reopen their waste and recycling sites. We all know the pressure that\u2019s building up in some people\u2019s homes, particularly those people who live in flats and apartments, without very much space, having bin bags and recycling and boxes from deliveries building up is both a challenge in terms of space but also a public health issue that needs to be resolved. He said an \u201corderly reopening\u201d of sites was possible in most areas and guidance was being updated to class a trip to the tip as a \u201cnecessary journey\u201d. There are ways in which councils can manage demand, by asking people to come with different registration plates on their cars or booking appointments and so on. There are options available to councils if they are concerned about long queues . Although the UK government has yet to produced details of its plan to relax the lockdown restriction (the term \u201cexit strategy\u201d has apparently been banned by No 10, and given that there may never be an exit in the sense of a return to the status quo ante, perhaps they\u2019ve got a point), that has not stopped lots of other people and organisations having a go. The Scottish government and the Welsh government have published outline proposals, here (pdf) and here respectively. The former prime minister Tony Blair has released at least three papers on the topic (here, here and here). The Institute for Government, a thinktank, has produced its own blueprint. And now the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the public spending thinktank, has also offered its thoughts on the topic. In a 23-page paper (pdf), it floats the idea of offering firms subsidiesto get employees to work from home. Here is an extract. As lockdown is eased, ensuring that those who could work from home reasonably productively are doing so should be a policy priority. It dampens the trade-off between the level of economic activity and the rate of virus transmission. It benefits not only those who can work from home; it also enables more of those who cannot work from home to go to work, without society once again seeing a spike in virus infections large enough to precipitate the re-introduction of lockdown which would once again threaten their livelihoods. But there is obvious potential for market failure here resulting in insufficient working from home. Some of the benefits from doing so accrue not to the individuals or firms themselves but to others in society (through lower virus transmission); and working from home may require investments and adaptations that the uncertain environment could inhibit ... Potential policy levers include: Subsidies for firms or workers who are operating from home. The theoretical case for these is clear, given the externalities, though the practical design could be challenging, e.g. to avoid large deadweight. Norm-setting. Simply sending a strong signal that certain sectors or occupations are expected to work from home, and that failing to do so is deemed unacceptable and irresponsible, may have a significant effect. There is a summary of the IFS paper here. A report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve \u2013 Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics \u2013 has weighed up the evidence and come out in favour of the public wearing facemasks, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle covid-19. It says: Our analysis suggests that their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers. If correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission. However the report stresses clear instructions should be given to the public, including that the wearing of masks is to protect others, rather than the wearer themselves, as well as information on reuse, and the importance of other measures such as washing hands. While there has been some concern that masks may cause some to become complacent, the authors say there is no evidence for this. \u201cWhile there is anecdotal evidence of individual risk compensation behaviour, at a population level the introduction of safety measures like HIV prevention measures, seatbelts and helmets have led to increased safety and even increased safety oriented behaviour,\u201d they write. \u201cThere is no evidence for individual risk compensation amongst the public during epidemics.\u201d However, the team say more research is needed, including into the routes of transmission of Covid-19, when a mask may be most necessary and the extent of transmission from those who are infected but asymptomatic. Thanks to everyone who has been emailing over news tips to me. Please do continue to share your thoughts and insights. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Even if only 20% of the population downloads the tracing-contact app it will start generating useful health information, the head of the NHS\u2019s digital arm has told MPs and peers. Giving evidence to parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights, Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX said children as young as 16 \u2013 and possibly younger - could be recruited to the pilot project being launched on the Isle of Wight. \u201cIf we are going to gain the level of engagement from the public we need to win their trust,\u201d he told committee members. The app will not know the identity of those who join it but they will be asked to register the first half of their post code \u201cso that we can tell where hotspots [of infection] are building up\u201d. He added: We have put privacy right at the heart of the app and the way it works. You don\u2019t have to give your personal details. You can always choose to delete it. The app by itself is not a silver bullet. It\u2019s part of a wider strategy. Even if the take-up rate is 20% that gives us important insights into how the virus is spreading. At 40 or 50% it will make a big difference. We have tried to have an approach of transparency \u2026. but there will be unexpected consequences. Data is deleted in a 28-day cycle from the phone. Last week MPs on the Commons culture committee had a frustrating time at a hearing when they tried to get answers from representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter about what they were doing to halt the spread of disinformation about coronavirus. Now Julian Knight, the committee chair, has written to the three companies with a series of follow-up questions. In a statement he accused them of being \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d. He said: The defensive position demonstrated by the representatives sent by Twitter, Facebook and Google was deeply unhelpful and failed in clarifying what they are doing to tackle the threat posed by record levels of misinformation and disinformation online about Covid-19, some of it deadly. The lack of information and detail in the answers we were given showed a disregard for the important process of scrutiny. We\u2019re again asking the social media companies for information that was so woefully lacking in order to prove to parliament and their users that their organisations are open and accountable for their behaviour. An elderly resident has died at the care home on Skye where nearly all the residents and half the staff have contracted Covid-19. The BBC has reported the owners of the Home Farm home in Portree confirming one of its residents had died, after it emerged 29 of its 34 residents, and half its 52 staff had tested positive for the virus. \u201cOur thoughts and sympathies are with the family who has lost a loved one,\u201d a spokesman said. The army has set up a mobile testing centre on Skye after local NHS managers ordered an urgent test and trace programme, to track the virus within the wider community. All the affected staff have been ordered home to self-isolate for seven days, while their immediate families have been asked to isolate for 14 days. Scottish government data shows more than half of Scotland\u2019s care homes have had at least one Covid-19 case since the start of the pandemic, with some reporting multiple fatalities. There have been 3,500 confirmed or suspected cases in care homes and as of last Sunday, 40% of care homes had at least one live case. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said the government would ensure councils were \u201cfully compensated\u201d for the Covid-19 tasks they were asked to undertake. He told the housing and local government committee: Of course some councils are doing things over and above what we\u2019ve asked and that\u2019s absolutely their right to do so, and I respect them making those decisions and those are matters for councils, but where we\u2019ve asked councils to do things, we are going to ensure they are fully compensated. The committee chairman, Clive Betts, said multiple councils were saying they had committed to spend, or had already spent, more money than the government had given them. Jenrick replied: \u201cFrom the returns that we have received so far, covering the first two months of the response, March and April, it\u2019s clear that the funding we have provided is more than enough in total for the response that is being done brilliantly on the ground by local councils.\u201d Some additional funding has also been directed to lower-tier authorities which have suffered \u201cirrecoverable losses\u201d due to fees lost from car parks and leisure centres. The Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, fears fans will not be returning to football stadiums \u201cany time soon\u201d, PA Media reports. \u201cThe reality is that we just don\u2019t know how things are going to pan out,\u201d Clarke said in a letter to the FA Council sent on Friday. \u201cBut with social distancing in place for some time to come, we do face substantial changes to the whole football ecosystem.\u201d The full story is here. Britain and Ireland should make more use of their island status in tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, a public health expert has said. Speaking at the \u201cindependent Sage\u201d meeting (see 9.29am) chaired by Sir David King, Prof Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, pointed to the approach of countries such as New Zealand. He said: There are countries that appear to have taken major advantage of their island status, like New Zealand and Taiwan, or virtual island status like South Korea, and have very successfully dealt with the virus. And here we are sitting in Britain, adjacent to Ireland, two islands with an opportunity to take maximum advantage of that island status and it seems to me that has not entered into discussion to any significant extent. Scally noted that unlike many countries, Britain and Ireland had maintained open borders in the face of Covid-19. \u201cThat seems to me, as we go into a situation where we are thinking of lifting restrictions, places us in sudden jeopardy,\u201d he said, adding that a key issue in countries including China at present was cases of coronavirus imported into the country, including from citizens who had returned from travelling abroad. Scally went on: I would strongly suggest that we look at the issue of port health and what might be done in future, and looking at the experience from other countries and the contribution that improving and tightening our port health to make use of this island advantage, to explore what a contribution that could make. The TUC has warned that the government\u2019s draft guidelines for getting employees back to work (see 2.50pm) during the coronavirus crisis will put people\u2019s health at risk and cannot be supported in their current form, our colleague Rowena Mason reports. BuzzFeed has published details of the seven draft guidance documents drawn up by the government intended to show what firms in seven different sorts of work settings will need to do to protect staff when the lockdown gets lifted. And these are from Alex Wickham, who published the story. Boris Johnson is now contributing, via a pre-recorded video speech, to the coronavirus global response international pledging conference. He said finding a vaccine was \u201cthe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes\u201d. And in Northern Ireland a further six coronavirus deaths have been announced, taking the total to 387. The dashboard with the full details is here. Public Health Wales has reported 14 new coronavirus deaths in Wales, taking the total to 997. A total of 1,576 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by five from 1,571 on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said earlier. She said that there are 99 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms in Scotland, no change from yesterday. And she said there are 1,720 people in hospital in Scotland with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, an increase of 54. The full figures are here. NHS England has announced 204 new deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,384. The full details are here (pdf). Of the 204 new deaths announced today, 54 occurred on 3 May, 108 occurred on 2 May and 24 occurred on 1 May. The government has announced a \u00a314m fund to help zoos and aquariums look after their animals in the face of pandemic closures. Zoos and aquariums have lost visitor income having been forced to shut due in the lockdown, but still face the costs of looking after the animals in their care. The government said the funding would help zoos cover costs relating to keeping the animals and ensuring welfare standards are upheld \u2013 helping pay for things such as feed, heating and security. The environment department (Defra) also said it would continue to work with some of the largest zoos to discuss additional concerns about funding in the longer term. The chief medical officer for Wales, Frank Atherton, is going to \u201cformalise his advice\u201d to the Welsh government on whether people should wear non-clinical face coverings, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said. Drakeford explained: What we are talking about are not masks of the sort that are worn in hospital. We\u2019re not going to embark on a course of action where members of the public end up competing with the health service for the use of masks which are needed in a clinical setting, and for which there isn\u2019t evidence for use in the community. What we are talking about are non-clinical face coverings, that\u2019s the phrase the Scottish government has used in its guidance. Thanks to those following the Guardian\u2019s live feed.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Easing the lockdown has the potential to divide communities that have come together during the the coronavirus outbreak if changes to the rules are perceived to be unfair, a senior scientist has warned. Prof Susan Michie, a behavioural psychologist at UCL, said that while the lockdown had led to a collective spirit in communities, the uneven lifting of lockdown measures risked harming the solidarity that will be needed in the longer term. Speaking at the \u201cindependent Sage\u201d (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] meeting (see 9.29am) chaired by Sir David King, Michie said: People were very surprised at how adherent the population has been and a lot of that is down to collective solidarity as people have been rising to the challenge. Going forwards, in terms of lifting lockdown, it\u2019s going to to be a very different situation. A lot of thought has to be given to how this will be managed. If it\u2019s not handled well, it risks potential divisions between groups. She added that if changes to the rules were seen as unjust and unfair, they could \u201clead to resentment and anger and people being alienated from the collective and what\u2019s being asked of them.\u201d Michie, who is also a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on behaviour, which feeds into the official government Sage, added that lockdown has already hit the disadvantaged hardest and that the way it was lifted risked driving inequality further. She told the meeting that it was crucial people from across society had financial security, that messaging was specific to different groups of society, and that more effort should be put into bottom-up community-level approaches to emerging from the lockdown. \u201cCommunities have been very impressive in how they\u2019ve come together and this needs to be kept going,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunities need to be mobilised for the longer term.\u201d The government has now published a list of the experts who have participated in meetings of Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, as well as other expert groups that have been giving advice to the government on coronavirus. The details are here. Sage does not have a fixed membership. Different experts are invited to attend depending on what topic is being discussed. The government has named 50 members, who it says \u201chave provided input as experts at one or more meetings\u201d. It says two other participants asked not to be named. But the list does not include the names of non-expert government officials who have also attended. Downing Street was furious when the Guardian reported recently that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, has attended and participated in meetings. Cummings is a history graduate, not a scientist, and although some Sage members did not object to his participation, others claimed it was not appropriate. The daily Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the key points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the NHS Nightingale hospital in London - the 4,000-bed emergency hospital set up within days in the ExCel centre, would be put \u201con standby\u201d. He said that it was not expected to admit any new patients in the coming days, and he said as a result it would be put on standby, ready to receive patients if needed. He said there were five Nightingale hospitals open in total in England, and another two being prepared. The spokesman would not confirm that the ones outside London would also be put on hold too. But he said that the fact that the Nightingale hospitals were largely not be used did not mean that opening them was a mistake. He said: We view the fact that the Nightingales have not has to be used in a significant way as something that is positive. Asked if they had been a waste of money, he said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d The spokesman did not contest reports saying that Boris Johnson is planning to unveil details of his plan to start relaxing the lockdown in a speech on Sunday. The spokesman said the government has to review by current lockdown measures by Thursday. But there was no fixed date for an update to be given to the public, he said. He would not confirm the reports that Johnson is planning a speech for Sunday. But he went on: We are at a critical moment in the fight against this virus and it it going to be crucial that we get the advice to the public right. If it means taking some extra time to do that, then that\u2019s what we will do. The spokesman did not challenge a comment from Nicola Sturgeon saying the lockdown will continue beyond Thursday. Asked about Sturgeon\u2019s comment, the spokesman said: I don\u2019t think I can pre-empt the review. But if we do ease the social distancing measures in any way, it is likely to be a gradual process. The spokesman said that lifting the lockdown too soon would be \u201cthe worst thing\u201d that could be done. He said: The British public have sacrificed an enormous amount to fight this virus, to protect the NHS and to save lives. We are at a critical point and the worst thing that we could do is lift the measures too soon and risk a second peak which overwhelms the NHS. The spokesman played down suggestions that the government would relax its two-metre rule. Asked about Ben Wallace\u2019s comment to this effect this morning (see 8.49am), he said: There has been no change to the two-metre rule. We continue to advise that people should remain two metres apart from each other. That has not changed. The spokesman said that Wallace had been \u201creflecting the existing advice, which says that people should remain two metres apart wherever possible\u201d. The spokesman said that a list of members of Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, would be published today. And this week the government will publish more of the Sage advice to government on coronavirus. The Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, addressed the situation at the Home Farm care home on Skye, which has experienced a \u201csignificant\u201d outbreak of coronavirus. On Sunday, it was announced that 26 members of staff and 28 residents had contracted Covid-19. She said all residents had been isolated in their rooms while the local GP and advanced nurse practitioner undertake \u201cmedical assessments\u201d. The health secretary said her \u201cbest thoughts and good wishes\u201d went out to those who had tested positive at Home Farm and other care homes across the country. Around 20,000 members of staff in health and social care have responded to the call to return to the respective sectors, Freeman added. A tweet summarising the measures in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon has warned that people may be asked to self-isolate themselves repeatedly once ministers introduce a new \u201ctest, trace, isolate\u201d policy after the coronavirus lockdown eases. The Scottish government published a new policy paper (pdf) on how it will tackle future Covid-19 infections during later phases of the pandemic, which will focus heavily on \u201cearly and effective\u201d identification of new cases through testing, and then tracking down and isolating other people in contact with infected people. The paper said Scottish labs would need to conduct at least 15,500 tests a day, to cover about 2% of the population. The NHS would also need to find and train 2,000 additional people to specialise in contact tracing. The document said the new \u201ctest, trace, isolate, support\u201d strategy would underpin the post-lockdown approach, alongside all existing measures such as social distancing, good hygiene such as regular hand washing, use of face-coverings in crowded public places and disease surveillance. It was \u201cdesigned to help us interrupt chains of transmission in the community by identifying cases of Covid-19, tracing the people who may have become infected by spending time in close contact with them, and then supporting those close contacts to self-isolate, so that if they have the disease they are less likely transmit to it to others.\u201d Anyone would had been closer than two metres from an infected person for 15 minutes or more would be required to self-isolate for 14 days, the document said. Testing capacity would need to expand dramatically to cope: Scotland\u2019s daily testing potential would hit 8,000 samples a day by mid-May, with another 4,000 tests a day done at the UK government\u2019s Lighthouse laboratory at Glasgow university. The first minister warned this would, in effect, become the new normal. It would be effective once community transmission rates were at a much lower level than at present, she indicated. It is important to stress that \u2018test, trace, isolate, support\u2019 will be most effective when levels of infection are low \u2013 lower than now \u2013 and stay low, and that its success relies on all of us knowing and agreeing what to do if we have symptoms, and being prepared to self-isolate when advised to do so. This will not be easy. In this next phase, we will be asking people to self-isolate, not for their own benefit, and not because we know for certain that they have contracted the disease, but in order to protect others in case they have. People may face self-isolation not just once, but on repeat occasions. Care home workers say employers are playing \u201cRussian roulette\u201d with their lives as personal protective equipment (PPE) is withheld or rationed amid unclear guidance, according to a union. In some homes PPE is being locked away, Unison said, while in others staff are being told they only need to wear it once a resident has confirmed coronavirus. Care workers have told the union they are being forced to use bin bags to protect themselves from potentially contracting or spreading Covid-19. Other staff said they had asked for PPE such as masks and visors, but were told \u201chead office is following government guidelines and will only give them out when they suspect someone might have Covid-19\u201d. PHE guidance states that staff \u201cshould have access to the PPE that protects them for the appropriate setting and context\u201d. Courts in England and Wales have managed to keep going during the Coronavirus crisis unlike those in most other European countries, the justice minister Chris Philp has told MPs. Giving evidence to the justice select committee, the minister denied that any cases had been dropped because of the pandemic and said courts are operating at around 49% of their previous workload. Philp told MPs: \u201cOur jurisdiction has done pretty well in keeping functioning when compared to the rest of Europe. In most of Europe, the courts have shut down completely. \u201c On an average pre-Coronavirus day, Philp said, courts would handle around 8,320 cases. By comparison on 27 April, the courts in England and Wales handled 4,066 cases. Around 85% of those heard involved some form of remote hearing by video link or phone. Many of the hearings, he acknowledged, were procedural hearings rather than full trials. Extra cleaners have been hired to ensure that the 149 courts that remain open during the pandemic are cleaned more regularly, MPs have been informed. Philp told the committee that the right to jury trial would be upheld once they resume. The only change being considered, he said, is whether the minimum jury size could be reduced to seven jurors to improve social distancing. It is currently nine. A consultation on raising the compulsory retirement age for magistrates would be conducted immediately after lockdown ends, he added. The current mandatory retirement age is 70. Hello everyone. I am helping Andrew today on the live blog. As ever, your input is really valuable. Please do share with me any comments, thoughts, and news tips. Thanks in advance. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Turning away from coronavirus for a moment, there is big news in Labourworld. Jennie Formby has announced that she standing down as general secretary. In a statement she said: When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down. I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill health. This is important because the general secretary runs Labour HQ and Formby\u2019s resignation means that Sir Keir Starmer can now install one of his own allies in the post. Formby, who worked for Unite before becoming general secretary in 2018, was close to Jeremy Corbyn and his faction in the party. In the Conservative party a new leader is free to install his or her acolytes in top jobs at party HQ but in the Labour party the general secretary is more independent, and harder to move if he or she has the backing of the national executive committee. It took Corbyn more than two years to instal a general secretary viewed as a loyalist. Paying tribute to Formby, Starmer said: I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for. Jennie has led our party\u2019s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year. I wish her the very best for the future. Labour\u2019s NEC will meet soon to decide the timetable for electing a new general secretary. Asda has offered priority delivery slots to thousands of care homes for the next six months and donated 250,000 face masks to protect workers and residents, the supermarket said. Bosses said 3,500 care homes across the country will be able to book the slots. It follows similar moves by other supermarkets to offer deliveries to those finding it hardest to get to stores during the coronavirus lockdown. The Asda chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: \u201cThe impact of Covid on our care system has been the subject of numerous news reports in recent days, and the challenges facing our nation\u2019s care homes and the staff who are working so hard to protect some of our most vulnerable people have been heartbreaking to see. \u201cGiving priority access to these amazing care homes is, I believe, the right thing for us to do - and I am proud that, having built the capacity of our online delivery service in recent weeks from 450,000 slots to 700,000 weekly slots, we are able to do this for our care homes.\u201d The medical-grade masks will be delivered later this month, he added. The \u201calternative Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]\u201d meeting (see 9.29am) organised by Sir David King, the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, is just getting going now. There is a live feed here. The Office for National Statistics has published a report this morning on well-being (or happiness, to put it crudely, although the ONS uses various different measures to assess this). As you would expect, coronavirus has led to an increase in the overall level of misery. Here are the main points. Almost half (49.6%) of people in Great Britain reported \u201chigh\u201d levels of anxiety between 20 and 30 March. (The lockdown was announced on 23 March.) That is more than double the level at the end of 2019 (21%). This chart makes the same point in another way. It shows how the average level of anxiety in that 10-day period was 5.18 out of 10, compared to a long-term average of about 3. Over the same 10-day period 20.7% of people reported low levels of life satisfaction. That is more than double the figure for the final quarter of 2019, when just 8.4% of people said they felt like this. A low level of life satisfaction means a score of 0 to 4, when people are asked to give their satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10. Here is the full standards committee report into Conor Burns. An investigation was launched after a complaint was made to the parliamentary commissioner for standards saying that Burns had written a letter on Commons notepaper in an attempt to help his father recover money that was allegedly owed to him following a loan. In the letter to the complainant, who is not named in the report, Burns also suggested that he might raise the case in the Commons chamber using parliamentary privilege if his father did not get the money he felt was owed to him. In his conclusion the standards committee said: Like the [parliamentary commissioner for standards], we are persuaded by the evidence that Mr Burns used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns\u2019 parliamentary duties. Mr Burns persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family\u2019s interests even during the course of the commissioner\u2019s investigation. He also misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the house authorities. Parliamentary privilege, particularly the privilege of freedom of speech, is precious to our democracy. The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament\u2019s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism. Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests. We, like the commissioner, conclude that Mr Burns was guilty of abusing his privileged status in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public. Burns told the committee that he accepted he should not have written the letter he did on Commons notepaper, but that he was under a \u201chuge amount of personal stress\u201d at the time. He said he was sorry for what he had done. Downing Street has announced that Conor Burns has resigned as an international trade minister. A No 10 spokesman said: Conor Burns has resigned as minister of state for international trade following a report from the parliamentary commissioner for standards. A replacement will be announced in due course. On the basis of a report from the parliamentary commissioner, the Commons standards committee said that Burns should receive a seven-day suspension from the House of Commons for abusing his position as an MP in order to further his private family interests. Burns became an MP in 2010 but only became a minister last summer, when Boris Johnson became PM. His promotion was seen as a reward for his having been one of Johnson\u2019s most loyal backbench supporters. I will post more from the standards committee report shortly. Magistrates should be able to impose sentences of up to 12 months for a single offence as a temporary response to the coronavirus crisis in order to take pressure off the crown courts, MPs have been told. Addressing the justice select committee, John Bache, national chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, called for JPs to be given enhanced sentencing powers so that they can deal with an anticipated backlog of criminal cases once lockdown ends. Jury trials across England and Wales have been postponed during the pandemic because of the impossibility of maintaining social distancing during the crisis. Magistrates have long campaigned to be giving greater sentencing powers. The current limit for any single offence is six months. Legislation under the last Labour government raised that limit to 12 months but it has never been brought into effect. On Monday, Bache told a session of the justice select committee considering the impact of Covid-19 on the justice system that: Giving magistrates the ability to impose 12 months sentences would take the pressure off crown courts. Even if it\u2019s only for a temporary time. Around 192 magistrates courts in England and Wales have been closed by the coronavirus crisis. Others are still dealing with urgent cases. Many magistrates are working remotely from home, dealing with significant quantities of single justice procedure cases such as driving fines. Last week Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced that small firms could apply for \u201cbounce back\u201d loans worth up to \u00a350,000. These loans are meant to be simpler to obtain than some of the other coronavirus loans available, and they are 100% backed by the government (not 80% backed, liked the others, which means banks should have no qualms about lending). The scheme is now open. Here is the Treasury\u2019s news release, and firms can apply here. The Times has more details about plans for that contact tracing app \u2013 about which more is expected to be announced by the health secretary at this evening\u2019s press conference. The paper reports that researchers at Oxford University have set up a model in computer code, which simulates a city of 1 million people \u2013 all behaving as we do in normal times, using public transport, seeing friends and family \u2013 in order to track how the app would work. Early tests have been a success and the next stage is to roll the app out to residents on the Isle of Wight, where eight out of 10 people with smartphones need to download it in order for the trial to be effective. If this stage of the trial is a success it will be introduced across the rest of the country in weeks. The app uses bluetooth to record everybody you come in close contact with. The data it gathers will stay on your phone until you notify the app that you have symptoms, at which point it will be uploaded to a central server and people who need to self-isolate will be alerted. At least 15,000 staff will be needed to arrange testing for those with symptoms. In a separate report, the Times says that this work will be outsourced to private call centre operators including Serco. Staff will be given about a day of training before starting work. The Times reports that there is disagreement in government about how much data the app should gather. The app used in South Korea, for example, records real time location data, so that authorities can see where there are clusters of infections. There are no plans for the UK app to do this. The paper says: [The] essential dilemma is this: The more intrusive the app is - the more information it gathers and relays to a central database - the more useful it will be in tracking localised outbreaks and guiding the \u2018human\u2019 tracing work. Yet at the same time the more intrusive it is the less people are likely to download it and unless it has significant take up it is more of a gimmick than a genuinely useful tool. Demonstrators have blocked access to building sites for the HS2 high-speed railway in London and Warwickshire, in protest at construction work continuing amid the coronavirus crisis, PA Media reports. The group, who call themselves HS2 Rebellion, claim the work is non-essential and that, by failing to sop during the lockdown, it is putting the lives of workers and their families at risk. They say that health workers remain without personal protective equipment (PPE) and that money used for construction projects should be channelled to such medical supplies instead. Here is a tweet from HS2 Rebellion explaining their case. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, a medical research charity, and a member of Sage, the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies, said that there was \u201cnothing magical\u201d about the two-metre rule and that other ways of minimising contact might be as effective . He told the programme: It\u2019s based on old data about how far when we cough and we sneeze that the droplets and the aerosols that may come from that spread. There\u2019s nothing magical about two metres. Perhaps more importantly is the time you spend in contact with somebody else. Not just the distance but also the time. (As this BBC analysis by David Shukman explains, some of this \u201cold data\u201d goes back to the 1930s.) In his interview Farrar also said that, when the lockdown eased, he would not approve of separate rules applying to the over-70s just on the basis of their age. He said: I think it\u2019s very difficult to have different rules for different age groups. I think isolating certain groups and saying you\u2019re different to the rest of society is a very, very difficult message to give and I personally would not be in favour of that. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. We\u2019ve already covered the main lines from the interviews giving by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, this morning. (See 8.49am.) Here are some of the other points he\u2019s been making. Wallace refused to back President Trump\u2019s claim that evidence exists to show the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, went further yesterday, claiming there was \u201cenormous\u201d evidence to this effect. But Wallace would not endorse these claims. Asked if he agreed, he replied: I think the time for postmortem into this global pandemic viral spread is for once we all have as much data as possible, the testing around the world produces solid and realistic results about who is infected, how it acts with different people, and also when there\u2019s potentially a vaccine in place. That\u2019s the time to have those types of discussions. By me speculating or talking about what I think about China or anyone else isn\u2019t going to help the fight against coronavirus in the UK right now. Wallace rejected claims there was a blanket rule saying the over-70s have to rigorously self-isolate. He said: It\u2019s not a blanket view of the over-70s. If you are over 70 and you have a range of conditions you are viewed as very highly clinically vulnerable and you should take extra measures. If you are over 70 you should take extra precautions but it is not a blanket rule that if you are over 70 at the moment you are going to be treated differently from other people. Wallace\u2019s comment is correct, but it is striking that six weeks into the lockdown, there is still confusion about what the rules actually say. The problem was also highlighted by this tweet at the weekend from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, in response to the Sunday Times splash. The confusion arises because there are three groups of people covered by social distancing rules: non-vulnerable people; around 1.5m people described as \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d, who have been told to \u201cshield\u201d at home at least until the end of June; and the over-70s and other \u201cclinically vulnerable\u201d people. Special rules (pdf) apply to the \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d. But people who are just \u201cclinically vulnerable\u201d are told to apply the same rules as everyone else, with the proviso that they should take \u201cparticular care\u201d to minimise contact with people outside their home. Wallace said the absentee rate from coronavirus in the armed forces was about half that seen in the rest of the community. He said that might be because of the \u201cstrong personal discipline\u201d imposed on members of the armed forces to follow hygiene routines. Half the workforce at a care home on Skye have been sent home after contracting Covid-19, in a major outbreak which has infected nearly all the facility\u2019s elderly residents. NHS Highland tested all the staff and residents at Home Farm care home in Portree after cases emerged last week and found 28 out of its 34 residents were positive for Covid-19 and 26 of its 52 staff. Soldiers from Royal Regiment of Scotland have set up a mobile testing site in Broadford, a village on Skye, and extra staff have been drafted into help run the home with the help of the local council and NHS Highland. Infected staff have been told to self-isolate for seven days and their immediate family for 14 days. Dr Ken Oates, the board\u2019s director of public health, said: There is no evidence at this stage that the covid infection has spread further into the community. The assessment centre in Portree and local GPs are not reporting an increase of cases. The measures that have been put in place will support us in ensuring, as best as we can, that the outbreak is as contained as possible. Ian Blackford, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, said the outbreak was particularly worrying because the nearest hospital ventilators were in Inverness, 112 miles away. Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser who will chair an \u201cindependent\u201d alternative to the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) at midday, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the new board was necessary because he feared experts were deferring to ministers. Asked if that meant they were not free to speak their minds, he responded: I believe that\u2019s the case, yes. I think there\u2019s a very big difference between the situation today and the situation as it was in 2010-11. That is quite simply the permission to speak in the public domain has been changed. I think the main point I\u2019m making is that an independent science advisory group really needs to be dominated by people whose income is not determined by the fact they are working for the government. King will launch his \u201calternative Sage\u201d \u2013 in which experts will discuss the UK\u2019s approach to coronavirus \u2013 on YouTube at 12pm. You can watch it here. He\u2019ll follow up with a press conference at 4pm. King said yesterday that public trust in science risked being damaged by potential political interference. He cited the government policy on face masks, which he said appeared to be politically convenient, but ran in contradiction to the best available evidence. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning. The PA Media news agency has quotes from his interview with Sky News, in which he said that ministers were trying to source as many masks as possible in case they change the advice to recommend the public wears them. It\u2019s not the amazing thing if you wear a mask that no one\u2019s going to get it but there is obviously this issue about human nature and interactions; if you go on public transport and wear a mask, will you feel able to go back to work? At the same time, to anticipate should different rules be made around masks, we\u2019re trying to source as many masks as possible as we speak, and have been for the last few weeks. Wallace was asked whether people would be hesitant to return to work when the lockdown is eased after weeks of strict stay-at-home messaging. He said: I strongly believe the public aren\u2019t stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media. They took on board the government\u2019s advice ... and I think they will be perfectly able to read the government\u2019s next stage when we get to it. I\u2019m totally confident when it comes to the next step we will all together be able to move forward. Wallace suggested the two-metre distancing rule could be relaxed to allow people to go back to work. You can look at shielding, you can look at how long you stay near people. The two-metre rule reduces the possibility of infection by a certain amount of time. If you halve that it still keeps people away from being infected but for a lesser time. The probability of being infected is much less. I think there are options about how we can do it. You can wear PPE, that could be a possibility if you have to be in close proximity or indeed you could find other ways of doing it. Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, has been speaking to BBC Breakfast. She said the public \u201cdeserve to be levelled with\u201d over a detailed plan for easing lockdown measures. We\u2019ve been urging government to publish a plan because businesses and other organisations ... need time to plan and to prepare to put in place very different organisation in their businesses and, for example, schools. Government need to put in a range of measures \u2013 whether that is mass community testing, contact tracing, and also those things like potentially the face coverings. But also I think the public who have overwhelmingly stuck by these very tough lockdown rules over the last few weeks deserve to be levelled with and also want some hope for the future, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re urging the government to give much more detail, and face masks are one part of that. An article in today\u2019s Guardian reports that government scientific advisers are examining the impact of letting children in their final year of primary school return to classrooms from 1 June. Boris Johnson is due to announce next Sunday that year six children, aged 10 and 11, will be the first cohort allowed back into schools since he announced their closure on 18 March, to be closely followed by other primary school years, and years 10 and 12 in secondary schools. The scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is said to be focusing on allowing back older primary school children initially, with the year group deemed a priority because of their need to transition to secondary school in September. Downing Street confirmed that 1 June after the half-term holiday was its target \u2013 subject to the latest data on the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 and that the prime minister would make a significant announcement on Sunday offering a roadmap out of the lockdown. Sage is expected to meet on Tuesday. You can read the full report here - In the second instalment of his interview with Sun newspapers \u2013 the first having been published in the Sun on Sunday \u2013 Boris Johnson said he feared he would not live to see his son born when he was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19. Asked if he had ever worried he might not live to meet his son Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday, he said: Well, yes, of course. We\u2019ve all got a lot to live for, a lot to do, and I won\u2019t hide it from you, I was thinking about that, yes. The prime minister said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see the way out of the skip\u201d but that he had a \u201cnatural buoyancy or refusal to give in or harbour negative thoughts\u201d. I never really thought that I wouldn\u2019t come back from it. It was more frustration. Johnson added: \u201cI owe my life to our doctors and nurses and the healthcare workers. They pulled my chestnuts out of the fire, no question.\u201d Guardian political correspondent Kate Proctor reports on today\u2019s front page that tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition. Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate \u2013 sometimes known as an immunity passport \u2013 proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased. The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people\u2019s identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood. Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests \u2013 proving whether someone has had the virus \u2013 or antigen tests, which show current infections. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is speaking to broadcasters this morning. He\u2019ll be on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme at 8.10am. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves is also doing interviews with a range of broadcasters. I\u2019ll bring you highlights from what they say. A selection of bankers, including the heads of commercial banking at HSBC and RBS, will give evidence on the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis The government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser David King will launch his \u201calternative Sage\u201d meeting of experts on YouTube at midday. They will discuss the UK\u2019s approach to coronavirus. It should be worth a watch. He\u2019ll follow up with a press conference at 4pm. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, will take questions in the Commons from 2.30pm. Expect him to be asked about that draft guidance for employers. The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, and Matthew Gould, who is heading up the NHSX contact tracing app, will also appear before parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights at 2.30pm. They will discuss the privacy issues surrounding the new app. The NHSX app is being trialled on the Isle of Wight this week. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will take this evening\u2019s Downing Street coronavirus press conference at 5pm. Politico\u2019s London Playbook reports that he will unveil plans for a vast South Korean-style \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d scheme. As reported yesterday, it is expected that the government will extend the current lockdown measures on Thursday and that Johnson will use Sunday\u2019s press conference to set out a more detailed plan for how and when they will start to be lifted. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus live blog. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest updates in the country\u2019s response to the pandemic. A draft government plan to ease the coronavirus lockdown has been seen by the BBC. It includes the suggestion that employers should minimise the number of people using equipment, stagger shift times, reduce hot desking and maximise home-working. The guidance also states that \u2013 where the 2 metre physical distance between employers can\u2019t be maintained \u2013 PPE, screens and additional hygiene procedures should be used. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that businesses needed the government to be as specific as possible in its guidance. We need as much specificity as possible so businesses can ensure they\u2019ve taken all the steps they can in order to protect their people. And as much as possible we want to see consistency across the UK it would be very confusing and costly for businesses if we saw different nations going in very different directions. They (bosses) will want to know that they\u2019re not going to be held liable to horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they\u2019ve done everything in their power to keep their people safe. Whereas by contrast you\u2019d want to see those employers who didn\u2019t take adequate steps face the consequences of that so the question of legal liability is extremely important. Elsewhere, a request by UK universities for a \u00a32bn bailout has been rejected by the government. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, has instead said that institutions could continue to charge the full \u00a39,250 annual tuition fee for undergraduates while campuses remained closed and face-to-face classes were suspended, as long high standards of online teaching were maintained. The government will also bring forward \u00a32.6bn in tuition fees that universities would have received at the start of the next academic year, as well as \u00a3100m in research funding.

A lot of thought has to be given to how this will be managed.

Indeed R is not fixed, and is affected by a number of factors, including by policies such as social distancing.</p> <p>Friston added that the current prevalence of the virus in the population is a more useful figure when it comes to making important policy decisions.</p> <p>\u201cR is post-hoc reflection, it is a nice statistic, it is easy to model,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is not really the thing you should be aiming at.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has fundamental questions to answer about its approach to tackling Covid-19, an independent body of experts have said. The Independent Sage committee \u2013 a body of 12 scientists and experts set up in parallel to the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) \u2013 is chaired by the former UK government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, who has criticised the official body\u2019s previous lack of transparency. Its members said on Monday that the government needed to make clear whether its objective was to suppress or manage infections of Covid-19, saying the two required very different processes and it was unclear which the government is pursuing. The team have also recommended that new health policies for ports are developed to prevent cases of Covid-19 being imported, particularly as and when restrictions are lifted, while they have stressed the need for better financial support for marginalised groups and the BAME community. Among other recommendations, they also advise that the government needs to move towards a local approach to testing and tracing. The group was set up by King and Professor Anthony Costello after concerns about the lack of transparency around the government\u2019s current Sage participants, and the revelation that 16 of the 23 known members are employed by the government. While the official Sage group is known to include behavioural scientists, pandemic modelling experts and infectious disease specialists, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief political adviser, is also known to have attended meetings. Holding their first meeting on Monday, the Independent Sage group discussed a number of points, including the need to avoid stoking social divisions as lockdown is eased. \u201cPeople were very surprised at how adherent the population has been and a lot of that is down to collective solidarity as people have been rising to the challenge,\u201d said Prof Susan Michie, a behavioural psychologist at UCL. \u201cGoing forwards, in terms of lifting lockdown, it\u2019s going to to be a very different situation. A lot of thought has to be given to how this will be managed. If it\u2019s not handled well, it risks potential divisions between groups.\u201d Other topics included the potential benefits to harnessing the island status of the UK and Ireland, as countries such as New Zealand have done, and developing new port health policies. Prof Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, noted that unlike many countries, Britain and Ireland have maintained open borders in the face of Covid-19. \u201cThat seems to me, as we go into a situation where we are thinking of lifting restrictions, places us in sudden jeopardy,\u201d he said, adding that a key issue at present in countries including China is cases of coronavirus imported into the country, including from citizens who had returned from travelling abroad. At a press conference, chaired by the MP David Davis, after the first meeting of the new group, King added that the government needs to manage the pandemic without banking on a vaccine, noting that it remains unclear at present how well the newly developed vaccines will work, while Prof Karl Friston, of University College London, cautioned against placing too great an emphasis on the \u201ceffective reproduction number\u201d, or R, which is the average number of people that one infected individual will pass the virus on to and has been a recurring figure in the government\u2019s daily press conferences. \u201cR in an of itself is not a cause of pathology, death, suffering or any other measurements of those things,\u201d Friston said. Indeed R is not fixed, and is affected by a number of factors, including by policies such as social distancing. Friston added that the current prevalence of the virus in the population is a more useful figure when it comes to making important policy decisions. \u201cR is post-hoc reflection, it is a nice statistic, it is easy to model,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is not really the thing you should be aiming at.\u201d",

A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as \u201ca man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month\u201d. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that \u201cdefies the usual ways of operating\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019ll need a truly global effort \u2013 because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China.</p> \n<p>Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said \u201cwe support the leadership of the World Health Organization\u201d, adding that without the UN body \u201can effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said that \u201cmultilateral cooperation is more important than ever\u201d and the meeting was the start of a global movement \u201cnever seen before\u201d.</p> \n<p>At the parallel \u201cnon-aligned movement\u201d summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as \u201ca strategic blunder\u201d.</p> \n<p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally.</p> \n<p>The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the \u20ac7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around \u20ac500m each. Turkey\u2019s contribution will be announced later in the month.</p> \n<p>The precise value of individual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed \u201cfantastic momentum\u201d and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus.</p> \n<p>From the \u20ac7.5bn initially sought, \u20ac4bn is for the development of a vaccine, \u20ac2bn for treatments and \u20ac1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission.</p> \n<p>The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible.</p> \n<p>The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: \u201cI would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit \u2026 both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cMy guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: \u201cWe have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?\u201d</p>",

But in a sign of the fractured state of global health diplomacy, the event was not addressed by India, Russia or the US. After a weekend of persuasion, China was represented by its ambassador to the EU. A separate Covid-19 summit was staged earlier in the day and addressed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders including the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. The EU-convened virtual summit was addressed in person by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Norway, Israel, South Africa and the EU, and took the form of a pledging marathon.

Trump has suggested a vaccine will be ready by the end of the year but many scientists are sceptical that even with global cooperation such a timetable can be met. The money is largely designed to speed up the process by raising guaranteed funds to coordinate research and incentivise pharmaceutical companies to distribute any vaccines and therapies to poorer countries, something that did not happen in the 2009 swine flu outbreak.

EU officials said pharmaceutical companies who will receive the funding will not be requested to forgo their intellectual property rights on the new vaccine and treatments, but they should commit to make them available worldwide at affordable prices. A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine. Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as \u201ca man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month\u201d. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that \u201cdefies the usual ways of operating\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ll need a truly global effort \u2013 because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus.\u201d Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China. Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said \u201cwe support the leadership of the World Health Organization\u201d, adding that without the UN body \u201can effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible\u201d. She said that \u201cmultilateral cooperation is more important than ever\u201d and the meeting was the start of a global movement \u201cnever seen before\u201d. At the parallel \u201cnon-aligned movement\u201d summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as \u201ca strategic blunder\u201d. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally. The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the \u20ac7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around \u20ac500m each. Turkey\u2019s contribution will be announced later in the month. The precise value of individual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed \u201cfantastic momentum\u201d and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus. From the \u20ac7.5bn initially sought, \u20ac4bn is for the development of a vaccine, \u20ac2bn for treatments and \u20ac1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission. The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible. The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing. Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: \u201cI would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit \u2026 both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.\u201d He added: \u201cMy guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.\u201d David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: \u201cWe have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries. \u201cThe factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?\u201d",

With the government weighing up how and when to start lifting restrictions imposed at the end of March, figures released by HMRC showed that companies have flocked to take advantage of the job subsidy scheme since it was launched on 20 April. HMRC said a total of 6.3m jobs had been temporarily laid off by 800,000 companies, with claims amounting to \u00a38bn by 3 May.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body that has the task of forecasting the economy for the government, said last week it expected the cost to the exchequer to be \u00a339bn between March and June. That does not include the cost of a separate scheme covering many of the five million self-employed workers which was announced later. However, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, told ITV News on Monday that the scheme would have to be wound down at some point because of its steep cost. Pledging that there would be no \u201ccliff edge\u201d termination of the scheme, he said: \u201cI am working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way. \u201cBut as some scenarios have suggested we are potentially spending as much on the furlough scheme as we do on the NHS for example. Now clearly that is not a sustainable situation.\u201d The high level of demand from employers to take advantage of the scheme suggests the government has so far succeeded in limiting the rise in unemployment. Last week an official survey showed two-thirds of UK firms had asked for public money to pay staff they have temporarily laid off. An employers\u2019 organisation, the British Chambers of Commerce, said its surveys showed more than 70% of private firms planned to furlough workers. The figures came as pensions minister, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said the government received 1.8mclaims for welfare payments between 16 March and the end of April via universal credit. It is paid to people in work as well as those who have lost their jobs. Coffey said that overall, the volume of welfare claims had been six times larger than pre-coronavirus during that period, and that in one particular week the increase had been tenfold. The number of people claiming jobseekers allowance \u2013 one of the methods use to calculate the level of unemployment \u2013 had risen by 250,000. The 6.3m jobs being furloughed shows in stark terms the scale of the economic shutdown in Britain. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the furlough and universal credit numbers showed the UK was experiencing \u201can economic crisis like no other\u201d. He added: \u201cEven despite mass furloughing, unemployment is still soaring, with over two million new claims for benefits coming though. This should remind us how badly needed the retention scheme is, but also that we are likely to be living with the legacy of high unemployment that coronavirus has given Britain, long after it has been phased out.\u201d \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

      "bodyText": "The devastating spread of the coronavirus among care homes has led to a growing number of families seeking legal advice about bringing their relatives home, the Guardian has learned. One law firm said it had received at least 10 calls a week from families wanting to overturn guidance that prevents them from withdrawing their loved ones. Advice lines said they had also seen a small but growing number of calls from those experiencing what one lawyer called a new \u201cfear factor \u2026 the fear that coronavirus will sweep through the care home and everyone will die\u201d. Recorded care home deaths from Covid-19 have been running at around 2,400 per week. When Boris Johnson said on Friday that the UK has passed the peak of the pandemic and he could see a light at the end of the tunnel, care networks hit back, saying this was not true in care homes. At the weekend, Britain\u2019s biggest care home provider, HC-One, wrote to social services officials asking for a financial bailout after modelling showed that occupancy was expected to reduce from its normal 90% to 70% by July. In a letter seen by the Guardian, David Smith, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said death rates were currently running at eight times admissions. The network had seen 637 resident deaths and three care worker deaths attributed to Covid, and the current death rate was three times higher than last year and the highest on record. HC-One, which has 328 homes and almost 20,000 residents, has asked councils to continue paying them at 90% occupancy rates. In a note accompanying the filing of its 2019 accounts, it said: \u201cThe directors consider the specific downside scenario impact of Covid-19 on the group\u2019s occupancy levels and cash flows to be so significant that it represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group\u2019s \u2026 ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d Amid concerns about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing in care homes, families now appear to be taking matters into their own hands. Emma Jones, a solicitor specialising in human rights at Leigh Day, said she is receiving at least 10 calls a week from families struggling to persuade local authority social workers to let them remove residents from care homes. \u201cPrior to the crisis, I didn\u2019t often get enquiries from families wanting to bring their loved ones out of residential care homes and into their own homes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut families are worried now that care homes aren\u2019t the safest place for their loved ones and, as a result, they want them back home. \u201cThe difference now to before the crisis is the fear factor.

A significant number have been assessed as being unable to make safe decisions about their own care. Deprivation of liberty (DoL) safeguards mean these people are unable to leave their care homes without permission from a social worker. In the year to 31 March 2019, 116,940 DoLs were granted in care homes or hospitals. Helen Wildbore, the director of the Relatives and Residents\u2019 Association, said its helpline had seen an increase in calls about the issue in the past week.

Doctors, campaign groups, academics and MPs raised the concerns about a \u201cpower grab\u201d after it emerged on Monday that Serco was in pole position to win a deal to supply 15,000 call-handlers for the government\u2019s tracking and tracing operation. They said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had \u201caccelerated\u201d the dismantling of state healthcare and that the duty to keep the public safe was being \u201coutsourced\u201d to the private sector. In recent weeks, ministers have used special powers to bypass normal tendering and award a string of contracts to private companies and management consultants without open competition. Deloitte, KPMG, Serco, Sodexo, Mitie, Boots and the US data mining group Palantir have secured taxpayer-funded commissions to manage Covid-19 drive-in testing centres, the purchasing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the building of Nightingale hospitals. Now, the Guardian has seen a letter from the Department of Health to NHS trusts instructing them to stop buying any of their own PPE and ventilators. From Monday, procurement of a list of 16 items must be handled centrally. Many of the items on the list, such as PPE, are in high demand during the pandemic, while others including CT scanners, mobile X-ray machines and ultrasounds are high-value machines that are used more widely in hospitals. Centralising purchasing is likely to hand more responsibility to Deloitte. As well as co-ordinating Covid-19 test centres and logistics at three new \u201clighthouse\u201d laboratories created to process samples, the accounting and management consultancy giant secured a contract several weeks ago to advise central government on PPE purchases. The firm said it was providing operational support for the procurement process of PPE from existing and new manufacturers, but declined to comment further. \u201cThe government must not allow the current crisis to be used as cover to extend the creeping privatisation of the NHS,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. \u201cThe process for the management and purchase of medical supplies must be open, transparent and subject to full scrutiny.

Allyson Pollock, the director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said tasks including testing, contact tracing and purchasing should be handled through regional authorities rather than central government. \u201cWe are beginning to see the construction of parallel structures, having eviscerated the old ones,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is anything new, it just seems to be accelerated under Matt Hancock.

      "bodyText": "There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, intelligence sources have told the Guardian, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began. The sources also insisted that a \u201c15-page dossier\u201d highlighted by the Australian Daily Telegraph which accused China of a deadly cover up was not culled from intelligence from the Five Eyes network, an alliance between the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. British and other Five Eyes agencies do believe that Beijing has not necessarily been open about how coronavirus initially spread in Wuhan at the turn of the year. But they are nervous about getting involved in an escalating international situation. On Sunday Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: \u201cI can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d No evidence was offered by Pompeo to back up his assertion but information has been circulating over the last month in the UK, US and Australia aimed at raising questions about the high security Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has long specialised in researching coronaviruses in horseshoe bats. Stories have suggested that workers in the lab may not have always used full protective equipment, and that in one instance a bat urinated on a researcher who did not subsequently become ill. But there is nothing to indicate a leak from the lab could have caused the pandemic, sources say. Claims are even made that the virus was genetically engineered in Wuhan, although there is both scientific and intelligence agency agreement that there is no evidence for this. American scientists who have worked with the Wuhan Institute add its safety standards are comparable to Western equivalents \u2013 and the prevailing theory is that the virus was passed onto humans via one of the country\u2019s live animal markets. Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph \u2013 a Sydney tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch \u2013 has been focusing on the Wuhan lab for several days, culminating in a weekend report which cited a 15-page dossier compiled, it said, by \u201cconcerned Western governments\u201d amid an investigation by British and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence agencies. Intelligence sources in Australia were quick to say they believed it was based on open source, public domain material.

So possibly open source leads with a classification slapped on it.\u201d Downing Street said that the UK did not comment on intelligence matters \u2013 although British sources also said they did not recognise the dossier as based on classified information provided by the country\u2019s spy agencies. Downing Street said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but a No 10 spokesman said: \u201cClearly there are questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure we are better prepared for future global pandemics.\u201d Neil O\u2019Brien, a Conservative MP and secretary of the China Research Group, said that Beijing could help fend off speculation with greater transparency: \u201cIf their government were less secretive and authoritarian they would cooperate more and so potentially put to bed wilder ideas about the origins of the virus.\u201d Last week, the New York Times reported that White House officials, led by deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, a former China reporter with the Wall Street Journal, pressed the US agencies to gather information that could support any lab theory. A report in the Washington Post two weeks later highlighted a leak of US diplomatic cables from 2018, claiming that a site visit showed the WIV had insufficient appropriately trained technicians for the high security work. The lab itself says it is distressed by talk of leaks. Scientific American re-edited an interview with the virologist Shi Zhengli last week to address \u201cthe tenuous suggestion\u201d of the lab theory, and noted the \u201cgenetic sequence\u201d of Sars-CoV-2, the scholarly term for coronavirus, \u201cdoes not match any her lab had previously studied\u201d.

There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected.

In the final phase, clubs will eventually be allowed to carry out sessions in which no more than 14 players can participate. In total, the league anticipates that there will be a month of preparation before competition gets under way. In the first phase players will return home daily, but in the final two training stages and after the return to competition clubs will adopt a training camp structure.<br><br>The move follows discussions and agreement with the health authorities and the minister for sport and is in line with the government\u2019s own four-phase plan to relax the state of emergency imposed on 12 March as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

      "bodyText": "La Liga has confirmed that Spain\u2019s footballers will go back to training this week, the first step in a month-long process towards a return to competition. The hope is that First and Second Division games can begin in mid-June. It is not yet clear how competition in the third tier down will be resolved, with a proposal currently in place to play only a set of accelerated play-offs involving the top four rather than any regular season games. Training grounds will be prepared, disinfected and inspected over the next two days \u2014 a process which is already under way \u2014 and players will undergo Covid-19 antibody tests before returning. In the first phase players will work alone, arriving at the facilities already in their kit. There will be no contact with coaching staff or each other. Small group sessions of not more than six players together will begin in the following phase. In the final phase, clubs will eventually be allowed to carry out sessions in which no more than 14 players can participate. In total, the league anticipates that there will be a month of preparation before competition gets under way. In the first phase players will return home daily, but in the final two training stages and after the return to competition clubs will adopt a training camp structure. The move follows discussions and agreement with the health authorities and the minister for sport and is in line with the government\u2019s own four-phase plan to relax the state of emergency imposed on 12 March as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Each phase will need to be authorised by the government and depends on the figures relating to the illness continuing on a downward trend. \u201cThe return of football is a sign that society is progressing to a new normality,\u201d said the president of the league Javier Tebas. \u201cIt will bring back a part of life that people in Spain and around the world love.\u201d",

Bray\u2019s resignation comes as Amazon faces increased scrutiny and employee activism surrounding its internal response to coronavirus. Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to protest against poor working conditions and inadequate safety protections, claiming the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave. In a blogpost explaining his resignation, Bray called the firings of organizers at the company \u201cchickenshit\u201d, and said they were \u201cdesigned to create a climate of fear\u201d. In resigning, Bray has become the highest-ranking corporate employee at Amazon to publicly speak out about worker conditions. \u201cRemaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,\u201d Bray, who had worked at the company for nearly six years, said. The Guardian previously published Bray\u2019s blogpost in full under Creative Commons licensing, but took it down at his request. Bray cited the experiences of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa \u2013 two user experience designers at Amazon who were fired in April after publicly denouncing the treatment of warehouse workers. Bray also cited activism among warehouse workers themselves, including actions from Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Bashir Mohammed and Chris Smalls \u2013 all of whom were fired after organizing. A leaked memo obtained by Vice News showed how an Amazon executive denigrated Smalls, who had helped organize an action at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse, labeling him as \u201cnot smart or articulate\u201d in a meeting with Jeff Bezos. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but previously cited violations of internal policies as reasons for dismissing these employees. Amazon made more than $33m per hour in the first three months of the year, according to earnings reports last week, boosted by consumers on lockdown ordering supplies to be delivered to home. The chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who was already the richest man in the world, has personally seen his fortune swell by $13bn this month to $145bn. \u201cAt the end of the day, the big problem isn\u2019t the specifics of Covid-19 response,\u201d Bray said. \u201cIt\u2019s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 5 May. Top stories Australia\u2019s coronavirus-related restrictions are costing the economy $4bn a week. Josh Frydenberg will use a speech to the National Press Club to warn that the economic shock will be profound and prolonged \u2013 wth the Treasury estimating a 10% to 12% fall in GDP in the June quarter. A leading business group is calling for the pandemic recovery and cutting greenhouse gas emissions to be addressed together, saying it would boost growth. New polling shows Australians are warming up to the idea of easing Covid-19 restrictions. And the government has released draft legislation for the Covidsafe tracing app to allay privacy concerns. There is no plan to extend daily Covid-19 testing to all aged-care staff across the country, despite the tactic being used to contain an outbreak at a Sydney facility. All staff at the Newmarch House aged care home are now tested daily after a NSW Health review found possible breaches of safety protocols. Fifteen residents at Newmarch House have died after testing positive. The federal and Victorian governments are in disagreement over whether it is safe for students and teachers to return to school, as a number of other states prepare for their students to go back to class. Meanwhile, universities are incensed by the third set of changes in a month designed to exclude them from the $130bn Jobkeeper wage subsidy program. World leaders have pledged more than \u20ac7bn to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies at a virtual event convened by the EU. The money will also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries. Internal projections in the US show the administration is expecting 3,000 deaths a day by 1 June. As Italy begins a cautious exit from lockdown, a statistics bureau has said the nation\u2019s death toll is far higher than reported. And intelligence agencies have told the Guardian there\u2019s no current evidence to suggest coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory. Australia The home affairs and employment departments are investigating a data breach revealing the personal details of 774,000 migrants and potential migrants, despite downplaying its seriousness. Guardian Australia revealed the breach of the government\u2019s SkillSelect app at the weekend. The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, is expected to put his hand up to be the Liberal candidate in the Eden-Monaro byelection. The poll in the traditionally marginal seat has been triggered by the retirement of the sitting federal Labor member Mike Kelly. The Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has poured cold water on Scott Morrison\u2019s push for weapons inspector-style powers for the World Health Organization. The NSW senator, who has a long record of taking a hard line on Beijing, instead called for the government to lessen Australia\u2019s economic dependence on China. The world The US Senate has rejected a request from Joe Biden to search for and release any records of a 1993 complaint against him. An aide has accused the Democratic presidential nominee of sexual assault, which he denies. North Korean defectors have apologised after false speculation of Kim Jong-un\u2019s demise. Kim disappeared from state media for three weeks, leading to concerns about the nuclear armed state in the event of an unexpected succession. A former US special forces soldier linked to a murky and apparently bungled attempt to topple Venezuela\u2019s leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has insisted his troops are still in action. Jordan Goudreau claimed the battle was not over hours after Maduro\u2019s government said it had foiled a US-backed sea \u201cinvasion\u201d near the country\u2019s main international airport. Recommended reads There\u2019s a chill in the air around most of Australia \u2013 perfect weather for ratatouille. Jackie Middleton says autumn is the best time to make the classic vegetable stew, and presents a new take in a filo tart. Here\u2019s a spoiler \u2026 her top tip is to cook each vegetable separately to dial up the flavour. We can\u2019t go back to the way we were after the crisis is over, argues Travers McLeod. The chief executive of the Centre for Policy Development outlines 10 steps towards a \u201cstronger Australia\u201d after the coronavirus pandemic. His ideas include aligning the growth agenda with a zero carbon future, addressing inequality and embracing flexible workplace changes. Even before the term \u201ccraftivism\u201d caught on, there was a strong trend of traditional handicrafts being used for political purposes. Explore the history of \u201csewing dissent\u201d through the ages, from the simple (the slogan \u201cVotes for women\u201d on a sash from the Suffragette movement) to the more subversive (an intricate embroidering of the warning \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die\u201d). Listen Today\u2019s Full Story examines how one man\u2019s time in intensive care with Covid-19 changed his life. A helicopter pilot, Dave Lewins, 60, explains what it\u2019s like to live through the coronavirus. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

With games, leagues and competitions around the world cancelled or on hold, a pastime once so essential has all but disappeared. \u201cIn a world without sport, we lose that easy shorthand of understanding who we are,\u201d she writes. The English Football League is facing some hard choices. Read the first of a week-long series about how coronavirus will change football. Media roundup The Australian reports that the federal government sought advice from the nation\u2019s spy agencies on the use of Chinese coronavirus testing equipment, obtained by the billionaire Andrew Forrest. The Courier-Mail has a story about Burleigh Hill on the Gold Coast being cordoned off after thousands breached social distancing rules to watch the sunset. The NT News interviews the territory\u2019s health minister about how Darwin\u2019s early role in Australia\u2019s coronavirus response informed the planning for outbreaks. And the Sydney Morning Herald reports on the closure of the cultural hub Carriageworks in Sydney\u2019s Eveleigh rail yards. Coming up Jacinda Ardern will join a national cabinet meeting today to share New Zealand\u2019s experience of managing coronavirus, amid talk of a \u201cTrans-Tasman bubble\u201d for travel. The RBA board will meet. And there\u2019s a hearing of the Ruby Princess inquiry. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 Nicolas Cage is set to take on the main character of everyone\u2019s isolation binge watch: Joe Exotic. According to Variety, the Oscar-winner will be the lead in a new miniseries based on the zoo owner made famous by Netflix\u2019s Tiger King.

He said care had become \u201cone of the most important areas of focus now for central government\u201d, with more than 30% of care homes recording outbreaks of Covid-19. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2020 to clarify that the figure given for daily care home deaths relates to those linked to Covid-19.",

      "bodyText": "Workers may refuse to turn up or stage walk-outs unless the government helps guarantee their safety, trade unions have warned amid anger over guidance designed to ease the lockdown. As ministers prepare to urge the country back to return to work, Labour joined a string of trade unions in criticising draft guidelines for being vague, inadequate and putting staff at risk because employers can choose how closely to follow them. They warned that vulnerable people such as pregnant women, those with underlying conditions such as cancer, asthma and diabetes, and over-70s could be forced to work without enough protections. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, backed workers\u2019 concerns on Monday night, saying: \u201cPeople rightly need confidence that it\u2019s safe before they go back out to work, travel or use public services.\u201d He called for a \u201cnational safety standard\u201d for businesses, schools and public services, with clear guidelines on social distancing. Boris Johnson is intending to set out on Sunday how restrictions can be eased, amid concerns about the economic cost of the lockdown \u2013 and pressure from restive Conservative MPs. A string of Tories raised concerns about the continuing restrictions in the Commons on Monday, with Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, calling for the removal of \u201carbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible\u201d and suggesting the public had been \u201ca little too willing to stay at home\u201d. Business groups and trade unions were given 12 hours to respond to draft guidelines over the weekend for how to protect people at work if the two-metre rule cannot be followed, with suggestions including physical shields, time limits on face-to-face meetings and staggered shift times. According to sources, other workplace measures include reduced hot-desking and avoiding the sharing of equipment including pens. A section marked PPE contains only a promise of more detail. One section says employers could consider limiting how many people are in a vehicle, without saying how many the government considers would be safe. Unions, led by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), criticised the non-binding guidelines for letting employers decide what is safe when it comes to distance between workers, cleaning practices and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The TUC, which represents 5.5m workers through its member unions, warned that under the current guidance \u201cbad bosses will be able to expose workers to infection without fear of consequences\u201d. The section referring to workers with underlying health conditions says they should be \u201casked to take extra care in observing social distancing\u201d and \u201chelped to work from home where possible\u201d \u2013 or alternatively \u201coffered the safest possible roles\u201d, the Guardian understands. But unions fear that creates a loophole that could allow exploitative bosses to pressure vulnerable staff to return to the workplace. The TUC is also calling for employers to be obliged to publish the risk assessments they will have to carry out before staff can return, to allow workers to scrutinise them. The GMB, which has more than 600,000 members, said the guidance \u201cdoes not adequately protect workers from Covid-19 exposure and as a result many may refuse to work to avoid putting themselves and their families at risk\u201d. It highlighted section 44 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which gives workers the \u201cright to cease work in circumstances of serious and imminent danger to themselves or others\u201d and said it was \u201cclear that failure to adequately control or mitigate Covid exposure risk would be considered serious and imminent danger by the worker\u201d. John Phillips, the GMB\u2019s acting general secretary, said: \u201cFor weeks the government has warned people this virus is dangerous and they must maintain social distancing and abide by the lockdown. They cannot just flick a switch, say it\u2019s safe to work within two metres of other people without PPE and expect them to head merrily off to work.\u201d Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA), warned that the government\u2019s demands for hugely increasing public transport from next week were unrealistic. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for the staff but passengers \u2013 how safe will people feel on overflowing train or tube carriages at the moment?\u201d he said. \u201cHealth and safety laws allow people to walk off jobs if they are at risk. That is the law of our country. And clearly our members are knowledgeable about the law. \u201cBut I hope we will not reach that stage because I do believe employers actually do care about the health and safety of members and the travelling public.\u201d With the government keen to open schools from next month, teaching unions say they are awaiting detailed discussions about how that could take place safely. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said \u201cthere needs to be an in-depth conversation about how we can keep education staff safe and, we think, parents and carers of children, safe in this context\u201d. Senior union sources said they believed the government would have to improve its workplace guidance in negotiations, especially to protect the vulnerable, but if not, then many trade unions would have to advise their members not to go into work if they feel at risk. However, they also stressed that the government appeared to want to avoid industrial tensions at a time of national crisis. Ministers are also concerned about ensuring workers feel safe enough to venture out of lockdown. In a hint that the government might be willing to make concessions to assuage public fears, Amanda Solloway, the business minister, told MPs on Monday that her department was negotiating with employers and unions to \u201ccome to a shared view\u201d about workplace safety. She was speaking after Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, wrote to the business secretary, Alok Sharma, saying unions would have \u201cno hesitation\u201d in telling members that the guidelines cannot protect workers unless they were significantly strengthened. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says: \u201cWorking people need to see that the government is genuinely committed to protecting their health and safety. At present, this guidance fails to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly and is an open goal to the worst of employers who want to return to business at usual \u2013 which will put their workforce at risk. \u201cWe want to be able to recommend the government\u2019s approach to safe working to our members and the wider workforce. As it stands, we cannot.\u201d Labour threw its weight behind the TUC\u2019s concerns. Starmer said the government must address trade union concerns about coronavirus safety at work, as he unveiled a seven-point plan for a \u201cnational consensus\u201d on tackling the virus. Speaking ahead of talks with the prime minister later this week, he said: \u201cOur priority is protecting the public\u2019s health and saving lives. That is why we supported the lockdown and again support the restrictions staying in place at this time.\u201d Starmer also said the government should beef up the health and safety executive, which will have the job of enforcing new safety rules, but has been hit by deep budget cuts in recent years. A business department spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been working with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community on developing sensible guidance for businesses that will give UK workers the utmost confidence they can return to work safely. \u201cAs part of this process we have worked closely with the TUC and look forward to continuing that close engagement, and will of course consider any recommendations they make carefully.\u201d",

The states worst hit are on the east and west coasts, with New York by far the hotspot, although Michigan and Louisiana have also been hard hit. Cases are rising in cities and rural areas.</p> \n<p>But more than half of the 50 states are now attempting some form of easing of lockdown measures.

He also said the administration \u201cmay have to put out a fire\u201d later in the year, if the virus returns.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, the president and his senior adviser Jared Kushner have repeatedly proclaimed success in handling the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Many observers have not shared their view and public health experts have warned that the US will need to dramatically ramp up testing if it is to effectively reopen the economy.</p> \n<p>In his statement on Monday, Deere insisted the \u201cphased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific-driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump\u2019s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, a majority of Americans do not agree with Trump\u2019s assessment of how he has handled the pandemic. A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-data-core-political-2020-04-29\">poll</a> last week showed 53% of respondents disapproved.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Christopher Murray, director of the IHME, said the team was gathering data about US residents\u2019 mobility during the pandemic. He pointed out that some data was being processed in order to \u201creflect the effect of premature relaxation of social distance, which has a substantial effect\u201d.</p>",

The Times report followed a Washington Post report on Saturday that said the Trump White House had followed a model for economic recovery written by Kevin Hassett, an adviser \u201cwith no background in infectious diseases\u201d. \u201cBy the end of April,\u201d the Post reported, \u201cwith more Americans dying in the month than in all of the Vietnam war, it became clear that the Hassett model was too good to be true. \u2018A catastrophic miss,\u2019 as a former senior administration official briefed on the data described it.\u201d The White House attempted to pour cold water on the New York Times story. In a statement, a spokesman, Judd Deere, said: \u201cThis is not a White House document, nor has it been presented to the coronavirus taskforce or gone through inter-agency vetting. \u201cThis data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the taskforce or data that the taskforce has analyzed.\u201d According to data from researchers at Johns Hopkins University, by lunchtime on Monday the US had recorded nearly 1,160,000 Covid-19 cases and nearly 68,000 deaths. The states worst hit are on the east and west coasts, with New York by far the hotspot, although Michigan and Louisiana have also been hard hit. Cases are rising in cities and rural areas. But more than half of the 50 states are now attempting some form of easing of lockdown measures. Some states led by Republican governors have sought to move more swiftly. Also on Monday, the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME), a team that has been cited by the White House, revised a key piece of coronavirus modeling and almost doubled its prediction for the US death toll in next three months. The IHME is now forecasting at least 134,000 deaths in the US by 4 August, while previously it had predicted just over 74,000 deaths. Trump, who is heavily dependent on economic recovery for his hopes of re-election in November, spoke in favor of reopening measures at a Fox News town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington on Sunday evening. \u201cI really believe that you can go to parks, you can go to beaches \u2026 [if] you stay away a certain amount,\u201d Trump said, adding that it was possible to balance the demands of anti-lockdown protesters with those of governors and public health experts who warn against reopening too soon. One of those experts, White House coronavirus taskforceresponse coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, told Fox News Sunday the anti-lockdown protests were \u201cdevastatingly worrisome to me personally, because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or a very \u2026 or an unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives\u201d. Birx also said the administration expected between 100,000 and 240,000 people to die in the coronavirus outbreak, \u201cand that\u2019s with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance\u201d. Hours later, Trump said he thought \u201cwe\u2019re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people\u201d, which was up from his previous prediction of 65,000. He also said the administration \u201cmay have to put out a fire\u201d later in the year, if the virus returns. In recent weeks, the president and his senior adviser Jared Kushner have repeatedly proclaimed success in handling the coronavirus pandemic. Many observers have not shared their view and public health experts have warned that the US will need to dramatically ramp up testing if it is to effectively reopen the economy. In his statement on Monday, Deere insisted the \u201cphased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific-driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump\u2019s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions\u201d. However, a majority of Americans do not agree with Trump\u2019s assessment of how he has handled the pandemic. A poll last week showed 53% of respondents disapproved. Meanwhile, Christopher Murray, director of the IHME, said the team was gathering data about US residents\u2019 mobility during the pandemic. He pointed out that some data was being processed in order to \u201creflect the effect of premature relaxation of social distance, which has a substantial effect\u201d.",

The consumer group Which? said it had been contacted by more than 1,000 people who were either disabled, elderly or had illness that put them at risk of contracting Covid-19 and were having difficulties in getting grocery essentials. Meanwhile the disability charity Scope said almost half of the 600 disabled adults it surveyed had issues getting hold of essential items and that 38% of respondents who had tried to book supermarket delivery slots in the past three weeks had been unsuccessful. Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection at Which?, said: \u201cBased on the huge number of reports we\u2019re seeing from vulnerable people struggling to get access to basic food and supplies, it\u2019s clear that the current system is not working for those who need it the most. \u201cWithout easily accessible and clearer information for these people, and stronger coordination between the UK\u2019s central and devolved governments, the food industry, local authorities and local charities, there is a risk that many will go hungry during this pandemic.\u201d Which? wants the government to simplify the system for registering for food boxes or prioritised supermarket deliveries; to step up efforts to find those who have fallen through the cracks; and to coordinate better with charities and the food industry to provide a more consistent service across the UK. James Taylor, the executive director of strategy at Scope, said the consumer group\u2019s findings echoed what his charity had heard from disabled people. \u201cMany have been forced to risk their health to visit supermarkets because they can\u2019t get the deliveries they need,\u201d he said. The government set up a food parcel delivery scheme at the end of last month in an effort to support some of the 1.5 million people it had identified as particularly vulnerable to coronavirus because of conditions such as cancer or severe respiratory illness. \u201cWe are determined to ensure the most vulnerable are supported during this pandemic,\u201d said a spokesperson, adding that the government had worked with local authorities, food service specialists and NGOs to deliver at least 900,000 food parcels in nearly five weeks.

Waitrose said about 35% of its 120,000 delivery slots last week had gone to the vulnerable. But the major supermarkets all say they cannot keep up with demand, given that the 1.5 million people identified by the government as particularly vulnerable account for a fraction of those at risk from the virus, estimated to be as many as 16 million.

The first residential women\u2019s centre will help women who otherwise would have been sent to jail by providing services that deal with underlying causes of offending, such as substance misuse and mental health problems. It is understood the centre would not be a secure site but some restrictions such as curfew times for the residents as part of licence conditions could be observed. The Ministry of Justice will work with the Welsh government and partners in Wales to identify a provider and site for the centre with the aim of opening by the end of 2021. The announcement comes as the government faces calls to release more pregnant prisoners and women held in mother and baby units (MBUs) to protect them during the coronavirus crisis. The number of pregnant prisoners plus inmates in MBUs was about 70 at the time the justice secretary announced plans to release the majority from prison in late March, but by late April fewer than half had been released. The government\u2019s female offenders strategy, published in June 2018 when David Gauke was justice secretary, included plans to develop a pilot for at least five residential women\u2019s centres across England and Wales. There are 3,400 women in custody in England and Wales \u2013 4% of the total prison population. There is a high prevalence of vulnerability among female offenders, which evidence shows can drive criminal behaviour and reoffending. Almost 60% of female offenders have experienced domestic abuse, and more than two-thirds of adult women released after jail sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year. The plans to open a residential women\u2019s centre come as the government released \u00a32.5m of funding for community services across England and Wales, which support women at risk of being drawn into crime. The funding, which will be awarded later this year, will help cover core costs such as wages, rent and bills to services that could include domestic abuse support, drug and alcohol rehabilitation or work with a particular group such as women from minority ethnic communities. The support is on top of the \u00a3750m coronavirus crisis package for charities announced by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor.",

given a century-old <strong>tuberculosis vaccine</strong> on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Devised at France\u2019s legendary

morning,\u201d Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. </p> \n  <p>Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. </p> \n  <p>Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\u201d said Diacon. \u201cNo one actually really understands why it works.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\u201d said Diacon. </p> \n  <p>The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town.

Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the <strong>United States</strong> into confrontation, Reuters reports. </p> \n  <p>The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said.</p> \n  <p>As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report\u2019s content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. </p> \n  <p>The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China\u2019s top intelligence body. </p> \n  <p>Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have relevant information,\u201d the

request for comment. </p> \n  <p>Reuters couldn\u2019t determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China\u2019s state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. </p> \n  <p>But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ed20c14567af2d7a4bab3fbcf5b9519edba2fa\"> \n   <img

schools and universities began reopening on Monday, as the country started easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>The vast island in the North Atlantic has confirmed 1,799 cases of the illness and 10 deaths, but the number of new cases has ranged between zero and three since 23 April. </p> \n  <p>A study published in April in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100\">New England Journal of Medicine</a> attributed Iceland\u2019s success at containing the pandemic to its widespread testing, having tested more people than any other country and starting a month before the first case was even confirmed. </p> \n  <p>As of Sunday, Iceland had carried out tests on 50,406 people, or 14% of its 364,000-strong population. </p> \n  <p>The aggressive testing programme appears to have helped slow the spread of the virus by allowing health authorities to detect people who were infected and contagious but had no symptoms or thought they just had a cold or the flu. </p> \n  <p>When people test positive, they have to self-isolate at home until 14 days after their fever subsides or until they test negative for the virus. Anybody who comes in contact with them has to self-quarantine for two weeks. </p> \n  <p>The University of Iceland in Reykjavik, which has 13,000 students, predicted a slow and gradual reopening on Monday, principal Jon Atli Benediktsson told AFP, and the same was expected at its six other campuses across the country. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaff16b8f0806a479812bc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T10:42:15.761Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine\u2019s</strong> government on Monday extended a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic until 22 May but agreed to partially lift some restrictions from 11 May, according to televised cabinet proceedings. </p> \n  <p>The partial lifting of the restrictions includes opening parks and recreation areas, and allowing some shops, such as those specialising in household goods or textiles, to open. </p> \n  <p>Cafes can reopen for takeaway services. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eafef558f0806a479812ba0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T10:41:18.385Z\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Major <strong>South African</strong> lender Absa said on Monday it had agreed hundreds of millions of dollars in temporary repayment relief for its borrowers, after the industry said 1.2 million people had applied for help. </p> \n  <p>The impact of the lockdown on South Africa, a country of over 58 million, mostly poor people, is expected to be devastating: the economy had already fallen into recession at the end of 2019, and official unemployment was close to 30%. </p> \n  <p>Absa said more than 376,000 of its account holders had applied for assistance and the bank would deliver 5.8bn rand of relief, such as repayment breaks or reductions in installments, over three months. </p> \n  <p>The Banking Association of South Africa (BASA) said the industry had already implemented more than 15bn rand ($798.03 million) in temporary repayment help -

The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>One of Macron\u2019s main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country\u2019s schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday.</p> \n  <p>In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new blog at the link below. Head over there for live developments in the pandemic worldwide: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is taking the lead in pressing a hard line against Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Pompeo, in an interview Sunday on ABC, said there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the new coronavirus came out of a Wuhan lab - not a wet market, as most scientists suggest. \u201cRemember, China has a history of infecting the world and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,\u201d he said. Pressed in the interview, Pompeo, formerly the CIA chief, walked back his statement that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was \u201cman-made,\u201d an idea explicitly rejected by US intelligence. Chinese state media on Monday responded with harsh commentary, denouncing his remarks as \u201cinsane\u201d and saying, \u201cEvil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies.\u201d Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization, which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory. The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support \u201cspeculative\u201d claims by the US president that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports. \u201cWe have not received any data or specific evidence from the United States government relating to the purported origin of the virus - so from our perspective, this remains speculative,\u201d WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual briefing. Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. But US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China\u2019s management of the first outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory. And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said \u201cenormous evidence\u201d backed up that claim, which China has vehemently denied. \u201cLike any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,\u201d Ryan said, stressing that this was \u201ca very important piece of public health information for future control. \u201cIf that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard,\u201d he added. Confirmed global death toll exceeds 250,000. According to research by both the Reuters news agency and Johns Hopkins University, at least a quarter of a million people are now known to have died as a result of the pandemic. Globally, 3,062 new deaths and 61,923 new were cases recorded over the past 24 hours, taking total cases to 3.58m. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 250,687. Germany set to ease restrictions \u2013 report. Germany\u2019s state premiers will agree on further measures to ease restrictions during a telephone call with the chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, Reuters reports, citing two people familiar with the preparations. French hospital discovers Covid-19 case from December. The hospital retested old samples from pneumonia patients and discovered that it treated a man who had Covid-19 as early as 27 December, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases. Italy\u2019s death toll far higher than reported. Statistics bureau ISTAT said its analysis showed an extra 11,600 deaths were unaccounted for, and it was reasonable to assume these people either died of Covid-19 without being tested or that the extra stress on the health system due to the epidemic meant they died of other causes they were not treated for. World leaders pledge $8bn to fight coronavirus. At a video-conference summit hosted by the European Union, Japan pledged more than $800m while Germany offered \u20ac525m. Italy and Spain each said they would provide more than \u20ac100m. Austrian unemployment at all-time high. The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%. Carnival to resume cruises in August. Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry\u2019s possible role in spreading the disease around the globe. Plane carrying aid supplies crashes in Somalia. The accident, involving an African Express Airways plane, killed seven people on board, a security official said. US supreme court hears arguments by teleconference for first time. In a break from tradition caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the nine justices participated remotely via a dial-in format, while the audio feed was broadcast live. In the UK, a review will analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people\u2019s vulnerability to coronavirus, health leaders have said. Public Health England (PHE) said thousands of health records of people who have had Covid-19 will be examined to establish more \u201crobust\u201d data on what can have an impact on the number of cases and health outcomes for different groups within the population. The review aims to better understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could impact on how people are affected by coronavirus, PHE added. The review is intended to provide \u201cinsight\u201d into emerging evidence the virus is having a disproportionate effect on different groups. It follows reports that deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high. Hello, Helen Sullivan with you now and for the next few hours. Get in touch any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. According to research by both the Reuters news agency and Johns Hopkins University, at least a quarter of a million people are now known to have died as a result of the pandemic. North America and European countries account for most of the new deaths and cases reported in recent days but numbers are rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia, Reuters reports. Globally, 3,062 new deaths and 61,923 new were cases recorded over the past 24 hours, taking total cases to 3.58m. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 250,687. Their figures, which are based on official and media reports, have been subject to small fluctuations in the past. Workers in the UK may refuse to turn up or stage walk-outs unless the government helps guarantee their safety, trade unions have warned amid anger over guidance designed to ease the lockdown. As ministers prepare to urge the country back to return to work, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart write that Labour has joined a string of trade unions in criticising draft guidelines for being vague, inadequate and putting staff at risk because employers can choose how closely to follow them. They warned that vulnerable people such as pregnant women, those with underlying conditions such as cancer, asthma and diabetes, and over-70s could be forced to work without enough protections. Italians were allowed out as the toughest quarantine measures were lifted throughout the country after almost two months on 4 May. About 4m people returned to work as the prime minister Giuseppe Conte appealed to the public in a Facebook post on Sunday night to \u201cact responsibly\u201d. Germany\u2019s state premiers will agree on further measures to ease restrictions during a telephone call with the chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, Reuters reports citing two people familiar with the preparations. The state premiers are expected to give the green light for large shops to reopen, probably from 11 May, Reuters says. The states will also agree to reopen schools for all grades step-by-step, though most children will only be allowed to go to class in rotating shifts, not on daily basis, the sources said. Tim Bray, a top engineer and vice-president at Amazon, is resigning \u201cin dismay\u201d over the company\u2019s firing of employee activists who criticised working conditions amid the pandemic. Bray\u2019s resignation comes as Amazon faces increased scrutiny and employee activism surrounding its internal response to coronavirus. Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to protest working conditions and inadequate safety protections. In the UK, the virus\u2019 devastating spread among care homes has led to a growing number of families seeking legal advice about bringing their relatives home, Amelia Hill and Diane Taylor write. One law firm said it had received at least 10 calls a week from families wanting to overturn guidance that prevents them from withdrawing their loved ones. Advice lines said they had also seen a small but growing number of calls from those experiencing what one lawyer called a new \u201cfear factor \u2026 the fear that coronavirus will sweep through the care home and everyone will die\u201d. Paraguay has become one of the first Latin American countries to start relaxing its lockdown, Will Costa writes from Asunci\u00f3n. The landlocked nation, which has reported some of the lowest numbers of cases in the region with 396 cases and 10 deaths, has launched a four-phase plan under which some public freedoms and economic activities will gradually be reintroduced over a period extending until early July. Under the measures introduced on Monday, people working in sectors such as construction, hairdressing and law will return to work. Paraguayans will also be allowed to leave their homes once a day to exercise. The country\u2019s president Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez claimed the low number of cases are due to citizens\u2019 good behaviour and the strict early measures taken by his government \u2014 restrictions began to be implemented after the confirmation of just the second case of infection on 10 March. Paraguay must keep moving while following the hygiene protocols and using our intelligence to take responsibility for the quarantine so that we can keep the curve flattened. The health minister Julio Mazzoleni said further relaxations and a potential return to stricter measures would depend upon developments over the coming weeks. A row has erupted among scientists over a new report into the use of face masks by the general public as an approach to managing the spread of Covid-19 in the community. The report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve \u2013 Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics \u2013 has weighed up the evidence and come out in favour of the public wearing face masks, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle Covid-19. The report notes: Our analysis suggests that their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers. If correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission. There have been 4,075 new cases and 263 deaths over the last 24 hours in Brazil, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. Brazil has now registered 105,222 confirmed cases and 7,288 deaths. New cases increased roughly 4% from the previous day, and deaths rose roughly 3.7%. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,152,372 cases in total, and said the number of deaths has risen to 67,456. Over the weekend, the CDC updated its case count to 1,122,486 and said 65,735 people had died across the country, but that the numbers were preliminary and had not been confirmed by individual states. The figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Kigali traders have resumed work as Rwanda partially lifted the strict lockdown measures adopted six weeks ago. Businesses in the capital were flooded with customers hurrying to finish their shopping before an 8pm (CAT) curfew, AFP reported. Rwanda imposed a shutdown on 22 March, closing non-essential shops, shuttering schools, suspending public transport and banning all \u201cunnecessary travel\u201d outside the home. The measures have had a heavy economic impact in the poor east African country. Jane Mutoni, a waitress at a small restaurant in Kigali, said two of her male colleagues were let go. We are now two waitresses. It has been really good to return to work because we had no other source of income. In the markets, only half the shops were allowed to reopen. Hair salons in particular have benefited from the easing of restrictions, although measures have been taken to prevent them from becoming overcrowded. John Sibomana, a Kigali hairdresser, said: We are going back to work slowly. Usually we are eight people working as a team here. But today we work in shifts at only three at a time to respect the social distancing. After three hours, a colleague will replace me. We don\u2019t earn much, but it is still better than staying at home. The government is using the pandemic to transfer key public health duties from the NH S and other state bodies to the private sector without proper scrutiny, critics are warning. Doctors, campaign groups, academics and MPs raised the concerns about a \u201cpower grab\u201d after it emerged on Monday that Serco was in pole position to win a deal to supply 15,000 call-handlers for the government\u2019s tracking and tracing operation. They said the health secretary Matt Hancock has accelerated the dismantling of state healthcare and that the duty to keep the public safe is being outsourced to the private sector, Juliette Garside and Rupert Neate write: In photographs together and with their families, the five men smile, or hold their loved ones close. All 50 or older, their friendships ranged over decades, their passions running from philanthropy to cycling, their duties from activism to business. A little over two weeks ago, they were pillars of the Pakistani community in the small pocket of Birmingham in which they all lived, with 41 grandchildren between them. Now they are all dead, victims of coronavirus. There must be equal access for developing countries to medicine to combat the pandemic, the Indonesian president Joko Widodo has said. We need to fight for just and timely access to affordable Covid-19 medicine and vaccine. Debt relief and debt repayment obligations from official creditors (for developing countries) need be rediverted into financing the handling of Covid-19. He attended a virtual summit held by 39 heads of states that are part of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a cold war-era bloc that was established in 1961 and declared itself non-partisan to any major powers.

Former Chelsea attacker Salomon Kalou has been suspended by German club Hertha Berlin after posting a video showing him breaking coronavirus social distancing rules by shaking hands with teammates. The Facebook video of Kalou, 34, greeting Hertha players and club employees with handshakes was condemned by the German league, which has put in place stringent hygiene measures as it attempts to secure the political green light to restart its interrupted season. \u201cThe pictures of Salomon Kalou from the Hertha dressing room are absolutely unacceptable,\u201d the German Football League (DFL) said in a statement. Hertha said they had suspended the 34-year-old Ivory Coast international \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. Kalou, who won the Premier League with the Blues in 2010, apologised for his actions and said he should have known better because of his involvement in health projects in his homeland. \u201cI am sorry if my behaviour has given the impression that I do not take corona seriously. I would like to apologise for this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opposite is true, because I am particularly concerned about the people in Africa, because the medical care there is by far not as good as in Germany. I did not really think about it.\u201d The Bundesliga, which is aiming to restart its season from 16 May, said mass testing of players and backroom staff had produced 10 positive results. Coronavirus funding pledges must require any vaccine to be patent-free, campaigners have said. Reacting to reports that today\u2019s Coronavirus Global Response Summit has raised $8bn for the research and development of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, Heidi Chow, of Global Justice Now said: We welcome the funding that has been pledged today and the commitment of the hosts to make any Covid-19 vaccine available, accessible and affordable to all. But what is not clear is how the hosts of today\u2019s summit intend to achieve the aim of universal access. Recent history tells us that it will not happen by default. She went on to say that participants of the summit should take concrete action and attach certain conditions to any funding pledged, specifying that any publicly funded Covid-19 vaccines and treatments are patent-free Ruling out pharmaceutical monopolies will not only prevent corporate profiteering but will also enable mass production at a scale that will be required by global demand. The challenge of our time is not just to develop a vaccine but to also take the bold steps needed to ensure new Covid-19 vaccines and treatments are affordable for all countries and free to the public. Auction house Christie\u2019s will hold a sale to help raise money for The Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) Covid-19 fund after the pandemic forced the cancellation of the charity\u2019s famous Cannes Film Festival gala. Leading collectors and artists have donated several contemporary artworks, some of which have never been seen before, Christie\u2019s and amfAR said in a statement. \u201cThe two organizations are joining forces to bridge the gap in fundraising and use it as an opportunity to address the new and urgent threat of Covid-19,\u201d they said. A date for the auction has not yet been announced but it is set to coincide with Christie\u2019s New York spring sales, which are scheduled for the week of 22 June. The announcement comes after amfAR said it was expanding its research efforts into the global push to find effective treatments for the disease caused by the coronavirus. The World Health Organization has stressed that contact-tracing apps and other technology cannot replace old-fashioned \u201cboots-on-the-ground\u201d surveillance measures as many countries begin easing lockdowns imposed to curb the coronavirus. \u201cWe are very, very keen to stress that IT tools do not replace the basic public health workforce that is going to be needed to trace, test, isolate and quarantine,\u201d the WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, told journalists at an online briefing in Geneva. He stressed the need for \u201cshoe-leather epidemiology\u201d and praised the success of places like South Korea and Singapore for their strategy. Many countries are easing lockdown restrictions to resurrect economies and contact-tracing apps are expected to play a role in helping identify new cases and contain clusters. The number of people who have died after contracting coronavirus in France increased by 306 to 25,201 on Monday, the sharpest rate of increase in four days, government data showed. On Sunday, only 135 new deaths were reported, but on Sundays the data reporting from nursing homes is often delayed, leading to a catch-up during the week. In a statement, the health ministry said the number of people in intensive care units fell to 3,696 from 3,819 on Sunday, down for a 26th consecutive day. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus also fell again to 25,548 from 258,815, continuing an uninterrupted fall for almost three weeks. European Union lawmakers said the coronavirus pandemic should not soften the bloc\u2019s long-term climate goals, although some called for a \u201cbeefed up\u201d fund to help coal-dependent regions move towards a greener economy. Europe is facing a recession and governments are pumping out cash to keep economies afloat, but the EU\u2019s executive Commission has pledged not to roll back its climate ambitions. The EU will use its Green Deal, a policy package centred around a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, to drive the bloc\u2019s economic recovery from the pandemic, Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said. EU lawmakers doubled down on the 2050 target on Monday, in a debate over the bloc\u2019s planned \u20ac7.5bn euro ($8.2bn) Just Transition Fund to help high-carbon regions shift away from fossil fuels. Alexandr Vondra, the Czech lawmaker guiding parliament\u2019s talks on the fund, had suggested the pandemic could require the 2050 climate goal to be delayed. The virus has had a \u201cprofound impact\u201d on Europe\u2019s economy, Vondra \u2013 who represents a country not enthusiastic about the climate targets and asking for more financial support for the transition \u2013 said in a draft proposal for parliament\u2019s position on the fund. \u201cIt may therefore be necessary to revise or postpone the date of achievement of the climate neutrality objective,\u201d the proposal said. However, the push for a delay found no supporters when parliament\u2019s environment committee discussed it on Monday. Lawmakers from the three biggest political groups in parliament \u2013 which make up 432 of the total 705 EU lawmakers \u2013 spoke out in favour of keeping the 2050 goal. Hungarian lawmaker Sandor Ronai said: I understand that some would like to delay this goal due to the economic challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in my view, the pandemic provides a unique opportunity to transform and rebuild our economies based on the European Green Deal. Some supported Vondra\u2019s call for the fund to be significantly larger, given EU climate targets will cost coal-reliant countries such as Poland hundreds of billions of euros. Mexican medical staff treating Covid-19 patients will be housed in the country\u2019s former presidential palace \u2013 a luxurious abode, in which the austere president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador refuses to live. Staff from three Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) hospitals will be offered temporary residence in the mansion known as Los Pinos, which was turned into a cultural centre after L\u00f3pez Obrador (commonly called Amlo) took office in late 2018. Amlo and his family now live in an apartment in the National Palace in central Mexico City. IMSS director Zoe Robledo said 58 physicians and nurses would start staying at Los Pinos on Monday, though the mansion could house up to 100 people. Robledo added that a survey of IMSS staff showed 86% of respondents wanting to temporarily reside somewhere other than home to avoid long commutes and possibly spreading Covid-19 to family members. Medical staff in Mexico report being accosted, having bleach thrown on them and having to remove their uniforms after leaving work as some in the population erroneously see doctors and nurses as carrying Covid-19. The decision to house staff in Los Pinos prompted cheers and jeers on social media \u2013 with critics panning the plan as \u201cpopulist\u201d and pointing out that many unoccupied luxury hotels in the same area of Mexico City would work better for housing staff. Mexico has reported 23,471 Covid-19 cases and 2,154 deaths as of 3 May. Its rate of testing, however, ranks among the lowest in Latin America with just 0.51 tests per 100,000 people. Turkey will start easing coronavirus containment measures as of Monday, president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said, lifting intercity travel restriction in seven provinces and easing a curfew imposed for senior and youth citizens after weeks. The country has around 130,000 confirmed cases, the highest total outside Western Europe, the United States and Russia. Ankara has rolled out measures to contain the outbreak, but Erdo\u011fan said Turkey would start easing them in May, June and July as the virus spread began slowing over the past two weeks. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdo\u011fan said senior and youth citizens will be allowed outside for four hours for one day a week starting this weekend and that travel restrictions would be lifted for seven cities, excluding Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. He said shopping malls, barber shops and some stores will be allowed to open on 11 May as long as they abide by normalisation rules, adding that universities would return to their academic calendar as of 15 June. But Erdo\u011fan warned that the government would impose much harsher measures if the normalisation plan is not followed. As Canada\u2019s Yukon territory braces for coronavirus, residents have been asked keep one caribou\u2019s length apart from each another. (For those not familiar with the dimensions of the reindeer, that\u2019s roughly equivalent to two husky lengths or eight loaves of sourdough bread.) The light-hearted advice is part of a viral public health awareness campaign that seeks to inform residents and pay homage to the region\u2019s cultural history. The guidelines from Yukon\u2019s department of health also advised residents that keeping the distance four ravens \u2013 the official bird of the territory \u2013 will help prevent transmission of the virus. Because of its geographic isolation and low population density, the Yukon territory has only recorded 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but has put measures in place to limit travellers at its borders with British Columbia and Alaska, where tourists often arrive. Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry\u2019s possible role in spreading the disease around the planet. In a statement on Monday, the operator said eight cruise ships would resume operations from 1 August, sailing from Galveston, Texas, and Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida, once a no-sail order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had expired. The CDC has issued repeated warnings that cruise travel has spread the coronavirus outbreak around the world and on Friday, the US Congress announced an investigation of Carnival Cruise Line\u2019s parent company \u2013 Carnival Corporation \u2013 over why it did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival\u2019s ships, which saw major outbreaks on the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. Studies in Britain show that most people who have had Covid-19 develop antibodies, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said, but it was too early to say whether this gave them immunity. At a daily news conference, Van-Tam said: The overwhelming majority of people so far called back who\u2019ve had definite Covid-19 infection have got antibodies in their blood stream. By and large the signal is that people get antibodies. The next question is, do those antibodies protect you from further infections? And we just haven\u2019t had this disease around ... for long enough to know the answers to that with any surety. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, added that the government was in discussions with Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche over antibody testing. Finland will lift some coronavirus restrictions, allowing restaurants to reopen and public services including libraries and sports facilities to start operating again from 1 June, the government has said. A ban on public meetings will be relaxed from a maximum of 10 people to 50 people from 1 June but emergency powers will be kept in place, it said. Essential travel to countries in the Schengen area will be allowed from 14 May, interior minister Maria Ohisalo said. Last week, the government decided to reopen schools from 13 May. The head of the World Health Organization has urged the world to unite to defeat the new coronavirus. WHO\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a virtual briefing in Geneva: This virus will be with us for a long time and we must come together to develop and share the tools to defeat it. We will prevail through national unity and global solidarity. He also praised pledges of $8bn from world leaders for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. This week, the WHO will launch its updated strategic preparedness and response plan, which will provide an update of its funding needs in order to support the international and national plans to fight the virus, Tedros said. Apple and Google have said they would ban the use of location tracking in apps that use a new contact tracing system the two are building to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smartphones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for Covid-19. Both companies said that privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data. But the developers of coronavirus-related apps in several US states told Reuters last month that it was vital that they be allowed to use GPS location data in conjunction with the new contact tracing system in order to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots. Tanzania has suspended the head of its national health laboratory in charge of testing for the coronavirus and ordered an investigation, a day after president John Magufuli questioned the tests\u2019 accuracy, Reuters reports. Magufuli said on Sunday the imported test kits were faulty as they had returned positive results on a goat and a pawpaw - among several non-human samples submitted for testing, with technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins. He did not say where the kits had been imported from or why the authorities had been suspicious of the results. Catherine Sungura, acting head of communications at the ministry of health, said in a statement on Monday the director of the laboratory and its quality assurance manager had been immediately suspended \u201cto pave way for the investigation\u201d. Sungura said a 10-person committee had been formed to investigate the laboratory\u2019s operations, including its process of collecting and testing samples. On Sunday, Magufuli also fired the head of the government medical stores department, which is in charge of distributing medical supplies and equipment to government hospitals, but gave no reason. As of Monday, Tanzania had recorded 480 cases of Covid-19 and 18 deaths, according to a Reuters tally based on government and World Health Organization data. Bulgaria will not extend a state of emergency past its 13 May expiry date but some coronavirus restrictions will remain in force for two more months, finance minister Vladislav Goranov has said. Bulgaria, which declared a state of emergency on 13 March, has so far confirmed 1,652 cases of the illness and 78 deaths. France might allow religious services to resume before the end of the month if a gradual easing of lockdown rules from 11 May did not result in the rate of coronavirus infections increasing, prime minister Edouard Philippe has said. The government had indicated religious ceremonies would be banned until 2 June at the earliest, but Philippe told the Senate this might be advanced by four days. He said: Many faiths have made proposals to reconcile how their meetings are held with social distancing rules I know the May 29 - June 1 period is for several faiths an important date on the religious calendar. The Christian holy day of Pentecost, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday, falls on 1 June. A week earlier, and before the government has said it might allow religious festivities, Muslims mark Eid, the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Britain needs new cases of Covid-19 to fall further, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, has said, even as data indicates that the peak of the coronavirus outbreak has passed. \u201cIt\u2019s now very clear in the data that we are past the peak,\u201d Van-Tam said at a daily news conference. \u201cNew cases need to come down further ... we have to get cases lower.\u201d The British government has set five tests that need to be met before it will start easing a lockdown that has been in place since 23 March. One of the five tests is that there has to be reliable data showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. Follow all the latest updates from today\u2019s daily press conference over on our UK live blog. A plane carrying aid supplies has crashed in Somalia\u2019s southern Bay region, killing seven people on board, a security official said. State-run Somalia News Agency said the plane belonged to African Express Airways and was ferrying supplies for use in the fight against coronavirus. It said there were six crew members on board. \u201cAn African (Express) Airways plane from Mogadishu flew to Baidoa and then continued its flight to Bardale town where it crashed,\u201d the news agency said on its website. \u201cThe plane crashed near Bardale airport. It was carrying medicine to prevent Covid-19. It is not clear why it crashed.\u201d The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask. Samanth Subramanian explores the newly distorted marketplace for masks and the lengths some will go to get them in the latest episode of our Today in Focus podcast. France\u2019s prime minister has stood by a plan for lifting the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown next week, despite concerns the government is moving too fast to reopen schools, as well as doubts over the availability of face masks. The French are due to emerge on 11 May from a lockdown that began in mid-March to combat the virus, and in a strategy different to other European countries, some schools are set to reopen. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said to senators while laying out his government\u2019s strategy: This confinement was necessary to meet the emergency, but its social and economic cost is colossal. We\u2019re at a decisive moment, we cannot remain in confinement. Economic life must resume imperatively and quickly. But officials have drawn fire from critics who say the country is not ready to cope with the strict social distancing and other protective measures that will be required after 11 May to avoid a flare-up of the epidemic, which has already killed nearly 25,000 people in France. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has outlined a phased reopening of business activity in the state hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, starting with select retailers, wholesale suppliers and the construction and manufacturing industries. Cuomo, speaking at a daily briefing, did not put specific dates to the outline, which envisions allowing finance, insurance, retail, administrative support and real estate businesses to restart in a second phase of reopening. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has warned that the country could face a \u201creal catastrophe\u201d if coronavirus cases spike and overwhelm health services. The current low level of infections did not mean Syria had gone out of the \u201ccircle of danger\u201d, Assad said in an address to the government committee that oversees measures to curb the pandemic. \u201cThese figures could suddenly spike in a few days or few weeks and we would see in front of us real catastrophe,\u201d he said. World leaders promised $8bn on Monday for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said at the end of a pledging event that she chaired. In the space of just few hours we have collectively pledged \u20ac7.4bn euros ($8.07bn) for vaccine, diagnostics and treatment. This will help kick-start unprecedented global cooperation. Britain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has risen by 288 to 28,734, according to figures announced by health secretary Matt Hancock. The increase was the smallest since late March, Hancock said, adding that he expected it to rise in coming days as the numbers tended to be lower over the weekend. Coronavirus deaths in Italy climbed by 195 on Monday, up from 174 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, but the daily tally of new infections declined to 1,221 from 1,389 on Sunday. Italy\u2019s daily death toll in recent weeks has always fallen on Sundays and risen the following day, while the underlying trend has been steadily declining since a peak above 900 daily fatalities around the end of March. The total death toll now stands at 29,079 the agency said, the second highest in the world after the United States. The number of confirmed cases amounts to 211,938. Italy\u2019s true death toll from the disease is much higher than is reported in the daily bulletins, the national statistics agency said in an analysis of mortalities from all causes released on Monday. There were 1,479 people in intensive care on Monday against 1,501 the day before, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 82,879 were declared recovered against 81,654 on Sunday. US senators returned to Washington for the first time in nearly six weeks on Monday, amid concerns that their legislative sessions could put lawmakers and staff at risk of contracting Covid-19. The Senate was due to reconvene to address partisan differences over the next step in legislation to combat the pandemic and to scrutinize a series of nominations for senior government posts put forward by president Donald Trump. Democrats and Republicans are at odds over the contents of any new coronavirus legislation. Democrats want up to $1tn to help state and local governments weather the brunt of the pandemic. Republicans are demanding liability protections for businesses, which Democrats oppose, as a condition for moving forward on any bill. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said Trump is looking at ways to stimulate travel and wants tax changes for business entertainment expenses to get people to go back to restaurants. With Washington still under a stay-at-home order, lawmakers have been advised by the congressional physician to wear masks, maintain a distance of six feet (2 metres) and limit the number of staff on Capitol Hill. The first real test of the recommendations will come at 5.30pm (ET), when senators are due for a roll call vote on Robert Feitel\u2019s nomination to be inspector general of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called the Republican-led Senate back into session, saying lawmakers would join American workers in essential sectors of the economy to address \u201ccritical business\u201d on several fronts. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives chose instead to remain in recess this week because of potential health risks. With some Democratic lawmakers warning that the Senate\u2019s return could risk spreading the virus, the Trump administration last week offered Congress 1,000 coronavirus tests. McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down the offer over the weekend, a decision that came under fire on Monday. \u201cBy Congress not wanting the special 5-minute testing apparatus, they are saying that they are not \u2018essential\u2019,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. There were feelings of relief and trepidation as people in Italy returned to the streets after almost two months indoors under a strict lockdown. Rina Sondhi, who lives in the Umbrian town of Orvieto, said: I literally haven\u2019t been out of the house. The biggest shock for me was the fresh air. Today I feel liberated, but with caution \u2013 that\u2019s the important thing, we can have the freedom but we must be really careful. An estimated 4 million people returned to work on Monday as part of what the Italian government called the second phase of the country\u2019s coronavirus emergency, with the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealing to the public in a Facebook post on Sunday night to \u201cact responsibly\u201d. Trenord, the company that manages train services in Lombardy, Italy\u2019s industrial hub and the region worst affected by the outbreak, said the commuter flow in the morning rush-hour was about 30% of pre-outbreak levels. Usually buzzing with activity in the morning, people wearing face masks queued outside bars in Orvieto as they waited for their espresso. \u201cThis is a great step even if we have to remain cautious \u2013 it gives you something else to smile about,\u201d said Slavik Cebanu. Jaskaran Singh, who works in Caff\u00e8 Barrique, said: \u201cWe are happy to be able to open even if things are still restricted, and to see some movement. I just hope everything goes well.\u201d Although the infection rate has been steadily falling, fear of the virus lingers. Valentina Santanicchio, a chef whose restaurant in Orvieto, Capitano del Popolo, has been providing home deliveries, said: In some ways, I\u2019m more afraid than when we closed, as a lot will now depend on people managing the moment in a responsible way. The Czech government has agreed to lift a ban on international bus and train travel from 11 May, a member of the government said. The measure was put in place on 14 March in an effort to control the spread of Covid-19. Yemen has reported two new coronavirus infections in Hadhramout, the national emergency coronavirus committee said on Monday, raising the number of diagnosed infections in the war-town country to 12, with two deaths. The province of Hadhramout was where Yemen recorded its first case of Covid-19 on 10 April. The United Nations says it fears the coronavirus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. A French hospital has retested old samples from pneumonia patients and discovered that it treated a man who had Covid-19 as early as 27 December, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases. Yves Cohen, head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in the northern suburbs of Paris, told BFM TV that scientists had retested samples from 24 patients treated in December and January who tested negative for the flu. \u201cOf the 24, we had one who was positive for Covid-19 on December 27,\u201d he told the news channel on Sunday. Each sample was retested several times to ensure there were no errors, he added. France, which has seen almost 25,000 people die from the virus since 1 March, confirmed its first three Covid-19 cases on 24 January, including two patients in Paris and another in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Cohen said it was too early to know if the patient whose 27 December test was Covid-19 positive is France\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d. Knowing who was the first is critical to understanding how the virus spread. Cohen said the patient had survived and that an investigation to trace the first contamination has been carried out. He said: He was sick for 15 days and infected his two children, but not his wife, who works in a supermarket. He was amazed, he didn\u2019t understand how he had been infected. We put the puzzle together and he had not made any trips. The only contact that he had was with his wife. The man\u2019s wife worked alongside a sushi stand, close to colleagues of Chinese origin, Cohen said. It was not clear whether those colleagues had travelled to China, and the local health authority should investigate, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wondering whether she was asymptomatic,\u201d he said. \u201cHe may be the \u2018patient zero\u2019, but perhaps there are others in other regions.\u201d So far 6.3 million workers in Britain have been furloughed, with \u00a38bn ($9.9bn) claimed from the government to sustain their wages during the coronavirus lockdown, tax authorities said on Monday. HM Revenue and Customs said on Twitter that 800,000 employers had furloughed their staff, citing figures up to midnight on Sunday. The major Canadian province of Quebec, among the worst hit by the coronavirus, started gradually restarting its economy on Monday, while prime minister Justin Trudeau maintained his cautious stance. Quebec is allowing stores with an outside entrance for customers to reopen but this does not apply to Montreal, Canada\u2019s second largest city, where retail establishments must wait until 11 May. Although Quebec makes up 24% of the Canadian population, it accounts for 54% of the cases and 60% of the deaths. Canada has so far reported 60,000 positive diagnoses and 3,800 deaths. Trudeau and senior medical health officials have repeatedly stressed any reopening efforts must be carried out carefully to head off a second wave of the virus. The provinces have a large amount of control over their economies and healthcare systems, and Trudeau has so far not offered any criticism. \u201cIf a province started to reopen and sadly saw an explosion in new cases, it would be up to that province to react. And I know the inhabitants of that province would certainly stress that they wanted to see a different approach,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. Trudeau appeared uncertain when asked by public broadcaster Radio Canada whether he would allow his children to go back to school if he lived in Quebec. He paused for a couple of seconds before replying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, while noting schools in Ontario \u2013 the most populous of Canada\u2019s 10 provinces \u2013 were not going to reopen soon. The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, according to official figures released on Monday, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%. The blow to the economy dealt by the virus \u2013 and the lockdown brought in to combat it \u2013 means 571,477 people are out of work, Austria\u2019s AMS employment service said. This compares with 361,202 people at the end of April 2019, an annual rise of 58%. The AMS said the rise since mid-March this year was \u201can extreme rise in inactivity linked to coronavirus\u201d. The unemployment rate, which in Austria is calculated to include those in training, stood at 12.8% at the end of April, up from 8.1% in February. AMS said in a statement that \u201call sectors, all regions and all age groups\u201d had been affected by the slowdown. There are now 10 times more jobseekers than vacancies, which are themselves down a third year-on-year. The hardest hit industries are hotels and restaurants, which have seen a 130% rise in unemployment, and construction, where the figure is 98%. The mountainous Tyrol region, where the vital ski season had to be ended early, had a 10% increase. Austria moved into a lockdown to restrict the virus\u2019s spread relatively early in mid-March, and is in the process of progressively lifting restrictions on movement. As of Monday, the country of 8.8 million people had recorded 15,538 infections and 600 deaths. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll is much higher than reported, statistics bureau ISTAT said on Monday, in an analysis pointing to thousands of fatalities that have never been officially attributed to Covid-19. In its first report of the epidemic\u2019s impact on Italy\u2019s mortality rate, covering 86% of the population, ISTAT said that from 21 February, when the first Covid-19 deaths occurred, until 31 March, nationwide deaths were up 39% compared with the average of the previous five years. Of the 25,354 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d, Covid-19 was registered by the Civil Protection Agency as the official cause for 13,710, leaving around 11,600 deaths unaccounted for. These occurred overwhelmingly in the northern part of Italy most heavily hit by the virus. The statistics bureau said it was reasonable to assume these people either died of Covid-19 without being tested or that the extra stress on the health system due to the epidemic meant they died of other causes they were not treated for. Officially, up to 3 May, the Civil Protection Agency recorded 28,884 coronavirus deaths, the second highest toll in the world after the United States. The tally only includes people who tested positive. The agency compiles data from the regions on deaths of people who tested positive for the virus and issues them in a bulletin at 6pm every day. ISTAT\u2019s report, drawn up with Italy\u2019s National Health Institute, confirmed the massive concentration of the epidemic in the country\u2019s northern regions, where the vast majority of unreported deaths have also taken place. In the northern region of Lombardy, which includes the financial capital Milan and has been most ravaged by the disease, deaths were up 186% in March from 2015-2019. Looking at individual cities, the worst-hit was Bergamo, near Milan, where deaths were up 568% in March compared with the 2015-2019 average. The nearby cities of Cremona and Lodi saw increases of 391% and 370% respectively. In Milan they rose 93%. In Rome, Italy\u2019s most populous city, which has been relatively lightly hit by Covid-19, overall fatalities were down 9% from the previous five years. The Sicilian capital Palermo also posted a 9% decline. Chemicals manufacturer INEOS said it has built two hand sanitiser plants in the United States in response to greater demand amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. The plants are in Arkansas and Pennsylvania and they will each produce one million bottles of hand sanitiser a month. The sanitiser will be given to hospitals across the United States for free. The firm has already opened four similar facilities in Europe. The number of coronavirus cases in Chile has exceeded 20,000, the health ministry said on Monday. Paula Daza, the health ministry subsecretary, said there were now 20,643 confirmed cases, 980 more than the previous day, and 10 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 270. Belarus will hold a military parade this week to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany, its president has said, despite having one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Europe. Alexander Lukashenko said in televised remarks that he did not want to cancel the parade in part because people \u201cwould say we were scared\u201d. Russia and other former Soviet countries have cancelled this week\u2019s commemoration to slow the spread of the virus. Last month, more than 10,000 Russian soldiers who took part in rehearsals were quarantined. Belarus has almost 17,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, giving it one of Europe\u2019s highest per capita infection rates. Lukashenko, president since 1994, has publicly said the danger from the disease was exaggerated and avoided instituting physical distancing guidelines. It is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death. The phenomenon, known by some as \u201chappy hypoxia\u201d (some prefer the term \u201csilent\u201d) is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients. A healthy person would be expected to have an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. But doctors are reporting patients attending A&amp;E with oxygen percentage levels in the 80s or 70s, with some drastic cases below 50%. Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said: It\u2019s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are. We\u2019re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they\u2019re unaware of that. We wouldn\u2019t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It\u2019s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes. In a break from tradition caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the US Supreme Court for the first time heard arguments in a case by teleconference. The case was a trademark dispute involving popular hotel reservation website Booking.com \u2013 and even typically silent Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions. The nine justices kicked off a scheduled hour of arguments in the case, not in a courtroom but by participating remotely using a dial-in format. Emphasising the unique nature of the proceedings, Thomas, a conservative justice who almost never asks questions during arguments, queried government lawyer Erica Ross about her arguments on behalf of the US Patent and Trademark Office seeking to prevent Booking.com from trademarking the site\u2019s name. The justices over the next two weeks are set to conduct arguments in 10 cases by teleconference, taking it in turns to ask questions in order of seniority. In another first, the court is providing a live audio feed, making these the first arguments that the public can hear live. Cable TV network C-SPAN said it plans to broadcast that feed in all the cases. The biggest cases to be considered by teleconference are three that focus on the question of whether president Donald Trump can keep his financial records, including tax returns, secret. Those cases will be argued on 12 May. The US president, Donald Trump, is planning executive orders to increase the production of medical products and energy components in the country, the White House said on Monday. Trump\u2019s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told Fox News in an interview that an order would soon require federal agencies to purchase US-made medical products, saying the Covid-19 outbreak had exposed the nation\u2019s reliance on China. The country\u2019s power grid is also at risk because components come from overseas, he said. Bangladesh authorities said on Monday they will gradually open up more factories, as well as farms and logistics operations, as they try to diminish the economic impact of a coronavirus lockdown which they extended to 16 May. Shopping malls were given permission to reopen with shorter than usual hours. The move followed a decision last week to reopen more than 2,000 garment factories that supply global brands, after a month-long shutdown. Much of the rest of the economy remains offline. The official tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases rose by 688 to surpass 10,000, the health ministry said. Some experts are concerned that the real number of cases could be higher in a country of more than 160 million people where many have only limited access to healthcare. The death toll rose to 182 from 177. Prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has told government officials that schools and colleges may have to remain closed until September if the situation does not improve. Kuwaiti authorities dispersed a \u201criot\u201d by Egyptian workers who demonstrated on Monday to demand repatriation amid the coronavirus crisis, state media said. Such protests are rare in the tightly controlled Gulf countries, where there is a large population of foreign workers. Security forces intervened to halt \u201criots and chaos\u201d at a housing area for foreign workers, detaining an unspecified number of people, according to the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA). On Sunday, KUNA quoted the Egyptian ambassador to Kuwait, Tareq al-Qooni, as saying that Egyptians at a camp for immigration offenders will be repatriated starting \u201cthis week\u201d. \u201cThe first flights will be for women and children who are kept in special housing units,\u201d Qooni reportedly said. Kuwait has said it will allow expatriates in violation of residency laws to leave the Gulf country without paying fines or for plane tickets. Millions of foreigners across the wealthy Gulf nations face uncertainty amid the coronavirus crisis, with many workers sick and countless others unemployed, unpaid and at the mercy of unscrupulous employers. Kuwait has so far recorded more than 5,000 infections, including 40 deaths. One of Brazil\u2019s most celebrated composers and lyricists has died at the age of 73 after contracting Covid-19. Aldir Blanc, whose mastery of the Portuguese language made him a legend of 20th-century Brazilian music, had been in hospital in Rio de Janeiro since 10 April and died in the early hours of Monday. He is one of more than 7,000 Brazilians killed by the pandemic so far. \u201cThe poet is dead. What a sad day, Brazil,\u201d the journalist Fl\u00e1via Oliveira wrote on Twitter as tributes from fans poured in. \u201cAll that remains for us is to weep and to honour,\u201d tweeted the composer Arnaldo Antunes. Blanc leaves a vast body of work including classic songs such as O b\u00eabado e a equilibrista and O mestre-sala dos mares. Many of his best-known compositions became famous in the voice of the legendary singer Elis Regina. Scores of sheep crossed empty streets in Samsun, northern Turkey, as people stayed indoors over the weekend during the coronavirus lockdown. Videos shared on social media show the animals following a shepherd along empty roads in the city, with some stopping occasionally to graze on grass verges. Participants have started enrolling in a study to find out the infection rate of Covid-19 in children and their families in the United States. The government-funded study, which will be conducted completely remotely, looks to determine how many children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, develop symptoms of the disease. The study also looks to determine whether there are differences in the rates of infection between children who have asthma or other allergic conditions, and children who do not. \u201cOne interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children have become sick with Covid-19 compared to adults,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Fauci said the study will determine if this is because children are resistant to the infection, or because they are infected but do not develop symptoms. The study will enroll 6,000 people from 2,000 families already participating in NIH-funded pediatric research studies in 11 cities. Spain will pledge \u20ac125m ($136.58m) to developing a global response to the coronavirus pandemic, prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said. Speaking at a virtual pledging conference today, Sanchez said Spain would contribute \u20ac50m to the Global Vaccine Alliance and \u20ac75m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. The funds add to the \u20ac500m pledged by France and \u20ac525m pledged by Germany. A street artist called Msale has taken it upon himself to create giant murals bringing public health messages directly to the overcrowded Mathare slum in Nairobi. With half a million people living in such \u2018a squeezed area\u2019 social distancing is quite impossible to achieve, says Msale, so he is providing information for people on how to keep safe from Covid-19 in the \u2018simplest, clearest\u2019 way he knows Hearings in the US extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will resume in September after being postponed from later this month because of the coronavirus outbreak, a London court said on Monday. Reuters reports from a hearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on Monday where it was agreed that September would be the most convenient date for the hearings to resume, although an exact date and an appropriate venue was yet to be decided, a spokesman said. Assange is wanted by US authorities to stand trial for conspiring to hack government computers and espionage. His extradition case began in February for a week before being adjourned until May 18 for another three weeks of arguments. Last week, Judge Vanessa Baraitser said it would not be possible for it to recommence this month because of strict restrictions on gatherings to curb the spread of coronavirus. A phased easing of a five-week lockdown on Abuja, Lagos and Ogun State in Nigeria has begun today, even as a rise in new cases of Covid-19 across Nigeria continues to accelerate. Infections have almost doubled in the last week to 2,500. Over 2000 cases are active infections, with 87 people dying from the virus and 400 having now recovered. Movement is permitted providing face masks are worn. Several businesses including restaurants, viewing centres and places of worship will remain closed. Gatherings of more than 20 remain banned. Yet the easing of restrictions has drawn sharp criticism. This weekend, the head of the Nigerian Medical Association said: \u201cThe easing of the lockdown even in phases is very premature,\u201d and could portend a \u201cfrightening scenario\u201d. Many African countries including Nigeria, swiftly adopted restrictive lockdowns, travel bans and other measures to curb Covid-19, far earlier than in many other parts of the world. Yet a worsening economy, and stretched security services, have diminished the limit of Nigeria\u2019s ability to withstand the effects that the lockdown has wrought. The government has provided support to only a small fraction of millions most affected. During the lockdown, the number of testing laboratories have significantly improved to 18 from four two months ago. But low levels of testing in Nigeria have only slowly risen, with 17,500 tests administered in total. Heightening fears further are hundreds of additional deaths in Kano, Nigeria\u2019s second largest city, which have now been confirmed as linked to Covid-19. Local media reports of residents fleeing Kano despite a ban on inter-state travel have heightened concerns that a potential epicentre is not secure. A two-week lockdown was imposed on Kano by President Buhari but the state governor has since declared that the measures would be suspended on Monday and Thursday this week to help residents during Ramadan. The European Union pledged \u20ac1bn ($1.09bn) on Monday for the global search for vaccines and treatment for the novel coronavirus, the European commission president Ursula von der Leyen told a pledging conference, Reuters reports. Norway pledged to give $1bn to support the distribution worldwide of any vaccine developed against Covid-19 as well as for vaccines against other diseases, prime minister Erna Solberg said on Monday. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday Germany would contribute \u20ac525m ($573.51m) to a global fund-raising push to search for vaccines and for a treatment for coronavirus. England reported 204 new coronavirus hospital deaths, the lowest daily increase since 30 March. The new hospital deaths bring the total figure of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 21,384. Scotland reported five new coronavirus deaths, taking the total to 1,576. She said there are 99 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms in Scotland, no change from yesterday. Wales reported 14 new coronavirus deaths, taking total to 997. Downing Street has published the names of the more than 50 scientists who sit on its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies to discuss coronavirus, after criticism of the secrecy surrounding the group and the Guardian\u2019s revelation that the No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings had attended meetings of the group. The list of names was made available on the government\u2019s website, showing that around half of the experts come from universities and another half are made up of government chief scientific advisers, public health officials or NHS senior staff. Cummings is not listed as a member even though he attended meetings and made interjections, according to those present. The scientists include university professors such as Wendy Barclay, Ian Boyd, John Edmunds, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Neil Ferguson, Julia Gog, Peter Horby, Dame Theresa Marteau, Graham Medley, Andrew Morris, Cath Noakes, Michael Parker, Venki Ramakrishnan, Andrew Rambaut, Brooke Rogers, James Rubin, Calum Semple, Sir David Spieglhalter, Russell Viner and Lucy Yardley. Two participants refused to be named. Membership lists of several other advisory groups were also published. \u2022 This entry was amended on 18 May 2020. An earlier version erroneously included Professor Mark Woolhouse as a member of Sage, because of a mistake in the government\u2019s list. Woolhouse is a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which is currently reporting to Sage. Migrant labourers in Indian cities whose incomes have plummeted as a result of anti-coronavirus lockdown measures have been told that they will have to pay to board special trains taking them back to their homes in the countryside. The decision has prompted derision in India, where most labourers live off what they earn in a day and have been surviving on state handouts. \u201cAt first I thought it was a joke,\u201d said Badal Raj, a carpenter from Patna who lives in a shelter in Delhi. \u201cWe have to pay? My last few rupees went on recharging my phone so I could speak to my children. Where am I going to get the money for the fare?\u201d Since the lockdown was imposed on 25 March, an estimated 10 million labourers have been trapped in the company of strangers in cities across India, with no work or income and a long way from the comfort of home and family. With public transport shut down, many labourers walked hundreds of miles to their homes in a massive reverse migration. Those who remained have been sequestered in government shelters. Mass deaths in a northern Nigerian state were caused by coronavirus, authorities said after a preliminary investigation into the phenomenon. Gravediggers in the state of Kano have reported burying dozens of corpses per day, in what the authorities had called \u201cmysterious deaths\u201d. But a local Covid-19 team, after carrying out door-to-door investigations and interviewing bereaved relatives, said coronavirus was most likely to blame. \u201cWith the preliminary report, most of the deaths recorded of recent, and tests carried out, indicated that coronavirus is the cause,\u201d the team leader, Nasiru Sani Gwarzo, told reporters. The final report will be published in the coming days, but residents needed to face the \u201cserious issue at hand\u201d, he said. He warned the pandemic had \u201cscaled to the level of community transmission\u201d. Kano, with around 12 million people, is the second most populous state in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Friday said the number of recorded infections across Kano rose to 219, up from 77 at the start of the week. Kano has in recent days seen a spate of high-profile deaths including academics, bureaucrats, businessmen and traditional leaders. The state has the capacity to carry out just 88 tests per day, which should rise to 300 this week. Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, with a headcount of around 200 million people, has 2,500 recorded cases of coronavirus and 87 deaths, according to official figures. A lockdown on Nigeria\u2019s largest city Lagos and the capital Abuja was to ease on Monday. Restrictions in Kano remain in force, although the authorities eased the measures for six hours on Monday to enable people to shop and replenish dwindling supplies. Hundreds of South African health workers were given a century-old tuberculosis vaccine on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. Devised at France\u2019s legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most trusted immunisations. \u201cWe vaccinated the first participant this morning,\u201d Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. \u201cThere are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. \u201cIt makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\u201d said Diacon. \u201cNo one actually really understands why it works.\u201d Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. \u201cIf you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\u201d said Diacon. The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town. Participants will be observed for at least a year. Similar BCG clinical trials are being conducted in the Netherlands, Australia and France. Millions of people were allowed to return to work in Italy on Monday as Europe\u2019s longest lockdown started to ease. Italy, the first European country hit by the pandemic and a nation with one of the world\u2019s highest death tolls, started stirring after its two-month shutdown. In all, 4.4 million Italians were able to return to work, and restrictions on movement eased. Traffic in downtown Rome picked up, construction sites and manufacturing operations resumed, parks reopened and flower vendors returned to the Campo dei Fiori market for the first time since 11 March. Its something that brings happiness and joy, and people have been missing that these days, vendor Stefano Fulvi said. He doesn\u2019t expect to break even anytime soon, but you have to take the risk at some point, he said. Mourners in the country are able to attend funerals, but services are limited to 15 people and there is still no word on when Masses will resume. Restaurants scrubbed their floors in preparation for take-out service, but sit-down service is several weeks away. Southern Italy braced for the return of students and workers who were trapped in the hard-hit north when the lockdown took effect. Some regional governors said they would require anyone arriving home to go into quarantine for two weeks. Its a new page that we must write together, with trust and responsibility, remier Giuseppe Conte said in a message to Italians. The Pulitzer prizes in journalism and the arts will be announced on Monday after being postponed by the coronavirus outbreak. The initial Pulitzer ceremony, which was scheduled for 20 April, was pushed back to give Pulitzer board members who were busy covering the pandemic more time to evaluate the finalists. The awards luncheon that is traditionally held at Columbia University in May will be postponed as well. Details of a fall celebration will be announced at a later date, the Pulitzer board said. The Pulitzer prizes in journalism were first awarded in 1917 and are considered the field\u2019s most prestigious honour in the US. Germany, which is part of Europe\u2019s open-border Schengen area, will extend its border checks until 15 May, a spokesman for the interior ministry has said. The measure is in line with the European commission, he added. \u201cOf course, we are guided by the European spirit not to act unilaterally or in an uncoordinated way.\u201d Numerous Schengen countries have imposed emergency border checks in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. A street artist called Msale has created giant murals bringing public health messages directly to the overcrowded Mathare slum in Nairobi, Kenya. With half a million people living in such \u201ca squeezed area\u201d social distancing is quite impossible to achieve, says Msale, so he is providing information for people on how to keep safe in the \u201csimplest, clearest\u201d way he knows. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 199 on Monday to 40,770, with 26 new deaths, health authorities said. Total deaths in the country rose to 5,082, the Netherlands Institute for Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned that it only reports confirmed cases and deaths, and actual numbers are higher. Zimbabwe is headed for a health and economic catastrophe from the coronavirus pandemic because its debt arrears mean it cannot access foreign lenders, the finance minister warned in a letter to the IMF. Mthuli Ncube said in the letter dated 2 April and seen by Reuters on Monday that Zimbabwe needed to start talks and normalise ties with foreign creditors to clear its decades-old arrears and unblock urgently-needed funding. \u201cThe Zimbabwean authorities propose a high-level dialogue on mitigating the economic and social downfall from the Covid-19 pandemic through transformative arrears clearance ... short of which the country will suffer a health and economic catastrophe,\u201d Ncube said in the letter. It was sent to the IMF and copied to the World Bank, African Development Bank, European Investment Bank and the chair of the Paris Club of sovereign creditors. The IMF declined to comment on the leaked letter. An official in the agency, who declined to be identified, confirmed the letter had been received. Lenders like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank stopped lending to Zimbabwe in 1999 after the country defaulted on its debt repayments. That has led the government to resort to domestic borrowing and money-printing to finance the budget deficit, pushing inflation to 676.39% in March year-on-year, one of the highest in the world. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Zimbabwe was grappling with its worst economic crisis in a decade, marked by shortages of foreign exchange, medicines and electricity as frustration over president Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government grows. Zimbabwe has reported just 34 coronavirus cases and four deaths. Yet the economic effects of its lockdown have been ruinous. More than half of Zimbabwe\u2019s 15 million people already needed food aid after a drought in 2019, according to the government and aid agencies, which shrank the economy by 6%. The president last week promised a $720m stimulus package for distressed companies, but did not say where the money would come from. \u201cCumulatively, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy could contract by between 15% and 20% during 2019 and 2020. This is a massive contraction with very serious social consequences,\u201d Ncube said in the letter. \u201cZimbabwe desperately needs international support,\u201d Ncube said, adding that the pandemic could lead to loss of lives and \u201craise poverty to levels not seen in recent times\u201d. China\u2019s southern Guangdong province has launched a raft of anti-discrimination policies targeting businesses and venues after a heavy-handed crackdown on the African community sparked international outrage last month. Authorities in the provincial capital Guangzhou had started mass testing its African community shortly after a cluster of Covid-19 cases was found in a neighbourhood with a large migrant population, and a wave of reports about discrimination and xenophobia followed. The new anti-racism rules, announced at the weekend, came after many Africans in Guangzhou said they had been forcibly evicted by police from their accommodation, refused service at shops and restaurants, and were subject to mass coronavirus testing and arbitrary quarantines. Now, businesses and residential compounds \u201cmust implement non-discriminatory service \u2026 treat all Chinese and foreigners in Guangdong equally, and firmly oppose any racist or discriminatory speech and behaviour,\u201d according to a Sunday report by the state-run China News Service. The new policies appeared to address some of the concerns raised by the African community, banning public spaces from setting tighter entry requirements for certain nationalities and promising to punish buses and taxis who refuse foreign passengers. They also ban landlords from cancelling housing contracts or increasing rent without explanation. However, the measures do not outline any specific punishments. A total of 111 African nationals in Guangzhou have tested positive for Covid-19, including 19 imported cases, officials announced on 11 April. The vast majority of imported cases in Guangdong province involved returning Chinese nationals. McDonald\u2019s China was among the businesses who came under fire. It apologised after a branch in Guangzhou displayed a sign banning black people from entry, prompting online outrage. Two US biotech companies have identified a drug candidate for treating Covid-19 and plan to begin human testing by the end of the year, the companies said on Monday. Vir Biotechnology Inc and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc said the therapy candidate makes use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology that targets and \u201csilences\u201d specific genetic material, blocking the production of deadly proteins that cause diseases. Is air pollution making the coronavirus pandemic even more deadly? My colleague, environment editor Damian Carrington, has written a comprehensive summary of the research into whether air pollution is turbo-charging the coronavirus pandemic. He writes: Researchers caution that plausibility is far from proof, and correlation does not necessarily mean causation, as many other factors may be important. But these initial findings do raise cause for concern \u2013 and may play a crucial role in helping us understand and combat the spread of the pandemic. More than 10 times as many people in Germany have probably been infected with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, researchers from the University of Bonn have concluded from a field trial in one of the worst hit towns. The preliminary study results, which have yet to be peer reviewed for publication in a scientific journal, serve as a reminder of the dangers of infection by unidentified carriers of the virus, some of whom show no symptoms, the researchers said. The readings come as Germany took further steps on Monday to ease restrictions, with museums, hairdressers, churches and more car factories reopening under strict conditions. About 1.8 million people living in Germany must have been infected, more than 10 times the number of about 160,000 confirmed cases so far, the team led by medical researchers Hendrik Streeck and Gunther Hartmann concluded. \u201cThe results can help to further improve the models to calculate how the virus spreads. So far the underlying data has been relatively weak,\u201d Hartmann said in a statement. The team analysed blood and nasal swabs from a random sample of 919 people living in a town in the municipality of Heinsberg on the Dutch border, which had among the highest death tolls in Germany. To arrive at their estimate, the researchers put the town\u2019s number of known deaths from Covid-19 relative to the larger estimate of local people with a prior infection \u2013 as indicated by antibody blood test readings \u2013 and applied the rate of 0.37% to country-wide deaths. They also found that about one in five of those infected showed no symptoms. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has revived calls for a European tax on digital businesses, saying the coronavirus crisis made such levies more pertinent than ever. Nearly 140 countries are negotiating the first major rewriting of international tax rules in more than a generation, to take better account of the rise of big tech companies that often book profit in low-tax countries. However, the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak has left finance ministries more focused on saving their economies than overhauling outdated tax rules, making a deadline of the end of the year to wrap up the talks look increasingly stretched. Le Maire had said before the crisis that if the talks organised by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fail, then the European Union should create its own digital tax. Le Maire said in a Linkedin Live event: This crisis shows that those who are making out the best are the digital giants, simply because they are able to keep their businesses going and yet they are the ones that are the least taxed. My digital tax proposal is more relevant than ever and I hope that our European partners will recognise the absolute necessity to step up the taxation of digital giants. Past attempts to create an EU-wide digital tax have failed in the face of opposition from Ireland, where many big US tech companies book profits, and some Nordic countries. In the face of the deadlock, some European countries, starting with France, have pushed ahead with their own national taxes on digital companies. France\u2019s tax triggered threats of tariff retaliation from the United States, which have been put on hold to give time for a deal to be reached this year at the OECD. Romania will not extend a state of emergency past its 15 May expiry date, but will impose a \u201cstate of alert\u201d allowing some modest relaxation of restrictions, president Klaus Iohannis said on Monday. \u201cUnfortunately this epidemic has not yet passed. We need to be responsible and be very cautions further ahead,\u201d Iohannis said, adding that some travel restrictions were lifted but \u201cpeople won\u2019t be allowed to travel in groups larger than three\u201d. Gatherings, outdoor and indoor, were still banned, he added. An internal Chinese report warns that Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the United States into confrontation, Reuters reports. The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said. As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report\u2019s content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China\u2019s top intelligence body. Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. \u201cI don\u2019t have relevant information,\u201d the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson\u2019s office said in a statement responding to questions from Reuters on the report. China\u2019s Ministry of State Security could not be reached for comment. CICIR, an influential think tank that until 1980 was within the ministry of state security and advises the Chinese government on foreign and security policy, did not reply to a request for comment. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China\u2019s state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. Relations between China and the United States are widely seen to be at their worst point in decades, with deepening mistrust and friction points from US allegations of unfair trade and technology practices, to disputes over Hong Kong, Taiwan and contested territories in the South China Sea. In recent days, US president Donald Trump, facing a more difficult re-election campaign as the coronavirus has claimed tens of thousands of American lives and ravaged the US economy, has been ramping up his criticism of Beijing and threatening new tariffs on China. His administration, meanwhile, is considering retaliatory measures against China over the outbreak, officials said. It is widely believed in Beijing that the United States wants to contain a rising China, which has become more assertive globally as its economy has grown. An international conference to drive forward the global race for coronavirus vaccines, treatments and tests is taking place today. The virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, is co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and the European Commission. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will confirm the government\u2019s pledge of \u00a3388m in aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments. This includes \u00a3250m for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop vaccines against coronavirus \u2013 the biggest such donation to the fund by any country. Speaking to the conference, Johnson will say: The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus - we are in this together, and together we will prevail. On Thursday, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca announced a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university. Swiss parliamentarians, who broke off work in March over the coronavirus outbreak, gathered on Monday in a large exhibition hall for a special session to discuss the best way forward in the pandemic. Opening the session in Bern - only the fourth in history to be held outside Switzerland\u2019s stately parliament building - president Simonetta Sommaruga acknowledged that the country was living through \u201can unprecedented crisis\u201d and urged MPs to get back to work. \u201cThe government needs you,\u201d she said, standing at a lonely podium, her microphone covered with a plastic bag, in a large hall with the country\u2019s 246 parliamentarians and their aides seated at tables spaced out with at least two metres between them. Sommaruga acknowledged that the government had been forced during the crisis to infringe on personal and economic liberties but said it had not taken such decisions \u201clightly\u201d. Over the next four days, MPs will discuss the restrictions imposed to halt the spread of the virus, and the path forward as Switzerland, like a number of other European countries, begins easing the lockdown. The wealthy Alpine country of some 8.5 million people has been relatively hard-hit by the pandemic, counting more than 1,450 deaths out of almost 30,000 people infected. Last week, hairdressers, garden centres, hardware stores and doctors\u2019 surgeries reopened again. Next week, schools, shops and markets, along with restaurants, museums and libraries are set to open their doors as well. Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, has outlined a list of what the public should be expecting of and demanding from their governments during the coronavirus pandemic. In brief: An aggressive \u201ctest, trace, isolate\u201d policy involving mass community testing The protection of health and social care workers who are most at risk from contracting the virus Constant surveillance of the virus using tracking systems to quickly detect hotspots across the country Clear and honest communication with the public to ensure trust Recognition that any \u201cexit\u201d strategy will not mean a return to normal pre-coronavirus Lockdowns are not a solution by themselves - they should be used as sparingly as possible The world is still awaiting key scientific findings that will determine the ultimate \u201cexit strategy\u201d. Iceland\u2019s secondary schools and universities began reopening on Monday, as the country started easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of coronavirus. The vast island in the North Atlantic has confirmed 1,799 cases of the illness and 10 deaths, but the number of new cases has ranged between zero and three since 23 April. A study published in April in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed Iceland\u2019s success at containing the pandemic to its widespread testing, having tested more people than any other country and starting a month before the first case was even confirmed. As of Sunday, Iceland had carried out tests on 50,406 people, or 14% of its 364,000-strong population. The aggressive testing programme appears to have helped slow the spread of the virus by allowing health authorities to detect people who were infected and contagious but had no symptoms or thought they just had a cold or the flu. When people test positive, they have to self-isolate at home until 14 days after their fever subsides or until they test negative for the virus. Anybody who comes in contact with them has to self-quarantine for two weeks. The University of Iceland in Reykjavik, which has 13,000 students, predicted a slow and gradual reopening on Monday, principal Jon Atli Benediktsson told AFP, and the same was expected at its six other campuses across the country. Ukraine\u2019s government on Monday extended a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic until 22 May but agreed to partially lift some restrictions from 11 May, according to televised cabinet proceedings. The partial lifting of the restrictions includes opening parks and recreation areas, and allowing some shops, such as those specialising in household goods or textiles, to open. Cafes can reopen for takeaway services. Major South African lender Absa said on Monday it had agreed hundreds of millions of dollars in temporary repayment relief for its borrowers, after the industry said 1.2 million people had applied for help. The impact of the lockdown on South Africa, a country of over 58 million, mostly poor people, is expected to be devastating: the economy had already fallen into recession at the end of 2019, and official unemployment was close to 30%. Absa said more than 376,000 of its account holders had applied for assistance and the bank would deliver 5.8bn rand of relief, such as repayment breaks or reductions in installments, over three months. The Banking Association of South Africa (BASA) said the industry had already implemented more than 15bn rand ($798.03 million) in temporary repayment help - with roughly half going to individuals and half to businesses. The death toll from the Covid-19 outbreak in Iran rose by 74 in the past 24 hours to 6,277, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on Monday. The total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the countries hardest hit by the outbreak in the Middle East, has reached 98,647, he said. Indian police fired tear gas on Monday to scatter migrant workers during clashes in the western state of Gujarat, officials said, as authorities relaxed one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The nationwide lockdown, extended twice since it was implemented on 25 March, is being eased in some areas, but will run until 17 May, the government said last week. The tally of infections stands at more than 42,500, with 1,300 dead. About 1,000 stranded workers seeking help to return to homes in states across India gathered on the outskirts of the industrial and diamond-processing city of Surat, but threw stones at police who ordered them to break up, an official said. \u201cThe police fired tear gas shells to disperse protesters,\u201d a police official in Kadodara, near the site of the clash, told Reuters, seeking anonymity as he was not authorised to speak with media. Television showed images of police entering buildings and homes in the area and detaining people. Surat has suffered incidents of labour unrest since the lockdown began. The shutdown endangers the economic survival of many of India\u2019s estimated 140 million migrant labourers, though officials say it is key to beating the virus in a nation of 1.3 billion people, where health services are already stretched. It\u2019s Jessica Murray here, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Aamna and will be running the global live blog for the next few hours, updating you on the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. If you\u2019re looking for UK-focused coronavirus news, Andrew Sparrow is heading up the UK live blog as ministers discuss plans for how Britain\u2019s lockdown could be eased. As always, feel free to get in touch with your suggestions and experiences - you can reach me via jessica.murray@theguardian.co.uk or @journojess_ on Twitter. US officials believe China hid virus\u2019s severity to hoard medical supplies. An intelligence report by US Department of Homeland Security, obtained by AP, claims China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it. The report follows claims by US defence secretary Mark Esper that Russia and China are taking advantage of the coronavirus emergency to put their interests forward in Europe. Police in Kuwait dispersed protests by stranded Egyptians unable to return home. The development was the first reported sign of unrest from the region\u2019s vast population of foreign workers who have lost their jobs over the crisis. Japan extends the country\u2019s national state of emergency to May 31. Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he had decided to extend the country\u2019s national state of emergency to 31 May, Reuters reports. High schools and universities slowly reopen in Iceland. The country began easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. South Africa\u2019s unemployment rate could reach 40%. In a radio interview, South Afica\u2019s treasury director general, Dondo Mogajane, said the country could see about 200bn rand under-collection in tax revenue, painting the starkest picture yet of the economic impact of the coronavirus on the nation. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has risen by 10,581 over the past 24 hours. This brought Russia\u2019s nationwide tally to 145,268, the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said on Monday. Swimming body FINA postpones 2021 World Aquatics Championships to 2022. The FINA World Championships in Fukuoka (JPN) was initially scheduled for the summer of 2021, but will now take place from 13-29 May 2022. Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has been giving evidence to the European parliament\u2019s committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Ammon told the committee that only Bulgaria among all European countries is still experiencing an increase in cases of infection. She said: \u201cThe country where we now see still an increase is Bulgaria. There are four countries where we see no substantial changes in the last 14 days \u2013 Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the UK. All the others we really see this substantial decrease.\u201d Ammon said that lockdowns in Europe have reduced the overall transmission of coronavirus by 45% compared with 8 April. \u201cAs of Saturday it appears the initial wave of transmission has passed its peak,\u201d she said. Ammon sounded cautious about the rollout of masks to the public as a way of controlling the spread given the lack of evidence for their utility. \u201cWearing a face mask should always be seen as an additional tool to hand-washing and social distancing measures,\u201d she said. Ammon added that there was a risk that masks would give citizens a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d. She said: This is a marathon not a sprint. People\u2019s expectations about the pandemic situation, duration, effect it\u2019ll continue to have on their lives for the foreseeable future needs to be managed. This isn\u2019t going to end any time soon and people need to prepare for it. Ammon said her agency had \u2018low confidence\u2019 that the death figures collected by governments within the EU/EEA and the UK are complete. An intelligence report by US Department of Homeland Security, obtained by AP, claims China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it. Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page dated 1 May. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable. The French prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe will present more details of the government\u2019s deconfinement or end of lockdown plan as well as the bill extending the \u201cstate of health emergency\u201d until 24 July, to the S\u00e9nat, the upper house of parliament, on Monday afternoon. The government is hoping for a quick passage through the house and on to the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale tomorrow where the debate is likely to be more heated, but where Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government has a large majority. France\u2019s health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran warned at the weekend that the date for the end of lockdown of 11 May is not set in stone and if there is no significant continuation of the drop in the spread of the virus, the date would be put back. However, the figures are continuing to look encouraging and the curve is still heading downwards, so France will almost certainly end the lockdown in a week. But the return to more normal life will be \u201cprogressive\u201d and will largely depend on where the virus is still circulating and how hospital intensive care units are coping. A map, updated every day, has been published dividing the country\u2019s departments into \u201cred\u201d, \u201corange\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d, indicating which areas may still face some lockdown regulations. The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future. One of Macron\u2019s main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country\u2019s schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday. In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday. The opening of classes is hampered because the city will almost certainly remain \u201cred\u201d on the coronavirus map and many city school buildings make it impossible to impose social distancing on youngsters. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo is among 334 mayors from the \u00cele de France region who have written an open letter to Macron asking for the reopening of schools to be postponed because of concerns over the potential health risk to children and teachers. For a second consecutive day, Spain\u2019s overnight coronavirus death toll has reached 164, according to the latest figures from the health ministry. To date, there have been 218,011 confirmed cases in the country and 25,428 deaths. The embattled carrier Norwegian Air has won support from aircraft lessors for its rescue plan as it faces a crunch shareholder vote on the $1.2bn (\u00a3950m) plan to convert debt into equity at an emergency meeting on Monday. Norwegian\u2019s shareholder meeting got under way in Oslo on Monday morning, as the European Union\u2019s competition watchdog approved French state aid worth \u20ac7bn (\u00a36bn) for Air France. The Covid-19 pandemic has plunged the global aviation industry into its worst crisis, bringing air travel to a near-standstill. Airlines across Europe have sought government help as coronavirus lockdowns have forced them to ground their fleets. As it approved the French state guarantee and shareholder loan to Air France, the European commission noted the importance of the carrier, with more than 300 planes, to the French economy and its role in repatriating stranded citizens and transporting medical supplies. Norwegian \u2013 one of the biggest airlines at London\u2019s Gatwick airport \u2013 grounded 95% of its fleet in mid-March and has warned it could run out of cash by the middle of the month unless it pushes through its rescue plan. The plan will hand majority ownership to the airline\u2019s creditors and leave current shareholders with just 5.2% of the company, but there was no alternative, Norwegian\u2019s chief executive, Jacob Schram, said. He told Norway\u2019s TV2: \u201cWithout a yes [from shareholders], it will be game over.\u201d Malaysian health authorities on Monday reported 55 new coronavirus cases, Reuters reports, raising the total to 6,353 cases as Malaysians began heading out under relaxed curbs on movement and businesses. There were no new fatalities reported, leaving total deaths at 105. Meanwhile, Indonesia reported 395 new coronavirus infections on Monday, taking the total in the south-east Asian country to 11,587, said health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto reported 19 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the total to 864, while 1,954 have recovered. More than 86,000 people have been tested, he said. The number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh surpassed 10,000 on Monday, the country\u2019s health ministry said, Reuters reports, with infections increasing in pace over the past several days. Bangladesh reported 688 new cases of Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, taking its tally since it reported its first case two months ago to 10,143. The death toll rose to 182. Russia and China are taking advantage of the coronavirus emergency to put their interests forward in Europe, US defence secretary Mark Esper claimed on Monday, according to a report by Reuters. Both China and Russia have offered support to Italy, sending doctors, medical equipment and face masks to the country which was the first in Europe to be hit hard by the outbreak. When asked whether China and Russia were trying to gain influence in Italy by sending aid, Esper told the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa: [The United States] is aware that some will try to use the pandemic as a way to invest in critical industry and infrastructure, with effect on security in the long term... Potential opponents will almost certainly try to use their interest to put their interests forward and create divisions in NATO and Europe Huawei and 5G are an important example of this malign activity by China.\u201d Esper\u2019s comments come at a time when some US officials have blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Sunday Washington had evidence the disease emerged from a Chinese lab, which Beijing strongly denies. Police in Kuwait dispersed what they described as a riot by stranded Egyptians unable to return home amid the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said on Monday, AP reports. The development was the first reported sign of unrest from the region\u2019s vast population of foreign workers who have lost their jobs over the crisis. Online videos purported to show Kuwaiti police firing teargas at the demonstrators overnight, who earlier chanted: \u201cWhere is our embassy?\u201d The state-run Kuna news agency called the confrontation a \u201criot\u201d carried out by Egyptians corralled at a group shelter. \u201cSecurity officials intervened and took control, arresting a number of them,\u201d the Kuna report said. It did not acknowledge what level of force police used to put down the unrest, nor how many people authorities ultimately arrested after the incident. Kuwait\u2019s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he had decided to extend the country\u2019s national state of emergency to May 31, Reuters reports. Abe will consider lifting the state of emergency without waiting for its 31 May expiration if experts decide that is possible based on detailed analysis of regional infection trends, he said at the start of a meeting of the government\u2019s coronavirus task force. Iceland\u2019s secondary schools and universities began reopening on Monday, as the country began easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, AFP reports. The country, a vast island of 364,000 people located in the North Atlantic, has confirmed 1,799 cases of the illness and 10 deaths, but the number of new cases has ranged between zero and three since 23 April. The University of Iceland in Reykjavik, which has 13,000 students, predicted a slow and gradual reopening, principal Jon Atli Benediktsson told AFP, and the same was expected at its six other campuses across the country. Of Iceland\u2019s 38 secondary schools, it was mainly vocational schools that were resuming classes in smaller groups. At these schools, which often involve practical classes, the approaching end-of-year exams must be conducted in person and not online. Most general secondary schools contacted by AFP said they would not be reopening and would instead continue distance learning for the last three weeks of the academic year, avoiding the need to find tricky solutions to social distancing in classrooms. Those students will take their final exams exclusively online. Nursery schools and primary schools, which have remained open albeit with reduced hours, resumed their regular schedules on Monday. Hundreds of people queued outside liquor stores in New Delhi on Monday as the Indian capital began easing some curbs after a 40-day lockdown against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Some offices resumed work with fewer staff and traffic trickled into the streets. Many government cars were among the traffic on Delhi\u2019s boulevards on Monday, while police at checkpoints peered into cars to ensure there were no more than two occupants. Everyone wore masks. South Africa\u2019s treasury director general warned that unemployment rate could reach 40%, Reuters reports. In a radio interview, Dondo Mogajane said the country could see around 200bn rand under-collection in tax revenue, painting the starkest picture yet of the economic impact of the coronavirus on the nation. He added the economy could contract by between 6% and 12% due to the coronavirus. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has risen by 10,581 over the past 24 hours, Reuters reports, compared with a record of 10,633 on the previous day. This brought Russia\u2019s nationwide tally to 145,268, the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said on Monday. It also reported 76 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total death toll in Russia to 1,356. Britain\u2019s defence minister declined to comment on media reports that a dossier by the US led \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 intelligence consortium had said that China lied about the coronavirus outbreak. The 15-page intelligence report claimed China deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak in an \u201cassault on international transparency\u201d that cost tens of thousands of lives. The report, obtained by Australia Sunday Telegraph, was reportedly produced by The Five Eyes, an intelligence group made up of Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. When asked about the report on BBC Radio, defence secretary Ben Wallace said: \u201cEvery day I get intelligence bulletins from our agencies around the world. I don\u2019t comment on individual bulletins, what I have and haven\u2019t seen. That would be wrong.\u201d The Five Eyes evolved from a secret World War Two alliance between British and U.S. cypher and code breaking teams, Reuters reports. The Ugandan government has launched an investigation into the activities of a megachurch in Kampala after seven members of its internationally renowned children\u2019s choir were diagnosed with Covid-19 following an overseas tour. The country\u2019s child affairs minister, Florence Nakiwala Kiyingi, told the Guardian the Internal Security Organisation was investigating Watoto church for allegedly breaching child labour laws, taking the children out of the country without permission and putting them at risk by not cancelling the tour as coronavirus cases escalated and countries closed their borders. The church has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment on the allegations. The children, aged between seven and 10, were diagnosed shortly after returning from a UK tour on 20 March. They, along with seven adults on the tour who also tested positive for the virus, have all now fully recovered, the church said. However, more than 80 members of the choir, including 48 children, reportedly remain stranded in the US, Malaysia, New Zealand and Brazil as they were unable to travel back to Uganda before the country closed its borders on the 23 March. As of Tuesday, Uganda had 83 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. In Afghanistan, the health ministry has warned that the threat of coronavirus is at its highest level across the war-torn country as number of confirmed deaths of Covid-19 reached 90. The country reported 190 new coronavirus cases and five new deaths over past 24 hours, including the highest one-day rise of infections in Paktia province and continued surge of transmission in Kandahar. Th latest figures push the total number of infections to 2894 and death toll to 90. The number of transmission continued to surge in Kandahar and Kabul on Monday, with around 50 new cases confirmed in both provinces. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 704 confirmed cases. One-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan\u2019s capital came back positive, health officials said Sunday. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said on Monday that the result of 500 tests are concerning though it\u2019s \u201cnot comparable with around 5 million population of Kabul and the tests were rapid and some may not confirmed at the end\u201d. He warned in press conference that the threat of the coronavirus is currently at its \u201chighest level\u201d. And asked the people to cooperate with health workers and stay at home. The Afghan government has pledged to distribute bread to poor people over the weekend using Kabul bakeries. \u201cSome bread is being distributed in the bakeries, but more people gathering. It has more disadvantages than advantages because the virus is spreading rapidly\u201d, said Wahidullah Mayar, health ministry spokesman. War continued to intensify in the country, a government spokesman said 17 civilians were killed by the Taliban in first week of Ramadan. The FINA World Championships in Fukuoka (JPN) was initially scheduled for the summer of 2021, but will now take place from 13 May 2022 to 29 May 2022. FINA president Dr Julio C. Maglione said in a statement: After liaising with the relevant stakeholders and receiving feedback from them, we have no doubt that the decision taken will provide the best possible conditions for all participants at the Championships. We look forward to witnessing the world\u2019s best aquatic athletes from around the world competing in the city of Fukuoka (JPN) in 2022 At a time of unprecedented uncertainty, FINA hopes the announcement of these dates will allow for some clarity in planning for all concerned. Singapore\u2019s health ministry said on Monday it confirmed 573 new coronavirus cases, taking the city-state\u2019s tally of infections to 18,778, according to a report by Reuters. Is Australia flattening the curve? My colleagues in Australia dig into the data. They bring together all the Covid-19 confirmed cases, maps, stats and graphs from NSW, Victoria, Queensland, SA, WA, Tasmania, ACT and NT to get a broad picture of the Australian outbreak and track the impact of government response. A global alliance of world leaders, potentially including China and the US, is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (\u00a36.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them. National prestige and huge profits are potentially at stake for the countries and firms that win the race for a vaccine that can take the world\u2019s economies out of lockdown, but there is a risk of uncoordinated duplication of research efforts slowing the process and adding to the cost. Monday\u2019s fundraising summit comes after the concept was launched at a previous meeting on 24 April. Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization. The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit. But optimism that the US might relent and join the initiative had waned by Monday morning. PA Media has a breakdown of what different aspects of UK society could look like after the lockdown is eased. Offices According to the BBC, staggered shift times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for a return to work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan. Meanwhile, the Guardian says ministers are holding talks with technology firms over the creation of \u201chealth passports\u201d that use \u201ccoronavirus testing and facial recognition\u201d to prove which workers have had Covid-19. Retail The British Retail Consortium (BRC) last month published guidance for measures that retail stores could introduce to help with the transition once restrictions are lifted. The recommended measures include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed. The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. Public transport Speaking on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, transport secretary Grant Shapp said increased bus and train timetables will be implemented to help the public transport system cope with an influx in passengers while still adhering to social distancing recommendations. He also pointed to active transport methods such as cycling as a way for people to take more personal responsibility over their welfare. \u201cThe second thing to say is active travel, I think, is a very important part of this, by which I mean cycling, walking and so on,\u201d he said. Airports Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye has warned that the nation\u2019s major international airports do not have enough space for social distancing to be a solution for safe travel post-lockdown. \u201cForget social distancing \u2013 it won\u2019t work in aviation or any other form of public transport, and the problem is not the plane, it is the lack of space in the airport,\u201d he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. \u201cJust one jumbo jet would require a queue a kilometre long.\u201d Instead, Holland-Kaye believes mandatory health checks for passengers, increased levels of hygiene and compulsory face masks would be more realistic options to enable airports to reopen and air travel to resume. Hi, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin in London taking over the liveblog from Helen. If you want to get in contact, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or tweet me @aamnamohdin That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I\u2019m off on a thrilling outing to the post office. Take it away, Aamna Mohdin. Global coronavirus cases top 3.5 million. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide has passed 3.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,506,924 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,473 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Trump \u2018very confident\u2019 there will be a vaccine by the end of this year. US president Donald Trump is \u201cvery confident\u201d there will be vaccine by the end of 2020. In a \u201cvirtual town hall\u201d with Fox news, Trump said: \u201cWe are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.\u201d Trump\u2019s declaration came despite his own pandemic task force predicting it could be another 18 months. The US president also said that up to 100,000 Americans could die in the pandemic. Mike Pompeo says coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. US intelligence had issued a formal statement saying the scientific consensus is the virus was not manmade or genetically modified. When reminded of this, Pompeo replied: \u2018That\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u2019\u201d France won\u2019t quarantine EU, Schengen area citizens. France said on Sunday it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown. New Zealand records zero new cases. New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 for the first time since before the lockdown. It\u2019s an \u201cencouraging\u201d result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health. There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people were still in hospital. Japan expected to extend state of emergency until end of May. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is set to extend the country\u2019s state of emergency on Monday, until the end of May, public broadcaster NHK said. The government is also expected to determine new prevention measures for the coronavirus outbreak that has infected about 15,000 people and killed more than 500 in the country, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro fuels protests in defiance of health advice. Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry\u2019s appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Brazil passed 100,000 confirmed cases. UK and France to trial tracing apps. France\u2019s tracing app is expected to enter testing week on Monday. France\u2019s state-supported \u201cStopCOVID\u201d contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove announced as the government looked to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. More than a million renters in Britain risk losing their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected by an immediate rent freeze, according to a thinktank. Calling on the government to suspend all private rents for three months as an emergency measure to protect those most at risk, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said 1.2 million people living in privately rented homes could fall into severe financial hardship otherwise. These people are among 5.6 million it identified who will miss out from the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme, due to having their hours cut or being made redundant rather than being furloughed. It also includes people ineligible for the self-employed income protection scheme. Thailand\u2019s new coronavirus cases rose to 18 on Monday, after falling to single-digits for the past week, but the country reported no new deaths. Monday\u2019s report brought the total number of cases to 2,987 since the new virus was detected in Thailand in January, with a total of 54 deaths. The new cases were migrants who were entering Thailand through an immigration checkpoint in the southern province of Songkhla, which shares a border with Malaysia, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman of the government\u2019s Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. They were all being quarantined in an immigration detention centre, along with 42 cases found previously on 25 April, Taweesin said. The full story on the latest from Japan now: Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is poised to extend the country\u2019s state emergency until the end of the month, amid warnings that relaxing social distancing advice too early could flood already crowded hospitals with coronavirus patients. Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures on 7 April, enabling local governors to request that people avoid unnecessary trips outside and that non-essential businesses close. The measures have since been expanded nationwide, but they are far less restrictive than those introduced in the US and parts of Europe, with no fines or other penalties for those who do not comply. The restrictions were due to end on Wednesday \u2013 the end of a series of public holidays known as Golden Week \u2013 but Abe has reportedly decided to extend them on the advice of experts who warned that a second wave of infections could put intolerable pressure on hospitals, particularly in Tokyo. Abe, who was due to explain his decision at a press conference later Monday, has warned that Japan faces a \u201cdrawn-out battle\u201d against the virus: Here\u2019s a look at the stories leading the papers this morning: Six Italians on lives changed by coronavirus The Guardian\u2019s Angela Giuffrida and Lorenzo Tondo have this in-depth report from Italy: The coronavirus crisis agony of Spain\u2019s poor Paloma P\u00e9rez, a smoker who has dealt with pancreatitis and cancer, has more reason than many to fear the coronavirus as she waits out the lockdown in her house in the mountains outside Madrid. To limit her exposure, the 74-year-old has told the home help who used to pop in twice a week to stop coming, and her main meal of the day \u2013 usually fish or meat, but with a decent variety of sides \u2013 is left outside her closed front door by the Catholic charity C\u00e1ritas. The nightmares P\u00e9rez suffered when the pandemic began have receded and she is adapting to the enduring lockdown with far fewer problems than many people in Spain. C\u00e1ritas has reported a surge in pleas for help since Spain went into national lockdown on 14 March. It says demand in the Madrid region has tripled over the past few weeks and 85% of the requests it receives are for food, medicine, or assistance in covering basic living costs. Trump \u2018very confident\u2019 of Covid-19 vaccine in 2020 and predicts up to 100,000 US deaths Donald Trump has said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d there will be a vaccine for coronavirus by the end of the year, revising up his estimate of the final US death toll as several European countries prepare for a cautious easing of lockdowns. The president used a Fox News \u201cvirtual town hall\u201d on Sunday night to repeat his regular virus talking points, including that a vaccine was not far away, Covid-19 was China\u2019s fault and the economy would not only recover but \u201cgrow like crazy\u201d. \u201cWe are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year,\u201d Trump said. Scientists have repeatedly warned that a vaccine may take 12-18 months or longer. Trump in April predicted 60,000 American lives would be lost but on Sunday said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people. That\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the government has \u201cnot yet\u201d received an invitation to take part in this month\u2019s meeting of the World Health Organization\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly. However, the government will strive \u201cuntil the last moment\u201d to participate as an observer, ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said in a statement. Taiwan\u2019s lack of membership at the WHO, due to China\u2019s objections which considers the island as one of its provinces, has infuriated Taipei, which says its exclusion has created a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global coronavirus cases top 3.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million. There are currently 3,506,924 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,473 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. US president Donald Trump is \u2018very confident\u2019 there will be vaccine by end of the year. In a sit-down interview with Fox news, Trump said: \u201cWe are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.\u201d The US president also said that up to 100,000 Americans could die in the pandemic. Mike Pompeo says coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. US intelligence had issued a formal statement saying the scientific consensus is the virus was not manmade or genetically modified. When reminded of this, Pompeo replied: \u2018That\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u2019\u201d France said Sunday that it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown. On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least 24 July, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks. New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 for the first time since before the lockdown. It\u2019s an \u201cencouraging\u201d result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, who\u2019s announcing the latest figures at an ongoing news conference in Wellington. There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people are in hospital. Japan expected to extend state of emergency until end of May. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to extend the country\u2019s state of emergency on Monday until the end of May, public broadcaster NHK said. The government is also expected to determine new prevention measures for the coronavirus outbreak that has infected around 15,000 people and killed more than 500 in the country, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro fuels protests in defiance of health advice. Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry\u2019s appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Brazil passes 100,000 confirmed cases. There have been 4,588 new cases of the coronavirus in Brazil and 275 deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, bringing total confirmed cases in the country to over 100,000. Italy reports lowest toll since first day of lockdown. Italyhas reported 174 new coronavirus deaths, its lowest toll since 168 fatalities were registered when the country\u2019s lockdown started on March 10. The 1,389 new infections were also the lowest since the first week of March UK to trial new tracing programme. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove has announced as the government looks to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. France\u2019s tracing app expected to enter testing week on Monday. France\u2019s state-supported \u2018StopCOVID\u2019 contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. The Pope has called for any successful Covid-19 vaccine to be shared worldwide. He said international scientific cooperation would be important in discovering a vaccine, stressing that it is \u201cimportant to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way\u201d.

Coronavirus health passports for UK \u2018possible in months\u2019 The Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor and Hannah Devlin report: Tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition. Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate \u2013 sometimes known as an immunity passport \u2013 proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased. The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people\u2019s identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood. Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests \u2013 proving whether someone has had the virus \u2013 or antigen tests, which show current infections. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is speaking to the press now. Ardern has told reporters that a trans-Tasman reopening \u2013 in which Australians and New Zealanders could travel between the countries without a 14-day quarantine period \u2013 wouldn\u2019t \u201cbe in the very very near short term.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t expect this to happen in a couple of weeks time,\u201d Ardern said. She added that the two countries \u201chave very similar perspective of the type of timeline\u201d that might be possible. While Australian prime ministers had attended New Zealand\u2019s cabinet ministers before, Ardern understood that she was the first New Zealand prime minister to be invited to an Australian gathering. \u201cIt highlights what\u2019s happened with cooperation at the state level and the mutual importance of both countries economies to each other,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s the full story on New Zealand, which has recorded its first day of no new cases of Covid-19 since a stringent national lockdown began more than one month ago. The public has been engrossed by the daily release of case numbers by the health ministry each afternoon \u2013 especially as a deadline looms for the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to decide whether the country\u2019s lockdown rules will ease further next Monday. One week into level-3 restrictions, however, officials sounded a cautious note as breaches of the shutdown rules continued to rise. Jacinda Ardern joins national cabinet meeting as Australia, New Zealand share coronavirus strategyRead more \u201cIt is cause for celebration \u2026 It is important that we reflect that it is symbolic of the effort that everybody has put in,\u201d said Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand\u2019s director-general of health, as he announced zero new cases of the coronavirus on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to downplay that but once again, we need to be continuing vigilance.\u201d There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people are in hospital. Twenty people have died of the virus; no additional deaths were reported on Monday. A dog is for life and not just for the Covid-19 lockdown, a UK charity has warned after online searches about getting a puppy surged by 120%. The Dogs Trust says it is concerned that the increased interest in acquiring a dog may be followed by a rise in people giving up their new pets when some form of normality resumes. The animal welfare charity, formerly known as the National Canine Defence League, is temporarily changing its famous slogan, \u201ca dog is for life, not just for Christmas\u201d to \u201ca dog is for life, not just for lockdown\u201d. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Owen Sharp, said: \u201cLike Christmas, when people are at home more, they might think now is the perfect time to get a dog. \u201cFor some people this will be the case, but we\u2019re asking people to consider when the lockdown lifts how your life will need to change to accommodate your four-legged friend. We\u2019re encouraging potential dog owners to carry out our new test to see if you\u2019re dog ready. \u201cAre you ready to be chief pooper scooper? Are you ready to forego a lie-in ever again? As well as more serious questions around vet treatment and preparing for emergencies.\u201d Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has extended a nationwide coronavirus lockdown until 17 May, but has allowed some relaxations, which will take effect on Monday. The following lists what remains banned and what is permitted, Reuters reports: NATIONWIDE: Travel by air, rail and metro and inter-state movement of people by road remains banned all over the country. Schools, hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, cinemas and places of worship are also shut nationally. There will be no restriction on movement of goods between states or on the manufacturing and distribution of essential items. Different regions have been colour-coded according to how much restrictions can be eased: RED ZONES: The metropolises of Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru have been designated as red zones - where most curbs remain in place. The classification is made based on number of active coronavirus cases, the doubling rate of cases, and the level of testing and surveillance in the area. In urban red zones that are not marked as containment zones - which are areas sealed off due to coronavirus cases - private offices can open at 33% capacity. Construction activity can also resume, as long as workers reside on site. Manufacturing of essential goods and IT hardware is permitted. E-commerce activities are only allowed for essential goods, while standalone shops are able to open. In rural red zones, all agricultural, construction and industrial activity is permitted. ORANGE ZONES: In orange zones, all the activities allowed in red zones are permitted. In addition, taxis are allowed, provided they are carrying only two passengers, as is travel between districts for permitted activities. GREEN ZONES: Areas designated as green zones, or places that have not seen any incidence of Covid-19 in 21 days, are allowed to resume all activities except those prohibited nationally. Buses are allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to extend the country\u2019s state of emergency on Monday until the end of May, public broadcaster NHK said. The government is also expected to determine new prevention measures for the coronavirus outbreak that has infected around 15,000 people and killed more than 500 in the country, Reuters reports. Abe is expected to explain the reasoning behind the extension of the state of emergency, which is now due to expire on Wednesday, at a news conference in the evening, NHK said. The government may also ease some of the current coronavirus-related constraints on economic activity by allowing places with relatively low infection risks, such as parks, to re-open, even in hard-hit prefectures. The state of emergency gives governors in those prefectures the authority to request residents to stay at home and businesses to close. There are, however, no penalties for non-compliance. The virus-triggered slump in business activity is threatening to throw the world\u2019s third-largest economy into a deep recession, prompting calls for more government spending. Japan\u2019s parliament last week approved an extra budget to fund a record $1.1tn stimulus package. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will join Tuesday\u2019s meeting of Australia\u2019s national cabinet to discuss approaches to managing the coronavirus and Australia\u2019s CovidSafe app. Scott Morrison, who has been in regular dialogue with leaders during the pandemic, invited Ardern to join Tuesday\u2019s national cabinet discussion with state premiers last week. Morrison and the premiers will meet twice this week to consider easing some of the restrictions imposed to flatten the curve of infections, with announcements expected on Friday. Australia and New Zealand have both deployed successful strategies to manage the pandemic, although New Zealand\u2019s lockdown has been more stringent than Australia\u2019s. New Zealand on Monday reported no new cases of Covid-19 for the first time in a month. The country has recently eased restrictions from level four to level three. Piers Morgan has said he will be temporarily stepping back from presenting Good Morning Britain after developing a \u201cmild\u201d coronavirus symptom, PA media reports. The programme will be hosted by ITV presenter Ben Shephard alongside Susanna Reid as Morgan waits for his test results, which are due on Monday. Morgan said in a tweet on Sunday night he had had a test and will be stepping back from presenting duties \u201con medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution\u201d. This week, Morgan was cleared of breaching TV watchdog Ofcom\u2019s rules after attracting more than 3,000 complaints over his \u201ccombative\u201d questioning of Helen Whately, the social care minister, in two interviews. During an animated interview, he asked Whately how many health workers and care workers who had died from the illness. She accused him of \u201cshouting at me and not giving me a chance to answer your questions\u201d and \u201cattempting to score points\u201d. Morgan defended his approach, saying it was not as \u201cuncomfortable\u201d as the conditions for the carers on the front line of the coronavirus crisis. Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview, with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on 16 April, who accused him of constantly interrupting him. Circling back to US president Donald Trump\u2019s Fox News town hall earlier, where he said up to 100,000 Americans could die from coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose anywhere from 75,000, 80,000 to 100,000 people. That\u2019s a horrible thing,\u201d said Trump, who as recently on Friday had said he hoped fewer than 100,000 Americans would die and earlier in the week had talked about 60,000 to 70,000 deaths. Nonetheless, he called his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic a success: While millions of people took advantage of easing coronavirus lockdowns to enjoy the outdoors, some of the world\u2019s most populous countries reported worrisome new peaks in infections Sunday, including India, which saw its biggest single-day jump yet, AP reports. Second in population only to China, India reported more than 2,600 new infections. In Russia, new cases exceeded 10,000 for the first time. The confirmed total death toll in Britain climbed near that of Italy, the epicenter of Europes outbreak, even though the U.K. population is younger than Italys and Britain had more time to prepare. The United States continues to see tens of thousands of new infections each day, with more than 1,400 additional deaths reported Saturday. Health experts have warned of a potential second wave of infections unless testing is expanded dramatically once the lockdowns are relaxed. But pressure to reopen keeps building after the weeks-long shutdown of businesses plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs. In Mexico City, where authorities expect infections to peak next week, workers will turn the Hernandez Rodriguez Formula 1 racecourse into a temporary hospital for Covid-19 patients. Governments have reported 3.5 million infections and more than 247,000 deaths, including more than 67,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University. Deliberately concealed outbreaks, low testing rates and the severe strain the disease has placed on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is undoubtedly much greater. US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus outbreak originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but failed to provide evidence following his statement. Pompeo added, \u201cexperts seem to think it was manmade\u201d, before reversing his statement after he was reminded the US intelligence dismissed those claims last week. Here\u2019s the video: Podcast: The global race for face masks The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask. Samanth Subramanian explores the newly distorted marketplace for masks and the lengths some will go to get them: France said Sunday that it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown, Reuters reports. On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least 24 July, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks. But the quarantine rules would not apply to \u201canyone arriving from the European Union, the Schengen zone or Britain, regardless of their nationality\u201d, the presidency said on Sunday. And for French and EU citizens arriving in France from other regions outside the EU, the Schengen area and Britain, \u201cthe rules will be announced in the coming days\u201d, the presidency said. Nevertheless, the tougher border controls introduced by France in mid-March to limit coronavirus contagion, particularly at the border with Germany, will continue, the interior ministry told AFP. \u201cThe travel restrictions currently in place at our borders will continue to apply,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cNothing has changed.\u201d The number of new deaths from Covid-19 in France has been declining in recent days, with 135 fatalities reported over the past 24 hours on Sunday.

More than 300,000 in the UK may have quit smoking during the coronavirus crisis as evidence mounts that the habit makes them more vulnerable to Covid-19, a survey suggests. A further 550,000 have tried to quit, while 2.4 million have cut down, according to the joint study by YouGov and the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). The survey of 1,004 people suggested 2% of smokers had quit because of concerns about coronavirus; 8% were trying to quit; 36% had cut down; and 27% were now more likely to quit. A quarter of former smokers said they were less likely to resume smoking, although 4% said the pandemic had made them more likely to relapse. UK business confidence at all-time low, Deloitte report reveals Business confidence at British companies has sunk to an all-time low because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey of finance chiefs at the largest UK firms. The accountancy group Deloitte found that nine out of 10 finance directors believe there is a high or very high level of uncertainty facing their business. Deloitte\u2019s latest quarterly survey of chief financial officers took place after the UK was placed into lockdown, and warns that only 16% of executives are more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago. The survey has recorded its lowest business confidence reading since it was launched in 2007, even lower than during the global financial crisis, in stark contrast to the final quarter of 2019, when the survey recorded confidence at a record high.

Staying in Asia Pacific now: New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 in the country for the first time since before the lockdown. It\u2019s an \u201cencouraging\u201d result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, who\u2019s announcing the latest figures at an ongoing news conference in Wellington. There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people are in hospital. 20 people have died of the virus so far, and no additional deaths were reported on Monday. Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, has won international praise for her swift and early lockdown of New Zealand. The most stringent measures eased last Monday, and officials and the public are keenly watching the daily figures to see whether measures can ease further next week. China reported three new coronavirus cases for 3 May, up from two the day before, data from the national health authority showed on Monday. All of the new cases were imported, the National Health Commission said. The commission also reported 13 new asymptomatic cases for May 3, an increase of one from the previous day. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 82,880. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained at 4,633. Trump is being asked about getting the nation back to work, and he says that not working can also have serious consequences for people, but praises the administration\u2019s success with the virus. Acknowledging that every death is one too many, he says: \u201cIn terms of the deaths ... we\u2019re at the lowest level predicted, and we might not even hit that.\u201d Then he appears to lay out his re-election strategy, pretty much in dot-point form: 1. Get rid of the virus 2. Get the country back to work \u201cquickly and safely\u201d 3. Economically, he says quarter three will be a \u201ctransition\u201d quarter, improved in quarter 4, and then a \u201cgreat year\u201d next year. It\u2019s six months exactly until the US election will be held (3 November), and he is asked about whether he will hold election rallies: \u201cEveryone wants the rallies... but I don\u2019t think you can a rally with an empty stadium,\u201d he says, adding that he hopes he will be able to to them in the last couple of months. And the event wraps up. Mike Pence is finally getting a word in. He\u2019s being asked about not wearing a mask when he visited the Mayo clinic last week, an event that was widely publicised. He apologises. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was necessary, but i should have worn a mask at the Mayo clinic,\u201d he says. The vice president then goes on to reassure that he \u201cknows we\u2019ll get through this (pandemic)\u201c and thanks the American people for what they\u2019ve done. Steve Mnuchin has still barely said a word. The vice president, Mike Pence, and Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, have joined the broadcast alongside Trump, but they are barely getting a word in. Trump is asked if he is considering tariffs as a way of punishing China. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate punishment, I\u2019ll tell you that. We are all playing a complicated game of chess or poker...but it\u2019s not checkers, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d \u201cTariffs at a minimum are the greatest negotiating tool,\u201d he says. He then attacks the World Health Organization for their involvement in managing the virus. He says the WHO missed \u201cevery call\u201d on the virus. He\u2019s also strongly targeting China: \u201cDon\u2019t forget China tried to blame it first on some of our soldiers. Then they tried to blame it on Europe.\u201d Asked if the virus came from a lab, by intent or by accident, he says: \u201cI think they made a horrible mistake and they didn\u2019t want to admit it. \u201cMy opinion is they made a mistake, they tried to cover it ... they couldn\u2019t put out the fire. They stopped people going into China but didn\u2019t stop people going around the world. \u201cThey knew they had a problem. I think they were embarrassed about the problem,\u201d Trump says. Will this affect his relationship with President Xi? He\u2019s reluctant to blame Xi directly. \u201cI did a great trade deal with him. I\u2019m not going to say anything. He\u2019s a strong man,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this should never have happened. They should have put it out. They should have let us and other countries in to put it out.\u201d Just a reminder that Trump claimed he was treated worse by the press than Abraham Lincoln: Trump is speaking as global coronavirus cases have passed 3.5 million, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Reuters reports that the rate of fatalities and new cases has slowed from peaks reached last month. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,503,533 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,306 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Trump is asked about the relationship with China, including on trade, and he\u2019s not happy about it: \u201cChina never gave 10 cents to our country ... they ripped off our country ... I\u2019ve told this to President Xi ... I get along with him ... (but) he should have done something different on this.\u201d He then goes on to list all the successful trade deals he has done ... with South Korea, Japan and others. The message is that the economy will bounce back next year. \u201cThis country is going to grow like crazy,\u201d he says. Now he\u2019s being asked about whether the manufacture of drugs will be brought back on shore, antibiotics and the like. He doesn\u2019t give specifics but says \u201cAmerica first\u201d was his election mantra, and reiterates that he thinks there will be a vaccine soon. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a vaccine by the end of the year. I firmly believe it,\u201d he says. Trump\u2019s virtual town hall is back from an ad break, and the next video call is from a business which has not qualified for any financial support. \u201cAt some point we have to open up our country. We can\u2019t stay closed as a country or we won\u2019t have a country left.\u201d Trump says the \u201cgreatest thing we can do is get rid of the virus\u201d. He\u2019s now pushing the economic recovery he expects next year. \u201cWe did the right thing (closing businesses down), but we never want to do it again,\u201d he says. The next question is from a Trump supporter who asks why he doesn\u2019t answer questions at news conferences and goes off on other tangents about positive decisions he\u2019s made. He launches into a long rant about how hostile the press is and that he has been treated worse than Abraham Lincoln by the press. \u201cThe media might as well be in the Democrat (sic) party,\u201d he says. Then lists what else he sees as his successes....killing Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killing Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, launching space force. The Fox anchor suggests he will be judged at the election on his handling of the virus. He doesn\u2019t agree. Meanwhile in Michigan: Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan issued a rebuke of the armed protesters who gathered inside the state capitol last week in defiance of statewide lockdown orders, saying the demonstrators embodied some of the \u201cworst racism\u201d of the nation\u2019s history. \u201cSome of the outrageousness of what happened at our capitol depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country,\u201d Whitmer said during a Sunday interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Last week Donald Trump had said of the protesters: \u201cThese are very good people.\u201d Hundreds of protesters, many not wearing protective face masks and some armed legally with \u201clong guns\u201d, gathered inside the statehouse in Lansing on Thursday as lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The tightly packed crowd attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. It\u2019s worth noting that this Fox News \u201cvirtual town hall\u201d as they are calling it, is a very controlled interview environment, compared with President Trump\u2019s usual daily White House briefings. He is being interviewed with two Fox news anchors and taking some phone calls. Fox has selected the questions to put to Trump from \u201cthousands\u201d of video questions and calls it has received from viewers over the past week. When asked about why he didn\u2019t act on the virus earlier, he was quick to point out that many people, including he says, disease expert Anthony Fauci, said Covid-19 \u201cwas going to pass\u201d. He indicates the US intelligence community will release a report on the virus on Monday. He\u2019s now being asked about what measures are being taken to protect nursing homes: \u201cThe nursing home issue is ground zero\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is legislation immediately about how many people can be in (visit) ... it\u2019s the one thing about this disease that everyone has learned ... is that it\u2019s so contagious.\u201d He reminds viewers that nursing homes are a matter for states. He\u2019s saying elective surgery must recommence, but again, it\u2019s up to the state governors. \u201cThey have to get back,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think they\u2019re making a lot of money? They\u2019re losing a fortune. they have to get back to elective surgery.\u201d The network is taking an ad break. More on Trump\u2019s town hall now, from AP: Trump declared Sunday that he believed a vaccine could be available by year\u2019s end, despite his own pandemic task force predicting it could be another 18 months. Anxious for an economic recovery, President Donald Trump fielded Americans\u2019 questions about decisions by some states to allow nonessential businesses to reopen while other states are on virtual lockdown due to the coronavirus. After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump returned from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and participated in a virtual town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial. He pushed for an economic reopening, one his advisers believe will be essential for his reelection chances this November. \u201cWe have to get it back open safely but as quickly as possible,\u201d Trump said. Though the administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic, particularly its ability to conduct widespread testing, has come under fierce scrutiny, the president defended the response and said the nation was ready to begin reopening. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing. We did the right thing and I really believe we saved a million and a half lives,\u201d the president said. But he also broke with the assessment of his senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, saying it was \u201ctoo soon to say if the federal government was overseeing a success story.\u201d Trump\u2019s impatience also flashed. While noting that states would go at their own pace in returning to normal, with ones harder hit by the coronavirus going slower, he said of some states, \u201cfrankly I think aren\u2019t going fast enough\u201d and singled out Virginia, which has a Democratic governor and legislature. And he urged the nation\u2019s schools and universities to return to classes this fall. This is the setting for Tump\u2019s Fox News town hall, by the way: President Trump is giving a sit-down interview with Fox news, and taking calls from viewers about the coronavirus. Asked about a Covid-19 vaccine, he says: \u201cWe are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.\u201d Trump is asked about schools going back in the US in September: \u201cWe have to go back,\u201d he says, adding that he is concerned about some older teachers and their possible exposure to the virus. He\u2019s criticising the Democrat\u2019s response to the pandemic, implying it would suit their political purposes if the virus outcome was worse. He talks about hydroxychloroquine, reminding viewers that he doesn\u2019t own shares in the company that produces it: \u201cWe don\u2019t lose anything with hydroxy .... people aren\u2019t dying from it.\u201d He\u2019s asked why he didn\u2019t act earlier on the virus, and says his intelligence was that \u201con January 23 I was told there could be a virus coming but it was of no real import,\u201d and then reminds viewers he stopped flights from China early. Trump is speaking now on Fox news, we\u2019ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, he has said this, referring to deaths in the US: The current US death toll, far higher than any other country, is 67,674 people. Hello and welcome to our global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan with comments, questions and news from where you live. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has claimed in a TV interview that there is \u2018enormous evidence\u2019 coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory, but did not provide any of this alleged evidence. But, writes the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger, \u201cwhen he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite \u2013 that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified \u2013 Pompeo replied: \u2018That\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile in Brazil, far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has been encouraging his supporters to protest, even as the country\u2019s cases pass 100,000. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Bolsonaro fuels protests in defiance of health advice. Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry\u2019s appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Brazil passes 100,000 confirmed cases. There have been 4,588 new cases of the coronavirus in Brazil and 275 deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, bringing total confirmed cases in the country to over 100,000. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. Italy reports lowest toll since first day of lockdown. Italyhas reported 174 new coronavirus deaths, its lowest toll since 168 fatalities were registered when the country\u2019s lockdown started on March 10. The 1,389 new infections were also the lowest since the first week of March UK to trial new tracing programme. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove has announced as the government looks to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. France\u2019s tracing app expected to enter testing week on Monday. France\u2019s state-supported \u2018StopCOVID\u2019 contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. Portugal downgrades state of emergency. Portugal has downgraded its state of emergency to a category of \u201ccalamity\u201d, as the rate of new coronavirus infections reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak, six weeks after a state of emergency was declared. Singapore records 657 new infections, the vast majority of them foreign workers living in dormitories, taking the city-state\u2019s total to 18,205. The Pope has called for any successful Covid-19 vaccine to be shared worldwide. He said international scientific cooperation would be important in discovering a vaccine, stressing that it is \u201cimportant to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way\u201d. NHS England has announced a further 327 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England is now 21,180. A coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned that Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 \u201cgenocide\u201d. Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Vietnam has confirmed its first Coronavirus case in nine days, meaning its total now stands at 271. The country\u2019s lockdown was eased in late April and it is yet to record a Covid-19 death. Footballers in Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will be allowed to start individual training sessions from Monday. It is the latest step in a series of cautious moves towards restarting top-level sport across Europe, which has also seen players in England and Germany permitted different degrees of training ground work. One third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan\u2019s capital, Kabul, have come back positive. It has raised fears that one of the world\u2019s most fragile states may be harbouring widespread undetected infections.",
