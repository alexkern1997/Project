      "bodyText": "More than 50 people were arrested in Hong Kong on Tuesday night after thousands of protesters took to the streets in defiance of a police order to mark the first anniversary of the anti-government movement. Police riot units used pepper spray and repeatedly charged at crowds in an attempt to disperse protesters gathered near the business district of Central, occupying roads and blocking traffic until well after midnight. In a statement, police said 53 people had been arrested for participating in an illegal assembly. The force said it had used \u201cminimum necessary force\u201d to disperse protesters who defied orders to leave. People first gathered in the Chater Garden park in Central in the early evening. They began chanting slogans but dozens of riot police descended on them, conducting body searches and ordering people to leave. A man who swore at police officers was arrested. Crowds were dispersed and began gathering on pavements. Later, protesters formed a line and began marching, yelling slogans and waving banners as they spilled on to the main thoroughfares. \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way!\u201d and \u201cRejuvenate Hong Kong, revolution of our era!\u201d were among the slogans being chanted by the crowd, many of whom were holding up their mobile phones with torchlights and umbrellas in anticipation of police firing teargas. Police raised blue flags to warn the crowds against taking part in an unauthorised assembly. Riot police charged at the crowds at about 7.30pm local time and chased protesters along the main street. Police tackled some to the ground and made several arrests. Crowds began to shout anti-police slogans while police formed a line and marched down the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional today, it feels like the people\u2019s spirit has not been broken,\u201d said a protester in his 40s who declined to give his name. \u201cIt shows that it\u2019s all still there and that\u2019s really heartwarming. It\u2019s tough but there is still a sense of hope among everyone here.\u201d \u201cWe fight for freedom but we fight for our Hong Kong, a free place where we have our identity, but that\u2019s been stripped away,\u201d he said. The 1 million people who first marched against an extradition bill on a hot June day in 2019 are now having to navigate a police force with little tolerance for protests, increasing interference by Beijing and the risks of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Here are a few ideas for what you can do to join the fight:</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <ul> \n    <li><em>Demilitarize the police. Decrease law enforcement budgets and reinvest those resources to fund schools, libraries, quality healthcare, parks, childcare, jobs, interventionists and a youth development system. Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism.</em></li> \n    <li><em>You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register.

      "bodyText": "George Floyd\u2019s family held a memorial service for him in Houston. Floyd, who was killed in police custody late last month, is now on his way to his final resting place. His final resting place is alongside his mother, who he called out for while a police officer kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. The Rev Al Sharpton sharply criticized Trump\u2019s response to recent protests in his eulogy for Floyd. \u201cYou take rubber bullets and teargas to clear out peaceful protesters, and then take a Bible and walk in front of a church, and use a church as a prop. Wickedness in high places,\u201d Sharpton said. Joe Biden addressed mourners via livestream during Floyd\u2019s service. \u201cToday, now is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow is the time for racial justice. That\u2019s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why. Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.\u201d In New York, state lawmakers repealed a law that keeps police disciplinary records secret. The move is one of several police reform measures that state legislators are undertaking. Georgia voters encountered equipment malfunctions and long waits to vote. The secretary of state announced an investigation but drew criticism for skirting the blame after overseeing the purchase of new voting equipment that poll workers said was failing. Top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci, warned that the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, calling Covid-19 his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d. He said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but was surprised by how \u201crapidly it just took over the planet\u201d. Trump was severely criticized for peddling the baseless claim that a Buffalo protester shoved by police officers was an Antifa plant. The 75-year-old man was hospitalized after the incident, and the two police officers involved have been charged with assault. Trump said he may hold a campaign rally as soon as \u201cnext week.\u201d The rallies have been halted due to the still-raging coronavirus pandemic, but some of the president\u2019s allies have suggested the Floyd protests, which have attracted thousands of people, could shield the rallies from potential criticism. Opinion: I grew up facing attack after attack on myself and others. Today each of us has a role in the fight for Black lives Alex M Johnson writes for The Guardian: We are our brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s keeper and each of us has a role in this fight for Black lives. Here are a few ideas for what you can do to join the fight: Demilitarize the police. Decrease law enforcement budgets and reinvest those resources to fund schools, libraries, quality healthcare, parks, childcare, jobs, interventionists and a youth development system. Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive. Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action. Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism. You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo. Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion. Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register. Vote. Vote. Vote. New York state lawmakers repealed a law that kept officers\u2019 disciplinary records secret. The measure is one of several police reform bills in the state legislature including one that bans police chokeholds. Lawmakers are also planning to vote on whether to provide all state troopers with body cameras and require that all officers provide medical and mental health attention to those in custody. New York City\u2019s legislature is also revisiting a bill to criminalize chokeholds. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who threatened to veto such legislation in 2014 after Eric Garner was killed, is facing increasing pressure to support the bill. Even without de Blasio\u2019s approval, the legislation now has enough support to overcome a veto. Philadelphians gathered in the city\u2019s Fishtown neighborhood and painted \u201cEnd Racism Now\u201d in bright yellow letters onto the street. The message is unlikely to last long, according to NBC Philadelphia, as the city is likely to remove it. Organizers are reportedly looking for a site where they can permanently paint the slogan. The event, which drew hundreds, was organized by a local pastor. The neighborhood was shaken recently after a group of armed white men took to the streets amid Black Lives Matter protests, saying they were there to protect businesses from looting. Protests are continuing around the country. Here are some scenes from California. In Berkeley: In San Francisco: In Los Angeles: In San Francisco, bus drivers halted service for eight minutes and 46 seconds \u2014 the amount of time that an officer had a knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck. Soon after, Muni, the local transportation agency, announced it would no longer transport officers to the protests. \u201cThe idea for the memorial was suggested by one of our transportation controllers in our Transportation Management Center,\u201d said Erica Kato, a spokesperson for Muni. \u201cWe\u2019ve been engaged in conversations with our staff, and that has given us the opportunity to reflect on what we can do to support our staff and black and brown community, and turn words into action.\u201d In Louisiana, a recently uncovered video shows police officers repeatedly punching and tasing a Black man, who died shortly afterward. Video on KSLA, obtained from a bystander, shows police officers in the northern Louisiana city of Shreveport wrestling Tommie Dale McGlothen, 44, to the ground and hitting him repeatedly. After cuffing McGlothen, officers are captured walking him to the police vehicle, and pushing him against it so that his head hits the hood. According to the coroner, McGlothen was exhibiting signs of mental distress when officers apprehended him. Four officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. The coroner, Todd Thoma, said, \u201cMcGlothen had underlying heart disease and clearly was suffering from excited delirium. The combination of these factors caused his death.\u201d But the autopsy also confirmed multiple blunt forced injuries and noted that his death could have been prevented as it should have been obvious \u201cthat he needed medical care\u201d. The CEO of CrossFit gyms stepped down after telling staff on a Zoom call, \u201cWe\u2019re not mourning for George Floyd.\u201d Several gyms associated with CrossFit had already ended their association with the brand after the CEO, Greg Glassman, tweeted, in response to a statement from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that racism was a public health issue, \u201cIt\u2019s FLOYD-19.\u201d On a private call with staff, which was obtained by BuzzFeed, Glassman said, \u201cWe\u2019re not mourning for George Floyd \u2013 I don\u2019t think me or any of my staff are.\u201d \u201cCan you tell me why I should mourn for him?\u201d Glassman reportedly said on the call, which was recorded. \u201cOther than that it\u2019s the white thing to do \u2013 other than that, give me another reason.\u201d The show Cops has been canceled by the Paramount Network. The network removed the long-running show from its schedule amid protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. Now, the network has announced it\u2019s fully dropping the reality show, which documents police chasing down and apprehending suspects. Officers would sometimes coerce suspects into signing releases to be filmed, according to a podcast called Running From Cops. \u201cCops is not on the Paramount Network and we don\u2019t have any current or future plans for it to return,\u201d a network spokesperson said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The A&amp;E network has also pulled last week\u2019s episodes of Live PD \u2013 which also follows officers in real time, though the show is not yet canceled outright. In March 2019, Javier Ambler, a Black man, was killed in Austin as the Live PD cameras were rolling. The 40-year-old postal worker and father of two had his brights on while driving home after a poker game. Officers held Ambler down and used tasers on him even as he pleaded \u201cI have congestive heart failure. I can\u2019t breathe\u201d, according to the Austin American Statesman, which along with KVUE-TV uncovered police video of the incident. The Live PD footage was not aired. The US\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, calling Covid-19 his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d. \u201cIn a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world,\u201d Fauci said, speaking to executives at a conference of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d About 7 million people have been infected with the coronavirus and 400,000 people are known to have died. Many countries, including the US, where more than 110,000 have died, are now relaxing quarantine rules despite rising rates of infection in some areas. \u201cThat\u2019s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn\u2019t over yet. And it\u2019s condensed in a very, very small time frame,\u201d said Fauci. In a videotaped discussion Fauci said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but he was surprised by how \u201crapidly it just took over the planet\u201d. Fauci attributed the rapid spread to the contagiousness of the virus and extensive world travel by infected people. Opinion: The toll of police violence on disabled Americans Dominic Bradley and Sarah Katz write for the Guardian: What do Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tanisha Anderson, Deborah Danner, Ezell Ford, Alfred Olango and Keith Lamont Scott all have in common? They were all black Americans who died at the hands of the police or in police custody. And they were all also disabled. Sandra Bland, 28, had epilepsy and depression and was found hanged in a jail cell in Texas after being arrested for an alleged lane change violation. Eric Garner, 43, had asthma, diabetes and a heart condition and died after an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold while arresting him for allegedly selling cigarettes without tax stamps. Freddie Gray, 25, had a developmental disability due to being exposed to lead at an early age and died from a severe spinal injury after police officers reportedly gave him a \u201crough ride\u201d in the back of a police van. Tanisha Anderson, 37, died while having a mental health crisis and being restrained by police officers with her face down in front of her Cleveland, Ohio, home. Deborah Danner, 66, had schizophrenia and died after being shot by an NYPD officer, who was responding to her neighbor\u2019s call that she had been behaving erratically. Four years earlier she had written an essay about mental health stigma that predicted, chillingly, the circumstances of her own death. \u201cWe are all aware,\u201d she wrote, \u201cof the all-too-frequent news stories about the mentally ill who come up against law enforcement instead of mental health professionals and end up dead.\u201d Ezell Ford, 25, who had bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia, was shot dead by LAPD officers during an alleged struggle. Alfred Olango, 38, was shot dead after his sister called the police for help while he was having a crisis related to his mental illness. Keith Lamont Scott, 43, had a traumatic brain injury from a prior accident and died after police shot him for not following orders to exit his car. Even George Floyd, whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked the nationwide protests, had a heart condition, hypertension and sickle cell trait. These deaths are part of a disturbing pattern in police killings. While the numbers of disabled people killed by police are not systematically tracked in the United States, the Ruderman Family Foundation has estimated that between a third to half of all Americans killed by police have a disability. (Their study defines disability broadly, \u201cinclusive of physical, developmental, intellectual, psychiatric, emotional, and any other form of disability that might fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\u201d.) To put that into perspective, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that disabled American adults make up a quarter of the population, making them the largest minority group. Los Angeles county district attorney Jackie Lacey announced that an officer has been charged with the assault of a 28-year-old man in April. Responding to a call about a tresspasser, officer Frank Hernandez, 49, hit a man on the head, neck and body more than a dozen times while screaming expletives. A bystander caught the incident on camera. Hernandez, who has served the Los Angeles police department for more than two decades, has been involved in three on-duty shootings, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThis is a disturbing case of the illegal use of force at the hands of a police officer,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cIn this case, we believe the force was neither legally necessary nor reasonable.\u201d My colleague Vivian Ho reports from Houston: Officials shut down the roads from the church to the cemetery, including a section of major toll road, to make way for the procession. Along the route, groups of supporters waved \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d signs and cheered for Floyd. About a mile to the cemetery entrance, where the family planned to have a horse-drawn carriage bring Floyd\u2019s casket the rest of the way to the burial site, hundreds lined the streets, holding up umbrellas and makeshift tents to protect themselves from the unrelenting sun. They doodled chalk messages of \u201crest in power\u201d and \u201cbe the change\u201d along the sidewalk, and periodically broke out in chants: \u201cSay his name! George Floyd!\u201d A sweating man walked down the line, wearily reading his double-sided sign to people he passed: \u201cWe will breathe. I see greatness in you.\u201d Herman Bell, 37, was on his way with his family to the eye doctor when he decided to stop to watch the procession. \u201cWe lost a great man from the third ward,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI want my kids to understand that when they go to school, they need to go to school and better themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man went out and bettered the world.\u201d There\u2019s a sense in Houston that in times like these, you come out to support the family even if you didn\u2019t know the family. Schon Carter, 40, came out on Tuesday to show not just her support for the family, but to show that \u201cwe\u2019re all standing in one accord.\u201d \u201cIt feels good, that despite the heat, the weather, that people actually took the time out to show their respect for the family,\u201d Carter said. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, has been tasked by Mitch McConnell to lead a Republican police reform effort. Scott, of South Carolina, has released a plan that proposes cutting federal funds to police departments that don\u2019t use body cameras and de-escalation training. Use of force review boards aren\u2019t in the proposal \u2013 though they are in the \u201cdiscussion/development\u201d section. Before he was killed, George Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. Floyd moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, Floyd\u2019s lifelong friend. \u201cHe was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe was happy with the change he was making.\u201d Floyd, who was 46, grew up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, one of the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6ft6in, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates\u2019 high school team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome. Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd\u2019s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname \u201cgentle giant\u201d. \u201cQuiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\u201d Cooper said. Harris, Floyd\u2019s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014 \u2014 and convinced Floyd to join. Floyd landed a job working security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. He later started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \u201cBig Floyd\u201d. \u201cAlways cheerful,\u201d Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro\u2019s owner, said. \u201cHe had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\u2019t because he was too tall for me. He always called me \u2018Bossman\u2019. I said, \u2018Floyd, don\u2019t call me Bossman. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho is in Houston, where members of Congress, members of Floyd\u2019s family and members of the public have all gathered to pay their respects to George Floyd, before he is buried. Mourners chanted Floyd\u2019s name as his casket left the church, where Al Sharpton had delivered a eulogy. Georgia\u2019s secretary of state has announced an investigation after poll workers have reported issues with new voting machines and long lines. The primary election today was already delayed from 24 March due to the coronavirus pandemic and voting, even as the state faces extra scrutiny after its handling of the 2018 elections when then-secretary of state Brian Kemp was in charge of overseeing an election in which he was also a candidate for governor. The current secretary of state Brad Raffensperger oversaw the purchase of the machines that are now causing issues, for $104m. Poll workers have voiced concern about the equipment, but Raffensperger has blamed workers for not knowing how to work the machines. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: George Floyd\u2019s family held a memorial service for him in Houston. Floyd, who was killed in police custody late last month, is now on his way to his final resting place. He will be buried alongside his mother, who he called out for while a police officer kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. The Rev Al Sharpton sharply criticized Trump\u2019s response to recent protests in his eulogy for Floyd. \u201cYou take rubber bullets and teargas to clear out peaceful protesters, and then take a Bible and walk in front of a church, and use a church as a prop. Wickedness in high places,\u201d Sharpton said. Joe Biden addressed mourners via livestream during Floyd\u2019s service. \u201cToday, now is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow is the time for racial justice. That\u2019s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why. Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.\u201d Trump was severely criticized for peddling the baseless claim that a Buffalo protester shoved by police officers was an Antifa plant. The 75-year-old man was hospitalized after the incident, and the two police officers involved have been charged with assault. Trump said he may hold a campaign rally as soon as \u201cnext week.\u201d The rallies have been halted due to the still-raging coronavirus pandemic, but some of the president\u2019s allies have suggested the Floyd protests, which have attracted thousands of people, could shield the rallies from potential criticism. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump\u2019s chief of staff said the president would like to overhaul police laws \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d according to a Politico reporter. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows made the comment while visiting Capitol Hill with senior White House adviser Jared Kushner and Ja\u2019Ron Smith, the deputy director of the office of American innovation. Congressional Democrats unveiled their sweeping police reform bill yesterday, but Trump is very unlikely to endorse that piece of legislation. It is unclear what reforms the president would support, but White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said yesterday that Trump did not support ending qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that makes it difficult to hold police officers accountable for civil rights violations. The memorial service for George Floyd has concluded, and his casket is now on its way to his final resting place in Houston, where he grew up. Many people waited outside of the Fountain of Praise church, where the service was held, in order to see Floyd\u2019s casket and accompany it to his cemetery plot. The Rev Al Sharpton has just concluded his eulogy at George Floyd\u2019s memorial service in Houston. Moments ago, the civil rights activist celebrated the protests that have spread across the country and around the world in response to the police killing of Floyd. \u201cAll over the world I\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave master statues,\u201d Sharpton said. Sharpton specifically referenced the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, England, which was torn down and thrown into Bristol Harbour by Black Lives Matter protesters. The Rev Al Sharpton sharply criticized Trump\u2019s response to the George Floyd protests, describing the president\u2019s recent actions as \u201cwickedness in high places.\u201d While delivering a eulogy at Floyd\u2019s memorial service in Houston, Sharpton said Trump was more focused on how to stop the protests than how to stop police brutality. The civil rights activist accused the president of being fixated on how the protests would affect his re-election bid and putting American lives in jeopardy as a result. \u201cYou take rubber bullets and teargas to clear out peaceful protesters, and then take a Bible and walk in front of a church, and use a church as a prop. Wickedness in high places,\u201d Sharpton said. In his eulogy at George Floyd\u2019s memorial service, the Rev Al Sharpton criticized NFL commissioner Roger Goddell, who said last week that the league was \u201cwrong\u201d in its handling of players\u2019 protests against police brutality. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, give Colin Kaepernick his job back,\u201d Sharpton said to applause. Kaepernick was the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality, and he has since struggled to get picked up by a team, which his supporters have described as retaliation from management over his activism. The Rev Al Sharpton is delivering a eulogy at George Floyd\u2019s memorial service in Houston, demanding justice for Floyd and others killed by police. \u201cLives like George will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cThere is an intentional neglect to make people pay for taking our lives.\u201d Shapton said any four police officers who killed a white person would be sent to jail, arguing the police officers charged with Floyd\u2019s murder should receive the same punishment. The civil rights activist promised Floyd\u2019s family he would \u201cbe here for the long haul.\u201d \u201cWhen the last TV truck is gone, we\u2019ll still be here,\u201d Sharpton said. He later added, \u201cWe are fighting an institutional, systemic problem.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from Houston, Texas: Meet Sharon Harry. This 64-year-old Houston nurse took time off work to attend not just Monday\u2019s public viewing, but on Tuesday to stand outside the church where George Floyd\u2019s memorial service is being held. For Harry, Floyd\u2019s death - and the deaths of all killed by police - have personal meaning to her. Thirty-five years ago, her 22-year-old brother was driving home in San Antonio when he got pulled over by the police. He went to open the passenger-side door. Police thought he was reaching for his gun. And Harry\u2019s baby brother Michael Haskins entered into a long legacy of unarmed black men killed by police in this country. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI now have three grandsons that range in ages from 18 to 3 years old. As I\u2019m growing older, it would be a solace for me to know that there\u2019s been a change. It would be a comfort to me to know that with all of this with Mr Floyd\u2019s death, we can now see a united front, in all rainbows of color, of all nationalities, that people can now become aware of some of their unbiased prejudices.\u201d Thirty-five years later, it doesn\u2019t get any easier. With each police killing, the heartache is renewed, Harry said, her voice cracking. \u201cYou know what the Floyd family feels,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know the loss. You know the pain.\u201d But this time feels different. \u201cI\u2019ve watched all the past police brutality but never anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI just had to be here and say thank you to Mr Floyd, for giving his life to those who don\u2019t have a voice anymore, who didn\u2019t have a voice then because there weren\u2019t any cameras.\u201d The Senate has unanimously confirmed General Charles Brown as the next chief of staff of the Air Force, making him the first African American chief of a military service branch. Vice President Mike Pence presided over the vote for Brown\u2019s nomination, which all 98 senators who were present supported. Announcing the final vote, Pence described Brown\u2019s nomination as \u201chistoric.\u201d Trump celebrated Brown\u2019s confirmation about an hour before the vote was finalized, praising the general as \u201ca Patriot and Great Leader\u201d in a tweet. Brown\u2019s confirmation came as George Floyd\u2019s memorial service took place in Houston, with many speakers demanding that racial injustice be addressed after Floyd was killed in police custody. Trump was reportedly on the brink of firing Mark Esper last week, when the defense secretary voiced opposition to the president\u2019s idea of sending active-duty troops to states with George Floyd protests. The Wall Street Journal reports: The president consulted several advisers to ask their opinion of the disagreement, intent that day on removing Mr. Esper, his fourth defense secretary since taking office in January 2017, according to [several] officials. After talks with the advisers, who cautioned against the move, Mr. Trump set aside the plans to immediately fire Mr. Esper. At the same time, however, Mr. Esper, aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s feelings, was making his own preparations to resign, partly in frustration over the differences regarding the role of the military, the officials said. He had begun to prepare a letter of resignation before he was persuaded not to do so by aides and other advisers, according to some of the officials. Last Wednesday, Mr. Esper said that he didn\u2019t think using federal troops in American streets was warranted at that time. The comments, made in an opening statement at a news conference at the Pentagon, weren\u2019t vetted beforehand by the White House, and the statement caught officials there off guard, two officials said. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany signaled Esper\u2019s job might be in trouble shortly after the cabinet secretary said he was against sending active-duty troops to the protests. \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith, we will all learn about that in the future,\u201d McEnany told reporters on Wednesday. The Guardian\u2019s Vivan Ho reports from Houston, Texas: Supporters of George Floyd stood outside the church in the punishing Houston humidity, waiting for the procession to Floyd\u2019s final resting place. Many in the crowd were friends of the family. Shereka Burton\u2018s mother grew up in the third ward, just like Floyd. The 32-year-old asked for time to think over the words she wished to express, unwilling to let anger and frustration take over the moment. \u201cWe prayed for unity for so long that we did not know how it would come,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it took this, I hope that we can all be at once in unity, in peace, on our knees in prayer, and I pray for strength for the family and the entire nation.\u201d Her mentor, Dr Edna L Kingsley, smiled at Burton\u2019s words. Kingsley said she feels hope in this moment. \u201cA change is going to come,\u201d she said. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s life was not in vain,\u201d Kingsley added. \u201cIt was an unfortunate situation, but a knee has been on our necks for a long time. However if we give up the fight, that knee will continue to be on our neck. So we\u2019re going to continue to fight this good fight, and we will prevail.\u201d Joe Biden expressed support for the Buffalo protester who was shoved to the ground by police officers, after Trump suggested the 75-year-old man might be an Antifa plant. \u201cMy Dad used to say there\u2019s no greater sin than the abuse of power,\u201d Biden said in a tweet. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.\u201d Noting that he and the protester, Martin Gugino, were both Catholic, Biden added, \u201cOur faith says that we can\u2019t accept either.\u201d Gugino was hospitalized after being shoved while protesting the police killing of George Floyd, and the two officers involved have now been charged with assault. Some Republican lawmakers are offering cautious words of criticism for Trump\u2019s tweet about the Buffalo protester, who was shoved to the ground by police officers and has been hospitalized. The president peddled a baseless claim that the 75-year-old protester was an Antifa plant, which was first suggested in a report from the far-right One America News Network. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious accusation which should only be made with facts and evidence, and I haven\u2019t seen any yet,\u201d Senate majority whip John Thune said of the tweet. Senator Mitt Romney, who participated in a protest against police brutality this weekend said, \u201cI saw the tweet. It was a shocking thing to say, and I won\u2019t dignify it with any further comment.\u201d However, some senators, such as Cory Gardner, claimed they had not seen the tweet and refused to read it when congressional reporters presented them with a printed version of it. Joe Biden delivered remarks at George Floyd\u2019s memorial service in Houston, appearing via livestream a day after meeting with Floyd\u2019s family. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, whose son Beau died of brain cancer five years ago, said he connected with the family\u2019s grief. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said to you privately, we know. We know you will never feel the same again,\u201d Biden said to the Floyd family, going on to describe \u201cthe burden\u201d of having to grieve in public. The former vice president then directly addressed Floyd\u2019s daughter, Gianna. \u201cLittle Gianna \u2014 as I said to you when I saw you yesterday, you are so brave. Daddy is looking down and he is so proud of you,\u201d Biden said. The presidential candidate concluded his remarks with a call for change. \u201cToday, now is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow is the time for racial justice. That\u2019s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why. Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America. \u201cAnd then, as you said, Gianna, your Daddy will have \u2018changed the world.\u2019\u201d A judge in Virginia has put a block on the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the state capital Richmond\u2019s historic Monument Avenue. Virginia governor Ralph Northam had announced plans for the divisive statue to be removed. But the court granted a 10-day injunction after a lawsuit was filed. It was in Charlottesville, Virginia, that neo-nazi, white supremacist and related far-right crowds paraded in 2017 for a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, tied to previous demonstrations aimed at preserving another statue of Lee in the college town. The August rally descended into chaos and violence when counter-protesters arrived and later turned fatal when a man drove a car into anti-rightist marchers. In Richmond, a 1890 deed was cited in court that prevents the statue there from being removed, including an agreement in which the state agrees to \u201cfaithfully guard and affectionately protect it.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: George Floyd\u2019s final memorial service is underway in Houston, Texas. After the private service, a large procession of mourners is expected to accompany Floyd\u2019s casket to his final resting place alongside his mother. Floyd cried out for his mother while a police officer kept a knee on his neck. Trump was severely criticized for peddling the baseless claim that a Buffalo protester shoved by police officers was an Antifa plant. The 75-year-old man was hospitalized after the incident, and the two police officers involved have been charged with assault. Trump said he may hold a campaign rally as soon as \u201cnext week.\u201d The rallies have been halted due to the still-raging coronavirus pandemic, but some of the president\u2019s allies have suggested the Floyd protests, which have attracted thousands of people, could shield the rallies from potential criticism. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from Houston, Texas: American flags lined the road leading up to the Fountain of Praise church in Houston, where George Floyd\u2019s final funeral service was being held Tuesday. The funeral was for family and friends only, but dozens still gathered outside the church to pay their respects to Floyd, wearing shirts reading \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. Tamecia Dogbe, 41, drove two and a half hours from Austin with her sister and 12-year-old niece to stand outside the church in the sweltering humidity. \u201cIt feels like a part of history, something I want my niece to witness,\u201d she said. \u201cTen years from now, she might be able to see this in a history book.\u201d She can only pray that in 10 years, these sort of funerals -- services for victims of police killings -- will be a thing of the past as well. Among the line of buses and cars at the front of the church, Savant Moore, 35, shared a sentiment he posted on Facebook in the aftermath of the killing: \u201cIt really took a global pandemic with no sports, no concerts, no vacations to get the world to sit down and have no choice but to watch what\u2019s really happening to Black people in America with zero distractions.\u201d Moore was an Army ranger who had been deployed four times, once in Afghanistan and another time in Iraq. Yet it\u2019s here in his home country that he is scared. \u201cI have a college degree from Howard University. I\u2019m an entrepreneur. And this is my America,\u201d Moore said. \u201cEvery day, I still have to worry about whether people will not like me because of the color of my skin, or if I might not make it back home to my children because I encounter a police officer for a routine traffic stop.\u201d George Floyd\u2019s memorial service is now underway at the Fountain of Praise church in Houston, Texas, where he will be laid to rest. The Rev Al Sharpton will lead the memorial service, which is private. Mourners are singing hymns to honor Floyd\u2019s life, which ended late last month after a Minneapolis police officer put his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. After the private service, a large procession of mourners is expected to accompany Floyd\u2019s casket to his final resting place alongside his mother. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho is in Houston, Texas, where George Floyd\u2019s memorial service is expected to begin at any moment. The service for Floyd, who was killed in police custody late last month, is private, but people have still gathered at the church where mourners are convening. One woman told Ho that she decided to come with her 12-year-old niece because \u201cit feels like a part of history,\u201d expressing hope that police brutality will soon be a thing of the past. A large procession is expected to accompany Floyd\u2019s casket to his final resting place once the service concludes. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from Houston, Texas: The Rev Al Sharpton will lead George Floyd\u2019s memorial service today, after leading the Minneapolis service for Floyd last week. In Minneapolis, Sharpton delivered a rousing eulogy calling for white America to \u201cget off our necks\u201d, a reference to Floyd\u2019s last moments. Floyd, an African American, struggled to call out for his late mother and beg a police officer for mercy as he lay dying, pinned down by now-former officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on his neck. Today, Floyd will join his mother when his family inters his body next to hers in Houston, where he grew up. Shaprton said last week, \u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck. ... It\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say: get your knee off our necks.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from Houston, Texas: The family of George Floyd is preparing to lay his body to rest in his home town of Houston, following weeks of protest over his killing by police in Minneapolis and a public viewing attended by thousands who waited for hours in the hot sun the day before. The memorial is set to begin in about 20 minutes at 11 am CT, and it will be led by the Rev Al Sharpton. He reminded the mourners outside the church on Monday that none of the victims\u2019 families who traveled to Houston had wanted to become activists, and that it would take work to change policing and racism in the country. Thousands attended Monday\u2019s public viewing, traveling into the city from across the US, and thousands more attended a candlelight vigil after viewing hours ended. Though Tuesday\u2019s funeral and burial are for invited guests and family only, officials expect a large turnout of mourners wishing to pay their respects to follow the funeral procession to Floyd\u2019s final resting place. The Brooklyn district attorney said a New York City police officer has been charged with assault, after a now-viral video showed the officer shoving a protester to the ground. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez said officer Vincent D\u2019Andraia, 28, would be charged with assault, criminal mischief, harassment and menacing for shoving 20-year-old Dounya Zayer to the ground during a George Floyd protest. \u201cI fully support the long-held American tradition of non-violent protest,\u201d Gonzalez said in a statement. \u201cAs District Attorney I cannot tolerate the use of excessive force against anyone exercising this Constitutionally guaranteed right. \u201cThis is especially true of those who are sworn to protect us and uphold the law. I am deeply troubled by this unnecessary assault. We will now seek to hold this defendant accountable.\u201d Newsweek reporter Jason Lemon first shared a video of the incident and said D\u2019Andraia called Zayer a \u201cstupid fucking bitch\u201d as he shoved her. The NYPD previously said it was reviewing the matter. Two law enforcement agencies acknowledged that police officers in Minneapolis cut some drivers\u2019 tires as the George Floyd protests played out across the city. Mother Jones previously shared videos showing police officers slashing tires in a K-Mart parking lot on May 30 and a highway overpass on May 31, both of which became police staging grounds near the protests. The Star Tribune reports: Images from S. Washington Avenue at Interstate 35W also showed officers with knives deflating the tires of two unoccupied cars with repeated jabs on May 31. Department of Public Safety spokesman Bruce Gordon confirmed that tires were cut in \u2018a few locations.\u2019 \u2018State Patrol troopers strategically deflated tires \u2026 in order to stop behaviors such as vehicles driving dangerously and at high speeds in and around protesters and law enforcement,\u2019 Gordon said. ... Deputies from Anoka County followed state orders and joined the patrol and also cut the tires on vehicles on Washington Avenue, said Anoka County Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Andy Knotz. Knotz said the deputies got their directions from the state-led Multiagency Command Center [MACC], which was coordinating law enforcement during the protests[.] Trump said he may resume holding campaign rallies, which have been halted because of the coronavirus pandemic, as soon as next week. \u201cBIG DEMAND! Starting up again soon, maybe next week!\u201d the president wrote in response to a tweet about resuming the rallies. Politico reported yesterday that the president planned to restart the rallies, which have become a defining aspect of his campaigning style, in the next two weeks. There are still concerns about holding massive in-person events amid the coronavirus pandemic, but some of the president\u2019s allies have argued the recent George Floyd protests, which have attracted thousands of people, make it harder for critics to question the safety of the rallies. Trump has clearly missed holding rallies, where he has been known to go on extended tangents about his many accomplishments in office, often creating a lot of work for news outlets\u2019 fact-checkers. On Friday, the president held a celebratory press conference after the jobs report showed the US unemployment rate had slightly dropped to a still-high figure of 13.3%. Trump\u2019s boasts about his accomplishments gave the event the feeling of a rally, particularly because the president took no questions from reporters at the \u201cpress conference.\u201d Trump was later criticized for saying during the event that it was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd, who was killed while in police custody late last month. Georgia is holding its primary today, three weeks after the election was originally supposed to take place. Governor Brian Kemp delayed the primary because of the coronavirus pandemic. State officials had encouraged voters to vote by mail in order to limit the potential spread of the virus at polling places, and 943,000 absentee ballots had been returned as of Sunday. However, Georgians attempting to vote in person are already running into issues, with Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms complaining of long lines and broken machines in her city. Georgia attracted scrutiny for its handling of the state\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial race, with Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams alleging voter suppression by her opponent, Kemp, who was then Georgia secretary of state. Abrams and her allies have argued that she would have won the race, which she lost by 1.4 points, if the vote had not been suppressed. Trump\u2019s baseless claim that the 75-year-old Buffalo protester who was shoved to the ground by police was an Antifa plant appears to have been sparked by this segment from the far-right One America News Network. The segment was done by OAN\u2019s Kristian Rouz, who has previously written for the Kremlin-owned outlet Sputnik. The US intelligence community has concluded that Sputnik played a role in Russia\u2019s election interference efforts during the 2016 presidential race. Rouz did a report last month peddling the theory that the coronavirus pandemic was \u201ca globalist conspiracy to establish sweeping population control\u201d backed by George Soros. Former Republican senator Jeff Flake accused Trump of \u201ctrafficking in conspiracy theories\u201d after the president suggested a 75-year-old protester who was shoved to the ground by police might have been an Antifa plant. George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, responded to the president\u2019s tweet by resharing a less-than-flattering anecdote about another time when Trump saw someone in physical pain. Trump is now threatening to release dirt on former defense secretary James Mattis, who released a scathing statement last week criticizing the president\u2019s response to the George Floyd protests. \u201cMattis was our Country\u2019s most overrated General,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cHe talked a lot, but never \u2018brought home the bacon.\u2019 He was terrible! Someday I will tell the real story on him and others - both good and bad!\u201d In his statement last week, Mattis said Trump was further dividing the country as it wrestled with how to crack down on police brutality. Directly addressing the forcible removal of peaceful protesters near the White House last week, Mattis said, \u201cWe know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. The Buffalo man who Trump claims was an Antifa plant is actually a \u201clongtime peaceful protester and human rights advocate,\u201d according to a statement from his lawyer released over the weekend. The Washington Post reported that 75-year-old Martin Gugino, who was shoved to the ground by two police officers while he was protesting, is a member of PUSH Buffalo, which advocates for affordable housing, and the human rights organization Western New York Peace Center. His lawyer said he was in serious but stable condition after the incident and is now \u201calert and oriented.\u201d The two officers who shoved him have been charged with assault. Donald Trump has just rather unexpectedly tweeted the claim that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old pushed to the ground by police in Buffalo, New York state, last week may have been an \u201cANTIFA provocateur\u201d who was trying to scan equipment and black out police communications. Two police officers \u2013 Aaron Torgalski, 39, and Robert McCabe, 32 \u2013 have pleaded not guilty to felony assault after a video emerged which showed the officers shoving Gugino as he was protesting outside City Hall on Thursday night. One of our New York reporters is looking further into this claim from Trump, which seems to have originated from coverage of the incident on OANN, the small far-right news channel which Trump has recently taken to promoting. Here\u2019s the video clip of the incident that Trump is referring to. Georgia is holding a combined state and presidential primary today, after votes earlier in the year were postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Voting doesn\u2019t seem to have got off to a great start, with reports of long lines and broken voting machines. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who was talking only yesterday about her fears for her children\u2019s safety with the police, has been tweeting urging people to stick with the voting process. The row over Arkansas senator Tom Cotton\u2019s New York Times op-ed column has claimed a high profile casualty at the paper in the form of James Bennet\u2019s resignation. But that\u2019s certainly not the last we will hear about the matter - or Cotton. Arwa Mahdawi has written about him for us today. Cotton\u2019s moment in the spotlight has passed \u2013 but he will almost certainly be back there soon. Despite having the charisma of a soggy bag of lettuce, the senator is hugely powerful: Cotton has influenced many of Trump\u2019s decisions, including cuts to legal immigration and the banning of commercial flights between the US and China during the early days of Covid-19. He is also the guy who told Trump it would be a great idea to buy Greenland. When not urging the acquisition of the world\u2019s largest island, Cotton can often be found fanning the flames of racism and xenophobia. He has repeatedly used the phrases \u201cChina virus\u201d and \u201cWuhan virus\u201d\u2026he is a dangerous man with dangerous ambitions. Indeed, a number of experts believe he is angling to be the heir to Trumpism. You can read Arwa Mahdawi\u2019s full piece here: Think Trump is bad? President Tom Cotton would be even more terrifying There\u2019s no denying the international impact that the #BlackLivesMatter movement has been having on urban landscapes across the world. As well as Confederate monuments being taken down in the US, and the toppling by protesters of a statue of a slave-trader in Bristol, England, this morning has seen the removal of a statue of King Leopold II in Antwerp, Belgium. Leopold II ruled viciously over the Congo Free State as a personal fiefdom between 1885 and 1908, and millions perished under his rule. His monuments in Belgium have been a target for anti-racism protesters in the last fortnight. Houston\u2019s police chief Art Acevedo has been on television this morning, talking about George Floyd\u2019s funeral, which will take place later today. He talked about how the police in Houston has been supporting Floyd\u2019s family since his death, and said: Our message to them is, first we extended our condolences, we wanted them to to know that we feel their pain, but the most important thing is, that this is different. The nation has united against police misconduct, and some of the other social, economic challenges in this country. [Floyd\u2019s] death will not be in vain. I really believe we\u2019re at a watershed moment, and I am very hopeful that we\u2019re going to see some, some real change, systemic change, in our country. He also discussed proposals for police reform and the \u201cDefund the police\u201d movement. You can watch the full clip here: Lawrence Douglas has written for us today about something that may have escaped your attention with all the news that has been around in the last few days - Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, John Dowd, describing citizens engaging in peaceable protest as \u201cterrorists\u201d. Trump\u2019s presidency has largely inured us to overheated rhetoric. We\u2019ve grown accustomed to Trump and his allies vilifying journalists as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d or characterizing officials trying to hold him to account as treasonous criminals. All the same, Dowd\u2019s brandishing of the term \u201cterrorist\u201d represents a frightening rhetorical escalation at a perilous time in the life of our nation. Douglas goes on to argue this key point about the use of the word: In labeling protesters as terrorists, Dowd engages in something far more ominous and shocking than mere rhetorical overkill. He is effectively erasing the difference between Americans peaceably exercising their constitutional rights and Isis insurgents laying down roadside explosives. You can read the piece in full here: In case you missed it, Trump\u2019s former lawyer compared protesters to terrorists Away from the #BlackLivesMatter protests and coronavirus outbreak, there is still some business as usual politics going on in DC. This morning the Senate permanent subcommittee on Investigations has released a bipartisan report which states that three Chinese telecoms firms were allowed to operate in the US without appropriate oversight for nearly two decades. The report calls on the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a full review of China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas and ComNet USA - claiming that there has not been an adequate assessment of what national security threats they might pose. Republican Ohio Senator Rob Portman is quoted by The Hill as saying: \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party uses its state-owned enterprises to further its cyber and economic espionage efforts against the United States, and they\u2019ve been exploiting our telecommunications networks for nearly two decades while the federal government historically put in little effort to stop it.\u201d You can read the full Senate report here. The killing of George Floyd sparked a wave of protest that has put police reform back in the spotlight - but much of the moderate action being proposed doesn\u2019t meet activists more radical aims for changing the way law and order is enforced in the US. My colleagues Victoria Bekiempis and Adam Gabbatt have been having a look at how different the approaches of some cities and states have been to reform, with an overview of the measures being enacted not just in New York City, but in Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Portland among others. You can read their report here: New York police budget to be cut as debate rages over reforms The Houston Chronicle has some more details of what is expected at George Floyd\u2019s funeral today. He will be laid to rest at Houston Memorial Gardens in Pearland, where his mother is buried. Police will escort Floyd\u2019s body into Pearland following a private funeral at the Fountain of Praise Church, and the procession will finish with Floyd\u2019s body carried in a horse-drawn carriage. The public are allowed to view the procession, but they are not allowed into the services. There are expected to be road closures to ease the procession, and mourners are being encouraged to wear face-coverings and to practice social distancing. One thing that will have been in the back of many people\u2019s minds when they were out standing for the #BlackLivesMatter movement in the last fortnight - with coronavirus around, how much of a risk is this? An Axios-Ipsos survey has tried to measure people\u2019s attitudes. It says that one in ten of the people surveyed knew \u201csomeone in their immediate family or close circle of friends who attended an in-person protest or demonstration in the last week\u201d. That in itself is an incredible statistic speaking to sheer volume of people who have engaged in the protests. Perhaps not surprisingly, younger people (20%), people who describe themselves as Democrats (16%), and residents of urban areas (14%) are more likely to have told the survey that they knew someone who attended a demonstration. And there is a perceived widespread health concern - almost all respondents (86%) see going to protests or demonstrations to be a large or moderate risk, and half of those surveyed say they are extremely or very concerned about a spike in coronavirus cases as a result of these protests. There\u2019s more detail here: One in ten Americans have a protest attendee in their family or close friends Hi, and welcome to our US politics and protest live blog, on the day of George Floyd\u2019s funeral. Thousands have attended his memorials in the last few days, and today there will be a final family ceremony in Houston to say farewell to the 46 year old whose death at the hands of the police on 25 May has sparked a global wave of grief and protest. Here are some of the key stories and developments from yesterday and overnight: Congressional Democrats unveiled their police reform bill. It would ban chokeholds but many criminal justice activists have said reforms do not go far enough Economists say the US entered a recession in February as businesses started to close down in response to coronavirus New Coronavirus cases are accelerating again in more than a dozen US states The president\u2019s diary is empty for today, save a meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo this afternoon. His diary wasn\u2019t empty yesterday though. In a bit of symbolism that couldn\u2019t be stronger, Joe Biden met privately with members of George Floyd\u2019s family in Houston. Donald Trump met with police. I\u2019m Martin Belam, and I\u2019ll be live blogging more reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement protests and US political developments for a couple of hours until my colleagues in New York pick up the baton.

Monday\u2019s announcement that the temporary provision of free childcare is about to end was just the latest in a long line of policy choices \u2013 made by the male prime minister, male treasurer and male finance minister \u2013 that weigh heavily on women in the Australian labour market.</p> <p>While the treasurer is right that he \u201chas to draw the line somewhere\u201d, he is wrong to keep drawing that line in places that harm women. Since the crisis&nbsp;began, 5.3% &nbsp;of employed women have lost their jobs compared&nbsp;with 3.9% of men. Women\u2019s hours of work have fallen by&nbsp;11.5%&nbsp; compared with&nbsp;7.5%&nbsp; for men. And women are more than twice as likely to have stopped looking for a new job, presumably because they have taken on a disproportionate amount of homeschooling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/government-free-childcare-doesnt-suit-the-coalitions-ideology-we-get-what-we-voted-for\">Free childcare doesn\u2019t suit the Coalition\u2019s ideology \u2013 we get what we voted for | Lisa Bryant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Morrison government\u2019s decision to exclude most casuals from jobkeeper also disadvantages women. Women account for a disproportionate share of casual workers, and workplace culture and laws in Australia make it much easier to load up the pain of recession on to those with less secure employment contracts. Casual and short-term contract workers in Australia were struggling with low wage growth, poor job security, expensive housing and challenges accessing childcare before Covid-19 hit. When the commonwealth government announced its decision to exclude most casuals from jobkeeper, they did so largely on the basis that casuals should have saved for a rainy day. Then they announced a $90bn line of credit for the big banks.</p> <p>Conservative governments have spent decades telling voters about their skills in economic management, but in this time of crisis they work tirelessly to blame Covid-19, rather than their choices, for the distribution of economic pain. In addition to choosing to exclude most casuals from jobkeeper and end free childcare, they have also decided to extend the small business instant asset write-off used by tradies (at a cost of $700m) and introduce a new $688m scheme to create jobs for tradies via subsidies for new homes and expensive renovations.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government keeps talking up the need to stimulate male-intensive industries such as construction. Choices matter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government knows that women are far more likely to work in industries such as health and education than they are to work in construction. The government knows that women have suffered a disproportionate hit from the recession. Yet, despite knowing these things, the government keeps talking up the need to stimulate male-intensive industries such as construction. Choices matter.</p> <p>If the government wanted to maximise the number of jobs it created per million dollars, and it wanted to make sure its stimulus policies were delivering jobs for women in line with the proportion of those who now need them, it would not be hard to do. My Australia Institute colleague, David Richardson, and I looked at the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on labour intensity by industry and the ABS data on female employment by industry, to estimate the \u201cfemale employment multiplier\u201d for each industry. The results are quite stark.</p> <p>Every million dollars the government spends on education would create 10.6 direct jobs for women and 4.3 direct jobs for men. And every million dollars they spend on construction would create around 0.2 jobs for women and 1 job for men.&nbsp;</p> <p>The same pattern in education is present for health, accommodation, hospitality and entertainment. Per million dollars spent not only do these industries create more jobs for women than men, but they also create more jobs for men than construction does.</p> <p>If the government wanted to maximise job creation, it would focus its stimulus spending on the most labour-intensive industries. It\u2019s not a complicated idea, it just means that a larger share of the money spent goes to direct job creation and a smaller share gets spent on heavy machinery or imported materials. But there is no evidence that the government wants to maximise the number of people who get employed by its various stimulus packages.&nbsp;</p> <p>Back in the depression of the 1930s, men accounted for around 70% of the paid workforce and activities like road building, bridge building and tunnel building were far more labour intensive than they are today. But despite the fact Australia\u2019s labour force and construction techniques have changed radically, it seems the Coalition\u2019s approach to job creation has barely changed at all.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of men and women have lost their jobs in retail, tourism, education and hospitality. International tourism is unlikely to restart until at least next year. Likewise, travel for foreign students. Even if the construction industry were labour intensive \u2013 which it\u2019s not \u2013 it would take years for those who have lost their jobs in the services sector to acquire the skills required to be of use on a modern construction site.&nbsp;</p> <p>Construction has an important role to play in our society. If we want more schools, hospitals or public transport, then all of those assets will need to be built by the workers in our construction industry. But it is absurd for the Coalition to pretend that if it is helping our tradies it is helping the economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/the-homebuilder-scheme-is-simply-pork-barrelling-to-the-coalitions-electoral-base\">The homebuilder scheme is simply pork-barrelling to the Coalition's electoral base | Emma Dawson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are currently more than 820,000 unemployed people in Australia and a further 1.8 million underemployed people.

      "bodyText": "Not only have women been hardest hit by the response to Covid-19, they have got the least out of government assistance and stimulus packages. Monday\u2019s announcement that the temporary provision of free childcare is about to end was just the latest in a long line of policy choices \u2013 made by the male prime minister, male treasurer and male finance minister \u2013 that weigh heavily on women in the Australian labour market. While the treasurer is right that he \u201chas to draw the line somewhere\u201d, he is wrong to keep drawing that line in places that harm women. Since the crisis began, 5.3% of employed women have lost their jobs compared with 3.9% of men. Women\u2019s hours of work have fallen by 11.5% compared with 7.5% for men. And women are more than twice as likely to have stopped looking for a new job, presumably because they have taken on a disproportionate amount of homeschooling. The Morrison government\u2019s decision to exclude most casuals from jobkeeper also disadvantages women. Women account for a disproportionate share of casual workers, and workplace culture and laws in Australia make it much easier to load up the pain of recession on to those with less secure employment contracts. Casual and short-term contract workers in Australia were struggling with low wage growth, poor job security, expensive housing and challenges accessing childcare before Covid-19 hit. When the commonwealth government announced its decision to exclude most casuals from jobkeeper, they did so largely on the basis that casuals should have saved for a rainy day. Then they announced a $90bn line of credit for the big banks. Conservative governments have spent decades telling voters about their skills in economic management, but in this time of crisis they work tirelessly to blame Covid-19, rather than their choices, for the distribution of economic pain. In addition to choosing to exclude most casuals from jobkeeper and end free childcare, they have also decided to extend the small business instant asset write-off used by tradies (at a cost of $700m) and introduce a new $688m scheme to create jobs for tradies via subsidies for new homes and expensive renovations. The government knows that women are far more likely to work in industries such as health and education than they are to work in construction. The government knows that women have suffered a disproportionate hit from the recession. Yet, despite knowing these things, the government keeps talking up the need to stimulate male-intensive industries such as construction. Choices matter. If the government wanted to maximise the number of jobs it created per million dollars, and it wanted to make sure its stimulus policies were delivering jobs for women in line with the proportion of those who now need them, it would not be hard to do. My Australia Institute colleague, David Richardson, and I looked at the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on labour intensity by industry and the ABS data on female employment by industry, to estimate the \u201cfemale employment multiplier\u201d for each industry. The results are quite stark. Every million dollars the government spends on education would create 10.6 direct jobs for women and 4.3 direct jobs for men. And every million dollars they spend on construction would create around 0.2 jobs for women and 1 job for men. The same pattern in education is present for health, accommodation, hospitality and entertainment. Per million dollars spent not only do these industries create more jobs for women than men, but they also create more jobs for men than construction does. If the government wanted to maximise job creation, it would focus its stimulus spending on the most labour-intensive industries. It\u2019s not a complicated idea, it just means that a larger share of the money spent goes to direct job creation and a smaller share gets spent on heavy machinery or imported materials. But there is no evidence that the government wants to maximise the number of people who get employed by its various stimulus packages. Back in the depression of the 1930s, men accounted for around 70% of the paid workforce and activities like road building, bridge building and tunnel building were far more labour intensive than they are today. But despite the fact Australia\u2019s labour force and construction techniques have changed radically, it seems the Coalition\u2019s approach to job creation has barely changed at all. Hundreds of thousands of men and women have lost their jobs in retail, tourism, education and hospitality. International tourism is unlikely to restart until at least next year. Likewise, travel for foreign students. Even if the construction industry were labour intensive \u2013 which it\u2019s not \u2013 it would take years for those who have lost their jobs in the services sector to acquire the skills required to be of use on a modern construction site. Construction has an important role to play in our society. If we want more schools, hospitals or public transport, then all of those assets will need to be built by the workers in our construction industry. But it is absurd for the Coalition to pretend that if it is helping our tradies it is helping the economy. There are currently more than 820,000 unemployed people in Australia and a further 1.8 million underemployed people. When jobkeeper ends, those numbers will surge. Last week\u2019s announcement of $688m to stimulate new home construction and renovations was rightly mocked for providing no help to those who can\u2019t afford to take on an extra $150,000 debt right now. But the fundamental problem with the policy is its pathetic size and appalling targeting. As the government prepares to withdraw the jobkeeper program, it needs to start rolling out tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of industry-specific support aimed at the industries that can employ the largest number of unemployed people. Even before Covid-19, women in Australia were more likely to miss out on sick pay, holiday pay, job security and tax concessions for their superannuation than men. And since the crisis they have been more likely to lose their hours, or their jobs, than men. There is absolutely no need for women to miss out on the benefits of stimulus spending as well. That decision is entirely up to government.

He relentlessly attacks those who dilute or deny essential truths.\u201d The company states they have over 15,000 affiliate gyms around the world, in 150 countries, including over 500 in Australia, 6,000 in the United States and 3,000 in Europe and the United Kingdom. In Australia, CrossFit affiliates were preparing for their gyms to reopen this month as coronavirus restrictions ease. None of the affiliates the Guardian spoke to were on the Zoom call or heard the comments related to social-distancing rules for gyms. CrossFit Sydney CBD said for its reopening later this week it was strictly limiting class numbers to eight, and requiring members to wash hands before class. There was also appropriate distancing set in place between equipment, which is washed with disinfectant after each session. Members were also advised not to come to the gym if they were feeling unwell. In a statement on the CrossFit website, which describes Glassman\u2019s exit as a \u201cretirement\u201d, Glassman stated: \u201cOn Saturday I created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members \u2026 Those who know me know that my sole issue is the chronic disease epidemic. I know that CrossFit is the solution to this epidemic.\u201d Glassman will be replaced by Dave Castro. CrossFit, which is both an exercise program and a competitive sport, makes money through its licensing partnerships with affiliated gyms, training programs and seminars. The brand has previously faced controversy over allegations, dating back to 2005, that its approach to exercise is more likely to lead to physical injury than other kinds of training. These claims have been contested by CrossFit in multiple lawsuits, which in one case led to a retraction of a paper published by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. In 2019, Russ Greene, who was CrossFit\u2019s director of government relations and research at the time, told Retraction Watch: \u201cLegitimate research on CrossFit has reached a near unanimous conclusion: \u2018The injury incidence rate associated with CrossFit training was low, and comparable to other forms of recreational fitness activities.\u2019\u201d On 11 June this piece was amended to state Russ Greene was formerly Crossfit\u2019s director of government relations and research. He has subsequently left the role.",

Spikes in cases and hospitalisations in parts of California and the US south-west prompted Arizona to reactivate its emergency plan for medical facilities and California to place counties where half its population lives on a watch list. The rise in cases, which could lead authorities to reimpose or tighten public health restrictions aimed at slowing the virus\u2019 spread, complicates efforts by Donald Trump to reopen the US economy and hold election rallies once more. In other developments: More than 1,000 doves died of starvation at Afghanistan\u2019s famed blue-tiled mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, after it closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, caretakers said. World Tennis No 1 Novak Djokovic is thinking of skipping the US Open \u2013 if it is played \u2013 and instead returning to competition on clay ahead of the rescheduled French Open, saying Covid-19 restrictions that would be in place for the Grand Slam tournament in New York would be \u201cextreme\u201d and not \u201csustainable\u201d.

The pandemic has exacerbated already worrying trends when it comes to doing business in China amid slowing revenue growth, regulatory obstacles and the clout of the state-owned sector, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said. Fujifilm Holdings Corp will spend $928m to double capacity at a drug manufacturing facility in Denmark that it has pledged to use in producing Covid-19 treatments, as the Japanese company steps up its pivot towards healthcare.",

It emerged on Monday that members of Essex University\u2019s Conservative Society have been suspended from the student\u2019s union after they suggested coronavirus spreading via Black Lives Matter protests was \u201cnatural selection\u201d. One member of the society wrote in a Facebook chat group: \u201cCorona be like, Hell, about time\u201d. Another said: \u201cLet them protest, the virus will decide,\u201d the Mirror reported. The same member said: \u201cI think it would be irresponsible to wish Covid on them. But at this point I don\u2019t need to, it\u2019s natural selection.\u201d A spokesperson for the Conservatives said the party \u201cdoes not tolerate racism and has acted to investigate and suspend members when appropriate\u201d.",

George Floyd\u2019s life has been celebrated at his funeral with eulogies that honoured him as a father, brother, athlete and mentor whose death sparked a global reckoning over police brutality and racial prejudice. \u201cEverybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world,\u201d Floyd\u2019s brother, Rodney, told mourners at the Fountain of Praise church in Houston, Texas, after Floyd\u2019s body was returned to his childhood hometown. In New York traders at the stock exchange paused for eight minutes and 46 seconds to mark the length of time the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck. \u201cLives like George will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives,\u201d said the civil rights advocate the Rev Al Sharpton in his eulogy. Celebrating the passion of the mass protests, he added: \u201cAll over the world I\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave master statues.\u201d In London, the statue of slave owner Robert Milligan outside the Museum of London Docklands has been removed by local authorities, while the campaign to take away Cecil Rhodes\u2019s statue at Oxford has been reignited. All statues in Labour councils across England and Wales, and across London, will be examined for links to slavery and plantation owners, their leaders have said. In Derbyshire, local people have removed and hidden a wooden bust of a black man with exaggerated features from outside the Green Man &amp; Black\u2019s Head Royal hotel \u2013 preventing the local council from taking the head into its keeping following objections. \u201cIt\u2019s not black anyway, it\u2019s Turkish,\u201d said one Tory councillor. Neville Lawrence, the father of Stephen Lawrence, has said black people are still treated as second-class citizens in Britain, more than two decades after police were shamed by their failure to find his son\u2019s racist killers. This morning, two clergy from BAME backgrounds claim discrimination has blocked their efforts to advance within the CofE hierarchy. The rapper Wretch 32 has shared video dated to 21 April of his father, Millard Scott, 62, being Tasered and tumbling down stairs during a police action at his London home. The Met said its professional standards unit found no misconduct. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has called for a further investigation. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 Boris Johnson will need an urgent national plan to get all pupils back to school in England from September including an army of support staff, the requisitioning of public buildings and extra help for disadvantaged students, unions and cross-party MPs have said. The waiting list for hospital treatment could soar to almost 10 million by Christmas amid a huge backlog, NHS leaders are warning. Beer gardens in England will not be allowed to open before the end of the month, Downing Street has said, quashing suggestions that ministers were considering allowing pubs to serve beer outside from 22 June. However, zoos and safari parks will be back in business from Monday. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has said the coronavirus pandemic \u201cjust took over the planet\u201d and is far from being over. Modelling studies have estimated up to 40% of coronavirus infections could be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms, a World Health Organization expert has acknowledged, clarifying her earlier comment that asymptomatic transmission was \u201cvery rare\u201d. But Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said real-world data, as opposed to modelling, suggested it could still be a rare event.

In a statement it said there had been no hack and it had notified the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. &gt; Fifteen potential cases of torture or rendition involving British intelligence were examined in a secret Whitehall review last year. Its existence was revealed in court proceedings where the former MPs David Davis and Labour\u2019s Dan Jarvis are seeking to reinstate a judge-led inquiry ditched by Theresa May into British involvement in torture and rendition. &gt; Brexit, tightening budgets and unchecked expansion have seen nearly three-quarters of UK universities slip down the QS international league table in their worst-ever performance. Imperial College London climbed one spot to reach eighth \u2013 the only UK university in the top 20 to improve. &gt; Property sales in most of England have rebounded to the same levels as just before the lockdown, although London lags behind the rest of the country and markets in Scotland and Wales remain closed, according to website Zoopla. &gt; A gas well has erupted into a huge fireball after leaking uncontrolled for weeks in Assam state, India. The explosion at the Oil India field caused a fire that spread to nearby homes, according to reports. * * * \u2018Hateful extremism\u2019 \u2013 Extremists are exploiting gaps in existing laws to push their agenda such as peddling antisemitic coronavirus conspiracy theories, Sir Mark Rowley, the former counter-terror chief, has warned. Rowley is to lead a review, under the auspices of the Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE), to examine whether existing legislation adequately deals with \u201chateful extremism\u201d. * * * Buried stories \u2013 Archaeologists believe they have found remains of the earliest purpose-built playhouse in Britain, a prototype for a theatre that staged plays by a young William Shakespeare. The Red Lion is thought to have been built around 1567 and, after years of conjecture and debate, archaeologists feel certain they have found it under the site of an old self-storage facility in the East End of London.

The group includes a high proportion of older men with an African-Caribbean background from London boroughs that have been heavily hit by Covid-19. Since the lockdown began the group has met over Zoom. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised with how many were already familiar with the technology, given that the group\u2019s average age is probably mid-60s.

The Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT), which has <a href=\"https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/about-us/what-we-do/cancer-units\">28 dedicated units</a> in primary treatment centres for cancer, says that large numbers of young people have told the charity that they\u2019ve found it really tough not being able to see friends and family or continue to work. Although the charity provides digital support and activities, it has had to suspend face-to-face activities. These \u201cprovide important psychological support, and we\u2019re worried about the toll this [lack of in-person meetings] will take on young people\u2019s mental health longer-term,\u201d says Kate Collins, TCT\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>For others, coronavirus has halted their tentative steps back to a normal life.<strong> </strong>Anna Robertson, 38, was on a phased return to work following breast cancer treatment when the pandemic sent her plans into reverse.

Colette Cowan, head of service delivery at Wessex, says: \u201cWe have seen an increase in demand for our services, both from existing and new clients. We\u2019ve seen an increase in clients wanting connection with others.

Funding for local, primary healthcare services will be cut by more than 40% this year in a revised budget expected to be passed into law in the coming weeks. The proposed cuts could affect immunisations, childcare, maternal healthcare and family planning services. Nigeria currently spends less than 5% of its federal budget on health. Dwindling oil sales, the crash in global oil prices and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic are understood to be the reason for the cuts. According to Prof Innocent Ujah, the head of the Nigerian medical association, the proposed cuts have come just as more investment in health is needed. \u201cOur budget for health is unacceptably low, under 5%. With the Covid-19 pandemic, it becomes even more serious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will have an impact on our response to the virus.\u201d Ujah said he was shocked at the announcement of the cuts, as it had been assumed health budgets would be ringfenced during the pandemic. Fuelling criticisms of the healthcare cuts has been the 37bn naira (\u00a375m) set aside for renovations to Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly buildings. \u201cWhatever renovations they want to do in the National Assembly should be suspended,\u201d Ujah said. \u201cThis is a global emergency.\u201d The legislative body is heavily criticised in Nigeria for the lack of transparency in government spending and for the high salaries of lawmakers.

The government has really underinvested in healthcare.\u201d Nigerian authorities took early steps to try to contain the outbreak of Covid-19. But cases are steadily rising, doubling in the past three weeks to 12,000 infections. A number of challenges have undermined its test and trace strategy, including too few test kits. Just 80,000 tests have been administered, far lower than the country\u2019s health officials want. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control has said 75% of infections are occurring in communities without an identifiable trace. Adding to the challenges are issues with morale among some health staff. Fifty doctors and nurses at a key Covid-19 response centre in Lagos University teaching hospital say they have not been paid the allowances promised to workers caring for coronavirus cases since April. The allowances are paid on top of their usual salaries. According to staff who spoke on condition of anonymity, the delay in receiving allowances was making it difficult to recruit health professionals to fight the virus. \u201cWe were assured payments for the Covid response.

The last of them that a man who is so complicated should be so blunt in his views, that a man who has so often been given the benefit of both sides of the argument has made such a point of painting the world in black and white.\u2019</p> <h2>2. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/the-trump-supporters-who-regret-their-vote\">Are they gone for good? The Trump supporters who regret their vote</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018It\u2019s helpful to remember, first, what the president has asked of Republicans. He has treated the party like Theseus\u2019s ancient ship, replacing one plank at a time until it becomes unrecognizable as itself.&nbsp;From a party whose elites sought to reject Trump in 2016, it has now become almost unerringly loyal and much changed.\u2019</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/what-would-israel-annexing-the-west-bank-mean\">What would Israel annexing the West Bank mean?</a></h2> <p>\u2018With a US \u201cvision for peace\u201d blueprint&nbsp;largely backing up his expansionist ambitions, the Israeli prime minister intends to make the explosive move with the support of Donald Trump. However, much uncertainty remains around when, how \u2013 or even if \u2013 Netanyahu will push forward with annexation and what effect it could have.\u2019</p> <h2>4. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/09/yellowstone-grizzly-bear-399-conservation\">\u2018She still lives!\u2019 Famed Yellowstone bear emerges from winter \u2013 with cubs</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Born in 1996, 399 has demonstrated the importance of a healthy female bear to an overall population. At least 22 bears are descended from her, both cubs and cubs of cubs (in human terms, grandchildren).&nbsp;It\u2019s possible she could become a great grandmother \u2013 a senior citizen who is still having offspring of her own.\u2019</p> <h2>5. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/09/ive-never-seen-the-blues-brothers\">I\u2019ve never seen ...

Deneuve, he wrote, is the mysterious&nbsp;Lady Lucille&nbsp;to whom Hallyday dedicated a song and it was she who left an anonymous wreath on his grave signed simply \u201cLady L\u201d.\u2019</p> <h2>7. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/republicans-donald-trump-protests-election-2020\">Republican criticism of Trump grows \u2013 but will it make a difference at the polls?</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Several Republican groups have formed to oppose his 2020 bid, including&nbsp;Republican Voters Against Trump,&nbsp;which last week launched a $10m digital ad campaign, and the Lincoln Project, which has produced a series of&nbsp;hard-hitting advertisements&nbsp;that got under the president\u2019s skin.\u2019</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/black-americans-police-violence-protest-activism\">To be Black is to suffer perpetual wounds.

      "bodyText": "1. Farewell Boycott, a mess of contradictions whose TMS innings lasted far too long \u2018He is a mess of contradictions. The last of them that a man who is so complicated should be so blunt in his views, that a man who has so often been given the benefit of both sides of the argument has made such a point of painting the world in black and white.\u2019 2. Are they gone for good? The Trump supporters who regret their vote \u2018It\u2019s helpful to remember, first, what the president has asked of Republicans. He has treated the party like Theseus\u2019s ancient ship, replacing one plank at a time until it becomes unrecognizable as itself. From a party whose elites sought to reject Trump in 2016, it has now become almost unerringly loyal and much changed.\u2019 3. What would Israel annexing the West Bank mean? \u2018With a US \u201cvision for peace\u201d blueprint largely backing up his expansionist ambitions, the Israeli prime minister intends to make the explosive move with the support of Donald Trump. However, much uncertainty remains around when, how \u2013 or even if \u2013 Netanyahu will push forward with annexation and what effect it could have.\u2019 4. \u2018She still lives!\u2019 Famed Yellowstone bear emerges from winter \u2013 with cubs \u2018Born in 1996, 399 has demonstrated the importance of a healthy female bear to an overall population. At least 22 bears are descended from her, both cubs and cubs of cubs (in human terms, grandchildren). It\u2019s possible she could become a great grandmother \u2013 a senior citizen who is still having offspring of her own.\u2019 5. I\u2019ve never seen ... The Blues Brothers \u2018It\u2019s self-indulgent, rather than funny, which is to be expected from a film that was filmed amid a blizzard of cocaine, and which was a spin-off of a spin-off \u2013 from Saturday Night Live, to an album, to a film.\u2019 6. Catherine Deneuve was Johnny Hallyday\u2019s secret love, book claims \u2018In his new book the author Gilles Lhote claims Deneuve became the love of Hallyday\u2019s life after they met in 1961 while filming Les Parisiennes. Deneuve, he wrote, is the mysterious Lady Lucille to whom Hallyday dedicated a song and it was she who left an anonymous wreath on his grave signed simply \u201cLady L\u201d.\u2019 7. Republican criticism of Trump grows \u2013 but will it make a difference at the polls? \u2018Several Republican groups have formed to oppose his 2020 bid, including Republican Voters Against Trump, which last week launched a $10m digital ad campaign, and the Lincoln Project, which has produced a series of hard-hitting advertisements that got under the president\u2019s skin.\u2019 8. To be Black is to suffer perpetual wounds. Here\u2019s how you can make a difference \u2018It has been grace, and grace alone, that has spared me from the violent deaths perpetrated against my brothers and sisters. But like Black people across this nation, I continue to ask the question, \u201cAm I next?\u201d\u2019 9. BBC interview haunts Prince Andrew as US prosecutors push to break deadlock \u2018Andrew has insisted he is eager to cooperate fully with the US investigation. But the prince and the detective appear to define \u201ccooperation\u201d very differently. Berman wants a sit-down interview. The prince\u2019s PR advisers say Andrew is ready to provide a witness statement. This would be sworn, of course. But it falls well short of a probing FBI encounter with follow-up questions.\u2019 10. #Solidaritea: Yorkshire Tea and PG Tips join brands in backing BLM \u2018The two tea firms are the latest to grapple with a corporate dilemma during the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 whether declaring their support is a clear communication of brand values, or risks backfiring and appearing opportunistic.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

On Thursday night, when protesters in the Bronx were zip-tied, she said they were taken to another borough, Queens. \u201cSome of them were ultimately released, but it was still during curfew time with no way to get back home and with real fear of being arrested again for violating the curfew.\u201d Many of the arrests are unnecessary, said Jared Trujillo, defence attorney and president of the association of Legal Aid Attorneys. \u201cUltimately someone who\u2019s just out there protesting there is no reason that police officers can\u2019t issue an appearance ticket \u2013 if they have to arrest them at all.\u201d Rather than scaring off protesters, police treatment of those arrested is in some ways \u201cemboldening\u201d people to demonstrate, he said. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, announced on Friday that he will not prosecute protesters for low-level offenses. However, Trujillo said there was no guarantee. \u201cSomething to note about the Manhattan DA is oftentimes they say they\u2019re not going to prosecute certain things and they do it anyway.\u201d Student Kellen Gold, 22, was arrested for violating the curfew on Wednesday night at a march in Manhattan. Gold, who uses they/them pronouns, said they were charged by police on bikes so they ran and kneeled before being \u201cthrown to the ground and then cuffed\u201d and taken to a police station in Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019ve been arrested a bunch of times [for activism] \u2026 this is the first arrest where I\u2019ve been violently handled,\u201d said Gold, who was released at around 1.15am and given a court date in September. Almost all of the officers were not wearing masks, said Gold, and protesters were required to share water cups. Johnathan, 35, a videographer from Brooklyn who did not want to give his last name, said he was arrested for trespassing at the Barclays Centre on 29 May after walking up the sloping grass-covered roof of the train station to get a better vantage point to film. At One Police Plaza, NYPD\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan, he claims it was \u201cchaos\u201d. He said he was not given a phone call and officers were not wearing masks or social distancing. In a holding area of about 50 people, he said he was the only one wearing a mask. He said he has been summoned to appear in September but that officers told him they will not charge him with trespassing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in store,\u201d he added. The experience has changed him, he said, and he believes the police should be defunded. He added: \u201cIf they\u2019re messing that up, what else are they messing up? \u2026 The fire that has now been lit under me is to hold the police accountable.\u201d The NYPD, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday would have its $6bn budget cut following pressure from protesters, said it \u201csupports and respects the rights of protesters to express their views\u201d and that they are given \u201cnumerous warnings to disperse\u201d if officers decide to clear the street. It said if directions are ignored, \u201ca person may be subject to an arrest or summons.\u201d Sergeant Mary Frances O\u2019Donnell, a spokeswoman for the deputy commissioner, public information, said: \u201cWhile the majority of the protests have been peaceful, our officers have encountered agitators with different agendas who have used the guise of the protests to commit criminal acts and violence. \u201cSince May 25, our officers have been shot at, stabbed, assaulted with rocks, bricks and other debris, have been struck by vehicles and have even had molotov cocktails thrown inside their vehicle. This behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\u201d",

It was pure madness. Many industries are going to have be be reconsidered in the wake of the economic shutdown, and weddings should be at the top of the list. Like the cruise industry, we should just let it die.&nbsp;</p> <p>The institution of marriage has been declining even as the cost of weddings&nbsp;has been exploding. Today, about half of adult Americans are married. In 1960, the number was three-quarters. And the people who do get married, get married way, way later.<strong> </strong>In 1962, half of 21-year-olds were married. In 2019, that number was down to 9%. In 1962, 90% of 30-year-olds had been married. In 2019, only <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/average-marriage-age-united-states-2019-2\">slightly over half of 30-year-olds</a> had been.&nbsp;</p> <p>Half a century ago, marriage meant big life changes:&nbsp;losing your virginity,&nbsp;moving in, merging bank accounts, having kids. But now, three-quarters of couples already live together. They split the bills. They share a bed. Marriage is not a requirement to be an adult any more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nonetheless, we maintain these supposedly necessary traditions. The most widespread collective response to the approach of gender equality has been that, in our most significant public declarations of love and commitment, women dress up like they\u2019re minor members of the Russian royal family from the 19th century and men dress up like they\u2019re waiters on cruise liners. I guess it\u2019s good to begin any major phase in life with a consciousness of your own ridiculousness, but surely there ought to be limits.</p> <p>And then there is the cost. The average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $32,329. The median cost for a house in the States that year was $200,000, according to Zillow. Do the math: the average cost of a wedding is a serious downpayment on an average house. You start off the period of your life when you really need money by collecting it in a pile and burning it. A big wedding makes leasing a sports car look like a good financial decision.</p> <p>Spending all that money on a wedding won\u2019t make you happier, it won\u2019t make your marriage stronger. The opposite, in fact. In 2015, social scientists in Singapore did the work. In \u2018<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2501480\">A Diamond is Forever\u2019 and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration</a>,&nbsp;they found marriage duration is inversely associated with the spending on the ceremony and the engagement ring. The more you spend, the shorter the marriage lasts. But that\u2019s obvious any time you go to a wedding. You can tell how unhappy a couple is by the size of the flower arrangements.&nbsp;(For the record, my wife and I eloped in the aftermath of September 11. We were, according to lifestyle journalists at the time, a \u201cterror marriage\u201d.)&nbsp;</p> <p>The idea that you need to have the big wedding because of \u201ctradition\u201d? The \u201ctradition\u201d behind weddings was all thought up by Madison Avenue types a hundred years ago. Karen Dunak, a history professor at Muskingum University in Ohio, wrote As Long as We Both Shall Love: The White Wedding in Postwar America. It\u2019s a fascinating history of the consumerist nonsense that is the modern wedding. \u201cWhen you have this rise and this increased democratization of a consumer culture in the 1920s, this is when you have more wedding registries; this is when you have department stores that would have wedding departments,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is when you have the commercialization of a lot of services related to the wedding. That you would have bakers who make wedding cakes, you would have wedding boutiques, you would have florists who would make wedding arrangements rather than people doing it as a part of home craft.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7051e7172d5cd258ed719f96388aabb0b5fb2c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7051e7172d5cd258ed719f96388aabb0b5fb2c7/0_220_6595_3957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The happiest day of their lives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The happiest day of their lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But global crises like Covid-19 changed it overnight. \u201c[The wedding industry] was disrupted a little bit with the Great Depression. It\u2019s changed some more with the nature of World War II, where you happen to have very rushed weddings where people meet each other and somebody\u2019s heading off to war. It\u2019s after World War II where you would have a church wedding, that you would have a reception, that you would have dinner, that you\u2019d have dancing.\u201d</p> <p>The tradition of huge elaborate ceremonies followed by enormous parties, all at vast expense, belongs to the recent past of unparalleled growth. That period is over. It\u2019s time to make some new traditions \u2013 vastly, vastly cheaper ones.</p> <p>Before Covid-19, a wedding was a way to begin your life together in a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism. That is what a pre-Covid wedding forced you to do: it forced you to turn your love into a lifestyle. It forced you to turn your private life into a big display. There was enormous social pressure to engage in what is obviously a folly: to begin adulthood by lying, by making up fraudulent histories, by pretending that you\u2019re independent, by grotesque and unoriginal conspicuous consumption.&nbsp;</p> <p>Covid-19 is ruining a great many beautiful things, glorious art, wonderful meetings, even love itself. But this destruction \u2013 the destruction of the wedding industry \u2013&nbsp;we should take for what it is, a blessing in disguise. Let\u2019s not let the insanity back. We should keep weddings right where they are, right now: nowhere.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Stephen Marche\u2019s audio series <a href=\"https://www.audible.ca/ep/how-not-to?ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;overrideBaseCountry=true&amp;pf_rd_p=22088211-8fdb-428a-b349-c53b6eb5e8a7&amp;pf_rd_r=FQN5SZGN9Q8S1AQYKTW7\">How Not to F*ck Up Your Marriage Too Bad</a> is available on Audible June 11</em></p>",

And the people who do get married, get married way, way later. In 1962, half of 21-year-olds were married. In 2019, that number was down to 9%. In 1962, 90% of 30-year-olds had been married. In 2019, only slightly over half of 30-year-olds had been. Half a century ago, marriage meant big life changes: losing your virginity, moving in, merging bank accounts, having kids. But now, three-quarters of couples already live together. They split the bills. They share a bed. Marriage is not a requirement to be an adult any more. Nonetheless, we maintain these supposedly necessary traditions. The most widespread collective response to the approach of gender equality has been that, in our most significant public declarations of love and commitment, women dress up like they\u2019re minor members of the Russian royal family from the 19th century and men dress up like they\u2019re waiters on cruise liners. I guess it\u2019s good to begin any major phase in life with a consciousness of your own ridiculousness, but surely there ought to be limits. And then there is the cost. The average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $32,329. The median cost for a house in the States that year was $200,000, according to Zillow. Do the math: the average cost of a wedding is a serious downpayment on an average house. You start off the period of your life when you really need money by collecting it in a pile and burning it. A big wedding makes leasing a sports car look like a good financial decision. Spending all that money on a wedding won\u2019t make you happier, it won\u2019t make your marriage stronger. The opposite, in fact. In 2015, social scientists in Singapore did the work. In \u2018A Diamond is Forever\u2019 and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration, they found marriage duration is inversely associated with the spending on the ceremony and the engagement ring. The more you spend, the shorter the marriage lasts. But that\u2019s obvious any time you go to a wedding. You can tell how unhappy a couple is by the size of the flower arrangements. (For the record, my wife and I eloped in the aftermath of September 11. We were, according to lifestyle journalists at the time, a \u201cterror marriage\u201d.) The idea that you need to have the big wedding because of \u201ctradition\u201d? The \u201ctradition\u201d behind weddings was all thought up by Madison Avenue types a hundred years ago. Karen Dunak, a history professor at Muskingum University in Ohio, wrote As Long as We Both Shall Love: The White Wedding in Postwar America. It\u2019s a fascinating history of the consumerist nonsense that is the modern wedding. \u201cWhen you have this rise and this increased democratization of a consumer culture in the 1920s, this is when you have more wedding registries; this is when you have department stores that would have wedding departments,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is when you have the commercialization of a lot of services related to the wedding. That you would have bakers who make wedding cakes, you would have wedding boutiques, you would have florists who would make wedding arrangements rather than people doing it as a part of home craft.\u201d But global crises like Covid-19 changed it overnight. \u201c[The wedding industry] was disrupted a little bit with the Great Depression. It\u2019s changed some more with the nature of World War II, where you happen to have very rushed weddings where people meet each other and somebody\u2019s heading off to war. It\u2019s after World War II where you would have a church wedding, that you would have a reception, that you would have dinner, that you\u2019d have dancing.\u201d The tradition of huge elaborate ceremonies followed by enormous parties, all at vast expense, belongs to the recent past of unparalleled growth. That period is over. It\u2019s time to make some new traditions \u2013 vastly, vastly cheaper ones. Before Covid-19, a wedding was a way to begin your life together in a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism. That is what a pre-Covid wedding forced you to do: it forced you to turn your love into a lifestyle. It forced you to turn your private life into a big display. There was enormous social pressure to engage in what is obviously a folly: to begin adulthood by lying, by making up fraudulent histories, by pretending that you\u2019re independent, by grotesque and unoriginal conspicuous consumption. Covid-19 is ruining a great many beautiful things, glorious art, wonderful meetings, even love itself. But this destruction \u2013 the destruction of the wedding industry \u2013 we should take for what it is, a blessing in disguise. Let\u2019s not let the insanity back. We should keep weddings right where they are, right now: nowhere. Stephen Marche\u2019s audio series How Not to F*ck Up Your Marriage Too Bad is available on Audible June 11",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. A slump in the UK\u2019s national income of 11.5% during 2020 will outstrip the falls in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the US, the Paris-based thinktank said. Germany\u2019s decline in national income (GDP) is forecast to be 6.6% this year while Spain\u2019s GDP will fall by 11.1%, Italy\u2019s by 11.3 and France\u2019s by 11.4%. The US, the world\u2019s largest economy, is expected to take a hit of 7.3%. Highlighting the task awaiting the UK government as it seeks to ease the lockdown, the OECD warned that countries forced to impose the most draconian restrictions faced a long haul back to previous levels of activity. Anneliese Dodds, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, blamed the \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d OECD forecast on the government\u2019s \u201cfailure to get on top of the health crisis, delay going into lockdown and chaotic mismanagement of the exit from lockdown\u201d, which she argued made the economic impact of the crisis worse. Responding to the report, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the UK was suffering \u201cin common with many other economies around the world\u201d and the priority was to \u201csupport people, jobs and businesses through this crisis \u2013 and this is what we\u2019ve done\u201d. Britain, which is forecast to post an increase in unemployment to around 9%, could make its situation more difficult if it failed to secure a lasting agreement with the EU on trade and access to the single market, the OECD said. \u201cThe failure to conclude a trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 or put in place alternative arrangements would have a strongly negative effect on trade and jobs,\u201d it said. Adding to pressure on No 10 to agree concessions with Brussels to secure a Brexit deal amid the economic damage caused by the pandemic, the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s warned that a no-deal Brexit would \u201csignificantly damage the UK\u2019s potentially fragile recovery from its deepest recession in almost a century\u201d. Moody\u2019s said a no-deal outcome was fast becoming increasingly likely and would be a severe blow to an economy already weakened by the coronavirus crisis. The OECD forecast of an 11.5% drop in GDP this year is an improvement on the 14% fall in national income put forward last month as a likely \u201cscenario\u201d by the Bank of England, but will add to pressure on the government after the OECD found that even countries that have come under severe criticism for their handling of the pandemic will fare better than the UK. Brazil, the US and Sweden were on course for contractions in GDP of 7.4% or less, the OECD said, while China was likely to drop by 2.6% and Russia by 8%. Defining the global situation as \u201cdire\u201d, the OECD said increases in government debt and the level of outstanding loans of private firms and banks would accompany the downturn, which would average 6% across the world. It ruled out a V-shaped recovery for the global economy, saying the path back to previous levels of GDP would be hampered by long-lasting effects of the pandemic. Laurence Boone, the OECD\u2019s chief economist, played down the significance of the UK contracting by the biggest margin in its 2020 economic outlook. She said it was difficult to be precise in the current situation and the exercise showed the UK would experience a similar contraction to Spain, France and Italy, which also imposed severe lockdowns. She warned that the world economy was \u201cwalking a tightrope\u201d and could face a second outbreak of the virus, triggering another lockdown and a more severe recession. Offering a forecast for both a single and double lockdown, Boone said the UK economy could contract by an unprecedented 14% if the government needed to impose a second lockdown this year. She said: \u201cThese scenarios are by no means exhaustive, but they help frame the field of possibilities and sharpen policies to walk such uncharted grounds. Both scenarios are sobering, as economic activity does not and cannot return to normal under these circumstances. \u201cBy the end of 2021, the loss of income exceeds that of any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments,\u201d she said. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said on Wednesday he could see some early signs of an economic recovery in Britain as the government\u2019s coronavirus lockdown restrictions were lifted but agreed there was still likely to be long-term damage. Speaking at an online conference organised by the World Economic Forum, he said: \u201cIf there is any such thing as a normal recession ... this one will be different. There will be elements of a faster recovery, because the first stage of the recovery is literally lifting restrictions and allowing people to go out. \u201cAnd we see ... evidence of elements of that recovery starting.\u201d Some surveys of businesses and consumers in May and early June have pointed to some recovery as the lockdown lifts, he added. Bailey is expected to vote at a policy meeting later this month in favour of the central bank injecting a further \u00a3100bn of rescue funds into the financial system to maintain low interest rates for businesses and consumers. He said long-term damage to the economy was likely as bankruptcies increased and unemployment climbed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much scarring there will be. I think it is reasonable to say there will be some but it is very hard to judge,\u201d he said. Figures showing the depth of the recession will be published on Friday when the Office for National Statistics publishes April\u2019s GDP data. The City expects the slump to be severe in response to the lockdown and the mothballing of much of the economy.",

The Australian Industry Group issued the warning in a submission to the Fair Work Commission calling for a freeze on the minimum wage, echoing economists\u2019 concerns that September looms as a cliff for $134bn of government supports. The employer group\u2019s intervention comes after Treasury revised its September unemployment forecast down to 8% and Labor continued to pursue the government over possible cuts to the $70bn jobkeeper package as a result of better-than-expected health results and the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. In question time in federal parliament, Scott Morrison revealed the government would respond to the Treasury review of jobkeeper \u2013 due by the end of June \u2013 by about the third week of July, after the Eden-Monaro byelection. On Wednesday, the Fair Work Commission held its final hearing in the annual minimum wage review, in which the Australian Council of Trade Unions has called for a $30-a-week increase in the minimum wage in part because of signs of an economic recovery as Covid-19 restrictions ease. The AiGroup emphatically rejected the view the economy is on the mend, citing the fact GDP is expected to fall by 8% in the second quarter, which would be \u201cmore than twice the size of the peak quarters of shrinkage in either the 1980s or 1990s recessions in Australia\u201d. The submission noted the government had given \u201cunprecedented levels of government financial support\u201d, including the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper payment and doubling jobseeker to $1,100 a fortnight.

O\u2019Neil told Guardian Australia the pandemic \u201chasn\u2019t treated everyone the same\u201d, because women were a higher proportion of the newly-unemployed and had lost more hours of work on average.

The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, asked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to confirm that in just three weeks since parliament last sat the government had admitted it overestimated coverage of its jobkeeper scheme by 3 million workers, announced it would repay $720m to victims of its robodebt Centrelink debt recovery scheme and Australia entered its first recession in three decades. \u201cIt is a recession, Mr Speaker, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Morrison said.

The industry is calling for a suite of federal measures, including an extension of the jobkeeper program beyond September, and its expansion to gig and contract workers who would otherwise not qualify; a $40m package for music industry recovery; a boost to Australia Council funding with $70m available across art forms; and tax reform for the live performance and recording sector.

      "body": "<p>Picture the scene: you walk into your favourite clothes store for the first time in three months, check your mask is covering your nose and mouth, and pump sanitiser into your hands. And then you spot it \u2013 the perfect gingham dress. Just the mood-boosting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/03/al-dressco-how-picnic-chic-became-the-look-of-the-summer\">picnic-appropriate</a> fillip your wardrobe needs, and it is just there, on the other side of the shop floor. But, instead of making a beeline for it, you have to take the long way round, following the one-way system marked out in arrow stickers on the floor, pausing when the shopper in front of you does in order to observe the two-metre-rule (the pandemic-era grandmother\u2019s footsteps that we have grown used to in the supermarket aisles). And then \u2013 disaster \u2013 the masked shopper in front of you reaches for your gingham dress and takes the last one in your size. Which means that, if she doesn\u2019t buy it, it will be headed for quarantine in the stock room, rather than back to the shop floor.</p> <p>From 15 June, clothes shops will be able to reopen in England, just a few days <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52925516\">after their counterparts in Northern Ireland</a>. The rest of the UK will eventually follow suit. Some people will have no interest in diving straight back into frenzied consumerism, what with the aforementioned frenzied consumerism being implicated in the rapid global spread of the coronavirus catastrophe. Some people will be constrained by financial circumstances. Some people may quite fancy a shopping trip just for a change of scene, but will still be trying to jigsaw together the jagged pieces of work and home-schooling children who are not back in the classroom.</p> <p>But reports from post-lockdown all over the world suggest that there is likely to be an appetite for a post-quarantine clothes splurge. A Herm\u00e8s boutique in Guangzhou <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/hermes-hauled-in-2-7-million-in-one-china-store-on-saturday-sources-1203559738/\">took the equivalent of \u00a32.1m</a> on its first Saturday after reopening, setting a record for a single day in a single boutique in China\u2019s retail history. Wherever Zara stores have opened their doors from Paris to Tunis, shoppers have formed long first-day queues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"739a1fe7194ab2452b6fa8ec8eac12c146c21a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/739a1fe7194ab2452b6fa8ec8eac12c146c21a6d/0_138_4125_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Hilfiger shop reopening in Azerbaijan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy Hilfiger shop reopening in Azerbaijan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aziz Karimov/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With pubs, cafes and restaurants yet to reopen, those who do go clothes-shopping next week will be guinea pigs for the new normal. They will be the first to assess the look and feel of the world of commercialised leisure time in which many of us used to spend our weekends.</p> <p>With warehouses of unsold summer stock to shift, retailers are at pains to do everything they can to make customers feel safe. Some of the basics will be universal. In-store numbers will be strictly limited, so expect queues outside.

      "bodyText": "Picture the scene: you walk into your favourite clothes store for the first time in three months, check your mask is covering your nose and mouth, and pump sanitiser into your hands. And then you spot it \u2013 the perfect gingham dress. Just the mood-boosting, picnic-appropriate fillip your wardrobe needs, and it is just there, on the other side of the shop floor. But, instead of making a beeline for it, you have to take the long way round, following the one-way system marked out in arrow stickers on the floor, pausing when the shopper in front of you does in order to observe the two-metre-rule (the pandemic-era grandmother\u2019s footsteps that we have grown used to in the supermarket aisles). And then \u2013 disaster \u2013 the masked shopper in front of you reaches for your gingham dress and takes the last one in your size. Which means that, if she doesn\u2019t buy it, it will be headed for quarantine in the stock room, rather than back to the shop floor. From 15 June, clothes shops will be able to reopen in England, just a few days after their counterparts in Northern Ireland. The rest of the UK will eventually follow suit. Some people will have no interest in diving straight back into frenzied consumerism, what with the aforementioned frenzied consumerism being implicated in the rapid global spread of the coronavirus catastrophe. Some people will be constrained by financial circumstances. Some people may quite fancy a shopping trip just for a change of scene, but will still be trying to jigsaw together the jagged pieces of work and home-schooling children who are not back in the classroom. But reports from post-lockdown all over the world suggest that there is likely to be an appetite for a post-quarantine clothes splurge. A Herm\u00e8s boutique in Guangzhou took the equivalent of \u00a32.1m on its first Saturday after reopening, setting a record for a single day in a single boutique in China\u2019s retail history. Wherever Zara stores have opened their doors from Paris to Tunis, shoppers have formed long first-day queues. With pubs, cafes and restaurants yet to reopen, those who do go clothes-shopping next week will be guinea pigs for the new normal. They will be the first to assess the look and feel of the world of commercialised leisure time in which many of us used to spend our weekends. With warehouses of unsold summer stock to shift, retailers are at pains to do everything they can to make customers feel safe. Some of the basics will be universal. In-store numbers will be strictly limited, so expect queues outside. Stores with more than one door may operate separate entrances and exits to avoid face-to-face contact at these points. Masks will be worn by staff, and shoppers will be encouraged to follow suit. Contactless payment will be encouraged (expect a push on Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, which are not usually subject to the \u00a345 limit) and sanitiser pumps stationed by each cash desk. Only household members can shop together, and lift occupancy will be limited to one person or those from one household. Lots of things will vary between stores, however. In the first wave, many will open only those branches whose customer base can travel by foot, bike or car. John Lewis will keep changing rooms closed for now, but Reiss and Gap will open some, with rigorous sanitising between customers. Jewellery and watches will be particularly challenging to try on, as the virus can live on metal for much longer than on fabric. Most stores have extended their returns policy to encourage shoppers to try clothes on at home; John Lewis is considering installing \u201cdrop boxes\u201d at store entry points, so that returns need not add to in-store footfall.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s failure to plan to get children back to school safely is \u201cabsolutely astonishing\u201d and must be remedied before September, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools in England, has said. Wilshaw, who led Ofsted from 2012 until 2016, said schools will need to put in place recovery programmes, appeal to teachers to run catch-up classes over the summer and even allow some of the most affected to repeat their school year. The government has been criticised by MPs from all parties and unions for lacking a coherent plan, after announcing that primary schools in England would return in June before backtracking this week. There is particular annoyance after ministers revealed that zoos, theme parks and outdoor cinemas would be able to open shortly \u2013 on the same day as confirming that not all primary schools could get back to operation before the end of the summer term. Wilshaw said it was a sign the government had failed to consult schools about what was feasible in terms of educating children while sticking to physical distancing guidelines of keeping them in bubbles of 15. \u201cI find it absolutely astonishing that an announcement could be made by the PM that all primary schools would open in June without effective consultation with professional associations and particularly headteachers who would have said this is impossible under the social distancing arrangements you are insisting upon,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt just smacks of poor organisation and No 10 saying something and the DfE [Department for Education] not being properly consulted. The government needs to get its act together \u2026 and make sure there is proper planning for September when both primary and secondary schools come back.\u201d He said it would be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d for schools to put in place recovery programmes to help youngsters catch up on at least a term of missed learning. \u201cI would be appealing to staff to come in over the summer holidays and take catch-up classes with those youngsters who need it,\u201d he said, adding that schools should be looking at their budgets to see if they can afford to pay staff for extra teaching. Nadhim Zahawi, a business minister, struggled to explain the government\u2019s policy of reopening the economy but not schools, acknowledging that \u201ctough decisions\u201d had been taken. Speaking on the same programme, he said 80% of schools remained open specifically to help vulnerable children and those of key workers but opening more widely had been dictated by the science that \u201csays that in indoor spaces 15 children is the number you could educate safely\u201d. \u201cThe whole focus has been making sure the most vulnerable children get to go to school,\u201d said. \u201cOf course these are tough decisions. Of course we want to get all the iPads and laptops out to all the children that need them \u2026 We are doing this as quickly as we can.\u201d Wilshaw also accused some of the government\u2019s critics of initially saying it was moving too fast to open schools, before pivoting to criticise ministers for not going far enough.",

And it\u2019s and there\u2019s a continuing pattern.</p> <p>There\u2019s a systemic pattern here which I appeal to the government, and this new system that the ministers believe is going to find the answers to it, this federation reform council, that this group of people actually look at the systemic approaches that take place where First Nations people are likely to come to the attention of police.</p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police are likely to be arrested and charged. </p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police will be charged but will also be sent to court. And when they go to court, what happens, they\u2019ll be sent to jail. Now this is a pattern. This is a paradigm, that systematic, it\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s institutionalised. </p> <p>And if you look at this, from a First Nations point of view, this is about the subjugation of the First Nations people. </p> <p>This is not about enlightened policy. This is about subjugating the First Nations people, you correlate that to the number of people who are being taken away, the number of kids, there will be 30,000 kids in their home care. </p> <p>And you\u2019ll come up with a \u2018it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s complicated. And you know, it\u2019s really difficult.\u2019</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not. Address the underlying issues \u2013 health, housing, education, employment \u2013 and work with First Nations peoples through the Coag system, or through the new system of the reform council, whatever it is, to actually set some targets as senator Wong has said, around the scenes for incarceration rates, and for the diminishment of removing kids from custody, or being removed from their homes and put into custody of another family, which ultimately will lead to the adoption out of these kids. </p> <p>And I\u2019ll remind the government that the Bring Them Home report re-analyse the policies and practices that pertain to that, practices as heinous practices, bordered on genocide, bordered on genocide. </p> <p>So I agree, I asked you sincerely to make this a priority, a top priority for too long \u2013 nice words, good intentions, but the lack of action and commitment has not seen a reduction of deaths in custody. </p> <p>It\u2019s seen an escalation in the social indicators that diminish First Nations people and diminish us as a nation because we are incapable of dealing with it. </p> <p>So I ask the government to sincerely put the best intentions into its commitments, and enter in a real working commitment with the First Nations peoples, and get real agreements with the states, and stop pussyfooting around with the states, say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility\u2019. </p> <p>Well, we know this.

As I said before, racism has no place in Australia, and we condemn it and call it out wherever we can.</p> <p>And the type of division that we\u2019ve seen in the US has been distressing and the fact that you have circumstances where black communities feel that they cannot live in an environment of safety \u2013 the fact that equally you now have circumstances where police, most of whom in the United States would still be good, law-abiding citizens, feel that they are being vilified, is creating a terrible circumstance there and I hope the US can find a way to come together and more successfully address these issues, and I don\u2019t want to see that sort of division brought at all into the Australian political debate.</p> <p>... Well, look, as I say, I\u2019m not surprised, but I am saddened and disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t engage in that type of vilification. His record can speak for itself, but equally, more importantly now, as we look to the future, the acts surrounding his death, I think, speak to an injustice that needs to be addressed in terms of that incident by the US legal system, but more broadly, an injustice that, as we\u2019ve seen, tragically in the US, the rates of deaths around Covid-19 have been disproportionately borne in communities \u2013 often black American communities. </p> <p>Thankfully in Australia, we have a much fairer system, a universal healthcare system, we are able to tackle many of these issues \u2013 not to the point of perfection. The job is never done in terms of stamping out racism, or driving towards creating the best environment for equality and opportunity for individuals. </p> <p>We have to be ever-vigilant and keep working there. But I think we have been saying that our system, in all of those areas, holds up amongst the best in the world, and much better than some of the challenging circumstances we\u2019ve seen in the US.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:49:47.451Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee07ea38f08beee219d88db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:33:32.208Z\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australian year 12 students will receive their final results in the second half of December.</p> <p>A meeting of education ministers from across the country has decided the release of individual Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) results, for students completing year 12 in 2020, would occur \u201cwithin a nationally consistent window of 15 December to 31 December 2020\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement issued this afternoon, the group \u2013 known as the Education Council \u2013 said it recognised the challenges being year 12 students and their families were experiencing as the pandemic had disrupted their final year of schooling.</p> <p>It also \u201cacknowledged the seriousness of these concerns and agreed that year 12 students and their families must be supported and have reliable information to pursue their post-school pathways\u201d.</p> <p>A working group \u2013 which includes Universities Australia, the Australasian Curriculum, Assessment and Certification Authorities, and the Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres \u2013 had advised students who wish to enter university in 2021 to \u201cwork hard and complete the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education\u201d.</p> <p>The Education Council also decided on a nationally consistent set of messages for all year 12 students to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion about the admissions processes for 2021. </p> <p>These key messages include:</p> <ul> <li>Current year 12 students will be able to complete a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (SSCE) this year.

The member for Rankin in phrasing that question in that way has demonstrated, I think, a great deal of immaturity.</p> <p>The introduction of the jobkeeper program, the single largest form of social support this country has ever seen, in the most uncertain economic environment anyone could possibly imagine of our generation ... and Mr Speaker ... and rolled out in considerably rapid time and as we have achieved a level of economic outcome well in advance of what we had expected to achieve by this time. </p> <p>And having announced the fact that we would look carefully at the implementation when we announced the jobkeeper program before announcing any revisions that might be necessary, Mr Speaker. These are not things that can be done, Mr Speaker, in a rushed or ill-considered manner.</p> <p>The review is being undertaken in June. The review will make recommendations, I would imagine, to the government, as would be its purpose, and then the government would consider those recommendations. It would consider the fiscal implications of those recommendations and, Mr Speaker, it would take advice on that as cabinet\u2019s work. </p> <p>Now, I appreciate the member who asked the question has never served in a cabinet, Mr Speaker, let alone an expenditure review committee or had any sort of ministerial responsibility for working through such decisions of great importance.</p> <p>But he might be educated on this point. That when you make decisions of this gravity and this seriousness, Mr Speaker, in a situation like this, you are very careful about it.</p> <p>So as the government announced, we will make the decisions on the basis of the view that\u2019s been submitted by Treasury and that will be done in the third week or thereabouts of July, as is our anticipated timeframe, to provide that further economic statement that will take into account the review that is being done of the jobkeeper program. </p> <p>Now, that is the proper, responsible way to manage important financial decisions.

To sum up today\u2019s events: Parliament returned with Labor focusing on the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis, the $60bn jobkeeper mistake and the robodebt scandal. During question time, the government services minister, Stuart Robert, would not answer questions from Labor about when the government first became aware its robodebt scheme was illegal. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, told the parliament \u201cit\u2019s a recession, no doubt about it\u201d after questions from the opposition about the government\u2019s economic response to the pandemic. The Labor senator Pat Dodson used a speech to highlight Australia\u2019s failure to act on Indigenous deaths in custody. He said that for too long there had been good words and intentions from governments but no action and commitment. Tina Arena, Jimmy Barnes and Jessica Mauboy were among more than 1,000 artists, venues and festivals to call for an immediate rescue package for the music sector. The multicultural affairs minister, Alan Tudge, cited Masterchef as proof of Australia\u2019s diversity. Thanks for joining us. We\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow. Just as the parliamentary day was beginning to wind down, there was some late action in the Senate. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick moved a motion to establish a Senate committee inquiry into Australia\u2019s relations with China. The motion didn\u2019t succeed, but it won support from the Greens, all of the Senate crossbench and one government senator, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. Patrick was delighted with the government recruit. Just in case we were inclined to nod off, or flip over to monitor the television news, Patrick took to Twitter to give thanks for CFW\u2019s first floor crossing in 15 years. Fierravanti-Wells, the conservative from New South Wales, is one of the government\u2019s China hawks. She\u2019s outspoken, but she doesn\u2019t run with the pack known as the Wolverines. If you want to know more about the government\u2019s China factions, I wrote a column about this recently. The Wolverines voted along party lines. Dozens of scientific papers co-authored by the chief executive of the US tech company behind the Lancet hydroxychloroquine study scandal are now being audited, including one that a scientific integrity expert claims contains images that appear to have been digitally manipulated. My colleagues Melissa Davey and Stephanie Kirchgaessner report the latest developments following their investigative work on the Surgisphere scandal. Parliament is starting to wind down so I will hand you over to Lisa Cox, who will take you through any evening developments. Thank you so much for joining us as the parliament returned, as usual. We will be back from early tomorrow morning for the second day of the sitting, which this week comes with the rare Friday sitting day, so strap in for that. Take care of you. Ben Butler has the latest on the Virgin issue: The administrators of Virgin Australia are asking the Morrison government for financial help, warning that a lack of taxpayer support is putting the sale of the stricken airline at risk. In a letter sent to senior ministers, including the prime minister, on Tuesday afternoon, the administrators \u2013 partners at accounting firm Deloitte \u2013 asked for measures to help Virgin Australia through both an immediate cash crisis and a longer period during which flying is expected to continue to be restricted. They said the sale of the airline was in the balance unless the government provided clarity and certainty about its financial future. Virgin Australia faces a cash crisis and is due to run out of cash by the end of the month, but any sale needs to be approved by creditors who could meet as late as August. With air travel likely to remain heavily restricted for months, it also faces difficult conditions even if administrators, led by Vaughan Strawbridge, can successfully sell the airline to one of the two remaining bidders, Bain Capital or Cyrus Capital Partners. And for those who missed the latest Pauline Hanson grab for attention, she has posted it herself. (But no doubt she\u2019ll be happy to discuss it in the media for the end of time, while also talking about how no one is allowed to say it.) The Greens senator Dr Mehreen Faruqi spoke in the Senate about why she attended a Black Lives Matter protest. Pat Dodson has spoken in the Senate on the issue of Indigenous deaths in custody: Thirty years ago, the royal commission that I was part of made recommendations to the parliament \u2013 339 recommendations. That commission had been set up by the government and at that time there were 99 deaths that we were concerned about in this nation to effect a national royal commission. Now we have got over 400 deaths since that royal commission, and we have 30 years that have passed that have not addressed the underlying issues that give rise to people being taken into custody and consequently die in custody. So the social factors of health, housing, education, employment, and the legal factors surrounding those, have not been addressed in a manner to relieve this awful blight on this nation\u2019s history. And it\u2019s and there\u2019s a continuing pattern. There\u2019s a systemic pattern here which I appeal to the government, and this new system that the ministers believe is going to find the answers to it, this federation reform council, that this group of people actually look at the systemic approaches that take place where First Nations people are likely to come to the attention of police. We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police are likely to be arrested and charged. We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police will be charged but will also be sent to court. And when they go to court, what happens, they\u2019ll be sent to jail. Now this is a pattern. This is a paradigm, that systematic, it\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s institutionalised. And if you look at this, from a First Nations point of view, this is about the subjugation of the First Nations people. This is not about enlightened policy. This is about subjugating the First Nations people, you correlate that to the number of people who are being taken away, the number of kids, there will be 30,000 kids in their home care. And you\u2019ll come up with a \u2018it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s complicated. And you know, it\u2019s really difficult.\u2019 Well, it\u2019s not. Address the underlying issues \u2013 health, housing, education, employment \u2013 and work with First Nations peoples through the Coag system, or through the new system of the reform council, whatever it is, to actually set some targets as senator Wong has said, around the scenes for incarceration rates, and for the diminishment of removing kids from custody, or being removed from their homes and put into custody of another family, which ultimately will lead to the adoption out of these kids. And I\u2019ll remind the government that the Bring Them Home report re-analyse the policies and practices that pertain to that, practices as heinous practices, bordered on genocide, bordered on genocide. So I agree, I asked you sincerely to make this a priority, a top priority for too long \u2013 nice words, good intentions, but the lack of action and commitment has not seen a reduction of deaths in custody. It\u2019s seen an escalation in the social indicators that diminish First Nations people and diminish us as a nation because we are incapable of dealing with it. So I ask the government to sincerely put the best intentions into its commitments, and enter in a real working commitment with the First Nations peoples, and get real agreements with the states, and stop pussyfooting around with the states, say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility\u2019. Well, we know this. You\u2019re incapable of finding ways of dealing with this. Now\u2019s the time to stop the rot of First Nations dying in custody, being over-imprisoned and their children being put into a home. Tony Burke\u2019s answer to that same question: Her politics feeds on outrage. It effectively \u2013 for all the talk of proud nationalism, that party has imported an American style of politics here. I don\u2019t want that style of politics here. I don\u2019t particularly want to join the outrage, because that in fact elevates what she said. I would simply refer to it in the way that I guess One Nation wouldn\u2019t want it referred to \u2013 that is importing foreign politics into Australia. We should be better than that. And most of us are. Patricia Karvelas asks this question of both Simon Birmingham and Tony Burke: Pauline Hanson has called George Floyd \u201ca dangerous thug who should not be made a martyr\u201d, the One Nation leader angry that his death sparked protests when the death of an Australian woman didn\u2019t spark the same protests. Her quote is: \u201cIt sickened me to see people holding up signs saying Black Lives Matter in memory of this American criminal.\u201d Are you shocked by that language? Birmingham: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m shocked, sadly, but I am saddened by anybody who wants to bring the type of division that we\u2019ve seen in the United States to Australia. As I said before, racism has no place in Australia, and we condemn it and call it out wherever we can. And the type of division that we\u2019ve seen in the US has been distressing and the fact that you have circumstances where black communities feel that they cannot live in an environment of safety \u2013 the fact that equally you now have circumstances where police, most of whom in the United States would still be good, law-abiding citizens, feel that they are being vilified, is creating a terrible circumstance there and I hope the US can find a way to come together and more successfully address these issues, and I don\u2019t want to see that sort of division brought at all into the Australian political debate. ... Well, look, as I say, I\u2019m not surprised, but I am saddened and disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t engage in that type of vilification. His record can speak for itself, but equally, more importantly now, as we look to the future, the acts surrounding his death, I think, speak to an injustice that needs to be addressed in terms of that incident by the US legal system, but more broadly, an injustice that, as we\u2019ve seen, tragically in the US, the rates of deaths around Covid-19 have been disproportionately borne in communities \u2013 often black American communities. Thankfully in Australia, we have a much fairer system, a universal healthcare system, we are able to tackle many of these issues \u2013 not to the point of perfection. The job is never done in terms of stamping out racism, or driving towards creating the best environment for equality and opportunity for individuals. We have to be ever-vigilant and keep working there. But I think we have been saying that our system, in all of those areas, holds up amongst the best in the world, and much better than some of the challenging circumstances we\u2019ve seen in the US. Australian year 12 students will receive their final results in the second half of December. A meeting of education ministers from across the country has decided the release of individual Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) results, for students completing year 12 in 2020, would occur \u201cwithin a nationally consistent window of 15 December to 31 December 2020\u201d. In a statement issued this afternoon, the group \u2013 known as the Education Council \u2013 said it recognised the challenges being year 12 students and their families were experiencing as the pandemic had disrupted their final year of schooling. It also \u201cacknowledged the seriousness of these concerns and agreed that year 12 students and their families must be supported and have reliable information to pursue their post-school pathways\u201d. A working group \u2013 which includes Universities Australia, the Australasian Curriculum, Assessment and Certification Authorities, and the Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres \u2013 had advised students who wish to enter university in 2021 to \u201cwork hard and complete the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education\u201d. The Education Council also decided on a nationally consistent set of messages for all year 12 students to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion about the admissions processes for 2021. These key messages include: Current year 12 students will be able to complete a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (SSCE) this year. States and territories are putting arrangements in place to take account of disadvantage faced by this year\u2019s student cohort due to Covid-19, while ensuring the integrity of the assessment process. Students should continue learning and finish their year 12 studies to the best of their ability to ensure they gain the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully transition to university study, other post-school education options, or work in 2021. Students completing the SSCE in each state and territory, and meeting Atar eligibility requirements in 2020 will receive an Atar. States and territories have worked closely with schools and tertiary admissions centres to ensure that the disruption of the 2020 school year does not impact the validity of the Atar. The Atar remains an accurate ranking of year 12 student results for university entry. Students will be able to use their Atar to apply for university admission in 2021 as is the normal practice. Universities understand that 2020 will be a challenging year for year 12 students and that students may be concerned. Universities have a range of entry pathways available every year for students. In 2021, universities will continue to use the Atar and existing alternative pathways alongside the Atar to facilitate access to university. Students should check individual university websites, consult with their state or territory Tertiary Admission Centre, or go to the Course Seeker website (www.courseseeker.edu.au) for the most up-to-date admissions information. Simon Birmingham is on Patricia Karvelas on the ABC. Asked about a Pacific travel bubble, he says: I wouldn\u2019t go into specific correspondence but there are certainly discussions that I know have occurred with various Pacific Island countries. We\u2019ve been in close contact with them right throughout the whole management of Covid-19. We recognise a very special responsibility to our Pacific family in terms of assisting them and working with them through these sorts of issues. Now, it\u2019s important that in all of the types of steps of opening up, we do so in a way that maintains the success of suppressing Covid, not just in Australia, but also in New Zealand and, if it got to the point of looking at Pacific countries as well, then being very mindful of our responsibility in helping them to avoid the type of devastation we\u2019ve seen in a health sense elsewhere, that we manage such circumstances very carefully with them as well. To be entirely fair, the rich still got off the Titanic first. Tony Burke is trying to see if he can get Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison to apologise for making what he says are false statements to the House, as both, on multiple occasions, said there were \u20186 million Australians\u2019 receiving jobkeeper payments, in answer to questions from Labor. As we now know, because of an \u2018estimates variation\u2019 there are not 6 million Australians who are being supported by jobkeeper. Tony Smith says Labor can ask about it on question time, as he doesn\u2019t have a role in deciding whether or not statements are factual. Question time ends. Because this day will never end, Anthony Albanese summons Angus Taylor to his feet, asking him about the fuel supply he made a lot of fanfare about securing during the bottoming out of fuel prices not so long ago. We bought about five days\u2019 supply for just under $100m. It\u2019s being kept overseas though, because it makes total sense to hold your strategic fuel reserve \u2013 which is called a strategic fuel reserve, just in case shipping routes are cut and you can\u2019t get your fuel \u2013 in a country that is not your own. Some from Taylor: Now we have taken the opportunity of record low prices in fuels \u2013 record low prices for liquid fuels \u2013 to purchase $94m worth of stocks to ensure that we have the liquid fuel security we need to keep this country strong and, Mr Speaker, because there is almost no storage left in the world \u2013 almost no storage left in the world \u2013 the right place to store it for now is the United States, but we are committed to ensure that there is local storage available in Australia to make sure that those truckies, those tradies, those farmers, those manufacturers have the supplies they need. Now, Mr Speaker, it is also crucial that we have a strong refining sector in this country to support our fuel security and we are working closely with our fuel refineries at a difficult time for them, a difficult time for them, working closely as well with the unions at a difficult time to ensure that we do have those fuel stocks we need in Australia. We are still going, because it is time for HOW SAFE ARE YOU, with Peter Dutton. Catherine King to Scott Morrison: Has the government received advice from Virgin\u2019s administrator that bidders for the airline are expected to pull out if the government keeps its hard September deadline for jobkeeper? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I\u2019ll asked the deputy prime minister to add to the answer. The government wants to see two viable airlines in Australia serving the Australian travelling public. And, Mr Speaker, we have taken a very consistent approach, which has seen through administration the identification of very serious proposals that are able to come forward that will enable that to become possible and we will continue to engage with the administrator throughout the course of their coverage of these issues to achieve those ends. But I would say one thing in particular right now, if we\u2019re concerned about Virgin employees, and that is it is very important that we open up the domestic borders in this country. We need to get planes flying around Australia and if you want to see planes flying around Australia, Mr Speaker, we need to open up these domestic borders. Mr Speaker, that will, and I agree, that occurs for South Australia, for Tasmania, for Queensland and Western Australia. This isn\u2019t a partisan issue. This is about, Mr Speaker, ensuring that our economies can open up and I have made this point consistently. That it is in Virgin\u2019s interests, it is in Qantas\u2019s interests, it\u2019s in the aviation sector\u2019s interest that we move to opening up travel in Australia as soon as possible. The three-step process ensures that is intended to be completed in July and we look forward to that being completed in July, and I would be hoping that at the earliest possible opportunity states will be able to indicate the date in July that that interstate travel will be open again to be able to give that certainty. I\u2019ll ask the deputy prime minister to add. That sound you hear is the entire parliament saying \u2018please don\u2019t\u2019. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert has asked if the government is ashamed that at least 437 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since the 1991 royal commission. Anne Ruston replied: Unquestionably we have made it very, very clear we want to work with states and territories, which are responsible for the justice system, to deliver better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. In a follow-up, Siewert asked why it is up to Guardian Australia to track Indigenous deaths in custody, why doesn\u2019t the federal government do it? There were a few scoffs from the Coalition senators \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what point they were trying to make. Were the deaths not real because it was Guardian Australia that reported them? I am genuinely mystified. Ruston then read out an answer from her question time brief that didn\u2019t really engage with the question. Instead, she noted as part of Closing the Gap targets the federal government has offered to fund a \u201ccustody notification scheme\u201d, which seems to be a system that gives notice to services that might assist Indigenous Australians once they\u2019re taken into custody. So: no answer as to why the commonwealth doesn\u2019t count deaths in custody. Paul Fletcher is now standing up and talking about the government\u2019s support for the creative arts and the media on a day that Australia\u2019s most famous musicians have sent out an open letter calling for support for forgotten arts workers, and News Corp has announced more redundancies and the ABC announced hundreds of job cuts, because of funding cuts. Ed Husic has a question for Paul Fletcher, who seems a little cranky, possibly because he was just owned on Twitter by someone he had named as benefiting from cutting community TV. Husic: Why has the prime minister and his government used the cover of a pandemic to increase Australia Post delivery times and put the jobs of postal workers at risk? Fletcher: I do thank the member for his question, former union official for that question, because the facts are, Mr Speaker, that when Australia Post came to the government and ... Anthony Albanese: Yes, point of order. I thought there was a love-in between unions and business. Tim Wilson just delivered a dixer in the style of someone who has been studying Vince Connelly, who himself delivers dixer questions in the style of someone who has been studying humanity from behind at least six glass walls, but never actually interacted with a human. Anthony Albanese asks about extending jobkeeper, mentioning the dnata employees who miss out on the program. Scott Morrison responds with something along the lines of well, they get Centrelink, so they are being supported. Morrison: That suite of economic supports has included the additional payments we have made to those on welfare payments and that was done back in April. There\u2019ll be another one of those in July. He makes no acknowledgement of the cashflow assistance of up to $100,000 for businesses that is there to support wages. He gives no acknowledgement also of the doubling of the jobseeker payments that have been provided to provide the ultimate safety net to Australians right across the Australian economy and, of course, there\u2019s the many other measures \u2013 the treasurer mentions the instant asset write-off and there are many and included in jobkeeper. In the design of jobkeeper we ensured it covered a wide spectrum of the Australian public for full-time employees, part-time employees and partial equivalents, long-term casuals working for employers, but we said we were not going to cover the bills of state governments and their responsibilities. We were not going to cover the bills of local governments and we were not going to cover the bills of foreign governments and that is the principle on which we established the jobkeeper program. And for those workers, Mr Speaker, who find themselves in need of support, then they can access the jobseeker program. What I will not do, Mr Speaker, is I will not join with the opposition in seeking to demonise as a program to support workers who lose their jobs. Scott Morrison has sent out this release (further to Paul\u2019s update from the Senate): Ordinary Seaman Edward \u2018Teddy\u2019 Sheean was an extraordinary Australian and Australia will remain eternally grateful for his service, dedication and sacrifice. Overturning a decision relating to a Victoria Cross nearly 80 years after Sheean\u2019s heroic actions in 1942 would need compelling reasons. That is why the Government\u2019s view and clear policy is that consideration of the awarding of a retrospective Victoria Cross would only occur in light of compelling new evidence or if there was evidence of significant maladministration. Given there are different views on whether there is compelling new evidence about Sheean\u2019s actions in 1942, I have today commissioned an expert panel to provide me with advice as to whether the 2019 review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal had any significant new evidence, not available to the previous reviews and otherwise available, that is compelling enough to support a recommendation by the Government that Sheean\u2019s Mention in Despatches be replaced by a Victoria Cross. The expert panel will be chaired by former Minister for Defence and former Director of the Australia War Memorial, the Hon Dr Brendan Nelson AO, and will also comprise former Solicitor-General, Mr David Bennett AC QC, former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Peter Shergold AC, and Senior Curator and Historian at the NSW Anzac Memorial, Mr Brad Manera. The panel will report to me by 31 July 2020. The Victoria Cross for Australia is our pre-eminent Australian gallantry decoration. The Government will always uphold the integrity of the Victoria Cross and everything that it stands for. The evidentiary standards for recommending the award of the Victoria Cross always have been, and always will be, the highest. This is even more so in the case of consideration of a potential historic award, where compelling new evidence must be identified. The Government will continue to apply this very high standard. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: The prime minister won\u2019t reveal the results of his jobkeeper review until the end of July despite receiving the review in June. Can the prime minister confirm he will delay the release of his plan to leave even more Australians behind until after the Eden-Monaro byelection? Morrison: Thank you. The member for Rankin in phrasing that question in that way has demonstrated, I think, a great deal of immaturity. The introduction of the jobkeeper program, the single largest form of social support this country has ever seen, in the most uncertain economic environment anyone could possibly imagine of our generation ... and Mr Speaker ... and rolled out in considerably rapid time and as we have achieved a level of economic outcome well in advance of what we had expected to achieve by this time. And having announced the fact that we would look carefully at the implementation when we announced the jobkeeper program before announcing any revisions that might be necessary, Mr Speaker. These are not things that can be done, Mr Speaker, in a rushed or ill-considered manner. The review is being undertaken in June. The review will make recommendations, I would imagine, to the government, as would be its purpose, and then the government would consider those recommendations. It would consider the fiscal implications of those recommendations and, Mr Speaker, it would take advice on that as cabinet\u2019s work. Now, I appreciate the member who asked the question has never served in a cabinet, Mr Speaker, let alone an expenditure review committee or had any sort of ministerial responsibility for working through such decisions of great importance. But he might be educated on this point. That when you make decisions of this gravity and this seriousness, Mr Speaker, in a situation like this, you are very careful about it. So as the government announced, we will make the decisions on the basis of the view that\u2019s been submitted by Treasury and that will be done in the third week or thereabouts of July, as is our anticipated timeframe, to provide that further economic statement that will take into account the review that is being done of the jobkeeper program. Now, that is the proper, responsible way to manage important financial decisions. Now, I understand the Labor party can only see things through a political prism, Mr Speaker. But the government is focused on the economic wellbeing of the country at a time of great crisis. Paul Fletcher, or his team, might need to make a phone call ... In responding to Rebekha Sharkie about not renewing a community TV grant, Fletcher mentioned Natalie Tran\u2019s YouTube channel (which hasn\u2019t been updated in a bit) and, well, Tran has some things to say. Amanda Rishworth to Scott Morrison: The Prime Minister said on Friday the six months provision of JobKeeper has been set out in legislation and people can count on that. Why did the Prime Minister break his promise three days later by cutting JobKeeper support for 120,000 early childhood educators? Morrison: The JobKeeper legislation does remain in place until the end of September.But where there is a better way to do things we won\u2019t step aside from doing them in a better way. As the member would know, Mr Speaker that...when we put the new arrangements for childcare in place during the worst parts of this crisis, we were very clear that that would not be a permanent arrangement, that it would be a temporary arrangements and that we would be... The answer continues, but it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere and the Tveeder transcription service somehow managed to throw Boko Haram in there, so best just to leave it. Jason Clare to Josh Frydenberg: I refer to the homebuilder scheme. How many Australians does the government expect to spend more than $150,000 on a renovation before the end of this year? Frydenberg: Around 7,000 substantial rebuilds is our estimate. Rebekha Sharkie to Paul Fletcher: My question is to the minister for communications. Minister, I understand that in just 20 days\u2019 time Adelaide\u2019s television broadcaster channel 44, our community television station, will be set to be switched off when the free-to-air broadcasting licence is not renewed. The station\u2019s a training ground for South Australian television and provides a valuable local content for many who do not have access to the internet, particularly older South Australians. Given that the government is yet to announce an alternative use for this broadcast spectrum, will you please allow this station to keep operating by extending their free-to-air licence? Fletcher: I do thank the member for her question. Since 2014, it\u2019s been the policy of this government that the radio frequency spectrum that was historically made available to community stations in our five largest cities should be put to alternative uses, and we have supported our community television to transition to delivering its content online. Community television will continue to have an important future, will continue to be a place where members of the community can make television content, but there is the capacity to generate and disseminate that content online. Already the community, the spectrum that was being used for community television in Sydney, in Brisbane and in Perth is no longer being used for that purpose, and our government has provided funding to community television to make this transition both in 2019 and more recently in December to support the transition online. [When] We look at where some of the best Australian new talent is developing today, it\u2019s people who are producing content online, disseminating it for example through YouTube. ... The community channel run by Natalie Tran with 1.3 million subscribers.* So we know that people can be very successful in generating original, creative content and disseminating it online and that\u2019s certainly where we want to see community television \u2013 we provided funding for that and that\u2019s been the government\u2019s policy that we\u2019ve committed to and we\u2019ve been implementing since 2014. As my colleague Matilda Boseley points out, Natalie hasn\u2019t posted to that channel in three years. This was at the end of a dixer \u2013 seems like some polls do matter, at least in terms of confidence. Bill Shorten: When did the government become aware that its robodebt scheme was illegal? Stuart Robert: And I thank the member for his question. As the member knows on 19 November last year I did a press conference to indicate that we were pausing all recoveries for debts raised by income averaging. ... The attorney general also made clear on the Insiders interview that income averaging is a long-standing practice of governments going back decades. So I went and checked over the weekend to see exactly how far income averaging went back again. I asked the department to do a random sample of 500 debts raised. Tony Smith: If he could just pause for a second. Unlike the last question, this was one question, not two or three, I think there were three last time. And it was a specific question. And so whilst he\u2019s entitled to have a preamble, the preamble cannot be the answer. And I\u2019d just ask him to direct himself to the question. Robert: As I said, as I announced to the public on 19 November that we would be pausing all recovery of debts that were raised either solely or partially by income averaging. And to see how far the practice went back to understand the government\u2019s consistent practice as to what they believed was sufficient. A random sample was undertaken and surprise, surprise, 16% of all debts in 2016 were raised ... Smith: Sorry. I\u2019ll just say to the minister, the question was very specific. I have enabled him to have a preamble. He\u2019s addressing the policy topic but he\u2019s not being directly relevant to the question that was asked. It was a very specific question. He can\u2019t seek to answer a question he wasn\u2019t asked so I just say to the minister to bring himself back to the question. Robert: I have finished. This entire answer was an absolute masterclass in WTF. Merit people, merit. Breaking out of question time once again \u2013 News Corp has announced more job cuts. This is not to be celebrated. The shrinking of media is not cause for celebration, no matter how much you may hate some talking heads. I can tell you, they won\u2019t be touched by this. It will be the journalists who work hard to just tell stories beyond the headline. After announcing the closure of more than 100 regional and community newspapers, the company has now announced job cuts in these metros: Herald Sun: 11 Adelaide Advertiser: 15 Courier Mail: 15 Daily Telegraph: 11 Hobart Mercury: 1 The Australian: 13 Labor has started Senate question time with a volley of questions to Mathias Cormann about new justice targets to be added to the Closing the Gap initiative to fix Indigenous disadvantage. The third supplementary asked whether Scott Morrison accepts he must lead the process rather than leave the issue to run on divisive commentary from senior ministers \u2013 a reference to Cormann\u2019s own comments condemning Black Lives Matter rallies. Cormann snapped back defending his earlier remarks: \u201cHowever legitimate the cause ... in the context of the pandemic it absolutely was reckless and irresponsible to conduct a mass protest at this time.\u201d In interjections, Penny Wong accused Cormann of \u201cdividing the country\u201d. Michael McCormack is talking. Something-something-cliche-cliche. There was probably more, but there is a stain on the carpet that looks like a sock puppet, so I got distracted. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister apologise to Australians targeted by the illegal robodebt scheme? Can he confirm that this is a scheme that he both created and announced on 28 June 2016. Morrison: As the leader of the opposition would be aware, the matters that he referred to are still being pursued through legal processes. But let me say this. The matter upon which the government has made a policy decision is on the basis that income averaging, a practice that was implemented by the Labor party in government, embraced by the Labor party as part of their debt recovery mechanisms ... It was the issue of income averaging, Mr Speaker, that could not be relied on solely in order to raise debts in relation to social security matters. Now, that is the matter, Mr Speaker. That is the actual matter. It is a policy and it is a principle ... that was embraced by the Labor party, that has been followed by this government and, Mr Speaker, where the circumstances have now presented that that income averaging is not something that could be relied upon solely, then the government has made it right. And that is what we should have done and that is what we are doing and that is, Mr Speaker, setting that matter aright. I would simply ask, Mr Speaker, given the Labor party have raised this, do they now believe that they did the wrong thing when they used income averaging? A policy, Mr Speaker, that they used? Mr Speaker, that was their policy. We continued that policy. This has nothing to do, Mr Speaker, with the issues of technology. Or how technology is used to do this, Mr Speaker. It is based on the principle of income averaging, something Labor embraced and now, for political purposes, once again seeks to reject. So, that\u2019s a no to the apology then. Also \u2013 Labor still had a human element to its policy. Scott Morrison: I can confirm that Australia has done incredibly well in dealing with one of the biggest challenges this country has faced, if not the biggest, since the second world war. I can confirm, Mr Speaker, that the government\u2019s focus each and every day is ensuring that we continue, Mr Speaker, to meet the needs of Australians and address the needs of Australians as we work through this difficult crisis. Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition makes reference to the national accounts. And it is indeed true that we had a negative quarter in March, Mr Speaker of 0.3%, and based on the estimates of the Treasury and that they have provided to us, then the June quarter is also likely to be negative and that of course means a technical recession. That is true. It is a recession, Mr Speaker, there\u2019s no doubt about that. And I don\u2019t think there is an Australian in this country, Mr Speaker, who doesn\u2019t understand the reason why. But only those opposite, Mr Speaker, would take joy in this fact and seek to use it for political purposes. [Labor gets very loud at this] Because what we have seen from this opposition is not a contribution but just constant whining, Mr Speaker, undermining the government at every turn as the government has sought to provide the support that Australians need. What we have seen from this opposition, disappointingly, is seeking to even undermine measures that they supported. The test during this crisis and the government is providing the leadership and support that Australians need. The opposition is failing. The House starts with a moment of silence for Bruce Reid, the former Liberal MP for the seat of Bendigo. And then we are into it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that in just the three weeks since parliament last sat the government admitted it overestimated coverage of its jobkeeper scheme by 3 million workers, resulting in a $60bn blunder, the government announced $720m will be repaid to victims of the prime minister\u2019s illegal robodebt scheme and Australia entered its first recession in three decades. It is time for who is that MP? And it\u2019s Damian Drum. Now it is Amanda Rishworth. Good Lizzo. It is almost question time. Take this time to grab things which make you happy. Victoria now has 21 people who have tested positive for coronavirus agree to let the state\u2019s health department download data from the Covidsafe app, but as yet no close contacts the department didn\u2019t already know about through existing contact tracing methods have been identified. One contact that had been identified using the data was consequently ruled out as being a close contact after contact tracers investigated. \u201cWith only a small number of cases being reported each day in Victoria, there have been few opportunities to use the app so far \u2013 and we hope this continues,\u201d a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. New South Wales reports \u201climited opportunity\u201d in using the app again due to the recent cases only being hotel quarantine cases where contact tracing is not required. The state\u2019s health department says it has been able to download data \u201cfewer than 10 times\u201d. Western Australia, similarly, has not had to use the app data due to low transmission. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said on the weekend the app could prove useful if there is a spike in cases from weekend protests, but said it was unclear how many would be using the app. The Covidsafe app would be absolutely critical and crucial in this type of setting. It\u2019s exactly what it is designed to do, is to pick up cases when you don\u2019t know the people around you. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know how many people that were at the protest that might have had the Covidsafe app on their phone and so it would rely on that. We\u2019ve had a very good uptake of the Covidsafe app, but the majority of people that have mobile phones have not downloaded the app so far. Labor leader Anthony Albanesehas acknowledged Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation\u2019s apparent intention to vote against extending jobkeeper to 5,500 Dnata workers \u201cit makes it difficult\u201d for the disallowance motion to pass. What I\u2019d say to all the senators is ... come and talk to these workers, these people who are hard working, don\u2019t earn a lot of money, that are just deserving of a little bit of respect. Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine was a little more blunt: This is a fight that is every day, every hour for these workers. They have taken extraordinary steps over the last three or four weeks to make sure the Australian people understand, the prime minister understands, One Nation in the Senate understands that they will never be forgiven \u2013 THEY WILL NEVER BE FORGIVEN \u2013 unless they step up and support these Australians now. Because these Australians and their families will suffer and the aviation sector will crumble and, if it crumbles, so too will the Australian economy. Now is the time for them to act. In her comments at the rally, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O\u2019Neil, noted the gendered impact of some of the government\u2019s decisions. She argued that the majority of airline catering workers at Dnata excluded from jobkeeper are women, just like the majority of childcare workers who will be excluded from jobkeeper from July in favour of an alternate subsidy. After the rally, O\u2019Neil told Guardian Australia the pandemic \u201chasn\u2019t treated everyone the same\u201d, with women losing more hours of work and a high proportion of the newly unemployed. She said the government must first acknowledge and then \u201crespond\u201d to the gendered impact of the recession by supporting the public sector and service industries that are disproportionately female including hospitality, higher education and the arts. Just as an FYI, when Peter Dutton, who had been attending cabinet meetings, tested positive to Covid-19, this was the advice from the PMO: In advice provided to the prime minister this evening, the deputy chief medical officer has reiterated that only people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate. That does not include the prime minister or any other members of the cabinet. AAP has an update on the Queensland high court border challenge case: A legal challenge against the constitutional right of the Queensland government to keep the state\u2019s borders closed has hit a snag. The high court in Brisbane has refused an application from lawyers for the Travel Essence challenge to access the documents used by the government when it decided to close the border. Chief justice Susan Kiefel said on Wednesday the application was \u201ca fishing expedition\u201d and \u201csubsidiary\u201d to the constitutional matter at hand. The matter will return to court for a directions hearing alongside two challenges by billionaire businessman Clive Palmer. Mr Palmer is challenging border closures in Queensland and Western Australia. The Travel Essence challenge is understood to be a group of tourism operators arguing the closure is causing them financial harm Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has previously refused to reverse her decision to keep the borders closed, saying she\u2019s keeping Queenslanders safe. Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, has addressed China\u2019s warning to international students. She said: Australia is one of the safest places in the world \u2013 and Australian universities are committed to making it even safer. In 2018, a survey of more than 80,000 international tertiary students found that personal safety and security is one of the top five factors for deciding to study in Australia \u2013 surpassed only by the quality of teaching and the reputation of the qualification. Any violent act is taken very seriously and reported to the police. On the Jobkeeper review, Anthony Albanese picked up Labor\u2019s theme from the weekend, which is something the opposition will be running with as the day runs: Last week, Scott Morrison said, in-ons response to a question, would he guarantee that JobKeeper would remain until September, and he answered very simply yes. This is a broken promise with regard to childcare workers, and it is the Government that have to explain this inconsistency. But I\u2019ll say this as well - the government have said they will receive the review in June. But they won\u2019t release it until July, after the July 4 by-election for Eden-Monaro. This is a government that hides from transparency, that should release the review when they get it, the only reason why they\u2019re delaying it is after the Eden-Monaro by-election. The Labor leader says the Labor MPs who went to Black Lives Matter protests on the weekend are being tested \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d. Given the tests aren\u2019t accurate until at least five days after potential exposure, it is still pointless. Anthony Albanese has wandered out to the front of the parliament where transport workers, including some who worked for the aviation catering company dnata, who have missed out on jobkeeper. They\u2019ve missed out because of a change that was made. I\u2019ve spoken to women here who received one payment and then had to give it back because they weren\u2019t eligible because of the issue of the ownership of this company. Now, these workers didn\u2019t make the decision to change the ownership of the company. That ownership change was approved by this government and one of the issues with jobkeeper is simply people missing out, doing the same job as others, who are getting the payment. The top spot in that ballot draw is the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers candidate, Matthew Stadtmiller. Preference deals just got super exciting. This seems unlucky. In Victoria: Michelle Rowland chatted to ABC radio this morning. Labor is pushing back against the Australia Post changes and hopes to have the regulation disallowed. Rowland: Australia Post have said that there will be job losses, and the government needs to be up front about this. These regulations are supposedly about a measure to deal with the impact of Covid-19, and these were announced in April. But in effect, these changes effectively halve the delivery and frequency of postal services and the concern is that this is not a short-term measure and indeed, it could be being used as cover for long-term detrimental changes to jobs and conditions of workers. Q: Well Australia Post has issued a statement saying it needs its workers more than ever to help deliver the increasing parcel volumes. What\u2019s your response to that? Rowland: Well, we support that. And in fact, the parcels boom is an opportunity to do more with one of our great government business enterprises. We need to be forward-looking about a post-Covid world and have a GBE from which we should be leveraging, in everything from logistics to technology to banking services, we should capitalise on those strengths. And around the world, you see Amazon, for example, their share price having skyrocketed, and even locally here domestic retail grocery services are all investing. Now, we support the surge in parcels. We support Australia Post doing more with that. But they can do it with or without regulation. For those wondering about pairs, with the social distancing going on, the parties have been granted a surplus of pairs, to choose who is in and out of the chamber at will. This should not come as a surprise: Chris Bowen has officially responded to the dental extension announcement: It is good that the federal government has today finally announced that it will extend the National Partnership Agreement on public dental services, after months of calls from Labor. However it is very disappointing this extension is for just one year. Labor consistently urged the government to ensure these services do not cease on 30 June, only three weeks away. But a one year extension is not enough for the vulnerable Australians who rely on public dental services for care. By the government\u2019s own numbers the NPA has provided services to 763,000 Australians since 1 January 2017. Disappointingly the announced one year extension guarantees only 180,000 patients public dental services over the next year. With waiting times for public dental already over 12 months in most states, someone who needs care today may not be seen under this scheme at all. Luke Henriques-Gomes has an update on robodebt: The true value of all welfare debts unlawfully issued through the federal government\u2019s robodebt scheme and soon to be wiped is expected to easily exceed $1bn, the Guardian has learned. In a humiliating backdown, the government last month promised to repay $720m to 330,000 past and present welfare recipients over 470,000 unlawful demands for money calculated using faulty \u201cincome averaged\u201d annual pay data as part of Centrelink\u2019s income compliance program. But as new polling showed significant support for a royal commission into the debacle, it can also be revealed internal estimates have shown the total value of those 470,000 unlawful debts will be close to $1.5bn, according to a source familiar with the refunds process. Since 2015, a total of $2.1bn is estimated to have been raised through the income compliance \u2013 or robodebt \u2013 program, including about 200,000 debts the government still considers legal and which it is not proposing to refund. The total value of the debts raised is much larger than the refunds being issued because much of the money has not been paid back, in many cases because people have sought payment plans, including through forced deductions from their Centrelink benefits. Overall, it means about three-quarters of all money banked from the robodebt program will likely need to be either repaid or wiped. No community transmission in NSW reported today \u2013 the three new cases of Covid-19 which were reported were from overseas travellers and all are in quarantine. This probably doesn\u2019t make any sense, given the tests aren\u2019t really accurate until at least five days after a possible contamination. I found that entire Alan Tudge quote on MasterChef, while speaking on Sky News. Even when you look at pop culture, some of the most successful and popular people have got a more diverse background, such as on MasterChef at the moment, which is the most popular TV show, where one of the judges is Chinese, has an ethnic Chinese background, and many of the contestants, who are hugely popular. This is an indication to me of what Australia is, where we treat people as individuals, we accept them for who they are and their contribution to our great country and that is the way I hope Australia will always be. For the record, Melissa Leong was born in Sydney. She is a first generation Singaporean Australian and her grandparents were originally from China. Transport workers have been protesting outside parliament, with many, particularly those in the aviation sector, having been left out of the jobkeeper program. Well this is cheery. There is still social distancing going on in the parliamentary chamber, which means MPs are on a roster for who is allowed in the chambers, and when. So expect a lot of desk photos in your Auspol social media feed. Look for strategically placed \u2018I\u2019m a human\u2019 props. Josh Frydenberg, sounding like he is reading from notes, says he sees government as \u201can enabler\u201d as he speaks to 5AA. Which is exactly what my friends call me, as I\u2019m always on the \u2018buy the thing, eat the thing\u2019 bandwagon. Life is short people. But Frydenberg has a different view of enabling, than I do, apparently. His view of enabling is more about \u2018do it yourself\u2019. It is clear the role of government and the future role of government will be much debated. The Labor party always want to see government as the big spender. Limitless spending and as the continuous provider of everything across the economy. We see government as an enabler. An enabler to ensure that people can be their best. That businesses can go out there and innovate, hire and grow. That individuals can provide for themselves, but if they need a helping hand, that there is a generous safety net, that is there, that at the same time there for them. I think that battle line will be very clear at the next election. Labor was promising to spend more before the coronavirus, during the coronavirus, and no doubt after the coronavirus. We are very much focussed on ensuring responsible, prudent, economical management, that don\u2019t leave an unnecessarily debt burden for future generations to pay. I mean, surely Tina Arena could just call up her number one fan, given how often the prime minister bangs on about her. Josh Frydenberg is continuing the \u2018curve is flattening, so, so is the stimulus\u2019 line on Adelaide radio 5AA. Simon Birmingham was also talking the Chinese government warnings to students when on Sydney radio 2GB this morning. He managed to avoid pointing to MasterChef. Ben Fordham: Is there an increase in racist attacks against Chinese students in Australia? Birmingham: No Ben, we don\u2019t believe that there is. Australia is country that holds ourself to an incredibly high standard. Far higher standard than most other nations and where racism occurs, it\u2019s condemned. Where there are incidents, we encourage it to be reported. Where there is any violence that occurs in our community, racist or otherwise, we encourage it to be not only reported, but insist that it be investigated and that people be brought to justice wherever possible. But also we widely report on statistics that are collected around these matters. Now, students in Australia from overseas continue to report that they choose Australia as a study destination, not only because of our high quality education standards, but also because of the safety and security that Australia offers them. Asked if Australia does have a problem with racism, Tudge said there were some \u201chigh profile\u201d instances of incidents directed against people of Asian descent but they were the \u201cactions of a tiny minority of cowardly idiots\u201d. He said: The vast majority of Australians would be appalled [by them] and would call it out. Just as the prime minister has, just as I have. 99.99% are as disgusted as I, the prime minister or anyone else is. It\u2019s not the Australian way and I don\u2019t think it is by any stretch of the imagination the Australian norm. The bells are ringing for the start of the parliament session. I now know what the Hound of Baskervilles sounded like. He was one beat away from saying that some of his best friends watch Masterchef. Alan Tudge is on Sky News pointing to Masterchef as an example of how multicultural Australia is, because there are judges AND contestants from multicultural backgrounds You read that right. The Group of Eight universities\u2019 chief executive, Vicki Thomson, has responded to China\u2019s warning for international students to reconsider coming to Australia. She said: Our duty of care extends to all of our students \u2013 domestic and international \u2013 and never more so at this time whilst we are in the middle of a global pandemic. It is for this reason that it is disappointing to see this statement from the ministry of education which speaks directly to Chinese students and urges caution when considering Australia as a study destination. Australia and our universities remain safe destinations for all of our students. The Go8 is absolutely committed to our international students and to maintaining a positive and collaborative relationship with China, but, statements such as this do make things more difficult at an already difficult time. We know students will do their own research about our health and safety as it relates to them - as they should - and we look forward to being able to welcome them back to our campuses as soon as the Australian government\u2019s health advice indicates that we can.\u201d Minutes are a long time in politics. Via AAP: NRL fans in NSW will have to wait a little longer before they can return to the grandstands with Premier Gladys Berejiklian shutting down a call of a dramatic relaxing of crowd restrictions before this week\u2019s round of matches. It comes as NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro says he wants to see fans flocking back to the game \u2013 starting with Thursday\u2019s clash between Manly and Brisbane in Gosford. The federal government is considering \u201cdecreased capacity\u201d for NRL games, according to deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth. The NSW government has already ticked off on the reopening of corporate boxes from this week at NRL stadiums, for one person per four square metres up to 50 people. On Wednesday morning, Berejiklian told the Nine Network there would be no further change to the restrictions just yet when asked if fans will be permitted to return to the footy. \u201cNo, not this weekend, no,\u201d she said on the Today Show. \u201cHowever, we we\u2019ve said, the use of corporate boxes and the like is the first stage of that engagement.\u201d If you pay pay-as-you-go tax, you might need to pay attention to this: the government will legislate to suspend the indexation of tax instalment amounts for the 2020-21 financial year in response to Covid-19. This change will affect instalments payable to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for an estimated 2.2 million taxpayers paying Pay As You Go (PAYG) income tax instalments, and around 81,000 taxpayers paying Goods and Services Tax (GST) instalments in 2020-21. The decision to suspend the indexation of tax instalments is yet another tangible way the Morrison Government is supporting Australians as we respond to the COVID-19 health crisis. Tax instalments help spread taxpayer obligations over the year and to reduce a taxpayers\u2019 balance on assessment. Historical Gross Domestic Product outcomes are normally used to index a range of instalment amounts annually to reflect anticipated income growth. Given the economic impact of COVID-19, the Government has decided to suspend this indexation for 2020-21. In addition to suspending indexation, taxpayers can still vary their instalment amounts if they believe they will pay too much tax for the year. Other taxpayers who pay instalments based on their current income are not subject to indexation because their instalments already adjust to changes in income. While these taxpayers are not affected by the suspension of indexation, they have the same right to vary their instalments. Taxpayers who do not pay GST by instalments are unaffected. It you require urgent assistance with your tax affairs due to COVID-19 you should contact the ATO\u2019s Emergency Support Infoline 1800 806 218. It\u2019s a big day for Angus Taylor \u2013 the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, which is actually more of a toothpick, comes into effect today. As the energy minister says in his statement: The \u2018Big Stick\u2019 legislation will ensure reductions in wholesale costs are passed on to customers, while penalties will apply for anti-competitive behaviour or moves to manipulate electricity prices. This new law comes at an important time, with an increased number of households and small businesses experiencing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ACCC will be responsible for enforcing the legislation, and will have a graduated range of penalties at its disposal to punish misconduct ranging from public warnings and court ordered fines. For the most egregious breaches, the legislation makes available two additional significant remedies: \u00b7 Treasurer-issued contracting orders that will require electricity companies to offer electricity financial contracts to third parties; and \u00b7 Federal Court ordered divestiture orders relating to misconduct in the wholesale market. What does this mean for you? Nothing, really. The great nation of Queensland has been under attack. Jobkeeper really is the topic of the day, at least at this early hour of the parliament\u2019s return. Jim Chalmers stopped by the Mural Hall to declare that the wage subsidy was a \u201cvery good idea being very badly implemented\u201d. Childcare workers are about to be carved out of the subsidy program, as the government stops the free childcare program and returns to the status quo. Labor says it is too early. Chalmers: It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Scott Morrison was saying, \u2018If you have a go, you get a go.\u2019 Well, now he\u2019s saying to so many workers, \u2018You\u2019ve had a go, now off you go, to Centrelink.\u2019\u201d Let\u2019s see if the parliament is still as passionate for change as it was before the pandemic. Australia\u2019s arts and entertainment workers are again hoping the government will change the jobkeeper wage subsidy program to include more people in their industry. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have both said that the program will be more \u201ctargeted\u201d as it moves forward. The Australia Institute has crunched some numbers and found that, so far, there has been a bit of an imbalance in how the stimulus has been handled: Between March and April the number of women employed fell 5.3 per cent compared to 3.9 per cent for men, and for hours worked the pattern was the same with women losing 11.5 per cent of their hours compared to the loss by men of 7.5 per cent. It is clear that women are facing the brunt of the recession so far,\u201d said Dr Richard Denniss, chief economist at the Australia Institute. \u201cBut despite the clear evidence that women are disproportionately losing their jobs and incomes, the Morrison Government is developing stimulus policies that disproportionately favour male dominated industries. The new research paper shows that every $1 million dollars spent on education creates 10.6 jobs for women while every $1 million spent on construction creates only 0.2 jobs for women. \u201cIf the Government is serious about maximising the number of jobs it creates then it needs to focus its stimulus spending on industries like education, health and tourism.\u201d Via AAP: NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro is pushing for a dramatic relaxing of crowd restrictions for NRL matches and the opening up of Sydney\u2019s ANZ Stadium for up to 40,000 fans as soon as round six. Barilaro says he wants to see fans flocking back to the game following the sport\u2019s restart after the Covid-19 shutdown, starting with Thursday\u2019s clash between Manly and Brisbane in Gosford \u2013 with sufficient social distancing. The federal government is considering \u201cdecreased capacity\u201d for NRL games, according to deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth. And the NSW government has already ticked off on corporate boxes, for one person per four square metres up to 50 people, open from this weekend. Discussions have begun about opening up the grandstands, with ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys aiming for a July 1 return for fans. But Barilaro believes it wouldn\u2019t make sense preventing supporters attending NRL matches now when 20,000 protesters took part in the Black Lives Matter rally with minimal social distancing rules in Sydney on Saturday. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s now clear we need some consistency with what is being approved,\u201d Barilaro told the the Daily Telegraph. \u201cHypocrisy at its best \u2026 the NRL have already proved they have the right plans in place. So as far as I\u2019m concerned the evidence is clear that we can open up these restrictions.\u201d Suggesting just one or two empty seats are needed to ensure adequate social distancing, Barilaro believes venues like the 80,000-capacity ANZ Stadium should start being used up as soon as possible. \u201cI want to see stadiums opened to the fans this weekend,\u201d Barilaro said. \u201cThere is no longer any need to keep these lockdowns in place. We can have crowds back and still be abiding by some social-distancing rules. The evidence is there to support that.\u201d Nationals leader Barilaro also said he wanted social-distancing restrictions lifted at grounds altogether by July 1. \u201cIf we open everything now with these social-distancing measures and there are no more problems, then come July, open everything. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be just about corporate boxes. We want people in the grandstands and people playing sport at grassroots level.\u201d In NSW, community sport will return on 1 July. Geoff Lee, the NSW sports minister, told Sydney radio 2GB that from the first of next month \u201ceveryone can play\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s game on for the whole community,\u201d he said, using phrases that normal people absolutely use every day. \u201cAll ages, whether it\u2019s under 18, over 18 competition can return July 1 this year.\u201d Mathias Cormann is not too fussed about the ABC\u2019s announcement that between 200 and 250 jobs as well as programs will have to be cut, after the latest round of cuts. As AAP reports: Finance minister Mathias Cormann has shrugged off the ABC\u2019s budget concerns as the national broadcaster prepares to cut more than 200 jobs. Senator Cormann says the ABC receives \u201csignificant\u201d taxpayer funding, even as the broadcaster offers voluntary redundancies because of an $84m budget cut. \u201cThe growth in funding hasn\u2019t been as high as the ABC might have hoped, but the ABC is in a much stronger position than any other media in Australia,\u201d he told the ABC on Wednesday. Since the Coalition came to power, and Tony Abbott stood in front of a \u201cno cuts to the ABC\u201d sign, the ABC has lost $783m in funding. The IPA must be thrilled. A police auxiliary officer has been charged with assaulting a 36-year-old man who was held in the Perth watch house. The 27-year-old man allegedly assaulted the man in the watch house on 11 April. He was issued with a summons for common assault and is scheduled to appear before the Perth magistrates court today. He has been stood aside for operational duties. WA police employ auxiliary officers in the Perth watch house and other police station lock-ups to support operational police officers in managing the admission, custody and release of detainees. Parliament is officially back and the coronavirus truce is off. You can expect a return to politics as normal, normal, from this week. Jobkeeper \u2013 who is in and who is out \u2013 is on the agenda, with Labor continuing to push for a win. Labor will also be moving a disallowance motion to try to overturn planned changes to how Australia Post operates. But of course the pandemic response continues. Yesterday Australia had its first day of no community transmission since March, when the virus peaked. That doesn\u2019t mean that the politics over the Black Lives Matter protests won\u2019t continue. But it is mostly about the economy now. Scott Morrison told the party room meeting yesterday that there were \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d ahead. He wanted you to know \u2013 the speech, usually delivered behind closed doors, (except when it is more for the public than the party room), was put up on the prime minister\u2019s social media. Why? Well, you are being prepared for a strong return to Liberal principles. So don\u2019t expect any of the Covid-19 changes to stick. Unless of course, it is tax cuts, or support for traditional industries. Take a look at the recent announcements and you\u2019ll get an idea of where we are headed. We\u2019ll cover all the day\u2019s events as they happen. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp, plus the entire Guardian brains trust at your disposal. I\u2019ve only had two coffees, so obviously that is not enough. But still. We go on. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. George Floyd was \u201can ordinary brother\u201d whose death made him the \u201ccornerstone of a movement\u201d, the Rev Al Sharpton told Floyd\u2019s family and the massed crowds of mourners at his funeral service in Houston on Tuesday. With his case being hailed as a landmark moment in the struggle against police brutality and racial prejudice across the US and beyond, Floyd\u2019s brother Rodney predicted: \u201cHe is going to change the world.\u201d As protests continue for a third week without any apparent loss of momentum, Ed Pilkington asks what\u2019s next \u2013 and whether changing the national conversation will be enough to change American society. Alex M Johnson suggests ways to help make sure it does: We are our brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s keeper and each of us has a role in this fight for black lives. The striking lack of diversity in police union leadership In 15 large American cities, a majority of police officers are non-white. But only one of them, Memphis, has a police union leader who is black. That\u2019s according to new a study of the vast racial disparity in police union leadership by the Marshall Project. With police departments under greater scrutiny nationwide, at least two more controversial deaths in police custody have come to light. And legal experts say thousands of protesters detained unnecessarily in New York \u2013 for up to 48 hours \u2013 have been held in \u201cabysmal\u201d conditions without access to water or facemasks. Cops has been cancelled. The popular reality show, broadcast by the Paramount Network for 32 seasons, will not return for a 33rd. Its critics said the series glorified police aggression and distorted the public\u2019s perception of crime and justice. Dr Fauci says \u2018we\u2019re still at the beginning\u2019 of the Covid-19 crisis More than a dozen US states have just had their worst week to date for coronavirus infections, even as lockdown restrictions are being eased across America. And the country\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, says \u201cWe\u2019re still at the beginning\u201d of the pandemic. Speaking to a biotechnology conference, Fauci said the Covid-19 crisis was his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d, but added that he was \u201cvery heartened\u201d by the progress being made on potential vaccines. Elsewhere in the world\u2026 The WHO has urged Pakistan to reinstate lockdown measures, with the country\u2019s hospitals straining at their capacity. The outgoing president of Burundi has died after a sudden illness, believed by many to have been Covid-19. Families in Milan want their loved ones exhumed from a cemetery in the Italian city after they were mistakenly buried in plots reserved for Covid-19 victims with no known relatives. Georgia\u2019s pandemic primary election did not go well With its primary on Tuesday, Georgia faced a test of whether states could safely and successfully hold elections amid the coronavirus pandemic. And by many accounts, it failed that test. New voting equipment malfunctioned across the state, leaving some precincts without a single working machine. And despite the authorities having encouraged voting by mail, many voters were forced to spend hours in line after choosing to cast their ballots in person. In other news\u2026 English authorities will examine the country\u2019s statues and their links to its racist past, after a monument to an 18th-century slave owner was taken down in London and protesters in Oxford demanded the removal of a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes. Trump has ordered an expansion of the US icebreaker fleet, signaling a more aggressive approach to the contest with Russia and China for resources in the Arctic and Antarctic. The US currently has just two icebreakers, while Russia has 40. Russia will open nuclear disarmament talks with Washington this month, but the Kremlin has warned that US attempts to include China in the Obama-era New Start treaty could scuttle the negotiations\u2019 chances of success. Crossfit\u2019s founder has resigned. Greg Glassman quit as the fitness brand\u2019s CEO after a series of offensive tweets and comments about George Floyd\u2019s death and subsequent protests.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses are expected to get a tax rebate of nearly \u00a31m as part of a government bailout for tourism businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The Trump Organization\u2019s golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry will benefit from emergency funding from the Scottish government worth \u00a32.3bn, which includes waiving the property taxes paid by hospitality, leisure and retail businesses this year.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus crisis, Trump Turnberry had been due to pay \u00a3850,766 in property tax this year and Trump Aberdeenshire \u00a3121,170. The&nbsp;Trump Turnberry\u2019s&nbsp;tax bill was recently reduced to \u00a3770,845, upon appeal.</p> <p>This week South Ayrshire, the local council which includes Turnberry, and Aberdeenshire council are expected to tell both businesses they no longer have to pay any of that tax, known as business rates, because they qualify for 100% relief.</p> <p>Both resorts have been able to avoid paying corporation tax, the main business tax in the UK, because they consistently report heavy losses due to their debts to Trump himself, cumulatively put at \u00a3155m in 2018.</p> <p>The revelation comes as some Democrats in the US Congress raise questions about whether it is lawful for Trump\u2019s companies to accept any benefits from a foreign country, including bailout funds from the UK and Scottish governments.&nbsp;</p> <p>The House oversight committee asked the Trump Organization to supply it with all documents related to the company\u2019s applications for loans or other funds by 21 May. There is no evidence that the company has complied with the request.</p> <p>One ethics expert in Washington stopped short of saying the property tax benefit represented an illegal gift under the emoluments clause of the US constitution \u2013 which was designed to block federal officials from receiving foreign payments \u2013 but said the tax rebate was nevertheless problematic.</p> <p>The US Congress has passed legislation prohibiting US taxpayer funds from being used to benefit companies in which&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;holds a stake.</p> <p>\u201cIt is troubling that he is getting essentially a benefit from the Scottish government, regardless whether it is an emolument. You shouldn\u2019t have a president who is in this kind of position who can say: \u2018I like what the UK did and I benefitted,\u2019\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire councillor Martin Ford said he did not object to Trump\u2019s businesses using a furlough scheme that allowed staff to continue to be paid, but criticised the business rates relief. \u201cTaxpayer assistance for a business owned by someone who boasts he is a multi-billionaire is quite another matter,\u201d Ford said.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike many people, Mr Trump won\u2019t be suffering any financial hardship. He doesn\u2019t need help. Mr Trump was given every assistance to set up in Scotland and the Scottish government repeated his ridiculous claims of an enormous economic and jobs boost for the region. Now, after years of losses, Mr Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire business is actually getting taxpayer support, perhaps a final irony in a very sorry saga.\u201d</p> <p>The ownership of the Trump Organization was shifted to a trust when Trump became president, but the businessman and former reality TV star has remained the majority owner of the trust and is expected to retain his position in the company once his term in the White House ends.&nbsp;\u201cA benefit to the Trump Organization is in large part a benefit to Donald Trump,\u201d Bookbinder said.</p> <p>The Scottish and UK governments\u2019 emergency funds include funding the furlough of any staff not able to work because their businesses have closed down and a \u00a3120m emergency fund for \u201cpivotal enterprises\u201d. Trump Turnberry said in 2018 it employed about 477 people a month; the Aberdeenshire course said it employed 77 employees on average across that year.</p> <p>The pivotal enterprise resilience fund gives out tailored grants to firms seen as \u201cvital to the local or national economic foundations of Scotland\u201d, but companies have to pursue that funding and prove why they need it.</p> <p>A Trump Organization executive in Scotland, Sarah Malone, confirmed they had used coronavirus emergency funding schemes but refused to provide details on how much they had claimed or how many staff they had furloughed. Malone did not deny, however, that the two golf resorts were due to receive the property tax relief.</p> <p>\u201cIt is well known across the world that the tourism and hospitality industry has been dramatically affected by Covid-19. Almost all businesses within this sector have been unable to trade,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOur priority throughout the mandatory closures has been the welfare of our staff and their families. The government schemes are designed to protect jobs and businesses affected by this worldwide crisis and to provide financial support to individuals unable to work.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses are expected to get a tax rebate of nearly \u00a31m as part of a government bailout for tourism businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis, the Guardian can reveal. The Trump Organization\u2019s golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry will benefit from emergency funding from the Scottish government worth \u00a32.3bn, which includes waiving the property taxes paid by hospitality, leisure and retail businesses this year. Before the coronavirus crisis, Trump Turnberry had been due to pay \u00a3850,766 in property tax this year and Trump Aberdeenshire \u00a3121,170. The Trump Turnberry\u2019s tax bill was recently reduced to \u00a3770,845, upon appeal. This week South Ayrshire, the local council which includes Turnberry, and Aberdeenshire council are expected to tell both businesses they no longer have to pay any of that tax, known as business rates, because they qualify for 100% relief. Both resorts have been able to avoid paying corporation tax, the main business tax in the UK, because they consistently report heavy losses due to their debts to Trump himself, cumulatively put at \u00a3155m in 2018. The revelation comes as some Democrats in the US Congress raise questions about whether it is lawful for Trump\u2019s companies to accept any benefits from a foreign country, including bailout funds from the UK and Scottish governments. The House oversight committee asked the Trump Organization to supply it with all documents related to the company\u2019s applications for loans or other funds by 21 May. There is no evidence that the company has complied with the request. One ethics expert in Washington stopped short of saying the property tax benefit represented an illegal gift under the emoluments clause of the US constitution \u2013 which was designed to block federal officials from receiving foreign payments \u2013 but said the tax rebate was nevertheless problematic. The US Congress has passed legislation prohibiting US taxpayer funds from being used to benefit companies in which Trump holds a stake. \u201cIt is troubling that he is getting essentially a benefit from the Scottish government, regardless whether it is an emolument. You shouldn\u2019t have a president who is in this kind of position who can say: \u2018I like what the UK did and I benefitted,\u2019\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire councillor Martin Ford said he did not object to Trump\u2019s businesses using a furlough scheme that allowed staff to continue to be paid, but criticised the business rates relief. \u201cTaxpayer assistance for a business owned by someone who boasts he is a multi-billionaire is quite another matter,\u201d Ford said. \u201cUnlike many people, Mr Trump won\u2019t be suffering any financial hardship. He doesn\u2019t need help. Mr Trump was given every assistance to set up in Scotland and the Scottish government repeated his ridiculous claims of an enormous economic and jobs boost for the region. Now, after years of losses, Mr Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire business is actually getting taxpayer support, perhaps a final irony in a very sorry saga.\u201d The ownership of the Trump Organization was shifted to a trust when Trump became president, but the businessman and former reality TV star has remained the majority owner of the trust and is expected to retain his position in the company once his term in the White House ends. \u201cA benefit to the Trump Organization is in large part a benefit to Donald Trump,\u201d Bookbinder said. The Scottish and UK governments\u2019 emergency funds include funding the furlough of any staff not able to work because their businesses have closed down and a \u00a3120m emergency fund for \u201cpivotal enterprises\u201d. Trump Turnberry said in 2018 it employed about 477 people a month; the Aberdeenshire course said it employed 77 employees on average across that year. The pivotal enterprise resilience fund gives out tailored grants to firms seen as \u201cvital to the local or national economic foundations of Scotland\u201d, but companies have to pursue that funding and prove why they need it. A Trump Organization executive in Scotland, Sarah Malone, confirmed they had used coronavirus emergency funding schemes but refused to provide details on how much they had claimed or how many staff they had furloughed. Malone did not deny, however, that the two golf resorts were due to receive the property tax relief. \u201cIt is well known across the world that the tourism and hospitality industry has been dramatically affected by Covid-19. Almost all businesses within this sector have been unable to trade,\u201d she said. \u201cOur priority throughout the mandatory closures has been the welfare of our staff and their families. The government schemes are designed to protect jobs and businesses affected by this worldwide crisis and to provide financial support to individuals unable to work. Most businesses across the UK, including those which have been able to continue to trade, have accessed the aid provided by the government.\u201d Trump Aberdeenshire announced on 24 March it had delayed reopening for the 2020 season because of the UK-wide coronavirus lockdown. Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son, who runs his golfing empire, tweeted on 28 May that both resorts were reopening the following day. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2020 to include an update on the Trump Turnberry property tax bill, which was reduced on appeal.",

Like today, with the recent defacing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Churchill statue</a> in Parliament Square and other monuments during the Black Lives Matter protests, it elicited outrage. One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/08/mayday.world\">tabloid newspaper</a> set up a hotline for readers to call if they knew \u201cthe identities of any of the scum who terrorised the capital\u201d. According to the magistrate who sentenced Matthews, his actions \u201ccaused great affront to many British people and people overseas\u201d because the statue symbolised \u201cthe war effort and the struggle against the Nazis\u201d.</p> <p>National monuments are sites of conflict because nations are contradictory. It is entirely possible that Churchill was both a war leader who helped defeat fascism and the enthusiastic supporter of a racist imperial system, but the debates that ensue at moments like this rarely reflect that paradox. Instead, when protesters descend on Whitehall in this way \u2013 which happens at least once or twice a decade \u2013 they are treated as if they have defiled something sacred.&nbsp;</p> <p>The outrage today follows similar lines, but the political context has changed dramatically. In a polarised landscape, it has been swiftly co-opted into an ongoing culture war. The most extreme statements have predictably come from the far right \u2013 Nigel Farage predicted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1269705670670114816\">\u201cfull-on race riots\u201d</a>, while the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson called on \u201cpatriots\u201d to defend the Churchill statue during future protests \u2013 but the narrative was summarised most neatly by the Conservative MP Ben Bradley. \u201cCountry more divided even than during Brexit,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBradley_Mans/status/1269712051695423490\">wrote on 7 June</a>. \u201cLondon &amp; metropolitan cities may as well be different countries; they have a different culture. One that\u2019s entirely alien and contradictory to life in working class towns in England.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians like Bradley have an interest in talking up these divisions: he is the MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, one of the towns that symbolises the collapse of Labour\u2019s vote in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\">former industrial heartlands</a>. The success of the Conservatives in seats like this rests on the claim that liberal, metropolitan Britain has become dangerously unmoored from the traditions and values of the nation \u2013 above all, of England \u2013 and needs to be reined in.</p> <p>The strength of this feeling shouldn\u2019t be underestimated or dismissed, since it\u2019s clearly shared by large numbers of voters in seats like Bradley\u2019s \u2013 but although it purports to be a defence of tradition, it instead relies on a denial of Britain\u2019s own history.&nbsp;</p> <p>One reason, I would suggest, that the UK\u2019s multi-ethnic cities seem \u201calien\u201d to many conservatives is because they can\u2019t accept the role that empire played in shaping the country we live in today. To them, the empire is largely something that happened to other people: it made Britain great, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau\">actual business of empire</a> \u2013 whatever that might have involved \u2013 took place overseas, and largely vanished along with all that pink territory on the map. In this view, urban Britain can only seem like an unwelcome intrusion into an otherwise coherent and unchanging nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet the empire transformed small-town and rural England just as it did the UK\u2019s cities. It powered industries and drew migrants from one part of the country to another; it sent large numbers of British functionaries overseas and, as the critic Edward Said described in his <a href=\"https://owlcation.com/humanities/Summary-of-Jane-Austen-and-Empire-by-Edward-Said\">study of Jane Austen</a>, lay as the unacknowledged source of wealth behind English country houses and their neatly pruned gardens.</p> <p>There is a long history of the right ignoring this. In his provocative study of British nationalism, The Break-Up of Britain, the historian Tom Nairn showed how Enoch Powell\u2019s fearmongering about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/enoch-powell-rivers-blood-legacy-wolverhampton\">black and Asian immigrants</a> from former colonies in the 1960s was supported by a sickly romanticism about England and its supposedly unchanging traditions. This denial has bequeathed our political culture with a kind of delirious national optimism \u2013 think of Boris Johnson, cheerily dangling the promise of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/boris-johnsons-test-and-tracing-system-britain-lockdown\">\u201cworld-beating\u201d test-and-trace</a> system in front of journalists rather than engaging with criticisms of his government\u2019s response to coronavirus \u2013 that turns nasty when challenged.&nbsp;</p> <p>At moments of unrest, the people who protest or riot are castigated not only for their behaviour, but for their very presence in the country.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI thought that on a day when people all over the world were gathering to express their human rights and the right to freedom of speech,\u201d said James Matthews, just before a judge sentenced him to 30 days in prison, \u201cI would express a challenge to an icon of the British establishment.\u201d The former Royal Marine, who served in Bosnia, had climbed the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square during a riotous protest and sprayed paint to make the mouth look like it was dripping with blood. Others added a green mohican made out of turf ripped from the ground nearby. That took place 20 years ago, during the huge May Day protests of 2000. Like today, with the recent defacing of the Churchill statue in Parliament Square and other monuments during the Black Lives Matter protests, it elicited outrage. One tabloid newspaper set up a hotline for readers to call if they knew \u201cthe identities of any of the scum who terrorised the capital\u201d. According to the magistrate who sentenced Matthews, his actions \u201ccaused great affront to many British people and people overseas\u201d because the statue symbolised \u201cthe war effort and the struggle against the Nazis\u201d. National monuments are sites of conflict because nations are contradictory. It is entirely possible that Churchill was both a war leader who helped defeat fascism and the enthusiastic supporter of a racist imperial system, but the debates that ensue at moments like this rarely reflect that paradox. Instead, when protesters descend on Whitehall in this way \u2013 which happens at least once or twice a decade \u2013 they are treated as if they have defiled something sacred. The outrage today follows similar lines, but the political context has changed dramatically. In a polarised landscape, it has been swiftly co-opted into an ongoing culture war. The most extreme statements have predictably come from the far right \u2013 Nigel Farage predicted \u201cfull-on race riots\u201d, while the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson called on \u201cpatriots\u201d to defend the Churchill statue during future protests \u2013 but the narrative was summarised most neatly by the Conservative MP Ben Bradley. \u201cCountry more divided even than during Brexit,\u201d he wrote on 7 June. \u201cLondon &amp; metropolitan cities may as well be different countries; they have a different culture. One that\u2019s entirely alien and contradictory to life in working class towns in England.\u201d Politicians like Bradley have an interest in talking up these divisions: he is the MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, one of the towns that symbolises the collapse of Labour\u2019s vote in its former industrial heartlands. The success of the Conservatives in seats like this rests on the claim that liberal, metropolitan Britain has become dangerously unmoored from the traditions and values of the nation \u2013 above all, of England \u2013 and needs to be reined in. The strength of this feeling shouldn\u2019t be underestimated or dismissed, since it\u2019s clearly shared by large numbers of voters in seats like Bradley\u2019s \u2013 but although it purports to be a defence of tradition, it instead relies on a denial of Britain\u2019s own history. One reason, I would suggest, that the UK\u2019s multi-ethnic cities seem \u201calien\u201d to many conservatives is because they can\u2019t accept the role that empire played in shaping the country we live in today. To them, the empire is largely something that happened to other people: it made Britain great, but the actual business of empire \u2013 whatever that might have involved \u2013 took place overseas, and largely vanished along with all that pink territory on the map. In this view, urban Britain can only seem like an unwelcome intrusion into an otherwise coherent and unchanging nation. Yet the empire transformed small-town and rural England just as it did the UK\u2019s cities. It powered industries and drew migrants from one part of the country to another; it sent large numbers of British functionaries overseas and, as the critic Edward Said described in his study of Jane Austen, lay as the unacknowledged source of wealth behind English country houses and their neatly pruned gardens. There is a long history of the right ignoring this. In his provocative study of British nationalism, The Break-Up of Britain, the historian Tom Nairn showed how Enoch Powell\u2019s fearmongering about black and Asian immigrants from former colonies in the 1960s was supported by a sickly romanticism about England and its supposedly unchanging traditions. This denial has bequeathed our political culture with a kind of delirious national optimism \u2013 think of Boris Johnson, cheerily dangling the promise of a \u201cworld-beating\u201d test-and-trace system in front of journalists rather than engaging with criticisms of his government\u2019s response to coronavirus \u2013 that turns nasty when challenged. At moments of unrest, the people who protest or riot are castigated not only for their behaviour, but for their very presence in the country. In 2001, when the descendants of workers invited from Pakistan during the 1960s to prop up north-west England\u2019s failing textile industry rioted, the media focused on their supposedly deficient culture rather than persistent racism and discrimination. During the 2011 riots in London and other English cities, the historian David Starkey voiced a fear about urban Britain that by then usually remained unspoken: \u201cthe whites have become black\u201d, he complained on Newsnight, as if pristine British culture was being polluted by a foreign influence. (Starkey was talking specifically about white \u201cchavs\u201d: fraternising among the lower orders has always disturbed British elites.) By forcing the UK to confront racism at home, the Black Lives Matter protesters are placing the empire and its legacy centre stage, from the dethroning of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, to highlighting the systemic inequality that has left working-class black and ethnic minority communities bearing some of the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet they are met with an infantile and increasingly toxic political discourse. Debate is frequently derailed into arguments over whether Churchill was personally \u201ca racist\u201d, rather than the ideas and structures that shaped the behaviour of the British ruling class. Over whether taking down the statue of Edward Colston is \u201crewriting history\u201d, rather than why Bristol taxpayers were still paying compensation to the descendants of slaveowners as late as 2015. Over the unruly behaviour of some protesters, rather than why, when people ask politely for things like a broader school or university curriculum, they are ignored or met with pearl-clutching horror. Likewise, the right tends to respond to demands that Britain acknowledge the truth about empire as if this were primarily about blaming people alive today, or about protecting the hurt feelings of minority groups. It doesn\u2019t have to be. A better understanding of our history, including the crimes committed in Britain\u2019s name, is essential for understanding the country we live in today, and the only way to defuse the claim that England is divided into two rival camps, utterly foreign to one another. Until Britain finds a way to reckon with its imperial past, this culture war will continue to burn. \u2022Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: the Rise of Britain\u2019s Far Right",

It comes after lawmakers in the European parliament accused the commission of watering down an earlier report on disinformation under pressure from China \u2013 charges EU officials strongly denied. EU member states are grappling with how to deal with China on a range of fronts, from foreign policy and security, to the economy. The commission described China as a \u201csystemic rival\u201d in a 2019 report that was seen by many member states as marking a watershed in how the EU deals with an increasingly aggressive government in Beijing. The EU commission also issued an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump, as it noted the harmful effects of his bizarre suggestions about injecting bleach to treat coronavirus. Without naming the US president, a commission document stated that such false claims can be \u201cvery harmful\u201d, noting that Belgium\u2019s Poison Control Centre has recorded an increase of 15% in the number of bleach-related incidents. Jourov\u00e1 repeated her praise of Twitter for putting a factchecking tag on two of Trump\u2019s recent tweets, while saying she would like to see a similar approach taken by social media companies on other false information. \u201cBe it the president, be the diplomats, be it me\u2026. when we [politicians] say something we have to be accountable and we should be able to stand that somebody goes and checks the facts.\u201d The commission has encouraged social media companies to sign a voluntary code of practice on disinformation, while threatening regulation if they fail to act. The latest report steps up demands on platforms to be more transparent in sharing data with researchers and intensify work with independent fact checkers. \u201cI would not like the platforms themselves to be the arbiters of truth,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said. The Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has become the latest company to sign the code of practice, the commission said, joining the likes of Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla.",

Having delayed imposing restrictions, the UK needed a near-blanket ban on activity from late March to early May to control the spread of the pandemic. Business and consumer confidence has been dented, unemployment is rising despite the government\u2019s furlough scheme and there is uncertainty about how quickly restrictions will be lifted. The OECD predicts recovery will take time and that by the end of 2021 output will still be 5% below pre-crisis levels. The continued need for working parents to look after school-age children is one important reason for the lack of a rapid bounce back. Samuel Tombs, a UK analyst at the consultancy Pantheon, has estimated that school closures wiped 8% off GDP in April and May, and 7% after the partial reopening in June. It is easy to see why ministers are so keen to see schools fully operational.",

With no income, many arts organisations are burning through reserves and, without targeted help, some will not survive.</p> <p>In a letter to the Guardian, Rattle, the music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Elder, the music director of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, describe classical music\u2019s situation as desperate.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this; orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality.\u201d</p> <p>Radio 3 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/12/glimmer-of-hope-leading-performers-return-to-londons-wigmore-hall\">the Wigmore Hall in London has started recitals with no live audience</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/28/the-proms-to-go-ahead-this-summer-but-not-as-we-know-them\">organisers of the BBC Proms are hopeful of two weeks of concerts in late summer</a>, probably with no audience.</p> <p>But orchestral music is essentially a live experience, Rattle and Elder write, \u201cand requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do individually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of&nbsp;space, art and emotion which is both vital and healing.\u201d</p> <p>They say learning to play while physically distanced will be harder than it may seem, but it has to happen.</p> <p>\u201cWe MUST find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline, of when that might be and how it can be implemented. We understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before;&nbsp;we will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems.\u201d</p> <p>Rattle and Elder said they were hopeful that music would weather the pandemic. \u201cWe refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.\u201d</p> <p>The government has set up a cultural renewal taskforce to help plot a way back for the the UK\u2019s recreation and leisure industries and there has been criticism that no representatives from music are on the taskforce. Ministers argue music is well represented on the important workgroups set up to develop guidance for reopening.</p> <p>Rattle and Elder point to the experience in mainland Europe where orchestras are gradually opening up and finding ways to deal with physical distancing.</p> <p>They write: \u201cIn the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness.\u201d</p> <p>Arts leaders in the UK warn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/15/uk-theatres-in-high-jeopardy-as-doors-remain-closed-amid-pandemic\">the position for performing arts companies is perilous</a>. About 70% of theatres say they will run out of money this year. Horace Trubridge, the general secretary of the Musicians\u2019 Union, this week told MPs: \u201cWe could very easily lose half the music venues we\u2019ve got in the UK during this crisis unless there isn\u2019t more permanent support for them.\u201d</p> <p>The West End producer Sonia Friedman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/21/british-theatre-on-brink-of-collapse-sonia-friedman-west-end-london\">has said</a>&nbsp;the performing arts face \u201cthe real possibility of complete obliteration\u201d without substantial government support, while the director&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/05/sam-mendes-calls-on-netflix-and-amazon-to-share-covid-19-windfall-with-theatre\">Sam Mendes said</a>&nbsp;\u201can ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch\u201d.</p> <p>Industry leaders say they are not after a bailout, but investment which will prevent parts of Britain\u2019s world leading arts sector going bust just at the moment it is most needed.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said this week that he was involved in \u201cintricate discussions\u201d with the Treasury and suggested a deal was almost done. \u201cI am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.\u201d</p> <h2>The Rattle/Elder letter</h2> <p>There are so many pressing problems to solve in the UK that it takes courage even to mention the desperate situation of classical music in the time of Covid-19.</p> <p>There\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this; orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality. What we write applies, of course, to all types of music, not just classical music which is our area of expertise. Our music is essentially a live experience and requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do individually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of&nbsp;space, art and emotion which is both vital and healing.</p> <p>This healing will become ever more necessary&nbsp;in the coming time as we attempt to bear witness and understand what we have all gone through. In such an existential crisis, the realisation of our shared vulnerability&nbsp;will surely change and deepen our relationship to all the arts. In our own field we are asking ourselves; how can we get back to live music? How can we give our audiences the courage to gradually return?</p> <p>More immediately, how can we maintain musical continuity when orchestras are silenced? And how do we nurture a generation of young musicians whose prospects look bleak just as they embark on a career in this ever more uncertain world?</p> <p>The recent extension of the furlough scheme is a blessing and enables many organisations to hang on. For freelance musicians, which include four of the London orchestras among others, huge problems remain. Currently many freelancers fall between the cracks of the government\u2019s self-employment schemes. We need to find a way to sustain some kind of backbone of income so that we will eventually be able to play whenever that will be possible. At the most basic level, despite all appearances to the contrary, musicians are humans. They need to eat and pay their bills. But we also need to play together and train, just like any sports team, albeit in a totally new environment. Crucially, this musical team is part of a complex structure that is focussed around, and serves, its home town or city.</p> <p>We will have to reinvent the wheel in so many ways. Learning to play while remaining distanced from each other will be much harder than it may initially seem.</p> <p>Our venues will have to learn to shepherd audiences in and out of performances in safety, and accept that at maximum only 25% capacity will be allowed, with all the economic knock on effects that this reality implies. We MUST find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline, of when that might be and how it can be implemented. We understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before;&nbsp;we will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems.</p> <p>All musicians of whatever genre share the magnificent problem of an art form which is, fundamentally, songs transmitted to people in a room. When will our audiences have the chance to experience this once more?</p> <p>We refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.</p> <p>In Mainland Europe orchestras are gradually opening up and finding different ways to deal with the problems of distancing. Good practice is being built up: in the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness.</p> <p>Sir Simon Rattle, OM, CBE, Music Director, London Symphony Orchestra</p> <p>Sir Mark Elder, CH, CBE, Music Director, Hall\u00e9 Orchestra</p>",

The performing arts, including theatre, music and dance, will be some of the last activities to resume as the UK climbs out of lockdown. With no income, many arts organisations are burning through reserves and, without targeted help, some will not survive. In a letter to the Guardian, Rattle, the music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Elder, the music director of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, describe classical music\u2019s situation as desperate. \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this; orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality.\u201d Radio 3 and the Wigmore Hall in London has started recitals with no live audience and organisers of the BBC Proms are hopeful of two weeks of concerts in late summer, probably with no audience. But orchestral music is essentially a live experience, Rattle and Elder write, \u201cand requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do individually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of space, art and emotion which is both vital and healing.\u201d They say learning to play while physically distanced will be harder than it may seem, but it has to happen. \u201cWe MUST find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline, of when that might be and how it can be implemented. We understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before; we will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems.\u201d Rattle and Elder said they were hopeful that music would weather the pandemic. \u201cWe refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.\u201d The government has set up a cultural renewal taskforce to help plot a way back for the the UK\u2019s recreation and leisure industries and there has been criticism that no representatives from music are on the taskforce. Ministers argue music is well represented on the important workgroups set up to develop guidance for reopening. Rattle and Elder point to the experience in mainland Europe where orchestras are gradually opening up and finding ways to deal with physical distancing. They write: \u201cIn the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness.\u201d Arts leaders in the UK warn that the position for performing arts companies is perilous. About 70% of theatres say they will run out of money this year. Horace Trubridge, the general secretary of the Musicians\u2019 Union, this week told MPs: \u201cWe could very easily lose half the music venues we\u2019ve got in the UK during this crisis unless there isn\u2019t more permanent support for them.\u201d The West End producer Sonia Friedman has said the performing arts face \u201cthe real possibility of complete obliteration\u201d without substantial government support, while the director Sam Mendes said \u201can ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch\u201d. Industry leaders say they are not after a bailout, but investment which will prevent parts of Britain\u2019s world leading arts sector going bust just at the moment it is most needed. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said this week that he was involved in \u201cintricate discussions\u201d with the Treasury and suggested a deal was almost done. \u201cI am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.\u201d The Rattle/Elder letter There are so many pressing problems to solve in the UK that it takes courage even to mention the desperate situation of classical music in the time of Covid-19. There\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this; orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality. What we write applies, of course, to all types of music, not just classical music which is our area of expertise. Our music is essentially a live experience and requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do individually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of space, art and emotion which is both vital and healing. This healing will become ever more necessary in the coming time as we attempt to bear witness and understand what we have all gone through. In such an existential crisis, the realisation of our shared vulnerability will surely change and deepen our relationship to all the arts. In our own field we are asking ourselves; how can we get back to live music? How can we give our audiences the courage to gradually return? More immediately, how can we maintain musical continuity when orchestras are silenced? And how do we nurture a generation of young musicians whose prospects look bleak just as they embark on a career in this ever more uncertain world? The recent extension of the furlough scheme is a blessing and enables many organisations to hang on. For freelance musicians, which include four of the London orchestras among others, huge problems remain. Currently many freelancers fall between the cracks of the government\u2019s self-employment schemes. We need to find a way to sustain some kind of backbone of income so that we will eventually be able to play whenever that will be possible. At the most basic level, despite all appearances to the contrary, musicians are humans. They need to eat and pay their bills. But we also need to play together and train, just like any sports team, albeit in a totally new environment. Crucially, this musical team is part of a complex structure that is focussed around, and serves, its home town or city. We will have to reinvent the wheel in so many ways. Learning to play while remaining distanced from each other will be much harder than it may initially seem. Our venues will have to learn to shepherd audiences in and out of performances in safety, and accept that at maximum only 25% capacity will be allowed, with all the economic knock on effects that this reality implies. We MUST find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline, of when that might be and how it can be implemented. We understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before; we will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems. All musicians of whatever genre share the magnificent problem of an art form which is, fundamentally, songs transmitted to people in a room. When will our audiences have the chance to experience this once more? We refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through. In Mainland Europe orchestras are gradually opening up and finding different ways to deal with the problems of distancing. Good practice is being built up: in the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness.

      "body": "<p>The killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd by a white police officer</a> took place thousands of miles from the UK. But the 46-year-old\u2019s cry in Minnesota that he could not breathe has sparked widespread protest in Britain. In the past two weeks, there have been demonstrations across UK cities. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 25, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d. The demonstrations were largely organised through word of mouth and social media rather than established anti-racism groups.</p> <p>Protesters carried handmade placards with the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">Sean Rigg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> and others killed or left disabled by British police. They chanted for the Windrush generation, the victims of the Grenfell tower fire, and decried the high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">Covid-19 death rate among members of the BAME</a> community. </p> <p>The Guardian asked the two women who organised the protest as well as other organisers and demonstrators what has driven them to this momentous time in the UK\u2019s history of race relations about the moment that made them want to protest. Black lives matter in the streets and in police custody \u2013 but also, they said, in schools, hospitals and workplaces. Six of the protesters in London explained why they were there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1/0_58_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"John, 24, mechanic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>John, 24 </strong></h2> <h2>Car mechanic</h2> <p>I became politicised at a really young age, probably when I was four. I was leaving a shop and security stopped me and my mum. The woman pulled out a scanner and started scanning me from head to toe. My mum gave her an earful, but that\u2019s when I realised that I looked different, that I was a target. They automatically assumed that I\u2019d stolen something when I hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>It was an important point in my life. It\u2019s the same issue trying to get a job. Even with mechanic shops all around London, it\u2019s harder for black people to get picked for a job in some of these places. The mechanic would rather take the white boy and not give me a shot. Enough is enough. My children aren\u2019t going to go through similar racist experiences. If I\u2019ve got to be out here every single day, I will be. </p> <p>Police brutality is a strong issue here in the UK too. During the coronavirus pandemic, police started coming round my area and black boys like me were getting stopped. Their excuses are we look like we\u2019re trying to steal something. They are stopping me in front of the building I live in, putting me in cuffs, embarrassing me in front of everyone. You\u2019re putting your hands on my parts for what? Just to feel power that you can abuse? These things need to stop. There are so many young black people here, outside the American embassy, because we all feel it. </p> <p>There has never been a time when I\u2019ve felt I can call the police: they\u2019re more likely to suspect me than actually help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da/0_1034_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chioma Atuanya, 22\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chioma Atuanya, 22</strong></h2> <h2>Former recruitment consultant</h2> <p>I realised there was institutional racism in the UK when I was 15. My dad lives in Nigeria and he said he knew someone who had died of Ebola. Everyone at school was making jokes, whereas I was worried for my father\u2019s safety. I told people that it wasn\u2019t cool and that they had to stop because what if I made a joke about cancer? </p> <p>Everyone started kicking off. Someone made a racist comment towards me and my mum got called into school. Not because of what they said, but because of what I said. They said I needed to stop talking about controversial subjects at school or I would be excluded. It was probably the first time I had a proper conversation about racism with my mum. I thought the teachers would be more understanding, but nothing happened.</p> <p>Since then, I realised it\u2019s a lot bigger than I first thought. George Floyd isn\u2019t the first man to die at the hands of racism, but there is such a hype right now, we need to jump on it. These are innocent people who are not sick and they are dying anyway. People are just taking lives here. </p> <p>The presence of social media has blown up the issue. There is a large black community online sharing everything, and it has brought it to everyone\u2019s attention. There is no shadow of a doubt what\u2019s happening and now everyone is wising up to previous things when excuses were made. Everyone is seeing it\u2019s all just smoke.</p> <h2><strong>Aima, 18</strong></h2> <h2>Student and co-organiser of the London Black Lives Matter group LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f/0_560_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aima\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve grown up with so many videos of police brutality; videos from the US, UK and all over the world. It has affected me quite badly. It\u2019s been 10 years of watching people die online that has driven me to being so angry and wanting my voice to be heard.</p> <p>When I moved to the UK from Nigeria in 2012, I saw so much that I have never seen before. Seeing and hearing my friends talk about stop and searches has really affected me. There was a lot of racism in school; other students calling me the N-word, calling me a monkey. I\u2019m here today because I stand in solidarity with all my US brothers and sisters. Enough is enough; black people cannot keep suffering.</p> <p>Racism doesn\u2019t just happen in the US; it also happens here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting. We need to realise that so many people have been harassed and assaulted by the British police. I\u2019m tired because systematic racism within the police system has been going on for years. Just because it\u2019s not talked about much doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. We want people to be educated and to hear us. That is the main thing \u2013 hear our voices. I think marching has made a huge difference because everyone is speaking about the issue.</p> <h2><strong>Natasha, 21</strong> </h2> <h2>Student, co-organiser of LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>George Floyd\u2019s death was the catalyst for everything.

This is a sign of real change and people want things to be different.</p> <p>I\u2019m here to call for justice for Grenfell. There are residents who still don\u2019t have housing. It was a tragedy.

      "bodyText": "The killing of George Floyd by a white police officer took place thousands of miles from the UK. But the 46-year-old\u2019s cry in Minnesota that he could not breathe has sparked widespread protest in Britain. In the past two weeks, there have been demonstrations across UK cities. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 25, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d. The demonstrations were largely organised through word of mouth and social media rather than established anti-racism groups. Protesters carried handmade placards with the names of Mark Duggan, Sean Rigg, Julian Cole and others killed or left disabled by British police. They chanted for the Windrush generation, the victims of the Grenfell tower fire, and decried the high Covid-19 death rate among members of the BAME community. The Guardian asked the two women who organised the protest as well as other organisers and demonstrators what has driven them to this momentous time in the UK\u2019s history of race relations about the moment that made them want to protest. Black lives matter in the streets and in police custody \u2013 but also, they said, in schools, hospitals and workplaces. Six of the protesters in London explained why they were there. John, 24 Car mechanic I became politicised at a really young age, probably when I was four. I was leaving a shop and security stopped me and my mum. The woman pulled out a scanner and started scanning me from head to toe. My mum gave her an earful, but that\u2019s when I realised that I looked different, that I was a target. They automatically assumed that I\u2019d stolen something when I hadn\u2019t. It was an important point in my life. It\u2019s the same issue trying to get a job. Even with mechanic shops all around London, it\u2019s harder for black people to get picked for a job in some of these places. The mechanic would rather take the white boy and not give me a shot. Enough is enough. My children aren\u2019t going to go through similar racist experiences. If I\u2019ve got to be out here every single day, I will be. Police brutality is a strong issue here in the UK too. During the coronavirus pandemic, police started coming round my area and black boys like me were getting stopped. Their excuses are we look like we\u2019re trying to steal something. They are stopping me in front of the building I live in, putting me in cuffs, embarrassing me in front of everyone. You\u2019re putting your hands on my parts for what? Just to feel power that you can abuse? These things need to stop. There are so many young black people here, outside the American embassy, because we all feel it. There has never been a time when I\u2019ve felt I can call the police: they\u2019re more likely to suspect me than actually help. Chioma Atuanya, 22 Former recruitment consultant I realised there was institutional racism in the UK when I was 15. My dad lives in Nigeria and he said he knew someone who had died of Ebola. Everyone at school was making jokes, whereas I was worried for my father\u2019s safety. I told people that it wasn\u2019t cool and that they had to stop because what if I made a joke about cancer? Everyone started kicking off. Someone made a racist comment towards me and my mum got called into school. Not because of what they said, but because of what I said. They said I needed to stop talking about controversial subjects at school or I would be excluded. It was probably the first time I had a proper conversation about racism with my mum. I thought the teachers would be more understanding, but nothing happened. Since then, I realised it\u2019s a lot bigger than I first thought. George Floyd isn\u2019t the first man to die at the hands of racism, but there is such a hype right now, we need to jump on it. These are innocent people who are not sick and they are dying anyway. People are just taking lives here. The presence of social media has blown up the issue. There is a large black community online sharing everything, and it has brought it to everyone\u2019s attention. There is no shadow of a doubt what\u2019s happening and now everyone is wising up to previous things when excuses were made. Everyone is seeing it\u2019s all just smoke. Aima, 18 Student and co-organiser of the London Black Lives Matter group LDN BLM I\u2019ve grown up with so many videos of police brutality; videos from the US, UK and all over the world. It has affected me quite badly. It\u2019s been 10 years of watching people die online that has driven me to being so angry and wanting my voice to be heard. When I moved to the UK from Nigeria in 2012, I saw so much that I have never seen before. Seeing and hearing my friends talk about stop and searches has really affected me. There was a lot of racism in school; other students calling me the N-word, calling me a monkey. I\u2019m here today because I stand in solidarity with all my US brothers and sisters. Enough is enough; black people cannot keep suffering. Racism doesn\u2019t just happen in the US; it also happens here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting. We need to realise that so many people have been harassed and assaulted by the British police. I\u2019m tired because systematic racism within the police system has been going on for years. Just because it\u2019s not talked about much doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. We want people to be educated and to hear us. That is the main thing \u2013 hear our voices. I think marching has made a huge difference because everyone is speaking about the issue. Natasha, 21 Student, co-organiser of LDN BLM George Floyd\u2019s death was the catalyst for everything. Black Lives Matter has resonated so deeply in the UK because the black community and other people of colour know what racism is like in this country. I think they all had a \u201cthis could be me\u201d or \u201cthis could happen to someone I know\u201d moment. This is a sign of real change and people want things to be different. I\u2019m here to call for justice for Grenfell. There are residents who still don\u2019t have housing. It was a tragedy. We want change and we want our voices to be heard. I cannot believe that in 2020, and even though we are facing a global pandemic, we still have to come out and protest for our civil rights and for our lives. You can\u2019t tell the oppressed how to feel. I hope that we can start to see some reform.

      "bodyText": "The Church of England is to allow funerals to take place in its buildings from next week for the first time in three months, although \u201csignificant limitations\u201d will be in place. The announcement follows the government\u2019s decision to allow places of worship to reopen for individual prayer from Monday, although communal worship will not be permitted until 4 July at the earliest. C of E bishops said allowing funerals inside was in line with guidance from Public Health England and a fall in the number of new infections and the death rate from Covid-19. Churches may need to cap the number of mourners attending and tape off pews or rows of chairs to ensure physical distancing. Hymns and singing \u201care not advised\u201d and the use of communal bibles or other books should be avoided. Wakes or gatherings after the funeral should not take place, \u201cbut if there is one, clergy are advised not to attend\u201d. Many Anglican clergy have said prohibiting funerals in churches has been extremely distressing for parishioners whose loved ones have died in the past three months. The bishops said their new guidance was \u201cpermissive and not prescriptive\u201d. Some churches may be unable to open because clergy or staff are ill, isolating or shielding. Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, said: \u201cWhile the restrictions on everyday life necessary to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus pandemic have been difficult for us all, I\u2019m only too aware that those who have lost loved ones have suffered most of all. I know that the grieving process has been even more difficult because of the limitations on funerals themselves. \u201cThere are now at least some signs of hope of an improvement with a fall both in the number of new infections and the death rate, but there will still, sadly, have to be significant limitations on how we mark funerals for some time to come. \u201cNevertheless the House of Bishops has agreed that in light of the changing circumstances it is time to review our advice so that it will soon be possible for funeral services to be conducted inside church buildings following government guidelines.\u201d The C of E has also issued guidance on the administration of holy communion when churches reopen for communal worship. Members of congregations will be allowed to take bread only, with wine being restricted to the priest taking the service. Hand sanitiser will be used by both clergy and congregations; kneeling at the altar for communion will be banned; and the shaking of hands, known as the sign of the peace, will be prohibited.",

      "bodyText": "An OECD report forecasted that the global economy will contract 6% in 2020, and 7.6% if there is a second wave of Covid-19 infections. It said the pandemic has triggered the most severe peace-time recession in nearly a century The report also found that Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world The news caused European stocks to flip flop, with most indices ending up in negative territory after a relatively strong start to the session Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey later said at a private event that there will be elements of a faster-than-usual economic recovery as the government lifts Covid-19 restrictions that that we are seeing elements of that recovery starting already US consumer prices fell for the third straight month. CPI dipped 0.1% month on month in May, worse than economist forecasts for a flat reading All eyes are now turning to the US Fed as the central bank plans to release its first set of economic forecasts since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold That\u2019s all from us today. We\u2019ll be back again tomorrow morning. Thanks for reading and stay safe \u2013KM Wall Street has edged higher at the market open, helping the Nasdaq hit a record high (remember it hit 10,000 for the first time ever yesterday, so it wasn\u2019t a huge feat to beat that level again today) Nasdaq opened up 0.6% at 10,014 points Dow opened 0.1% higher at 27,244 points S&amp;P 500 opened 0.1% higher at 3,211 points Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, says the US Fed is unlikely to forecast GDP growth above 2.5% for 2021 when it releases projections later today: It is unlikely that the FOMC\u2019s GDP forecast will be much higher than 2.5%, as the Fed can explain such a modest increase in the light of a wide output gap that will take time to recover. A much stronger GDP growth forecast would certainly come to the attention of bond investors, who might think that this would mean a faster-than-expected normalisation of policy. It would also be a surprise if the Fed deviated much from its recent messages to the market of being there to provide policy support for the economy. Fed Chair Powell might also want to again send the message that accommodative policy will be in place for some time \u2013 i.e. dovish forward guidance. The potential upset today is that Fed Chair Powell sends an inadvertent hawkish message and/or highlights concerns with new highs in equity markets. More comments being reported from Andrew Bailey: After the doom and gloom of the OECD report, Bailey has said that there will be elements of a faster-than-usual economic recovery as the government lifts Covid-19 restrictions. He adds that we are seeing elements of that recovery starting already. However, there will be a greater degree of natural caution by people after lockdown ends, and he warns that we don\u2019t know how much economic scarring there will be. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is speaking at a private event as part of the World Economic Forums\u2019 \u201cGreat Reset Dialogue\u201d series. Thankfully Reuters has a view of what\u2019s being said. Bailey, like almost every BoE official in recent months, has insisted that the financial sector is much more resilient than before the financial crisis and that banks can aid the recovery from Covid-19 by continuing to lend. However, Bailey will they have to consider some reform of the \u2018non-bank sector of finance\u2019 after the Covid-19 crisis (though no detail yet over what exactly the issues or or what the potential solutions might be). US CPI dipped 0.1% month on month in May, worse than economist forecasts for a flat reading. That\u2019s the third straight month of declines and follows a 0.8% fall in April which was the biggest decline on record since December 2008. On an annual basis, consumer prices actually rose 0.1% but that was still worse than predictions for 0.2%. Worse than Italy. Worse than Spain. Britain has already had more deaths from Covid-19 than any other European country. Now it faces the possibility of a second embarrassment: the deepest recession of any nation in the developed world, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott. There\u2019s not much in it, according to the latest forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Italy and Spain are also propping up the league table put together by the Paris-based thinktank. A lot can happen between now and the end of 2020, a year that has not yet reached its mid-point. Even so, the OECD\u2019s findings make grim reading. It thinks the economy will contract by 11.5% in the event of a single hit and by 14% if the virus returns later in the year. The 37-member thinktank says one is no more likely than the other. So why is the UK set to do much worse than Germany, which expects output to contract by 6.6% in the event of a single hit? One factor identified by the OECD is the importance of the service sector to the UK economy. Trade, tourism, real estate and hospitality together make up a sizeable chunk of gross domestic products and all have been hard hit by the lockdown. You can read Larry\u2019s full analysis here: Stocks are on a bit of a rollercoaster ride today, with the FTSE 100 edging back into positive territory to trade up 0.1% US futures are also showing some green shoots just a little over an hour before Wall Street opens for trading. Oil prices are continuing their downward slide, with Brent crude down 1.8% and WTI slumping 2.2%. While oil prices had climbed since the initial OPEC+ production cut agreement in April (as well as the recent easing of lockdowns) the long road to recovery from Covid-19 appears to weighing on the minds of investors. Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: The global economy is still in a precarious position. The dip in oil prices in recent days most likely reflects the end of the price boost that came from the initial economic re-opening. The global economy is now settling in for a long, slow recovery process, which we only expect to pick up in late 2021, assuming a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available then. Global energy consumption will remain depressed compared with the start of 2020, particularly as demand for travel and hospitality services stays weak. This will require continued production restraint from OPEC+ partners in order to stabilise oil prices around their current level of US$40/b. Boris Johnson has further quashed any hopes of pubs and the wide hospitality industry re-opening this month, saying at PMQ\u2019s that the government was sticking to its plan to hold out until at least 4 July. You\u2019ll remember that there were rumours that there might be an early re-opening of beer gardens around 22 June. Johnson said that guidance for the hospitality industry was being development but there were still risks, and that the government did not want to se a mass of people who could further spread the coronavirus. The US dollar is trading at three-month lows ahead of the conclusion of the US Fed meeting later today. While we\u2019re not expecting any change to interest rates, all eyes are turning to economic projections, particularly in light of the surprise drop in unemployment in May. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The economic projections will be particularly instructive in the context of whether Fed policymakers believe a v-shaped recovery is likely, and whether they think the worst is behind the US economy. We\u2019ve already seen more details this week of the Main Street Lending program, however it will be on how the Fed intends to manage the recovery process that will be of most interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is currently facing Labour leader Kier Starmer at PMQs. You can follow those proceedings at our politics live blog here: Speaking of Germany, there are reports that the country\u2019s finance minister Olaf Scholz is mulling a larger-than-expected extra budget that will involved taking on \u20ac50bn worth of fresh debt to fund a coronavirus stimulus package. The cabinet is planning to pass a second supplementary budget on 17 June, according to Reuters, which is citing an unnamed senior official with knowledge of the discussions. It would be on top of a supplementary budget worth \u20ac156bn agreed in March, and would bring the federal government\u2019s overall net new borrowing beyond \u20ac200bn this year. After a relatively positive start to the session, it\u2019s a sea of red across European stocks. Germany\u2019s XETRA DAX is logging the worst losses, down -9%. The UK government has weighed in on the OECD forecasts (but failed to address the fact that the UK is likely to suffer the worst Covid-19 damage among its peers). Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said: In common with many other economies around the world, we\u2019re seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy. I\u2019ve been clear that our top priority has always been to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis- and this is what we\u2019ve done. The unprecedented action we\u2019ve taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible. And if you\u2019ve forgotten about the looming Brexit transition period deadline: The OECD has said that if the UK fails to strike a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 or put in place alternative arrangements, Brexit threatens to have a strongly negative effect on trade and job in the UK. That\u2019s being reported by Reuters. Sir Martin Sorrell is fond of coining a phrase to describe the shape of an economic recovery and his latest prediction is that the world is likely to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in a \u201creverse square root\u201d, Mark Sweney writes. Sorrell, who famously labelled last decade\u2019s advertising recession as \u201cbath shaped\u201d, said that while industry sectors will have their own recovery shapes - V, U, L and even \u201ca chair\u201d - the overall global economy is likely to reset at a lower level. \u201cThe best analogy I like is the reverse square root,\u201d he said, speaking at the virtual CogX conference. \u201cA sharp fall, a recovery, but maybe not to the levels we were at before.\u201d The former chief of WPP has always had a hectic globe trotting schedule but, perhaps surprisingly, he says he is enjoying the shift to remote working under lockdown. \u201cI feel much better physically and mentally not rushing around the world,\u201d he said. Sorrell quipped that as the business world moves to less face-to-face meetings, and travel is curtailed, post-coronavirus it was unlikely that his son\u2019s joke that he would pass away \u201cin seat 1A\u201d was now likely to come true. There has been a surge in the number of people looking for a place to rent in London and the home counties since the UK housing market reopened about a month ago, my colleague Julia Kollewe writes. The lettings market has bounced back faster than the home sales market, according to the upmarket estate agent Knight Frank. It says that the number of valuation appraisals for lettings properties jumped to a record high in the week to 6 June, and was 19% above the five-year average. The weekly number of tenants looking to move was 40% above the five-year average. House moves and physical viewings were effectively banned between late March and 13 May, when restrictions were lifted. Estate agents switched to virtual viewings, but the housing market pretty much ground to a halt. Knight Frank says the number of viewings for homes to rent was 1% higher than the five-year average in the week to 6 June, even though physical distancing rules remain in place. By comparison, viewings for properties for sale fell 26% in London. Web viewings remain popular, up 33% higher than the five-year average last week, compared to a 12% decline for sales. Despite the increase, activity in the lettings market is still below where it was during the second half of 2019, when demand was boosted by uncertainty in the sales market because of Brexit. Jon Reynolds, head of lettings at Knight Frank for the City, east and Riverside region in London, said: We expect demand to get even stronger when there is more certainty around how universities will be teaching their courses next year. Those announcements will make a huge difference and demand will be bolstered further as companies reactivate relocation plans that are currently on hold. An interesting graphic by our team showing how the UK\u2019s economy is on track for the worst performance among its peers: Sidenote for all your Bank of England geeks: chief economist Andy Haldane has been re-appointed for another three year term on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. He first joined the MPC in June 2014. Don\u2019t expect much fanfare on Wall Street at the start of trading. US futures are showing the S&amp;P down 0.1% and the Dow down 0.2%. However, there may be some optimism left around tech stocks, with Nasdaq futures up 0.3%. The dismal OECD forecasts have hit UK stocks. The FTSE 100 and more domestically-focused FTSE 250 have reversed their gains and are now down around 0.3% each. Even the first line of the OECD report makes for grim reading: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis without precedent in living memory. It has triggered the most severe economic recession in nearly a century and is causing enormous damage to people\u2019s health, jobs and well-being. The decision to publish two separate economic forecasts was due to the fact that the OECD believes there is \u201clittle prospect of a vaccine becoming widely available this year.\u201d It\u2019s a deflating thought, especially as AstraZeneca and partners race ahead with trials of a potential vaccine that they hope will be on track for manufacturing by September. A second wave of Covid-19 later this year will trigger a return to lockdowns, the OECD said, putting the world economy on track for a worse 7.6% contraction this year, before climbing back 2.8% in 2021. In that scenario, unemployment in the OECD economies would be more than double the rate prior to the outbreaks, with little recovery in jobs next year, it warned. You can read the OECD summary here and the outlook here. (Just a quick note to say that if anyone was patiently waiting for our post on German unemployment or Eurozone PMI data as outlined in the agenda this morning, it actually isn\u2019t due today but was out last week. Apologies. The agenda has since been updated) Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world, according to a report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Phillip Inman writes. A slump in the UK\u2019s national income of 11.5% during 2020 will outstrip the falls suffered by France, Italy, Spain and Germany, the Paris-based thinktank said. Germany\u2019s decline in national income (GDP) will be 6.6% this year while Spain\u2019s GDP will fall by 11.1%, Italy\u2019s by 11.3 and France\u2019s by 11.4%. Highlighting the task awaiting the UK government as it seeks to ease the lockdown, the OECD ruled out a V-shaped recovery for the global economy, saying the path back to previous levels of activity would be hampered by long-lasting effects of the pandemic. The forecast of an 11.5% drop in GDP this year is an improvement on the 14% fall in national income put forward last month as a likely \u201cscenario\u201d by the Bank of England, but will add to pressure on the government after the OECD found that even countries that have come under severe criticism for their handling of the pandemic will fare better than the UK. You can watch the live OECD press conference here: OECD forecasts are out and it\u2019s not a pretty picture. UK GDP is expected to be -11.5% and as low as -14% if there\u2019s a second wave of the outbreak. The US forecasts suggest a -7.3% contraction and -8.5% with a new outbreak. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has criticised the British bank HSBC for supporting China\u2019s move to end Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, calling it a \u201ccorporate kowtow\u201d. Pompeo said the US was ready to assist Britain with whatever it needed after Beijing reportedly threatened to punish HSBC and break its commitments to build nuclear power plants in the country if the UK did not allow the Chinese technology firm Huawei to build its 5G network. \u201cThe United States stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist party\u2019s coercive bullying tactics,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement. He added that displays of support for Beijing received little in return, although the Chinese government \u201ccontinues to use the bank\u2019s business in China as political leverage against London\u201d. Pompeo said China\u2019s treatment of HSBC was a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d and referred to the bank\u2019s Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Wong\u2019s decision to sign a petition supporting Beijing\u2019s plans to enact new security legislation in Hong Kong: The CCP\u2019s browbeating of HSBC, in particular, should serve as a cautionary tale. Just last week, the bank\u2019s Asia-Pacific CEO, Peter Wong, a member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, signed a petition supporting Beijing\u2019s disastrous decision to destroy Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and to break commitments made in an U.N.-registered treaty. That show of fealty seems to have earned HSBC little respect in Beijing, which continues to use the bank\u2019s business in China as political leverage against London. Let\u2019s catch up with some of the Chinese inflation data released overnight which has also weighed on Asian stocks. Both the consumer price index and producer price index figures pointed to a drop in demand last month. Chinese consumer price inflation came in at 2.4% for May, below forecasts for 2.7% and Aprils\u2019 reading of 3.3%. The producer price index, meanwhile, came in at -3.7% against consensus estimates for -3.3%, and worse than the a month earlier when it came in at -3.1%. The Heng Seng fell 0.1% on Wednesday and the Shanghai Stock Exchange posted a near 0.4% loss. But Robert Alster, head of investment services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, said there were some indications of a further rebound: China was ground-zero for the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, but it also appears to be leading the global recovery. Auto sales data looks to be strengthening, and with some factory levels almost back to pre-pandemic levels there is a real hope that the worst is in the rear-view mirror. Its role at the heart of the global economy has meant that Chinese inflation has historically acted as an indicator for other countries. It remains to be seen whether that\u2019s still the case in this new environment, where local effects will play a more prominent role in the basket of goods. Hurdles remain for the global recovery, with recent reports that logjams could be on the horizon for the shipping industry and emerging economies projected to shrink for the first time in sixty years. But as the US shows signs of greater bouncebackability, governments and central banks around the world will have their fingers crossed that a v-shaped recovery could be on the cards.\u201d The owner of dozens of magazines including The Week, Minecraft World and Viz has put a quarter of its UK staff into a redundancy consultation process as the coronavirus crisis hammers the publishing industry, the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney writes. Dennis Publishing, the company founded by the late media entrepreneur Felix Dennis, has begun a consultation process with 122 of its approximately 480 UK staff. The company is understood to be seeking to cut just over half of those staff involved in the consultation. The company, which was sold to private equity group Exponent two years ago for \u00a3166m, has a portfolio of titles mainly in the technology, fitness and cycling sectors. Brands range from Cyclist and Expert Reviews to Fortean Times and an unofficial guide to global phenomenon Fortnite. A spokesman for the company said: The impact of Covid-19 has been significant for the publishing sector.As a result, this week we will begin a redundancy consultation process here in the UK. We are fully committed to supporting employees in impacted groups throughout this period and ensuring that this process is fair and transparent. European stock markets are open for trading. While we\u2019re nowhere near some of the gains we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, all major indices are in positive territory: FTSE 100 is up 0.3% France\u2019s Cac 40 is up 0.6% Spain\u2019s IBEX is up 0.36% Germany\u2019s XETRA DAX is up 0.8% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business. Market headlines were dominated last night by news that the Nasdaq hit 10,000 for the first time and that US stocks had actually logged gains for 2020 overall. But the stunning recovery has not reverberated throughout global equity markets, which have not had the benefit of being home to lucrative tech stocks that have rallied as Covid-19 lockdowns took hold. But all eyes are now turning to the US Federal Reserve, which will give its first economic projections since the pandemic started to hit the US in February. Their estimates are expected to point to a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years. (It\u2019s worth noting that the Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold today, hence why most attention is aimed at the forecasts.) Growing tensions in Hong Kong have also weighed on investor sentiment, with stocks across Asia falling broadly into the red in Wednesday\u2019s session. More than 50 people were arrested in Hong Kong on Tuesday night after thousands of protesters took to the streets in defiance of a police order to mark the first anniversary of the anti-government movement. The agenda: 13:30pm BST: US CPI for May 19:00pm BST: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, to be followed by press conference",

      "body": "<p>After university, I signed up for Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s management trainee scheme. When I was pregnant with my first child, I went to see a nurse. I said to her: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse, you&nbsp;know.\u201d She said: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why you can\u2019t be.\u201d </p> <p>I started my training&nbsp;in 1983 at the Royal London hospital when my son was six months old. My sister had applied to do nursing at that same hospital a year before me \u2013 she was the first black nurse at the hospital. When she went for her interview, they tried to persuade her to train as a state-enrolled nurse, which is a lower grade than a registered general nurse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes patients would say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to have any black hands on me.\u2019 That was fairly common in the 1980s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She told me: \u201cWatch out, they\u2019ll try to push you into a lower grade.\u201d She was right. In my interview they started saying it would be better for me to be a state-enrolled nurse. I said: \u201cNo thank you, not with my qualifications, and if you don\u2019t want me I\u2019ve got an interview at Bart\u2019s down the road.\u201d That was my first experience of racism in the NHS.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes patients would say: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have any black hands on me.\u201d That was fairly common in the 1980s. It was obvious that some people didn\u2019t expect me to progress. They would be surprised that I had such a good education, as if black people couldn\u2019t go to university.&nbsp;But there were also people who were white and saw the talent I had. They created opportunities for me to flourish. </p> <p>When I took on the role of chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing in 2018 (to which I was permanently appointed in April 2019), I became the UK\u2019s second black female trade union leader. As a black leader, you are always aware that if you are not a good role model, someone coming up behind you may not be afforded the same opportunity you\u2019ve been given. There are, sadly, too few of us. We only have 10 black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) chief nurses across the whole of the NHS in England. The leadership of the NHS is not reflective of the workforce, or the communities we serve.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are huge structural issues at work when it comes to how BAME communities access healthcare in the UK. When you look at the outcomes for BAME patients, they\u2019re worse in almost every category, from heart disease to diabetes. In every community we work with, BAME patients suffer the most.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you rock up to your GP as a BAME person, your illness isn\u2019t taken as seriously. Sometimes it takes five or six visits before you get into the system. Every step of the way, from services to treatment, some BAME patients have a worse experience of the NHS than their white counterparts.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I\u2019m in the street, people don\u2019t see me as the head of the Royal College of Nursing; they see me as a black woman</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus has exposed the underlying healthcare inequalities experienced by BAME communities. People of Bangladeshi ethnicity <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/890258/disparities_review.pdf\">are twice as likely</a> to die of Covid-19 compared with white people. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Caribbean and black ethnicity have between a 10 and 50% higher risk of death from Covid-19 compared with white people [according to Public Health England]. That\u2019s before we even get on to the health and care staff who have died; at least 250, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">more than 60%</a> were from BAME communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>We need to recognise that this loss of life is deeply distressing.

      "bodyText": "After university, I signed up for Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s management trainee scheme. When I was pregnant with my first child, I went to see a nurse. I said to her: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse, you know.\u201d She said: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why you can\u2019t be.\u201d I started my training in 1983 at the Royal London hospital when my son was six months old. My sister had applied to do nursing at that same hospital a year before me \u2013 she was the first black nurse at the hospital. When she went for her interview, they tried to persuade her to train as a state-enrolled nurse, which is a lower grade than a registered general nurse. She told me: \u201cWatch out, they\u2019ll try to push you into a lower grade.\u201d She was right. In my interview they started saying it would be better for me to be a state-enrolled nurse. I said: \u201cNo thank you, not with my qualifications, and if you don\u2019t want me I\u2019ve got an interview at Bart\u2019s down the road.\u201d That was my first experience of racism in the NHS. Sometimes patients would say: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have any black hands on me.\u201d That was fairly common in the 1980s. It was obvious that some people didn\u2019t expect me to progress. They would be surprised that I had such a good education, as if black people couldn\u2019t go to university. But there were also people who were white and saw the talent I had. They created opportunities for me to flourish. When I took on the role of chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing in 2018 (to which I was permanently appointed in April 2019), I became the UK\u2019s second black female trade union leader. As a black leader, you are always aware that if you are not a good role model, someone coming up behind you may not be afforded the same opportunity you\u2019ve been given. There are, sadly, too few of us. We only have 10 black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) chief nurses across the whole of the NHS in England. The leadership of the NHS is not reflective of the workforce, or the communities we serve. There are huge structural issues at work when it comes to how BAME communities access healthcare in the UK. When you look at the outcomes for BAME patients, they\u2019re worse in almost every category, from heart disease to diabetes. In every community we work with, BAME patients suffer the most. When you rock up to your GP as a BAME person, your illness isn\u2019t taken as seriously. Sometimes it takes five or six visits before you get into the system. Every step of the way, from services to treatment, some BAME patients have a worse experience of the NHS than their white counterparts. Coronavirus has exposed the underlying healthcare inequalities experienced by BAME communities. People of Bangladeshi ethnicity are twice as likely to die of Covid-19 compared with white people. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Caribbean and black ethnicity have between a 10 and 50% higher risk of death from Covid-19 compared with white people [according to Public Health England]. That\u2019s before we even get on to the health and care staff who have died; at least 250, and more than 60% were from BAME communities. We need to recognise that this loss of life is deeply distressing. Every death is a tragedy. We need to understand how we can prevent this happening in the future. Do we need to give BAME healthcare workers better personal protective equipment? Should we redeploy them away from the frontline, in case there is a second wave of the pandemic? How are we risk-assessing our staff, to ensure that we aren\u2019t putting healthcare workers with underlying conditions at unnecessary risk? When I\u2019m in the street, people don\u2019t see me as the head of the Royal College of Nursing; they see me as a black woman. It\u2019s part of the everyday experience of my life, and my family\u2019s life. Whether it\u2019s being looked at differently in a shop, or my son being stopped repeatedly by police as he tries to make his way across London. Racism happens every day. It\u2019s about how I react to it. Coronavirus has shone a spotlight on the contributions made by immigrants to our NHS. Let\u2019s not forget that a year ago we had the government talking about a hostile environment. Too many immigrants were supposedly \u201ctaking our jobs\u201d. And now we\u2019re clapping immigrant healthcare workers. I hope we recognise the contribution healthcare workers make in a material sense. Let\u2019s not just have clapping or words of empty praise. If we value our nurses, let\u2019s pay them properly.",

      "body": "<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak reached the UK, health officials have recommended people stay at least 2 metres apart to reduce their risk of picking up the infection or spreading it to others.</p> \n<p>But in recent weeks, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd\">impact of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd\">the lockdown on the economy has become clearer</a>, the government has come under increasing pressure to relax the physical distancing rules so pubs, cafes and restaurants and other businesses can reopen fully.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s what the science says about physical distancing.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why does distance matter?</strong></h2> \n<p>Coronavirus spreads when virus particles get into the body through the eyes, nose or mouth. One route is via contaminated surfaces, such as door handles that are touched by people with virus on their hands. But the more common route of infection appears to be tiny virus-bearing droplets that are released into the air by coughs and sneezes, and to a lesser extent when people talk or shout. These droplets fall to the ground with the heaviest falling nearest to the infected person and the lightest falling further away. The aim of physical distancing is to be far enough away from an infected person to avoid the airborne droplets.</p> \n<h2><strong>What distance is recommended?</strong></h2> \n<p>Health officials in the UK recommend people keep at least 2 metres from each other. At that distance, they believe the risk of infection during face-to-face conversation reduces to an acceptable level. The same distance applies in Canada and Spain. But other countries are less cautious. In the US people are advised to keep <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html\">at least 6ft</a>, or 1.8 metres, apart. Other countries, such as Germany, Italy, Greece, Australia and the Netherlands have opted for 1.5 metres. South Korea advises 1.4 metres, and in France, Denmark, China, Hong Kong and Singapore it is 1 metre.</p> \n<h2><strong>Where do the numbers come from?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>In the 1930s, a Harvard sanitary engineer called William Wells proposed that some infectious diseases were spread by <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/20/3/611/280025?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">airborne droplets</a>. His experiments showed that most droplets sprayed from the mouth fell to the ground within 3ft, and so beyond this distance infection was unlikely. The result shaped scientific opinion on what is a safe distance and underlies the World Health Organization\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">1-metre recommendation</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But while 1 metre reduces the risk substantially, another coronavirus outbreak \u2013 Sars in 2003 \u2013 showed it may not be sufficient. Tests of passengers on one flight found that 90% who caught Sars from an infected passenger had been sitting <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa031349\">more than three feet away</a> from them. A distance of 6ft or 2 metres became the more cautious recommendation. The latest paper on physical distancing from the government\u2019s scientific advisory group on emergencies recommends keeping the 2-metre rule but states it \u201cshould be seen as a ballpark guide to distancing rather than an absolute value.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Is distance everything?</strong></h2> \n<p>No. The way a person is exposed to the virus and how long for are important too. Because coughs are more forceful than conversations, they propel droplets further. According to UK science advisers, exposure to one cough at 2 metres has a similar risk to talking with someone for a minute at 1 metre and for half an hour at 2 metres. Likewise, a six-second chat at 1 metre is comparable to a one minute conversation at 2 metres. Explaining the importance of the 2-metre guidance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance told the Commons health committee in May that the risk at 1 metre was 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at 2 metres.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Is it safe to reduce the distance?</strong></h2> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext\">recent Lancet study</a> commissioned by the World Health Organization found that the chance of transmitting or becoming infected by the virus, with no other protection in place such as a face mask, fell dramatically with distance. At 1 metre, the risk was 12.8% but this dropped to 2.6% at 1.5 metres and to about 1.3% at 2 metres.</p> \n<p>The decision on whether to reduce the distance must weigh up the direct public health risks from the virus and the harm caused by businesses folding or being unable to operate with 2-metre distancing enforced. \u201cI think it would be reasonable to reduce it to 1.5 metres as long as strict guidelines are in place for what else needs to be done,\u201d said Linda Bauld, a professor of public Health at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>What other measures do we need?</strong></h2> \n<p>Beyond handwashing and distancing where possible, wearing face masks and ensuring venues are well ventilated will all help.

      "bodyText": "Since the coronavirus outbreak reached the UK, health officials have recommended people stay at least 2 metres apart to reduce their risk of picking up the infection or spreading it to others. But in recent weeks, as the impact of the lockdown on the economy has become clearer, the government has come under increasing pressure to relax the physical distancing rules so pubs, cafes and restaurants and other businesses can reopen fully. Here\u2019s what the science says about physical distancing. Why does distance matter? Coronavirus spreads when virus particles get into the body through the eyes, nose or mouth. One route is via contaminated surfaces, such as door handles that are touched by people with virus on their hands. But the more common route of infection appears to be tiny virus-bearing droplets that are released into the air by coughs and sneezes, and to a lesser extent when people talk or shout. These droplets fall to the ground with the heaviest falling nearest to the infected person and the lightest falling further away. The aim of physical distancing is to be far enough away from an infected person to avoid the airborne droplets. What distance is recommended? Health officials in the UK recommend people keep at least 2 metres from each other. At that distance, they believe the risk of infection during face-to-face conversation reduces to an acceptable level. The same distance applies in Canada and Spain. But other countries are less cautious. In the US people are advised to keep at least 6ft, or 1.8 metres, apart. Other countries, such as Germany, Italy, Greece, Australia and the Netherlands have opted for 1.5 metres. South Korea advises 1.4 metres, and in France, Denmark, China, Hong Kong and Singapore it is 1 metre. Where do the numbers come from? In the 1930s, a Harvard sanitary engineer called William Wells proposed that some infectious diseases were spread by airborne droplets. His experiments showed that most droplets sprayed from the mouth fell to the ground within 3ft, and so beyond this distance infection was unlikely. The result shaped scientific opinion on what is a safe distance and underlies the World Health Organization\u2019s 1-metre recommendation. But while 1 metre reduces the risk substantially, another coronavirus outbreak \u2013 Sars in 2003 \u2013 showed it may not be sufficient. Tests of passengers on one flight found that 90% who caught Sars from an infected passenger had been sitting more than three feet away from them. A distance of 6ft or 2 metres became the more cautious recommendation. The latest paper on physical distancing from the government\u2019s scientific advisory group on emergencies recommends keeping the 2-metre rule but states it \u201cshould be seen as a ballpark guide to distancing rather than an absolute value.\u201d Is distance everything? No. The way a person is exposed to the virus and how long for are important too. Because coughs are more forceful than conversations, they propel droplets further. According to UK science advisers, exposure to one cough at 2 metres has a similar risk to talking with someone for a minute at 1 metre and for half an hour at 2 metres. Likewise, a six-second chat at 1 metre is comparable to a one minute conversation at 2 metres. Explaining the importance of the 2-metre guidance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance told the Commons health committee in May that the risk at 1 metre was 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at 2 metres. Is it safe to reduce the distance? A recent Lancet study commissioned by the World Health Organization found that the chance of transmitting or becoming infected by the virus, with no other protection in place such as a face mask, fell dramatically with distance. At 1 metre, the risk was 12.8% but this dropped to 2.6% at 1.5 metres and to about 1.3% at 2 metres. The decision on whether to reduce the distance must weigh up the direct public health risks from the virus and the harm caused by businesses folding or being unable to operate with 2-metre distancing enforced. \u201cI think it would be reasonable to reduce it to 1.5 metres as long as strict guidelines are in place for what else needs to be done,\u201d said Linda Bauld, a professor of public Health at the University of Edinburgh. What other measures do we need? Beyond handwashing and distancing where possible, wearing face masks and ensuring venues are well ventilated will all help. Bauld says there is a case for bar and restaurant staff wearing masks to prevent them unwittingly spreading infections. And when people are in proximity for some time, such as in the queue for the toilets, the more cautious 2-metre distancing rule is preferable to standing closer. Another important move is to improve air circulation by opening doors and windows, which will be easier in the UK over the summer than later in the year. Is it safer being outdoors? Yes. In an enclosed space such as a living room or bedroom there are no appreciable air currents to help disperse virus-containing droplets or extremely tiny aerosols. The latter tend to be smaller than five thousandths of a millimetre wide and can remain suspended in the air for some time. How important these are for spreading infection is unclear, however.",

Prof Gabriel Leung, the dean of the Li Ka Shing faculty of medicine at Hong Kong University, said: \u201cIf you look around the world, the places that have imposed border restrictions earlier on have tended to come out much better with local outbreaks.\u201d Leung said studies had shown where cases in the UK originated from. \u201cIf you had imposed border restrictions earlier on that picture would have looked quite different.\u201d The Home Office has relied on a scientific assessment that the number of imported cases were about 0.5% of domestic cases and as a result decided stricter border restrictions earlier on would not have had an impact. But the experts questioned this calculation. Prof Teo Yik Ying, the dean of Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, said: \u201cIn a country like Singapore, essentially all our cases are the result of importations. \u201cBe it secondary, tertiary or subsequent chains, I see this as crucial. When we start thinking of figures like 0.5% it grossly underestimates the impact of importation risk because everyone who comes in will seed additional clusters and each member within that cluster will go on and then it\u2019s the dangerous nature of Covid-19 being so infectious.\u201d He added: \u201cI would hesitate to put much faith in that figure of 0.5% - is it the only primary chain of infections? All the infections will be attributed to importations.\u201d Asked what they thought about reports giving the impression that Britons were \u201cclamouring\u201d to head overseas this summer on holidays, the experts all urged caution. Ying said summer overseas tourism \u201cdoes not sound like a good idea\u201d. \u201cIf we look at what the current situation in Asia is, for many countries in east Asia the cases are actually very low. Regardless of that, the government are not looking at mass-market travel and tourism.\u201d Leung said: \u201cIt would be premature for any kind of mass-market holiday.\u201d All the experts said it was not too late to enforce border controls but they had to play a part alongside physical distancing and test-and-trace systems.",

In recent years, the idiosyncrasies and charm of regional shows have quietly been replaced by a cheaper, identikit radio. In 2019, Global Radio replaced the 40-plus local breakfast shows across its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three nationwide programmes hosted from London. The formula was simple enough: replace local hosts with big names based in the capital and beam one blanket service out to the regions. Now the commercial group Bauer has announced plans to fold almost 50 regional radio outlets into a national network. It means dozens more towns and cities across England will lose their own distinctive local radio stations later this year, with stations such as York\u2019s Minster FM and the West Midlands\u2019 Signal 107 being replaced with largely syndicated programmes made in London, hundreds of miles from the communities they serve. It has also recently emerged that the BBC is considering axing its regional current affairs television shows. The award-winning Inside Out series of investigative programmes has already had its autumn series cancelled \u2013 and budget cuts mean bosses have launched a review of all regional programming in England. MPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, have criticised the move but offered no promise of a reprieve. If this is the end of regional output, it is going out with a whimper.

      "body": "<p>While uncertainty over the reopening of English schools continues to provoke anger, concern and incredulity in the UK, other European countries have been sending children back to class for weeks - if not months. Here\u2019s what 10 of them are doing, or are planning to do.</p> \n<h2>Germany</h2> \n<p>Reopening rules vary considerably between Germany\u2019s 16 states, but schools across the country have been gradually returning over the past three to four weeks, operating strict shift patterns.</p> \n<p>Classes are often divided in two, with half of pupils attending one day, the other half the next, but only for &nbsp;two to three hours a day. Priority was given to older pupils who had exams, with primary school pupils the last to return.</p> \n<p>The plan in some states is for all classes in schools and kindergartens to return before the start of the summer break - which is staggered across the country but starts as early as 22 June \u2013 although many headteachers have said staff shortages and physical distancing measures of 1.5 metres mean this is not realistic.</p> \n<p>Pupils have to stay in one classroom for all their lessons. Breaktimes are monitored, with pupils banned from playing contact games. The government says the goal is for schools to be running more or less normally when the new school year begins in August, but that will depend on there being no new coronavirus wave.</p> \n<h2>France</h2> \n<p>In<strong> </strong>France,<strong> </strong>infant and primary schools and the lower secondary school years reopened before caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants. Under France\u2019s very centralised education&nbsp;system, the government has ordered schools in most of the country outside the Paris region and the overseas territory Mayotte to open, while ensuring a maximum 15 pupils per class and physical distancing.

      "bodyText": "While uncertainty over the reopening of English schools continues to provoke anger, concern and incredulity in the UK, other European countries have been sending children back to class for weeks - if not months. Here\u2019s what 10 of them are doing, or are planning to do. Germany Reopening rules vary considerably between Germany\u2019s 16 states, but schools across the country have been gradually returning over the past three to four weeks, operating strict shift patterns. Classes are often divided in two, with half of pupils attending one day, the other half the next, but only for two to three hours a day. Priority was given to older pupils who had exams, with primary school pupils the last to return. The plan in some states is for all classes in schools and kindergartens to return before the start of the summer break - which is staggered across the country but starts as early as 22 June \u2013 although many headteachers have said staff shortages and physical distancing measures of 1.5 metres mean this is not realistic. Pupils have to stay in one classroom for all their lessons. Breaktimes are monitored, with pupils banned from playing contact games. The government says the goal is for schools to be running more or less normally when the new school year begins in August, but that will depend on there being no new coronavirus wave. France In France, infant and primary schools and the lower secondary school years reopened before caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants. Under France\u2019s very centralised education system, the government has ordered schools in most of the country outside the Paris region and the overseas territory Mayotte to open, while ensuring a maximum 15 pupils per class and physical distancing. Teachers and children over 11 are expected to wear masks. Infant and primary schools in half the country have been open since a few days after the end of the strict two-month lockdown on 11 May, with the above conditions, meaning pupils have been taught in alternate half-classes, though the return to school was not obligatory and priority was given to the children of essential workers. The two lower years of secondary schools - sixth and fifth grade \u2013 returned the following week, 18 May, under the same rules. The remaining secondary school years in the \u201cgreen zone\u201d \u2013 where the virus was deemed to pose little risk \u2013 have progressively opened since 2 June. In the \u201corange zone\u201d, including the Paris region where the virus is still of concern, most secondary schools/lyc\u00e9es have remained shut. Ireland Schools in Ireland are to start reopening on a phased basis from late August, more than five months after they shut \u2013 and well after the reopening of shops, pubs and cafes. Some parents and others have complained this is too slow but school managers and teachers\u2019 unions have agreed in principle to the plan. However, logistics around cleaning, protective equipment and physical distancing remain unclear. Ireland has some of Europe\u2019s biggest class sizes, raising doubts about proposed \u201cpods\u201d of four children grouped together in a classroom. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the return to school was not a \u201cno-risk scenario but we know it\u2019s a low-risk scenario\u201d. Denmark Denmark became the first country in Europe to reopen primary schools in mid-April, letting the youngest children return first to daycare, kindergarten, and primary schools. Denmark\u2019s schools started off with a 2-metre social distancing rule, but this was reduced to 1 metre on 7 May, while for kindergarteners, distancing has been removed altogether. Instead, children stay in \u201cprotective bubbles\u201d \u2013 keeping to their own zones in the playground in small groups and sticking with the same teacher. Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and parents are not allowed inside schools. Children aged 11 and over returned to school from 18 May, separated into smaller groups and taught outside wherever possible. Hands must be washed at least every two hours, and equipment \u2013 such as toys and tablets \u2013 is disinfected after use. Italy Schools in Italy finished for the summer break earlier this week and the education ministry is working to establish under which criteria they will reopen from September. Italy was the first European country to close schools and universities on 4 March, days before the national coronavirus lockdown. A definitive date for the reopening of schools is yet to be set, but when they do reopen they will probably need to maintain a 1-metre physical distance rule in classrooms, ensure that children over six wear masks, and deny entrance to anyone with a temperature of more than 37.5C. School opening hours might also be reduced and lessons staggered. Spain Under Spain\u2019s ongoing and staggered lockdown exit, some children have been returning to partially reopened schools since late May, but attendance has been on a voluntary basis and dependent on the situation in each of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions. The education system\u2019s return to what the central government calls \u201cthe new normality\u201d will not begin in earnest until the new school year starts in September. On Wednesday, Spain\u2019s education minister, Isabel Cela\u00e1, said the government was working towards the reopening of schools \u201cfor all students\u201d in September. Draft plans include physical distancing of 1.5 metres between students, and masks obligatory for children over the age of six, while children aged 10 and under could be taught in \u201cbubbles\u201d without the need for distancing. Cela\u00e1 \u2013 who had previously said schools would have to operate at 50% of pupil capacity \u2013 told Cadena Ser radio that the continuing absence of physical classes would only cause more problems for vulnerable children. Belgium All primary schools resumed classes in full in Belgium on 8 June with few adaptations required to classrooms or the normal interaction between teachers and pupils. The decision to bring children back had been led by the Dutch-speaking Flemish region. An announcement by Ben Weyts, the Flemish minister for education, of his plan to reopen nurseries and primary schools proved to be a challenge to the federal government, which subsequently made a nationwide ruling. It has been left up to local authorities to decide on the reopening of their secondary schools with the condition that pupils are able to maintain physical distancing and that there is a staggering of classes through the week. The government has said it will not sanction parents who do not return their children to schools for the last month of the academic year. Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland Most governments in central and eastern Europe have taken the decision to keep schools closed, despite much lower coronavirus rates compared with western Europe. Politicians in the region have erred on the side of caution, with early and strict lockdowns and only gradual easing. In the Czech Republic, students up to fifth grade can attend school on a voluntary basis as of last week, but high schools will not return until September. A similar decision has been taken in Hungary, where teachers and students can meet in small groups if necessary but proper schooling will not start until after summer holidays. In Poland, kindergartens have been open since mid-May but there is no prospect of schools restarting before September.

      "bodyText": "France is to lift its state of emergency on 10 July, Denmark said opening its bars, restaurants and malls had not led to a rise in infections, and Austria will reopen its border with Italy next week as EU nations pursue their steady exits from lockdown. However, Germany extended its coronavirus travel warnings for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August and reports suggested that Moscow\u2019s death toll may be twice as high as Russia\u2019s official figures. Beyond Europe, it emerged that the World Health Organization has told Pakistan that it should impose successive intermittent lockdowns to curb a sharp increase in new cases that has accompanied the country\u2019s loosening of lockdown restrictions. With the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care falling below 1,000, France\u2019s parliament is to debate new legislation allowing the government to lift its current state of emergency while keeping certain measures in place to avoid a second wave. The new rules, which are intended to last until November but could be amended as necessary, would allow the government to control people\u2019s movement and access to public transport, order public spaces to close and reinforce mandatory mask-wearing. Denmark said the spread of Covid-19 had not accelerated since it entered its second phase of exiting lockdown early last month. \u201cThe level of contagion in society is still very low,\u201d the national health authority said, with the number of confirmed new infections continuing to fall despite an increase in the number of tests. Austria said it would allow free travel with most other European countries, including Italy, from 16 June. However, travel between Austria and Sweden, Spain, Portugal and the UK will remain restricted, and a travel warning remains in place for Lombardy in northern Italy, one of the hardest-hit regions. Germany, which last week downgraded its travel warning for 32 European countries, on Wednesday announced the end of inbound border controls for all EU citizens except those coming from Sweden, but maintained its ban on travel to 160 other countries until the end of the summer. Poland announced a similar decision, saying it would open its borders with fellow EU states on Saturday and allow flights from next Tuesday. \u201cIn some countries ... the pandemic is still behaving in a very disturbing way, so for now we limit this decision to EU countries,\u201d the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Reports that Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years, meanwhile, indicated the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least double the official tally, casting further doubt on the accuracy of Russia\u2019s Covid-19 death figure. The Russian capital reportedly had 5,799 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d for the month of May but has recorded only 2,750 deaths primarily due to coronavirus. The data is in line with other major cities, including St Petersburg, where total mortality rates have shown thousands of deaths not reflected in official coronavirus tallies. Since the start of Pakistan\u2019s outbreak in March, the prime minister, Imran Khan, has opposed a nationwide lockdown, arguing the impoverished country could not afford it and instead ordering a patchwork of closures, now being lifted. But health officials on Wednesday declared a record number of new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to more than 113,000 cases and 2,200 deaths, although the real rates are thought to be far higher. The WHO\u2019s regional office in Africa confirmed on Wednesday that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases on the continent had passed 200,000, with 201,157 people testing positive and 5,486 deaths. Again, the real figures are likely to be higher. As the global economic fallout from the pandemic continued to worsen, the OECD predicted the world economy would contract by at least 6% this year amid unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by countries\u2019 measures to contain the outbreak. In the event of a second wave of infections later in the year, economic output could shrink by as much as 7.6%, and in either case recovery will be \u201cslow and uncertain\u201d. France\u2019s economy minister said the country could have 800,000 job losses. Underlining the extent of the economic damage, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said airlines were set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the pandemic, with revenue likely to halve to $419bn from $838bn last year. In other developments worldwide: According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, Covid-19 has infected nearly 7,300,000 people and killed more than 411,000. The EU accused China and Russia of running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the pandemic. Greece said it had resumed production of chloroquine to treat people with Covid-19 and would continue trials with the drug, despite a major UK trial run by Oxford University concluding there was no evidence it worked. Iran announced more than 2,000 new infections, in line with a recent rise that its president, Hassan Rouhani, has attributed to increased testing. Taiwan said no new cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed on its territory in the past 24 hours, the 59th consecutive day without a local infection. Indonesia reported its biggest daily increase in cases for a second successive day, with 1,241 new infections taking its total to 34,316 and a death toll of 1,959. Nearly all economic and social activities have resumed in Malaysia after nearly three months in lockdown curbed the spread of the virus. Malaysians are now returning to school and can travel for domestic holidays, get haircuts and shop at street markets.",

      "bodyText": "The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven by relatives of coronavirus victims into alleged errors made by authorities at the beginning of the pandemic. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, will also question the health minister, Roberto Speranza and the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, over the failure by authorities to quarantine the towns of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro after outbreaks occurred there. The move came after grieving families of Covid-19 victims on Wednesday submitted the first 50 complaints to Bergamo prosecutors as they pushed for an investigation into possible criminal negligence by authorities. The files were brought together by members of NOI Denunceremo (we will denounce), a Facebook group set up in April. \u201cWe haven\u2019t identified culprits in the files but the other day we spoke to the prosecutor and explained that our main objective is to find out the truth,\u201d Luca Fusco, the president of NOI Denunceremo, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in convictions, we just want to understand what happened. If we understand what happened we can change a system that made mistakes.\u201d Bergamo has so far registered more than 13,600 coronavirus infections and more than 3,000 deaths, according to official figures.

Meanwhile, tests carried out on 9,965 people in the province between 23 April and 3 June showed 57% had Covid-19 antibodies, local health authorities said on Monday. Relatives of the deceased believe authorities made serious errors, especially at the beginning of the outbreak, such as only briefly closing a hospital in the town of Alzano Lombardo after the first coronavirus infection was detected there on 23 February and failing to quarantine the town and the nearby Nembro. Ten towns in the Lombardy province of Lodi went into lockdown on 21 February, after Italy\u2019s first locally transmitted case was confirmed, but Bergamo was only quarantined with the rest of the Lombardy region on 8 March. The families are also asking prosecutors to investigate the alleged failure by authorities to sufficiently inform people of the risk of infection, the lack of personal protective equipment in healthcare facilities and the lack of effective and timely medical assistance. Bergamo prosecutors also recently questioned Lombardy\u2019s regional head, Attilio Fontana, and the region\u2019s health councillor, Giulio Gallera. NOI Denunceremo was set up initially by Fusco as a platform for relatives to share their stories, and has since attracted more than 56,000 members.

There are genuine concerns some clubs will not make it that far. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a few stadiums were locked up and never opened again,\u201d says Warne, a former Rotherham, Oldham and Yeovil midfielder. \u201cI hope that isn\u2019t the case but unfortunately the staff at clubs are always the first to go. \u201cWhen teams fall out of the Championship, it is always peripheral coaching staff that are first to go \u2013 Nigel Clough fell on his sword recently. Some teams might go from two masseurs, two physios and two sports scientists to all of sudden just having one of each. It\u2019s the same on the media side and people in the club shop. It hits a lot of people. There will be tough decisions for a lot of people in the next weeks and months.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Streaming services such as Netflix, Stan, Apple and Amazon could soon be required to pay into a fund for Australian productions or to make shows in Australia as part of the federal government\u2019s plans to assist the struggling entertainment industry. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, flagged last week that the government was developing an assistance package for the sprawling entertainment and arts sector, which has been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance \u2013 the union covering actors, production workers and journalists \u2013 many industry workers were ineligible for jobkeeper because they were employed on short contracts for different productions or were freelancers. A union survey of 1,000 members found that one in five were ineligible for either jobkeeper or jobseeker, which has assets and spouse income tests. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the government was turning its attention to more targeted measures for heavily affected sectors, including arts, entertainment and film. The aim was to get the arts sector back to work once the shutdown ended, he said. Among the immediate measures being sought by industry is government support for insurance for the film and television industry so they can get productions off the ground. Many are facing extra costs and longer shoot times due to social distancing rules and the possibility of disruption if a crew member contracts the coronavirus. While series like Home and Away have multiple plots which can accommodate absences of some characters, feature films with high-profile actors would struggle if they were forced to halt due to Covid-19. This is making it difficult to get the insurance necessary to restart local productions. Australia\u2019s film promotion arm, Ausfilm, has also made a pitch for more funding for the location incentive fund, a $140m fund that assists in luring foreign productions to Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald reported it was seeking a top-up and a more generous incentives to lure more foreign productions, such as the two Marvel movies being shot in Fox Studios. But the biggest issue will be how to encourage Australian production. Screen Producers Australia\u2019s CEO, Mathew Deaner, said bringing international players to Australia was important, but making that the focus of assistance risked turning Australia into a service hub, rather than encouraging local creativity and productions. \u201cOur ambition should be to pivot this into local IP and local exports,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to think about opportunities to take the lead in local production.\u201d The government temporarily suspended the Australian drama quota and the children\u2019s television quota for the commercial television industry during the pandemic. This is one of the cornerstones that drives local television production. But just before Covid-19 struck, two government agencies \u2013 the Australian Communications and Media Authority and Screen Australia \u2013 released an options paper on alternatives to quotas. These ranged from the status quo to deregulation of the industry. But the option that appears to have captured most attention is the third option, which involves all platforms being subject to local content rules, including the streaming services, such as Apple, Netflix and Stan, which currently have no Australian content obligations. Stan has invested in local production. The move by the government to expand the obligations to streaming services comes as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has recommended that Google and Facebook be required to compensate media companies for content they publish. Other countries have either mandated or encouraged companies such as Netflix and Apple TV to make programs in their territories and in their languages. The move to include the streaming services is broadly supported by the commercial television networks, which are likely to face huge financial pressures on their advertising revenues in the post Covid-19 economy. Some participants in the roundtables with the minister said he seemed interested in the Canadian approach, which has set up a public-private partnership to fund Canadian programs that foster Canadian cultural values. The proposal contains a number of variations, including an option that all providers of video services could be permitted to negotiate a bespoke agreement with the ACMA on their Australian content, rather than facing a one-size-fits-all requirement.

Samantha Page, the chief executive of the peak group Early Childhood Australia, said the temporary relief package generated widespread uncertainty across the sector as it was announced just a few days before it came into effect in April. \u201cThe whole idea of switching off fees completely and receiving these fixed payments and not knowing whether you were eligible for jobkeeper or not at that time brought out some of the worst survival tendencies, if you like, in the sector,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a real pity. I wish the government from that experience had learned the lessons of the need to consult and consult widely and actually test solutions with the sector.\u201d The government is now preparing to wind up the temporary relief package and reintroduce childcare fees and the old childcare subsidy on 13 July as it says demand has been steadily increasing from when it plummeted at the height of the pandemic and the system has \u201cdone its job\u201d. Under the emergency funding package, the government has been paying services half of their pre-crisis fee revenue or half of the old childcare subsidy rate cap \u2013 \u201cwhichever is lower\u201d. Services were prohibited from charging families any fees, removing a chunk of the old revenue they could access. While the relief package was intended to work together with the jobkeeper wage subsidy of $1,500 per worker per fortnight, there were persistent concerns that some services did not meet the test for the payment and those that did qualify could not claim it for some casuals or work visa holders. Services have been allowed to limit attendance based on the funding they have at their disposal, but with priority given to the children of essential workers or from vulnerable home environments. In late April, the education department emailed childcare providers to warn their funding could be cut off if they were found to be excessively limiting their capacity during the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesperson for the education department told Guardian Australia on Wednesday: \u201cFor the period 2 April 2020 to 5 June 2020, the childcare tip-off line was contacted 1,916 times and 192 services have been contacted by the department in relation to their obligations under the relief package.\u201d The government\u2019s plan to reintroduce fees next month came under attack in parliament on Wednesday. Labor\u2019s early education spokesperson, Amanda Rishworth, told the lower house that \u201cthis policy to bring back high childcare fees in the middle of a recession will be a job crusher for women and a wallet smasher for families\u201d. Challenged in question time over his promise last week to keep jobkeeper in place for six months, Scott Morrison denied that he had broken his commitment by moving childcare workers off the wage subsidy from 20 July and bringing in a $708m sector-wide transition payment. \u201cThe jobkeeper legislation does remain in place until the end of September, but where there is a better way to do things, we won\u2019t step aside from doing them in a better way,\u201d the prime minister told parliament. \u201cWe sought and have received an employment guarantee as a result of providing those transition payments to the childcare sector.\u201d Guardian Australia asked the education department to explain what level of childcare attendance it assumed or predicted in the second half of July after fees returned. In a more general response, the department\u2019s spokesperson said survey data from the sector indicated overall attendance hours were 74% of pre-Covid-19 levels in the week beginning 11 May, and that \u201cdemand is expected to continue to increase through June and July\u201d. The spokesperson said the government \u201cconsidered multiple scenarios to assist in transitioning\u201d to the return to the childcare subsidy and included changes to the activity test and fee capping \u201cto support families to access care\u201d. \u201cAll transition measures will be reviewed at the end of the 12-week transition period,\u201d the spokesperson said. The final comment suggests the government is keeping its options open depending on how the changes play out. It may face calls to continue with a relaxed activity test beyond October. Page said demand may continue to rise if childcare remained free \u2013 but the reintroduction of fees came during uncertain economic times, with unemployment high and household incomes down. She called on the government to closely monitor how the reintroduction of fees affected two groups \u2013 children and parents. \u201cIt\u2019s really risky because we don\u2019t know what parents\u2019 capacity to pay is,\u201d Page said. \u201cMy prediction \u2013 and I don\u2019t have any hard data on this \u2013 is that a lot of families will want to keep their foot in the door and will ask to reduce their [childcare] hours because they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d She said she hoped parents did not end up \u201cstuck between a rock and a hard place\u201d, not being able to take on extra shifts at work because of the financial impost of childcare.",

      "bodyText": "About 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister announced the new easing of social restrictions at his daily press conference in a move to alleviate loneliness among adults struggling on their own. The guidelines will apply from midnight on Saturday, meaning some grandparents will be able to hug their grandchildren for the first time and some couples can be reunited. The new rules will mean single parents and children under 18 that they live with, as well as single adults living alone, can go inside one other household and even stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing. A single-person household will be able to join together with a multi-person household, so a lone parent could, for example, visit their children\u2019s grandparents in another part of England for help and stay for an extended period. It will also mean a couple who live apart can be together for the first time during the lockdown, if at least one of them lives alone. However, any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, so it would mean hard choices for a group of people living together with partners who live alone elsewhere. It will also not apply to people told to shield, who are meant to be isolating until the end of June apart from being able to meet one other person outside their home. If any member of the support bubble developed coronavirus symptoms, all the members would have to follow the normal advice on household isolation. Explaining the new rules, Johnson said: \u201cWe are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures. \u201cIt\u2019s a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions. \u201cIt is emphatically not designed for people who don\u2019t qualify to start meeting inside other people\u2019s homes, because that remains against the law.\u201d There were 8.2 million people living alone last year and 2.9 million lone parent households, according to the Office for National Statistics. \u201cWe would want to make sure that people who have been suffering from loneliness, and have been unable to see their families for a long time, the rest of their families, are able to do that,\u201d Johnson added. The news is likely to be met with relief from people who live alone but frustration among others who will still not be able to meet loved ones unless physically distancing outside in groups of up to six. Officials admitted the measure was not going to benefit everyone but was targeted at those who had been left isolated by the lockdown restrictions. The government has been criticised for prioritising the reopening of the economy, including zoos, shops and outdoor cinemas, above people\u2019s social contact with their families and the full return of schools. However, ministers and the scientific advisers have stressed that the biggest risk of transmission is within households rather than distanced workplaces, so they have been acting with caution to ease restrictions on families meeting each other. One exemption to the exclusivity rule will be that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households, so the children of separated parents could potentially be in two separate support bubbles \u2013 one bubble for each parent.",

      "bodyText": "Scottish health board figures for tests on care home staff and residents reveal a \u201cscandalous\u201d postcode lottery, with significant divergence in how different parts of the country are coping with new testing policy. Scotland\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, pledged on 28 May to offer weekly tests to all 50,000 care home workers. Last Friday, after concerns were raised about the uptake of the policy, she sent a strongly worded letter to health board chief executives last Friday, telling them that directives were \u201cnot for local interpretation\u201d, and that board-by-board data on the number of completed tests would now be published weekly. The figures show Scotland\u2019s largest health board, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, tested 1,127 care home staff in the past week, compared with Dumfries and Galloway, which tested only four, a large differential even when adjusted for population. Fife, which has around 40 care homes, tested 178 staff and only 30 residents over the past week, although the data does not offer context on whether settings had ongoing coronavirus outbreaks. NHS Borders tested 22 staff and 13 residents over the past week, after ITV Border reported on Tuesday that the health board had written to the Scottish government saying it had \u201cno capacity\u201d to bring in ministers\u2019 policy of regularly testing all staff in care homes. Publishing the tables, the Scottish government added the caveat that the data did not include tests that were carried out by UK routes \u2013 regional testing centres and mobile testing \u2013 and \u201ctherefore is likely to underestimate testing for staff\u201d. Freeman and the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks as they face growing criticism from across the Holyrood chamber over care home deaths, which exceeded those in hospitals for the first time last week according to National Records of Scotland figures. Nearly 1,000 elderly patients were discharged from hospitals into care homes at the start of the pandemic without testing, a figure at first significantly under-reported by the Scottish government, and many staff fear that this had fatal results. The policy to test all hospital patients twice before they are discharged to care homes was only announced on 22 April.

      "body": "<p>Wednesday is Boris Johnson\u2019s take your inner child to work day. The day when he falls out of bed, puts on a suit, uses a brush to turn his hair into a total state and rides out of his Downing Street flat to first face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/10/keir-starmer-tells-pm-to-take-responsibility-for-his-failures-on-schools\">prime minister\u2019s questions</a> in the Commons before doing his weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">coronavirus press briefing</a> at 5pm.</p> <p>Quite what he does in the intervening six days, almost no one has a clue as he is rarely spotted in the wild and there is no visible evidence of any action. Though many of us \u2013 including a large number of Tory MPs who are beginning to think they might have backed the wrong man as his approval and competency ratings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/tory-poll-lead-collapses-as-voters-say-cummings-should-go\">plummet</a> \u2013 would dearly love to know. Perhaps he has been taking time out to catch up with the third series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/ozark-is-brilliant-sprawling-and-intense-gemma-whelans-lockdown-tv\">Ozark</a>.</p> <p>Fair to say that until now Boris has taken a hammering from Keir Starmer at PMQs. Exposed for the petulant narcissist he so clearly is. Yet on Wednesday he escaped with his pride more or less intact. Not because he was any better at responding to the questions \u2013 Boris has yet to answer any question directly or truthfully \u2013 but more because the Labour leader seemed vaguely distracted and not at the top of his game. Perhaps it had all got too easy for Starmer and he had come to believe that all he needed to do was turn up, do his surgical QC schtick and wipe the floor with the prime minister.</p> <p>After an unsatisfactory opening skirmish on racism in the UK \u2013 surely now would have been the time for Starmer to ask if Boris regretted his own use of the terms \u201cpicaninnies\u201d \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d and whether that might have normalised racist attitudes to people from BAME communities \u2013 in which Boris was allowed to suggest he had already implemented the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">Lammy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush</a> reports in full, the Labour leader did land a telling blow on the coronavirus death rate. Which bit of the excess 63,000 deaths was the PM proud of?</p> <p>Boris\u2019s reply that it was too early to make international comparisons fell hopelessly flat. How many people does he need to die \u2013 100,000? 200,000? \u2013 before he admits the UK response to the pandemic has been far worse than almost every other country in the world? If we had the mortality rates of South Korea or Germany, Boris would be the first person to sing his own praises. World-beating only cuts one way for Johnson.</p> <p>You could tell that Boris sensed he was getting away with it as Starmer moved on to the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/10/keir-starmer-tells-pm-to-take-responsibility-for-his-failures-on-schools\">failure to plan for children returning to school</a>. The familiar entitled confidence and swagger began to shine through. Out came the long words (\u201ctergiversation\u201d was reminiscent of a wannabe Will Self, only without the smack) as first he accused Starmer of being a rent-a-gob lawyer \u2013 a bit rich coming from someone who has been sacked from several jobs for lying \u2013 and then brazenly insisting it was basically Labour\u2019s fault that most children would not go back to school before September at the earliest.</p> <p>By now Starmer had run out of questions, so he had to just suck it up as Johnson began to ad lib like some bloated Mr Toad. The two-metre rule was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/englands-2-metre-distancing-rule-still-under-review\">under review</a> \u2013 as in would be dispensed with ASAP regardless of what the scientific advice happened to be \u2013 and the world would be returning to some kind of order. What was the point of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/uk-zoos-and-safari-parks-to-reopen-from-15-june\">reopening zoos</a> and theme parks if kids were stuck in schools unable to enjoy them?</p> <p>The Labour leader shook his head. He had missed a trick, but wouldn\u2019t be making the mistake of underestimating his opponent again. In the end it was the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman who landed the most telling blow by asking the prime minister to condemn Donald Trump\u2019s response to the death of George Floyd. Boris couldn\u2019t even bring himself to equivocate, instead calling the US \u201ca bastion of peace and freedom\u201d. A response that confirmed what many people think he really believes: that when push comes to shove, Black Lives Don\u2019t Really Matter.</p> <p>After a couple of hours\u2019 shut-eye, Johnson was back on view \u2013 he\u2019d make a good exhibit in the sloth enclosure for next Monday\u2019s zoo reopenings \u2013 for the Downing Street press briefing. Here, once he had waffled his way through his big announcement that single people were now free to resume their affairs \u2013 who could he have had in mind? \u2013 things got noticeably more tricky for Boris than they had been at PMQs.</p> <p>Why had he been so disorganised in getting children back to school? \u201cUm ...\u201d said Boris. He\u2019d have liked to get children back sooner but that would have meant a level of planning and preparation of which his government was completely incapable. Besides, it had been impossible to predict you could only get 15 kids in a classroom even though everyone had been saying just that for months. In any case, the UK wasn\u2019t doing noticeably worse on schools than any other countries. Here was one international comparison he was happy to make.</p> <p>Boris initially dodged the more telling question raised by Prof Neil Ferguson earlier in the afternoon that the UK could have halved its death rate by introducing lockdown a week earlier, instead letting Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty take the flak. Both advisers are now showing worrying signs of having gone over to the dark side. Vallance merely played for time by talking of a range of different scenarios while Whitty initially answered a completely different question to the one asked, before his integrity kicked in. Eventually, though, after repeated questioning on the same subject, Boris was backed into a corner by Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, who asked if there was something he regretted. Anything he might have done differently. The prime minister merely hummed and hawed.</p> <p>\u201cBut you take the decisions,\u201d Rigby insisted. This seemed to come as news to Boris. He hadn\u2019t realised that was part of the job description and scuttled out of the room as soon as was indecently possible. Not to be seen again for another week.</p>",

Not because he was any better at responding to the questions \u2013 Boris has yet to answer any question directly or truthfully \u2013 but more because the Labour leader seemed vaguely distracted and not at the top of his game. Perhaps it had all got too easy for Starmer and he had come to believe that all he needed to do was turn up, do his surgical QC schtick and wipe the floor with the prime minister. After an unsatisfactory opening skirmish on racism in the UK \u2013 surely now would have been the time for Starmer to ask if Boris regretted his own use of the terms \u201cpicaninnies\u201d \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d and whether that might have normalised racist attitudes to people from BAME communities \u2013 in which Boris was allowed to suggest he had already implemented the Lammy and Windrush reports in full, the Labour leader did land a telling blow on the coronavirus death rate. Which bit of the excess 63,000 deaths was the PM proud of? Boris\u2019s reply that it was too early to make international comparisons fell hopelessly flat. How many people does he need to die \u2013 100,000? 200,000? \u2013 before he admits the UK response to the pandemic has been far worse than almost every other country in the world? If we had the mortality rates of South Korea or Germany, Boris would be the first person to sing his own praises. World-beating only cuts one way for Johnson. You could tell that Boris sensed he was getting away with it as Starmer moved on to the government\u2019s failure to plan for children returning to school. The familiar entitled confidence and swagger began to shine through. Out came the long words (\u201ctergiversation\u201d was reminiscent of a wannabe Will Self, only without the smack) as first he accused Starmer of being a rent-a-gob lawyer \u2013 a bit rich coming from someone who has been sacked from several jobs for lying \u2013 and then brazenly insisting it was basically Labour\u2019s fault that most children would not go back to school before September at the earliest. By now Starmer had run out of questions, so he had to just suck it up as Johnson began to ad lib like some bloated Mr Toad. The two-metre rule was under review \u2013 as in would be dispensed with ASAP regardless of what the scientific advice happened to be \u2013 and the world would be returning to some kind of order. What was the point of reopening zoos and theme parks if kids were stuck in schools unable to enjoy them? The Labour leader shook his head. He had missed a trick, but wouldn\u2019t be making the mistake of underestimating his opponent again. In the end it was the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman who landed the most telling blow by asking the prime minister to condemn Donald Trump\u2019s response to the death of George Floyd. Boris couldn\u2019t even bring himself to equivocate, instead calling the US \u201ca bastion of peace and freedom\u201d. A response that confirmed what many people think he really believes: that when push comes to shove, Black Lives Don\u2019t Really Matter. After a couple of hours\u2019 shut-eye, Johnson was back on view \u2013 he\u2019d make a good exhibit in the sloth enclosure for next Monday\u2019s zoo reopenings \u2013 for the Downing Street press briefing. Here, once he had waffled his way through his big announcement that single people were now free to resume their affairs \u2013 who could he have had in mind? \u2013 things got noticeably more tricky for Boris than they had been at PMQs. Why had he been so disorganised in getting children back to school? \u201cUm ...\u201d said Boris. He\u2019d have liked to get children back sooner but that would have meant a level of planning and preparation of which his government was completely incapable. Besides, it had been impossible to predict you could only get 15 kids in a classroom even though everyone had been saying just that for months. In any case, the UK wasn\u2019t doing noticeably worse on schools than any other countries. Here was one international comparison he was happy to make. Boris initially dodged the more telling question raised by Prof Neil Ferguson earlier in the afternoon that the UK could have halved its death rate by introducing lockdown a week earlier, instead letting Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty take the flak. Both advisers are now showing worrying signs of having gone over to the dark side. Vallance merely played for time by talking of a range of different scenarios while Whitty initially answered a completely different question to the one asked, before his integrity kicked in. Eventually, though, after repeated questioning on the same subject, Boris was backed into a corner by Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, who asked if there was something he regretted. Anything he might have done differently. The prime minister merely hummed and hawed. \u201cBut you take the decisions,\u201d Rigby insisted. This seemed to come as news to Boris. He hadn\u2019t realised that was part of the job description and scuttled out of the room as soon as was indecently possible. Not to be seen again for another week.",

Earlier, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, repeatedly accused the government of having no coherent plan for the return of all pupils. \u201cWhat it required for that to happen was a robust national plan, consensus among all key stakeholders and strong leadership from the top,\u201d Starmer told the Commons. \u201cAll three are missing. The current arrangements lie in tatters. Parents have lost confidence in the government\u2019s approach. Millions of children will miss six months\u2019 worth of schooling, and inequality will now go up.\u201d In response, Johnson accused Starmer of inconsistency on the subject, saying Labour had previously suggested the plan to get primary schools fully back in June was going too fast. The government is also facing controversy over its plans for exam results, as teachers\u2019 leaders in England called for GCSEs and A-levels grade boundaries to be relaxed this summer to ensure pupils are not unfairly disadvantaged. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, told MPs on the Commons education committee that the qualifications regulator, Ofqual, should consider relaxing the boundaries so more pupils receive higher grades. \u201cWhere there is doubt, somebody should move up a grade mark rather than moving down a grade,\u201d he said, \u201cand that will mean exams are regarded as not having the same rigour as the previous exam series, but I don\u2019t see how else we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d He made the call following the cancellation of summer exams, which have been replaced by predicted grades based on teacher assessment. There are fears that some groups, including black and minority ethnic pupils, may be penalised unintentionally and will not receive the results they deserve. There are also concerns that exam boards and Ofqual will be inundated with appeals once results are published this summer, and that disadvantaged pupils are less likely to access the appeals system. Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, told MPs that this year\u2019s results should be closely monitored to assess the impact on poorer pupils. \u201cI think the worry is that unintentionally teachers will underestimate, sometimes, the academic potential of poorer pupils, potentially those from black backgrounds, and potentially boys as well.\u201d He said students who leave their revision until the last minute \u2013 often boys \u2013 and summer-born children were also likely to lose out in a grading system based on teacher assessment. And he suggested universities may need to consider if they should lower their offer to disadvantaged applicants who have faced particularly difficult circumstances during the crisis. Zubaida Haque, the interim director of racial equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, told MPs that the Department for Education had not responded to three letters from the trust calling for the government to ensure BAME pupils were not disadvantaged. MPs were also told there was a \u201ctsunami of anxiety\u201d facing students preparing to sit their exams next summer, having missed so much of the curriculum this year, and continuing uncertainty about what school will look like from next September. Sally Collier, Ofqual\u2019s chief regulator, told MPs that schools and teachers needed to know what the plans were for exams in 2021 as a matter of urgency. \u201cSchools and teachers need to know very quickly, and exam boards, before the summer break ideally, as to what\u2019s going to happen in September.\u201d Separately, a TUC poll of 3,400 women reveals that a quarter of pregnant women say they have faced discrimination at work during the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 including being singled out for redundancy or furlough. Of those surveyed, 28% of low-paid pregnant women (earning less than \u00a323,000 a year) had faced discrimination compared with 17% of women on higher salaries. Pregnant women told the TUC they were required to take sick leave when they were not sick, to take unpaid leave, to start their maternity leave early or to leave the workplace, because their employer did not act to make their workplace safe for them.",

The laboratory moved quickly to retest on a second machine the swabs that it still held that had tested positive on the fast track analyser. This showed that it had reported some false positive results.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The hospital is conducting a full investigation to understand what caused the problem. Early indications are that it was potentially caused by a change in the kind of swabs that were in use from 27 May.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have contacted the 78 patients who tested positive for Covid-19 after their swabs were analysed on the fast track machine between 27 May and 4 June to explain to them what has happened and that it is possible that they may have been incorrectly diagnosed, to understand the impact this may have had on them, to offer them subsequent testing and to say how sorry we are.</p> \n   <p>We have also forensically checked to see if those particular swabs were used before 27 May and we have found that a small number may have been. Therefore, as a precaution, we are in the process of contacting the 69 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 having tested positive on the fast track machine from 7 May when the machine came into use and the 27 May.</p> \n   <p>We understand that this issue may concern patients and families. We can reassure them, and members of the public, that patients who test positive for Covid-19 are cared for in single rooms or in intensive care to the highest infection control standards, that we have notified the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the incident.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee124948f08beee219d91ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sallyweale\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T18:21:18.774Z\">7.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The chief inspector of schools <strong>Amanda Spielman</strong> has expressed her disappointment at the government\u2019s U-turn on primary schools reopening, and has said people may be more frightened than they need to be.</p> \n  <p>Giving evidence to the Lords public services committee, the head of Ofsted called on local areas to step up to get as much on the road as possible ahead of the summer holidays which start next next month.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s really saddened me that so many people have become perhaps more frightened than they actually need to be and that so many people perhaps have been looking at this from the point of view of what they can\u2019t do, rather than what they can.</p> \n   <p>I would love to see more people in local areas really stepping up and saying \u2013 I could make this happen \u2013 and getting as much on the road as possible this side of the summer and real ambition for what happens in the autumn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Spielman said the scale of the medical and care home crisis meant the focus had been on adults and mostly older adults during the pandemic, and children\u2019s interests had been deferred.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And yet there\u2019s a really, really big and serious issue here that I would very much like people to be bringing to the forefront of their minds because children\u2019s lives have been disrupted a lot for a long time already.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee112ca8f08beee219d90d0\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T17:47:19.261Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Evening summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a summary of the highlights of the day, focusing on what was said at this evening\u2019s Number 10 press conferences, but with some of the day\u2019s other main coronavirus stories included too.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has dismissed an expert claim that he could have halved the coronavirus death toll by introducing the lockdown a week earlier as \u201cpremature\u201d. </strong>The claim was made by <strong>Prof Neil Ferguson </strong>of Imperial College in evidence to the Commons science committee. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0f4a88f0860ca20fa9ab7#block-5ee0f4a88f0860ca20fa9ab7\">4.23pm.)</a> Ferguson used to be a member of Sage and his epidemiological modelling has been highly influential with government. Asked about his claim at the the press conference, Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course we are going to have to look back on all of this and learn lessons that we can. But, frankly, I think a lot of these questions are still premature. There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the goverment\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, also argued that now was not the time to make that assessment. But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062001.pdf\">and he said no. </a>Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. <strong>Whitty</strong> stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas. Not just in this country, but around the world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Whitty</strong> made a similar point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be very clear, we are not at the end of this epidemic, not be a long shot.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is an awkward admission for the PM because tomorrow marks 12 weeks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">the day when he said the UK could turn the tide in the fight against coronavirus in 12 weeks.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said it was wrong to see the instruction to remain two metres away from people as a firm scientific rule.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is not a rule, it is not a scientific rule - it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces. And the risks are associated with distance - so the risk falls after two metres - time, what mitigating factors you can put in place, which can include whether you are sitting side-by-side, back-to-back or face-to-face, whether you\u2019ve got face covering, whether there is ventilation and other measures ...</p> \n   <p>It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Coming from Vallance, this sounded like the clearest indication that, in England at least, the two-metre rule will go.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said there was \u201ca reasonable chance\u201d of a second spike of infections happening in the winter. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We all think there is a reasonable chance that in the winter this virus will have some advantages it doesn\u2019t have at the rest of the year. It is something that transmits more easily indoors, for example, and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he would have liked the government to have been able to do more testing early on.</strong> Asked to name his biggest regret, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously.</p> \n   <p>If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic.

But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced. So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.</p> \n   <p>Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69889190-90d6-40f1-a768-cffabc2d8ce4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SKNpCBBuVws?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ferguson said he also agreed with <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062003.pdf\">told the Marr Show: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf\">this paper)</a> and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind.

And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7#block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7\">10.17am)</a>, not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good.</p> \n  <p>Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point.</p> \n  <p>Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case.</p> \n  <p>Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out.</p> \n  <p>The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663#block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663\"> 12.28pm.) </a>But even that did not generate a memorable answer.

But he is using the same phrase as the former Ofsted chief <strong>Sir Michael Wilshaw</strong>, who said the Department for Education had made a mess of things when he described pupils missing school this morning as an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d.

You can follow our global pandemic coverage here: And here, you can follow our coverage of the black lives matter protests as George Floyd\u2019s brother testifies before the US Congress: Scores of patients may have received false positive Covid-19 results because of a fault in a testing machine at a hospital in Somerset. Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton is contacting 147 patients who tested positive over almost a month from the start of May. The hospital said the alarm was raised by a laboratory manager after he noticed a spike in the number of positive tests recorded by a fast-track machine. It has apologised to all the people involved and said that patients who test positive are cared for in single rooms or intensive care, where the chances of them catching coronavirus if they did not have it was minimised. Dr Daniel Meron, the chief medical officer for Somerset NHS Foundation Trust said in-patients were routinely tested for Covid-19 when they are admitted to hospital. From around 27 May we began to see an increase in the number of inpatients at Musgrove Park Hospital who were testing positive for Covid-19 and we were working with public health colleagues to understand the cause of this. On Thursday 4 June, one of our vigilant laboratory managers noticed an unusual increase in the number of positive test results recorded by the laboratory\u2019s fast track machine. The laboratory moved quickly to retest on a second machine the swabs that it still held that had tested positive on the fast track analyser. This showed that it had reported some false positive results. The hospital is conducting a full investigation to understand what caused the problem. Early indications are that it was potentially caused by a change in the kind of swabs that were in use from 27 May. We have contacted the 78 patients who tested positive for Covid-19 after their swabs were analysed on the fast track machine between 27 May and 4 June to explain to them what has happened and that it is possible that they may have been incorrectly diagnosed, to understand the impact this may have had on them, to offer them subsequent testing and to say how sorry we are. We have also forensically checked to see if those particular swabs were used before 27 May and we have found that a small number may have been. Therefore, as a precaution, we are in the process of contacting the 69 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 having tested positive on the fast track machine from 7 May when the machine came into use and the 27 May. We understand that this issue may concern patients and families. We can reassure them, and members of the public, that patients who test positive for Covid-19 are cared for in single rooms or in intensive care to the highest infection control standards, that we have notified the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the incident. The chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman has expressed her disappointment at the government\u2019s U-turn on primary schools reopening, and has said people may be more frightened than they need to be. Giving evidence to the Lords public services committee, the head of Ofsted called on local areas to step up to get as much on the road as possible ahead of the summer holidays which start next next month. It\u2019s really saddened me that so many people have become perhaps more frightened than they actually need to be and that so many people perhaps have been looking at this from the point of view of what they can\u2019t do, rather than what they can. I would love to see more people in local areas really stepping up and saying \u2013 I could make this happen \u2013 and getting as much on the road as possible this side of the summer and real ambition for what happens in the autumn. Spielman said the scale of the medical and care home crisis meant the focus had been on adults and mostly older adults during the pandemic, and children\u2019s interests had been deferred. And yet there\u2019s a really, really big and serious issue here that I would very much like people to be bringing to the forefront of their minds because children\u2019s lives have been disrupted a lot for a long time already. Here is a summary of the highlights of the day, focusing on what was said at this evening\u2019s Number 10 press conferences, but with some of the day\u2019s other main coronavirus stories included too. Boris Johnson has dismissed an expert claim that he could have halved the coronavirus death toll by introducing the lockdown a week earlier as \u201cpremature\u201d. The claim was made by Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College in evidence to the Commons science committee. (See 4.23pm.) Ferguson used to be a member of Sage and his epidemiological modelling has been highly influential with government. Asked about his claim at the the press conference, Johnson said: Of course we are going to have to look back on all of this and learn lessons that we can. But, frankly, I think a lot of these questions are still premature. There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know. Sir Patrick Vallance, the goverment\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, also argued that now was not the time to make that assessment. But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, Prof John Edmunds, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed and he said no. Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. Whitty stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d. Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England. Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d. He said: There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas. Not just in this country, but around the world. Whitty made a similar point. He said: To be very clear, we are not at the end of this epidemic, not be a long shot. This is an awkward admission for the PM because tomorrow marks 12 weeks from the day when he said the UK could turn the tide in the fight against coronavirus in 12 weeks. He said: I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. Vallance said it was wrong to see the instruction to remain two metres away from people as a firm scientific rule. He explained: It is not a rule, it is not a scientific rule - it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces. And the risks are associated with distance - so the risk falls after two metres - time, what mitigating factors you can put in place, which can include whether you are sitting side-by-side, back-to-back or face-to-face, whether you\u2019ve got face covering, whether there is ventilation and other measures ... It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now. Coming from Vallance, this sounded like the clearest indication that, in England at least, the two-metre rule will go. Whitty said there was \u201ca reasonable chance\u201d of a second spike of infections happening in the winter. He said: We all think there is a reasonable chance that in the winter this virus will have some advantages it doesn\u2019t have at the rest of the year. It is something that transmits more easily indoors, for example, and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter. Whitty said he would have liked the government to have been able to do more testing early on. Asked to name his biggest regret, he said: I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously. If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems that we have had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were. Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson have clashed at prime minister\u2019s questions over the delay to the full reopening of schools, with the Labour leader saying Johnson should take \u201cresponsibility for his own failures\u201d on the issue. The coronavirus coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It\u2019s here. This is from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, on the claim from Prof Neil Ferguson. (See 4.23pm.) The tragic reality is Boris Johnson was too slow to take us into lockdown, too slow on PPE for health and care staff, too slow on testing and now too slow on putting in place a functional test and trace regimes. Ministers must accept they made mistakes and reassure they have learnt lessons so we can save as many lives as possible and minimise harm from this horrific deadly virus. The press conference is now over. I will post a summary shortly. Johnson says he is confident that the cruise industry can return in a Covid secure way. Whitty says there are no comfortable options. He says the scientists support the plan announced by the prime minister. But it is not a \u201crisk free\u201d option, he says. And Vallance says easing the lockdown is conditional on test and trace working. Johnson refers again to the BBC article about what other European countries are doing with schools. He may be referring to this one. Johnson says he wants to get all schools back in September, after a summer of catch-up. And it won\u2019t just be a summer of catch-up. Pupils will get help for months and months to come. Q: Is relaxing the two-metre rule a political decision? And are you willing to ignore your scientific advisers? Johnson says there is a balance of risk to be struck. It is important to get the rate down. Only one in 1,000 has it. But it is not down yet as far as he would like, he says. Vallance says two metres is not a rule. It is a scientific assessment of risk. Other factors are relevant, such as time and mitigating factors in place. All those need to be taken into account. It is wrong to portray that as a scientific rule, two metre or nothing. That is not what the advice is now. Q: [From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby] What is your biggest regret? Johnson says there will be a time to look back. But these questions are \u201cpremature\u201d. This epidemic has \u201ca long way to go\u201d, especially around the world, he says. Vallance says we need to have the information to be able to make that judgment. Whitty says there is a long list. If he were to choose one, he would go for testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems were caused by that. They were trying to see things through a \u201cfog\u201d, he says. But he accepts there were reasons for this. Q: Do you not regret going into lockdown earlier? Johnson refers to what Whitty and Vallance said earlier. He says they made the decisions based on advice from Sage, including Prof Ferguson. Of course that moment will come. But at this stage it is \u201cpremature\u201d. Whitty says he is not denying at all the need for an assessment of what went wrong later. But we are still in the middle of the crisis, he says. We are not through it \u201cby a long shot\u201d. Q: [To the PM] What do you say about Ferguson\u2019s claim? Johnson says all these judgements will have to be examined in the fullness of time. Johnson does not challenge the claim that delaying lockdown by a week doubled the death toll - but says it\u2019s a judgment for later. Q: [From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg] How come children can go to the zoo, but not to school? How have you allowed this? Johnson says he would have like to have got to the position where primary pupils could go back to school. But the disease is \u201cnot right down far enough\u201d to allow schools to go back. A \u201chuge amount\u201d of catch up will be organised for schools. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, will announce more next week. He says the BBC has produced a guide showing that many other European countries are not allowing schools back. The UK is in line with other countries, he says. Q: Neil Ferguson said the death toll would be reduced by a half if lockdown had come a week earlier. Was he right? Vallance says Ferguson also told the committee this afternoon that now was not the time to second guess. There will be a time to look back, and do that analysis. It is very important to address that. Whitty agrees with Vallance. He says it is routine for medics to look back at what happened and consider what could have been done better. Whitty says at the time they had limited information about the virus. What counts is what measures have the most impact on the virus, but the least impact on society. That is a \u201cvery complicated balancing act\u201d, he says. He says there are three scenarios. It could take off again soon. Second, there is a reasonable chance it could come back in the autumn or winter. And, third, there is a risk of a second wave after the virus has been around the world. Whitty says bubbles benefit households with a single adult. He says it is only by breaking the links between households that we can continue to bring the R now. That is why this bubbling plan is relatively specific. Other people will have to continue to meet outside. Johnson is now taking questions. Ruth from Bournemouth asks if people serving food to the public should be wearing masks or gloves. Johnson says guidelines will be introduced as to how shops should open up in a Covid secure way. Vallance says the Sage advice is clear. Face coverings have benefits in closed environments. He says touching and surface contact is a major way of spreading the disease. Individual workplaces must decide what is appropriate. Johnson says the Covid secure guidelines are on the website. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, says if someone keeps wearing the same pair of gloves, that can be less useful than washing hands. At the press conference Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, is now going through more slides. He says the coronavirus numbers are low, \u201cbut not yet very low\u201d. Here are some figures showing how many people have had it. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s story on the \u201csupport bubble\u201d plan. Johnson says the rate of infection is not low enough to allow all primary pupils to go back to school. He says he does fully intend to bring all pupils back to school in September, provided progress continues. Johnson confirms that zoos will be allowed to open from Monday. And he says places of worship will be allowed to open for prayer from this weekend. Step three, the next phase of easing lockdown, will not begin before 4 July, he says. He says these changes are incremental. He understands why it is frustrating for people, he says. But he says he will continue to remain cautious. Turning to social contact, Johnson says he relaxed rules last Monday, so that groups of up to six could meet outdoors. But too many people are lonely. From this weekend, single adult households will be allowed to form a support bubble with one other household. That means they can act as if they are one household. They can visit each other\u2019s homes, and don\u2019t need to stay two metres apart. But they can only form a support bubble with one household. And if someone in the bubble falls ill, all must self-isolate. He says this does not mean anyone can meet in anyone else\u2019s home. And shielding people are not included, he says. Johnson turns to the new measures. The devolved administrations can move at the right pace for them. He says these measures he is announcing apply to England only. Shops have been closed for 82 days, he says. He says all shops can reopen from Monday. They will have to meet Covid secure guidelines. And the fifth test is about being confident measures would not risk a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS. Johnson says this is being, and the government can proceed with further measures. The fourth test relates to operational capacity. The third test relates to infection levels. Here is progress on test two. Johnson says they must be confident they have moved beyond the peak. Johnson starts by saying he is going to explain progress made against the five tests. Here is progress on test one. Boris Johnson is taking this afternoon\u2019s daily press conference. It is about to start. Here is more from what Prof Neil Ferguson told the Commons science committee. Asked what went wrong, he said: I think two things - one is a paper actually out in Nature, which highlights that around about that time, just before lockdown happened, the first two weeks of March, we probably had 1,500 to 2,000 infections imported from Italy and Spain, which we just hadn\u2019t seen in the surveillance data, until that point. So there is much heavier seeding than we\u2019d expected ... The key things to determine number of deaths is at what point in your local epidemic you trigger interventions - how far in are you when you shut down transmission. And we frankly had underestimated how far into the epidemic this country was, that\u2019s half the reason. The second part, which I think would have been more avoidable, is about half of those deaths occurred in care homes ... And we did all this working under the assumption which was government policy at the time that care homes would be shielded from infection. On care homes, Ferguson said the government failed to enact the policies it had to protect residents. See 4.38pm. And this is from Lawrence Freedman, the historian who was a member of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, on what Prof Neil Ferguson said earlier. (See 4.23pm.) Freedman published a long and judicious account of decision making in the early days of the crisis last month. One of his arguments was that the politicians delayed moving to lockdown measures because the scientists assumed that the epidemic would take longer to spread than in fact it did. The Department of Health and Social Care says another 245 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total to 41,128. The full data is here. Here is Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator (a job that Boris Johnson himself once held) on Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s comment about the timing of the lockdown. (See 4.23pm.) UPDATE: The doctor Rachel Clarke says Nelson is wrong. Historic breaches of planning and building control regulations took place at the County Durham property where Dominic Cummings took his family for a controversial lockdown stay, planning inspectors have said, but time limits mean that no action is to be taken. Council enforcement officials had been investigating the planning history of the property at the farm where the parents of the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser live after receiving queries about its planning and council tax status. Complaints relating to payment of council tax have also been looked into by officials, who will be passing their findings on to the Valuation Office for its consideration and review. The development raised potentially awkward new questions for Cummings about whether his visit in April to what he described as an \u201cisolated cottage\u201d on his father\u2019s farm was a breach of lockdown rules banning stays at second homes. But Stuart Timmiss, head of development and housing at Durham County Council, said in a statement issued today: We have now investigated the complaints regarding planning permission. While there have been historic breaches of planning and building control regulations, current legislation places a time limit on any enforcement measures and as a result no further action will be taken. The investigation concluded that the main house has not been subdivided and that the residential use of an outbuilding for family accommodation does not require planning permission. However, advice has been provided in relation to building control. Liz Brown, a Liberal Democrat councillor and a member of the planning committee, had told the Guardian that she had referred a number of queries from members of the public to planning enforcement officials and had been told that an appointment had been made to look around the property. In a lengthy defence of his actions last month in the Rose Garden of Downing Street, Cummings referred to the County Durham farm, North Lodge, where he said that his parents live in one house. His sister and her two children lives in another house, he added, and there was a separate cottage roughly 50 metres away from either of them. However, Cummings made no mention of the fact, according to land registry documents, that he is the joint owner of the land at North Lodge. The others are listed as his father and mother and his sister And this is what Prof Neil Ferguson said about the government failing to enact the policies that would have protected people in care homes. (See 3.37pm.) He said: The policy has always been to protect care homes and to protect the elderly. The policy has been clear in that sense. This is not unique to this country. The policy has simply failed to be enacted until very recently, and there are multiple causes for that. This echoes what he told a Lords committee last week when he said that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by how badly people in care homes had been protected all over the world. The latest Guardian Politics Weekly podcast is out. Jonathan Freedland speaks to Heather Stewart about the latest in Westminster. Haroon Siddique and Joseph Harker outline what the British government should be doing to address racism in the UK. And Patrick Wintour reports on the government\u2019s response to the latest in Hong Kong. Here is the key point from Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s evidence to the Commons science committee\u2019s hearing. Ferguson, the Imperial College academic whose research prompted Boris Johnson to introduce the lockdown, said that the death toll could have been halved it it had been introduced a week earlier. In response to a question about whether the right decisions were taken at the right time, he said the right decisions were taken. But he went on: The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced. So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half. Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. Ferguson said he also agreed with Prof John Edmunds, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson told the Marr Show: We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately. After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from this paper) and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind. (He used to joke that his hero was the mayor in the film Jaws who kept the beach open even though swimmers were being attacked.) Johnson announced the full lockdown on 23 March. That was a week after Sage agreed at a meeting that \u201cthere is clear evidence to support additional social distancing measures be introduced as soon as possible\u201d. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, a Ministry of Justice figures shows. As at 5pm on Tuesday, 490 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 80 prisons, a rise of less than 1% in 24 hours, while there were 956 infected staff across 105 prisons, a rise of 0.5% in the same period. There are around 79,800 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. Scotland\u2019s tourism sector could open from 15 July, for a truncated summer season, Holyrood\u2019s tourism secretary, Fergus Ewing, has announced as he acknowledged that businesses have been \u201cdevastated\u201d by lockdown measures. Ewing confirmed the Scottish government hopes to give the green light to reopening the sector at the 9 July review, and that businesses should prepare to reopen from 15 July, which will allow them to cash in on the anticipated rise in staycations across the UK this summer. The Scottish Tourism Alliance welcomed the clarity but said it remained hopeful that an earlier date for reopening would be given for certain sectors which are more easily placed to do so safely by their nature, for example self-catering, caravan and camping parks. The STA added that urgent solutions or alternative measures must be found for the current 2-metre distancing restrictions, which it argues threaten the economic viability of many businesses. Scottish ferries \u2013 which transport tens of thousands of visitors to Scotland\u2019s islands during the summer months \u2013 have warned that they may only be able to return to under 20% capacity. Q: Do you think the government has been too reliant on epidemiological models? Ferguson says he is a modeller. That is like asking a turkey to vote for Christmas. He says he thinks models are valuable because they \u201ccodify assumptions and knowledge\u201d. But they should not be taken as \u201cliteral truth\u201d, he says. He says they are reliant on the information and assumptions that go into them. Back at the Commons science committee Labour\u2019s Graham Stringer is now asking questions. Q: Do you know yet if the summer weather has an impact on transmission? Ferguson says he has seen some research saying transmission might be 20% lower in the summer than in winter. But it is just a small effect, he says. Q: Was there not concern within Sage that sending people back into care homes from hospital might intensify the epidemic. Ferguson says he only became aware of this policy later. Contrary to warnings by academics at Cambridge University that Covid infections might be on the increase in the north-west, there are promising signs in Greater Manchester that the virus is on the retreat. At his weekly press conference, the region\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, said there were just 168 new cases in Greater Manchester last week; 66 people are currently in ICU (the figure was 67 last week); 468 people are in hospital with Covid (down from 523 last week) and there have been just 11 hospital admissions, down from 29 last week. Currently 20% of care homes in GM have at least one infected resident, down from 24% last week. But Burnham said he was still in the dark about where local infection hotspots were as he and the 10 local authorities still had no \u201cpillar 2\u201d testing data from drive-through centres or postal tests. Burnham also said it was \u201cworth looking into\u201d the idea of giving shielding people a dedicated hour to go out and exercise safely, after Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft earlier asked the prime minister to support a \u2018safe-hour walk\u2019 for shielded people. As the lockdown is eased, Burnham also announced a \u00a321.5m bid for temporary measures for walking and cycling, including 200km of pop-up bike lanes \u2014 94km of which is on \u201cstrategic\u201d routes. A row has been brewing in the region over the past week after it emerged Manchester city council (MCC) had refused to build any pop-up cycle lanes to help commuters from the surrounding nine districts get into the city by bike and was instead concentrating on pedestrianising parts of the centre. The Guardian understands that the nine boroughs all want to install segregated bike lanes on key routes into Manchester, but that MCC\u2019s refusal to cooperate means they all stop abruptly at the Manchester border. More than 200,000 people who normally commute under three miles to Manchester city centre will not be able to use public transport if social distancing is observed on buses, trains and trams, with 45% of Mancunian households having no car. Q: What other lessons are there? Ferguson says a focus on where infections are happening is crucial. Q: Do you think the right decisions were taken at the right time? Ferguson says the right decisions were taken. He says the epidemic was doubling every three to four days before the lockdown was introduced. So if the lockdown had been introduced earlier, the death toll could have been halved, he says. Q: What is your current estimate for the likely overall death rate? Ferguson says the challenge now is to decide what the impact of the lockdown will be, and whether there will be a second wave. He says he expects the total from the first wave to be around 50,000. Q: When did Sage become aware of the problems in care homes? Ferguson says Sage anticipated problems in care homes in February and early March. But you can only protect care homes with extensive testing, he says. Q: On 25 March you said deaths were unlikely to exceed 20,000. At the stage the lockdown policy was known. And you knew what the policy was for care homes. Ferguson says the policy, protecting care homes and the elderly, was obvious. But it \u201cfailed to be enacted\u201d. He says it is common for care home staff to work in more than one place. That contributed to the spread, he says. He says at that point, in March, they had not realised how serious the problem would be in care homes. Ferguson says Spain and Italy had large epidemics before they fully realised. They led to the virus spreading into the UK, he says. If the UK had had the testing capacity, and if it had tested people coming into the country, the government could have had a much better assessment of the spread of the disease. Ferguson tells the committee that he is still providing advice to government through his Imperial College team. Greg Clark, the committee chair, asks why the death toll is higher than Ferguson originally expected. (At one point in early April Ferguson said it could end up at around 20,000.) Ferguson says it is clear now that the infection had by then spread more widely than people realised at the time. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College academic whose team wrote the paper that led to the government announcing the lockdown is giving evidence to the Commons science committee now. He is appearing with two other academics who have produced pandemic modelling considered by the government, Prof Matt Keeling from Warwick University and Dr Nicholas Davis from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This is not Ferguson\u2019s first appearance in public since he had to resign as a member of Sage after his lover visited him at home in breach of lockdown guidance. Ferguson gave evidence to a Lords committee recently. But the Lords committee asked him nothing about the circumstances of his resignation. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over. Here are the main points. No 10 confirmed that the two-metre rule could be reduced in England but not other parts of the UK. At PMQs Boris Johnson said it was being kept under review. He is under strong pressure to replace it with a one-metre or 1.5-metre rule, which would make it much easier for schools and commercial premises, especially pubs and restaurants, to open in a Covid-secure way. \u201cMatters of public health are devolved, so it is a theoretical possibility that the position could be different in different parts of the UK,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. Downing Street would not rule out the possibility of retired teachers being called back to the profession to help schools cope with the coronavirus crisis. The spokesman said: The education secretary has said that we will do whatever we can to make sure that no child falls behind as a result of coronavirus. We have already committed over \u00a3100m to support children to learn at home and pupil premium funding continues to be paid at the highest-ever rate to help schools to support disadvantaged pupils. We are working to bring all children back in September and are considering what more is needed to support pupils. We have also said that we are looking at what further support we can provide over the summer. Private hospitals are being used to help clear the backlog of NHS cases built up during the coronavirus outbreak, Downing Street said. The spokesman said: We reached agreements with private hospitals at the beginning of the outbreak to ensure that we had the potential for surge capacity for coronavirus patients. With the number of cases falling, these private hospitals are now helping to bring back wider NHS services. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has said it may be possible to further lift some of the lockdown restrictions in Wales, if the number of new cases continues to fall. He told a meeting of the Welsh parliament that a key indicator of whether the restrictions could be eased would be the reproduction level, or R number, and how the virus was circulating in Wales. He said: I share that hope that people in Wales have that we will be in a position at the end of next week to further lift some of the restrictions we\u2019ve all had to abide by over what is now nearly three months. As we go into this week, the figure is around 50 new confirmed cases every day, and that number continues to fall. So, your chances of meeting somebody, as you leave your own home, who is suffering from coronavirus, is about an eighth of what it was when we went into lockdown. We will continue to have to emphasise to people, that as they exercise those freedoms, they have to exercise them really carefully. Because even if there are only 50 new confirmed cases a day, you have no way of knowing, as you leave your home, whether you are going to be in contact with one of those 50 people. Drakeford told Senedd members the Welsh government was hoping to be able to resume parts of the tourism industry before this year\u2019s season ended, but that it had to be done with \u201ccommunity consent\u201d. If it is possible, then beginning with self-contained accommodation, where people are not sharing kitchens and toilets and showers and so on, seems to be a sensible and safe way of thinking about how we can resume activity in the tourism industry. So, as we move, if we are able to, to allow tourism to resume in Wales, people who travel to those communities can be sure that they would be welcome, and that the industry will once again be demonstrating to people everything that Wales has to offer. NHS England has recorded a further 88 coronavirus hospital deaths in England, taking the total to 27,707. The full details are here. For the record, here are the equivalent figures for the last two weeks. Wednesday 27 May - 183 Thursday 28 May - 185 Friday 29 May - 149 Saturday 30 May - 146 Sunday 31 May - 85 Monday 1 June - 108 Tuesday 2 June - 143 Wednesday 3 June - 179 Thursday 4 June - 115 Friday 5 June - 123 Saturday 6 June - 75 Sunday 7 June - 72 Monday 8 June - 59 Tuesday 9 June - 129 Northern Ireland\u2019s Department of Health has reported no further deaths of people with coronavirus for a fourth day in a row. There were 13 new confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total since the outbreak began to 4,818. Public Health Wales said a further nine people had died after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,419, while the total cases increased by 38 to 14,518. Hello all. I am helping on the Guardian\u2019s live feed while Andrew takes a break. Please do get in touch with any news tips, insights or story ideas. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The Health Service Journal is reporting that the government\u2019s Nightingale hospitals, created to ease pressure on the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic, have cost \u00a3200m. It comes after the London Nightingale was wound down after a lack of patients. Here are the quotes form the exchange at PMQs between Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer on the coronavirus death numbers. Starmer said: Since last prime minister\u2019s questions, the government\u2019s daily total figure for those that have died from coronavirus has gone past 40,000. The ONS figure, which records cases where coronavirus is on the death certificate stands at just over 50,000 and the number of excess deaths, which is an awful phrase, stands at over 63,000. These are amongst the highest numbers anywhere in the world. Last week, the prime minister said he was proud of the government\u2019s record, but there\u2019s no pride in those figures is there? And Johnson replied: On the death figures for this country, we mourn every one and we grieve for them and for their relatives and their friends. But I must also tell them he\u2019s raised this point repeatedly across the dispatch box, the best scientific evidence and advice is that we must wait until the epidemic has been through its whole cycle in order to draw the relevant international conclusions. As for what this country did to fight the epidemic, I must say I strongly disagree with the way he characterises it. I think it was an astonishing achievement by the NHS to build the Nightingale hospitals, I think it was an astonishing thing this country came together to drive down, to follow the social distancing rules in spite of all the doubt that was cast on the advice. Scotland has recorded the sixth weekly reduction in a row of deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, taking to total deaths as of 7 June to 4,000, with 89 deaths in the past week from June 1 to 7. This is the lowest number of Covid deaths in a single week since late March. At first minister\u2019s questions Nicola Sturgeon also announced 12 more daily deaths, taking that total to 2,434. The weekly data from National Records of Scotland also showed that deaths in care homes have fallen back to 47% of all Covid-19 deaths in week 23, June 1 to 7, when the number of deaths in that setting fell for a sixth week, by 27 to 42. Three-quarters, or 76%, of all coronavirus deaths to date involved people aged 75 or over. Sturgeon also announced the first data from Scotland\u2019s new test and trace system from Health Protection Scotland: there have been 681 cases where the individual tested positive, contact tracing has been completed in 481 cases and 741 contacts have been traced. According to Joe Murphy at the Evening Standard, Boris Johnson had another announcement at PMQs - although it was not obvious at the time. In one of his responses to Sir Keir Starmer, Johnson said the government would ensure that \u201chigh-contact professions get expanded and targeted testing now\u201d. In his story Murphy says this was a reference to taxi and bus drivers being offered covonavirus tests, even if they don\u2019t have symptoms. For all its multiple faults, there are days when PMQs does provide a forum where the most intense political issues are illuminated. And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see 10.17am), not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good. Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point. Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed. Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case. Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out. The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See 12.28pm.) But even that did not generate a memorable answer. It was that sort of PMQs. Labour\u2019s Olivia Blake asks if the PM will agree to a funding boost for local welfare systems. Johnson says many families are facing great hardship. And he repeats what he said earlier about the extra \u00a363m going to councils that he said could help them provide meals for poor pupils during the school holidays. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. Stuart Anderson, a Conservative, asks Johnson to commit to measures to help Wolverhampton. Johnson says he will. He rattles off some investment figures for Wolverhampton. Labour\u2019s Rachel Hopkins says her constituents are confused by the government\u2019s coronavirus policy. Johnson says the public, with their overwhelming common sense, have ignored the \u201cnegativity and the attempts to confuse\u201d from Labour. Johnson says the government will raise animal welfare standards outside the EU, not lower them. The Tory, Mark Logan, asks if the PM agrees that the publication of local R number data might help to give people confidence to go back to work. Johnson broadly agrees, although he does not make a commitment on R number data. He says test and trace should give people confidence. The SNP\u2019s Stuart Malcolm McDonald says the UK has one of the worst statutory sick pay systems in the world. Will the PM create a system fit for people\u2019s needs? Johnson says people receive additional funds on top of statutory sick pay. He claims the UK has done more than almost any other country on Earth to support people affected by the coronavirus crisis. Johnson says he remains committed to using infrastructure projects to unite and level up in the country. Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, says black people are 47 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. Johnson says these powers are important for fighting violent crime. Knife crime is a problem. He says stop and search is not the whole answer, but it is part of the mix. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP and father of the house, asks the PM to pay tribute to the retiring archbishop of York, John Sentamu. Johnson says he and Sentamu correspond frequently. The SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman criticises President Trump\u2019s response to the death of George Floyd. Does the PM still think Trump has many, many good qualities. If so, what are they? Johnson says, amongst other things, Trump is president of the US, which is the UK\u2019s most important ally and which has been a bastion of peace throughout his lifetime. Maria Miller, a Conservative, says there have been many peaceful protests against racism. She commends the PM for recognising the significance of them. Will he look again at systemic racism in government? Johnson says all political leaders should promote these issues. He is proud of what he did as mayor on BAME issues, he says. Johnson says it is still the plan to allow outdoor hospitality to open up from July. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Johnson told the liaison committee he did not read the scientific papers. He says it is no wonder it took the UK so long to introduce quarantine. We should not ignore the experts again. What papers has he read about the 2-metre rule? Johnson says he has read many papers about this disease, including on the 2-metre rule. He wants to keep it under review, he says. Blackford says the cabinet has discussed reducing the 2-metre rule. But the scientists are not advising it should be relaxed. The risk at one metre is much higher, he says. And he says Prof Chris Whitty said the two-metre rule should stay. He says the government is trying to reduce it too soon. Johnson says people are following the advice. Tomorrow the government will announce more on test and trace. He says people will be surprised by the extent to which people are complying. Johnson hints data about the success of the test and trace system may be announced tomorrow. Starmer says he has been consistently been saying that children should be back when it is safe. He says in Wales the Labour government will continue to fund school meal vouchers during the summer holiday. The government in England won\u2019t. Will Johnson reconsider? Johnson says the government does not normally do this. But it has announced \u00a363m of welfare assistance for councils to allow them to help people. It has put its arms around people. It is not helped by the \u201ctergiversations\u201d of Labour. He says he will be announcing more measures to open up Britain later. The government will stick it its plan, with or without the assistance of the opposition. Starmer says, contrary to what Johnson claimed, they have not discussed the proposal in the Starmer letter. He says Johnson is flailing around. He says Johnson is responsible for this mess. He quotes the children\u2019s commissioner, who says she is not confident there is a plan. The government knew space was a problem. The government built the Nightingale hospitals. So why are they only addressing schools now. Johnson says Labour supports one thing one week, one thing another. He says he knows this is how lawyers work. He says it is safe for children to go back. Will Starmer say that? Starmer says Johnson\u2019s argument \u201cjust does not wash\u201d. It is not too early to learn from what happened elsewhere, he says. Turning to schools, he says there has been no consensus. Pupils are missing six months\u2019 school. He says he suggested a national taskforce. Will the PM agree? Johnson says last week Labour did not want pupils back. Now it does. He says some other schools have sent no pupils back. The government has a plan, he says. He claims 97% of schools submitted data are seeing pupils coming back. He blamed Labour\u2019s leftwing union \u201cfriends\u201d. Starmer says action is needed now. He says the PM should indicate when this will happen. Turning to the overall death numbers, he says these figures \u201chaunt us\u201d. The government\u2019s daily figure is over 40,000, the ONS figure is over 50,000 and the number of excess deaths is 63,000. These are around the highest numbers in the world. The PM said he was proud of his record. But there is no pride in these numbers, is there? Johnson says they mourn every death. But he says the best advice is that we must wait until the end of the pandemic to make international comparisons. He disagrees with Starmer. Building the Nightingale hospitals, and having the country follow the social distancing advice, was remarkable, he says. Starmer says Labour will hold the government to that. He turns to the PHE report on Covid and disparities. He says it said it was already clear policy should be changed to mitigate the risk. Why is that not happening? Johnson says the government is acting. It is looking at the exposure of BAME groups to coronavirus. He says high-contact professions are getting expanded and targeted testing. That is the first and most practical step that can be taken, he says. Sir Keir Starmer welcomes what Johnson said about newly-shielding people being covered by the furlough scheme. Turning to Black Lives Matters, he says the recommendations from the Lammy report on the way BAME treated are treated by the criminal justice are yet to be implemented. And the Windrush report recommendations have not been implemented either. When will that happen? Johnson says the government is implementing these. He says the number of BAME people in the prison service is being increased. Cameras are being rolled out for police officers. But it is vital that we keep our streets safe, he says, and that we back the police. Asked about China, Johnson says he is a Sinophile. We must work with this great power, he says. But where there are concerns, over infrastracture or Hong Kong or Covid, we must raise our concerns \u201cloud and clear\u201d, he says. Labour\u2019s Vicky Foxcroft, who is speaking via Zoom because she is shielding, asks if the PM agrees that time should be set aside for shielded people to be able to go for walks. Johnson says new guidance will be issued to people who are shielding. And the government will be taking steps to ensure that people recently told to shield can benefit from the furlough scheme, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying Sunday is the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire. He offers his condolences to the families of the 72 people who died. And he expresses birthday wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh and to the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. PMQs is about to start. The list of MPs down to ask a question is here (pdf). The Social Mobility Commission has published a report (pdf) this morning that examines how many of its 52 recommendations over the last seven years have been implemented by government. It says that \u201cstrong progress\u201d has only been made in relation to about a quarter of them. In relation to the others, there has either been no or very little action (31%) or insufficient progress (46%). Dame Martina Miliburn, the outgoing commission chair, said that one problem was that there was no department championing social mobility in government. She said: Social mobility has never been more important. It is the poor and the young who will suffer most from the economic downturn. To succeed, action will need to be driven from the heart of government. At present there is no meaningful coordination between departments on the social mobility agenda, and no single force championing social mobility across the government. This is embarrassing for Boris Johnson because at the general election he said levelling up Britain (a form of social mobility, although Johnson seemed more interested in regional inequalities than class inequalities) would be the main goal of his government. If anyone is supposed to be championing social mobility in government, you might have expected it to be him. The commission, which was set up by in its current form by David Cameron\u2019s government, is used to be ignored by Whitehall. The previous chair, the former Labour cabinet minister Alan Milburn (no relation to Martina Milburn) resigned in 2017 complaining that his proposals were being ignored by No 10. Fair Vote UK, which campaigns for transparency and fair elections, has published a report (pdf) with recommendations to support democracy in the era of coronavirus. Its director, Kyle Taylor, said the recommendations could be summarised very simply: \u201cHigh-tech parliament, low-tech elections.\u201d He explained: The digitisation of parliamentary work - derailed in recent weeks - should continue and deepen. Parliament should also implement a codified crisis-response protocol that allows scrutinising work to continue unabated in times of disruption. Conversely, for reasons of security, accessibility and confidence, digitisation should not be pursued for elections. South Korea has shown that - with extensive innovation, rigorous planning/investment and clear communication - it is possible to hold a \u201cnormal\u201d election in these challenging circumstances. Speaking at the CogX technology conference this morning, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, questioned the claim from the NHS Confederation that waiting lists for hospital treatment in England are likely to reach 10m by the end of the year. But he accepted that waiting lists would be a \u201cvery serious problem\u201d. Asked about the 10m figure, he replied: That isn\u2019t the figure that we have got, but there definitely is an increase. Absolutely. Hancock said it was also important for patients to come forward for treatment. He said: Our biggest problem is people not coming forward. We all know that, especially with cancer and other areas like stroke and heart disease, early diagnosis is so important in improving the survival rates We have got to make sure that people come do forward for these treatments that are available again because we have restarted the NHS. In an interview with Sky News Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said that it is a tragedy that so many children will not be back in school until the autumn. Judging by the write-up from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway (I have not seen the full interview yet), he was making a general point and not directly criticising his cabinet colleague Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, who is being blamed by some - at least in part - for the fact that schools have not found a safe way of opening. But he is using the same phrase as the former Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said the Department for Education had made a mess of things when he described pupils missing school this morning as an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d. (See 9.12am.) Sunak told Sky News: I personally think every day our children are not at school is a tragedy. In this comment Sunak is not diverting from the government line in terms of policy (even though he know that he has been one of those ministers most keen on reopening the economy, which can only fully happen when pupils return to class, making it easier for their parents to work). But in terms of tone, Sunak is differentiating himself from Williamson; he is conveying empathy, just as he did with the statement he issued about the Black Lives Matters protests on Monday. This article, by our colleague Sally Weale, explains in detail the situation for pupils returning to school in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil thinks Boris Johnson is facing trouble with his own MPs. Neil thinks the Tory discontent might not manifest itself at PMQs today, but who can be sure? As usual, Jack Blanchard has a good scene-setter in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe. He writes: The prime minister faces Keir Starmer for PMQs at noon amid mounting concern on his own back benches about the government\u2019s faltering approach to unlocking the UK economy. Tory MPs are angry about the failure to reopen English schools; dismayed by the adherence to 2-meter social distancing; fuming about airport quarantine rules; and concerned the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system is anything but. The discontent is growing, and it will be fascinating to see how much spills over today .... Newsnight\u2019s Nick Watt is hearing the very same grumbles from Tory MPs. \u201cI am picking up real unease from Conservative MPs about Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of this phase of the pandemic,\u201d Watt reported last night. \u201cGrave disappointment on that announcement on schools, lots of Tory MPs blaming that on the failure to overrule scientists on the 2-metre rule. Tory MPs believe cutting the 2-metre rule down to 1 meter is absolutely at the heart of the wider opening of the economy \u2026 One very senior Tory MP said to me: \u2018Our leadership is pitiful. Boris Johnson needs to be honest. Opening up the economy brings risks. If we don\u2019t do this we are heading for economic catastrophe.\u2019\u201d Here is the Newsnight clip. The grounding of air travel during the coronavirus pandemic could prompt a jobs crisis in British aviation on the scale of the coal mining industry\u2019s collapse during the 1980s, a report has warned. Putting ministers on notice for a surge in redundancies as airlines confront a future with fewer journeys made by plane even after the outbreak recedes, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said at least 70,000 jobs in the wider aviation industry \u2013 including engineering, catering and duty free shopping \u2013 were at risk before the end of summer. Thousands of workers in the industry will have to retrain in other areas of the economy, it said. Read the full story here: Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here is the agenda showing what\u2019s coming up. 9.30am: Health academics give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the quarantine policy. 9.30am: The National Education Union and Ofqual give evidence to the Commons education committee about the impact of coronavirus on education. 10am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, speaks at the CogX summit.

The UK economy is set to be the hardest hit by coronavirus among the world\u2019s developed countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In its latest global economic outlook, the OECD predicted Britain\u2019s economy was likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020. But it warned that if there was a second peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the UK economy could contract by 14% this year. Read the full story here: More criticism of the government\u2019s education policy this morning, as former education secretary Justine Greening says its policies will make the inequality gap wider. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning, she said: I think many people will be very surprised that there isn\u2019t yet a government plan in place to help our schools get back open and there\u2019s also not a government plan in place to help children that have been most affected by the schools shutdown to be able to catch up. And the big risk for Boris Johnson\u2019s government now is that unless they bring forward a proper joined-up strategy, then it won\u2019t be a government that delivers levelling up in Britain, it will end up being a government that levels down and nobody wants to see that. It will open up opportunity gaps that were already there before and make them even wider. Former chief inspector of schools in England Sir Michael Wilshaw has said the government\u2019s approach to education has been an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d. He told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: What\u2019s happened over the last few weeks and months has been an absolute tragedy. And it\u2019s been a tragedy for those youngsters who need school, need the structure of school, need the routine of school, need teachers who will be working with them, to support them when they get very little support at home. He added: I just don\u2019t know how we\u2019ve made such a mess of it, because headteachers, and I know lots of headteachers, will have been saying to the Department for Education, you\u2019ve got this wrong. If you\u2019re going to insist on social distancing and a maximum of 15 in a class we will need double the amount of space, we will need double the amount of teachers and we\u2019ve got to make sure we have that. Reacting to news this morning that NHS hospital waiting lists could hit 10m in England this year, the NHS Confederation chief executive Niall Dickson has said the entire health service is under \u201chuge pressure\u201d. Projections by the NHS Confederation show that the combined effects of keeping up social distancing, the backlog of treatments and challenges around staffing mean the list is expected to rise from around 4.2m currently to around 10m by Christmas. Dickson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: There is going to be huge pressure to get waiting lists down. There\u2019s also going to be huge pressure in other parts of the service - we shouldn\u2019t just concentrate on waiting lists or hospitals but also look at what\u2019s happening in community services and primary care. Because in all those areas the ability of the service to meet demand, and growing demand, over this period will be severely constrained by the fact that Covid is still around - so we are still treating Covid patients and recovering Covid patients. But we are also dealing with this un-met demand which has built up over this period as well as inheriting what happened before Covid, which was already a service under great strain. The quarantine row rumbles on. Conservative MP Caroline Nokes has been on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, saying that the government\u2019s quarantine measures have come \u201cat the wrong time\u201d, although she doeds acknowledge that hindsight is a wonderful thing. The former immigration minister said: I think there have been challenges and 2020 hindsight is always a marvellous thing but its crucially important that we learn the lessons, that we act as quickly as we can in those areas where we haven\u2019t done well. Too many people have died, too many people have been infected and I have said from the outset I think we were slow into lockdown. Quarantine is coming at the wrong time and had we quarantined sooner, perhaps followed the models of countries like Australia and New Zealand who closed borders, we would have seen fewer infections. Asked about the dramatic removal of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, she said it was \u201cterribly symbolic\u201d, but disagreed with the way it was done. Nokes, who is the chairwoman of the women and equalities committee, said: If we\u2019re going to remove these historic artefacts then we should do it carefully. We should have a discussion about what happens to them next, how can we continue to learn from that history and please can we do it appropriately, not drag down monuments and throw them into the harbour, because actually that causes all sorts of damage and issues. That was terribly symbolic and right that it should have happened but can we have a proper debate and do this in a right and thoughtful way? The spread of coronavirus cases is \u201chighly correlated\u201d with the extent of air travel, according to a report. A study by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) named the UK as an example of where a large number of domestic and international flights \u201cfacilitated contagion\u201d, PAMedia reports. The report said \u201cthe flow of air passengers across and within country borders has been a major contributor to the spread of the virus\u201d. Serge Stroobants, an IEP director, told the news agency: The countries most impacted are countries that are really participating in global trade in the globalised world and the interconnected world. These are countries in which you will find a large airport hub, giving the potential to people to travel from one country to the other. That\u2019s why, for example, the region of Milan in Italy, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt, London and New York, those big international hubs created more exchanges and more potential for the virus to grow. The UK government\u2019s policies on air travel during the pandemic have been controversial. Flights have been unrestricted and international arrivals have only been required to enter a 14-day quarantine since Monday. When there was still a small number of coronavirus cases in the UK, there were calls for restrictions on flights from destinations deemed at high risk of the virus. The government insisted at the time there was no evidence that closing borders would be an effective measure. Parents who return to work following extended leave after the June cut-off date for furlough payments will still be eligible for them, the Treasury has said. Those on statutory maternity and paternity leave who return to work in the next few months will be eligible for the furlough scheme after 10 June, the government said. PA Media reports that the coronavirus job retention scheme set to close to new entrants at the end of June, people on paternity and maternity leave who return to work will remain eligible for the furlough scheme. It has been extended until October with extra contributions from employers being introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: When I announced these changes to the furlough scheme last month, I was clear that we wanted to do this in a fair way, that supports people back to work as the country begins to reopen following coronavirus. But for parents returning from leave, their circumstances has meant that they are still in need of support, and I\u2019m pleased that they will be able to receive the financial assistance they and their family will need. Further details of the change will be published on 12 June, the Treasury said. The Treasury said: To enable the introduction of part-time furloughing, and support those already furloughed back to work, claims from July onwards will be restricted to employers currently using the scheme and previously furloughed employees. This means people must be on the furlough scheme by 10 June. However, the government today confirmed that parents on statutory maternity and paternity leave who return to work in the coming months after a long period of absence will be permitted to be furloughed. This will only apply where they work for an employer who has previously furloughed employees. Boris Johnson needs an urgent national plan to get all pupils back to school in England from September, with an army of support staff, the requisitioning of public buildings and extra help for disadvantaged students, unions and cross-party MPs have said. The waiting list for hospital treatment could soar to almost 10 million people by Christmas amid a huge backlog caused by coronavirus disrupting services, NHS leaders are warning. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has confirmed that non-essential shops in England can open from Monday, saying the move will \u201callow high streets up and down the country to spring back to life\u201d. One in 10 UK charities are facing bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle to cope with a \u00a310bn shortfall caused by soaring demand for their services and lost fundraising income due to the coronavirus pandemic, a study shows. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has said the 2 metre distancing rule remains under review in England, despite the prime minister\u2019s hope that his scientific advisers would give the green light to relax it imminently.",

In documents seen by Guardian Australia, a&nbsp;BHP&nbsp;archaeological survey identified rock shelters that were occupied between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago, but in accordance with section 18 of the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act, the traditional owners, the Banjima people, were unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged. Rio Tinto had received ministerial consent under WA legislation to destroy the nearby Juukan Gorge in 2013, but the approval for BHP\u2019s $4.5bn South Flank expansion by the Western Australian minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, came just days after the explosion of the Juukan Gorge garnered global headlines.</p> \n<p><strong>The European Union has accused China of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/eu-says-china-behind-huge-wave-covid-19-disinformation-campaign\">orchestrating a \u201chuge wave\u201d of disinformation</a></strong><strong> about coronavirus. </strong>Commission vice president, V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1, told reporters the EU should not \u201cshy away from naming and shaming\u201d, listing China alongside Russia in creating and spreading \u201ca surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis\u201d. The EU commission also issued an implicit rebuke to US president Donald Trump, noting the potentially harmful effects of his suggestions about injecting bleach to treat Covid-19. Elsewhere, an OECD report has found that the UK\u2019s economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd\">is likely to suffer the most severe contraction of any developed nation</a>, with national income expected to decline by 11.5% during 2020.</p> \n<p><strong>Australian and international environmental law groups have accused the Morrison government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/11/unesco-urged-to-declare-great-barrier-reef-in-danger\">violating its legal obligation to protect the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s world heritage status</a>,</strong> urging the United Nations to place the natural wonder on Unesco\u2019s \u201cin danger\u201d list.

Top stories Mining giant BHP stands poised to destroy as many as 86 significant Aboriginal sites in the Pilbara, just one week after a senior executive from Rio Tinto apologised for the company\u2019s destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site. In documents seen by Guardian Australia, a BHP archaeological survey identified rock shelters that were occupied between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago, but in accordance with section 18 of the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act, the traditional owners, the Banjima people, were unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged.

Australia Foreign interference activity against Australian interests is occurring at an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d, the home affairs department has warned, with independent research organisation the China Policy Centre naming China as \u201camong the fastest-growing sources of threats and challenges\u201d. Two-thirds of people in a fire-affected region of New South Wales suffered at least one symptom of exposure to bushfire smoke this summer, a health survey has found. A royal commission heard last month that smoke from the 2019-20 bushfires caused an estimated 445 deaths and put more than 4,000 people in hospital. More than 190 Australian childcare providers may have breached temporary Covid-19 relief package funding rules. The education department is currently investigating nearly 2,000 anonymous tip-offs .

One of the weirdest aspects about the government\u2019s homebuilder package is that it is not really needed.

      "bodyText": "Business lobby group the CBI has appointed Tony Danker \u2013 a former government adviser \u2013 as its new director general. Danker, 48, will replace Dame Carolyn Fairbairn at the helm of the UK\u2019s foremost business lobby group when she steps down in November after five years in the pivotal industry role. He is currently chief executive of Be the Business, a government and industry-funded organisation launched by George Osborne with the aim of boosting the productivity of British companies. Danker was previously chief strategy officer at Guardian News and Media, the publisher of the Guardian and Observer. The appointment comes at a critical moment for companies around the country as the coronavirus crisis plunges Britain\u2019s economy into the deepest recession in living memory, and as the country gears up for leaving the EU at the end of the Brexit transition period in December. Against a backdrop of mounting job losses as businesses fight to stay afloat, the CBI has taken a key role alongside other business groups and trade unions in shaping the government\u2019s economic response to the crisis. As an organisation with a direct line into government to lobby on behalf of 190,000 businesses, employing 7 million people between them, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, publicly thanked the CBI and unions for helping to design the Covid-19 furlough scheme. However, the CBI has faced criticism in recent years over its stance on Brexit, as one of the most vocal supporters of the remain campaign before the 2016 referendum and as one of the leading organisations warning against a no-deal exit. The lobby group also clashed with Labour ahead of the 2019 election after it was found to have exaggerated claims over the cost of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s renationalisation plans. Danker will be expected to draw on experience at Be the Business in attempting to fix Britain\u2019s dismal productivity record of the past decade as the country recovers from the Covid-19 recession. He also takes over as demands grow on business to better serve society at large, rather than simply lining the pockets of investors and top executives. Pressure is mounting on firms to pay fair taxes, tackle the climate emergency, reduce inequality and boost diversity in the workplace. The CBI said more than half of the candidates considered to lead the organisation were female, while a 10th were from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background. Danker said: \u201cIt is an honour to be asked to lead the CBI, which is doing vital work in response to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Be the Business is also working to support thousands of businesses around the country through challenging times, helping them emerge resilient.

George Floyd died in custody after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring his protests of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The Memorial Day encounter on 25 May, which began with a call about an alleged attempt to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a local market, touched off demonstrations around the world that have already prompted local leaders to act to curb the powers of police as public support for the Black Lives Matter movement surges. \u201cIs that what a Black man\u2019s life is worth? Twenty dollars?\u201d Philonise Floyd said. \u201cThis is 2020. Enough is enough.\u201d \u201cBe the leaders that this country, this world, needs,\u201d he continued. \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d Democrats unveiled sweeping legislation this week aimed at combating excessive use of force by police and limiting legal protections for officers accused of misconduct. Republicans have scrambled to respond to the growing calls for reform. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone Black Republican in the chamber, has been tasked with drafting a conservative legislative response. But their efforts are complicated by the president, whose incendiary response to the protests \u2013 and blunt calls for \u201cLAW AND ORDER\u201d \u2013 have only inflamed tensions. On Wednesday, he tweeted that he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming military bases named after Confederate leaders, even though the Pentagon said it would consider the move. This week, thousands of mourners attended vigils and memorials for George Floyd, which culminated in his funeral in Houston on Tuesday. In his eulogy, the Rev Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, called George Floyd an \u201cordinary brother\u201d who had become the \u201ccornerstone of a movement that\u2019s going to change the whole wide world\u201d. In death, George Floyd became an international symbol of police violence and injustice. But in life he was a father, a brother, a \u201cgentle giant\u201d, Philonise Floyd told lawmakers on Wednesday. While the video of Floyd pinned to the street under the knee of a police officer started a distinct new wave in the justice movement, the family is clearly finding it deeply painful to constantly relive his final moments in what seems like an unending loop on TV and online. \u201cI just think about that video over and over again,\u201d Philonise Floyd said, wiping tears from his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that to a human being, you don\u2019t even do that to an animal.\u201d \u201cJustice has to be served,\u201d he said. \u201cThose officers have to be convicted.\u201d The four officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death have been fired from the force and have been charged by the state attorney general. But activists want more \u2013 they are demanding systemic changes to policing to prevent future deaths at the hands of police. In response to the protests, Minneapolis city council pledged to dismantle and restructure the city\u2019s police department, and other cities are proposing reforms, infuriating some powerful police unions. In testimony on Wednesday, the Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, said there was \u201cno denying that changes in policing must be made\u201d. Yet the hearing laid bare the political divide that has long stood as a barrier to policing reform in America. The committee chair and Democrat Jerrold Nadler urged Congress to adopt the Democrats\u2019 Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which he says would create a \u201cguardian \u2013 not warrior \u2013 model of policing\u201d. Republican Jim Jordan of Ohio, agreed that it was \u201ctime for a real discussion\u201d about police misconduct and discrimination. But he tried to tie Democrats to calls for defunding, which he called \u201cpure insanity\u201d. Among witnesses called by Republicans was Angela Underwood Jacobs, the sister of Dave Patrick Underwood, an African American security officer contracted by the Federal Protective Service who was fatally shot while guarding a courthouse in California during the unrest after Floyd\u2019s death. Speaking to Philonise Floyd, Jacobs said she mourned with his family. But despite most protests being peaceful, she said discrimination was no excuse to \u201cloot and burn our communities\u201d and \u201ckill our officers of the law\u201d. Meanwhile, the congresswoman Lucy McBath of Georgia told Philonise Floyd: \u201cI know your pain.\u201d McBath\u2019s son, Jordan Davis was murdered at 17 by a white man after refusing to turn down rap music in his car. Philonise Floyd urged Congress to at least make his brother\u2019s killing a catalyst for reform. \u201cIf his death ends up changing the world for the better \u2013 and I think it will, I think it has \u2013 then he died as he lived,\u201d he told lawmakers, before marching with protesters through the recently-renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza street near the White House. \u201cIt is on you to make sure his death isn\u2019t in vain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pacific Island nations are urging Australia and New Zealand to include them in a planned travel \u201cbubble\u201d, as flights across the region resume. Pacific governments face a delicate balancing act, weighing the devastating economic impact of border closures and travel restrictions on their tourism-dependent economies, with the risk of widespread and uncontrollable Covid-19 infections if the virus is introduced. The Pacific region has had very low numbers of Covid-19 infections \u2013 just 305 confirmed cases to date \u2013 due to its geographic isolation and the strict enforcement of border closures. Fiji and New Zealand this week declared themselves free of Covid-19, while other Pacific nations, including Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Tonga, have successfully kept the virus from their shores altogether. But in a part of the world that is financially dependent on tourism and which imports much of its food, fuel and other vital supplies, travel lockdowns have hit Pacific economies especially hard. Fiji Airways has laid off 775 employees \u2013 more than half its workforce \u2013 while in Vanuatu, 70% of tourism workers have lost their jobs. A recent survey of Cook Islands businesses forecast a 90% drop in revenue from the economic impact of coronavirus travel restrictions. Some Pacific leaders have expressed hope that inclusion in a travel bubble with Australia and New Zealand, which may open by September, could alleviate some of this distress. \u201cA travel bubble that includes Fiji alongside Australia and New Zealand would do far more good than any aid or assistance \u2026 we want to be in that bubble,\u201d said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji\u2019s minister for the economy at the end of May, after detailing how pandemic travel restrictions could see government revenues halve next financial year. \u201cThe hard truth is that if this drags on much longer, we\u2019ll be coming to you for help one way or the other,\u201d said Fletcher Melvin, the chair of the Cook Islands private sector taskforce, addressing the New Zealand government. \u201cOur community wants a hand, not a handout \u2013 we\u2019d much rather have New Zealand tourism dollars than its aid money.\u201d New Zealand and Australia have been reluctant to consider including Pacific neighbours. Australia has indicated Pacific labourers might be able to travel to Australia to work, but two-way travel is not yet currently being considered. \u201cThe last thing we want to do is imperil those populations,\u201d said Winston Peters, New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister at the end of March, when the idea was first raised. Governments across the Pacific also hold concerns that if the virus were to gain a significant foothold in the region it could devastate island communities, which have limited public health infrastructure, and populations with high rates of comorbidities, such as diabetes. Secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, Dame Meg Taylor, told the Asia Society Policy Institute in May that any reopening would \u201ctake time\u201d and that government\u2019s first priority must be \u201cthat people stay healthy\u201d. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have strong health systems, health services and health infrastructure.\u201d Travel is beginning to resume across the Pacific, but so far has largely been limited to the repatriation of citizens, or travel between communities with existing close ties. But flights from Paris to French Polynesia will resume next month with RNZ reporting that from 15 July, travellers from Europe, the United States and New Caledonia will be allowed to enter the country, though they must have a Covid-19 test three days before departing for the territory and four days after arrival. There have been 60 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in French Polynesia, and the French territory reported the first case in the entire region in mid-March, a returning passenger from Paris.",

      "bodyText": "Businesses have dramatically scaled back investment plans for the rest of the year in response to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK economy, according to a leading business survey. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said its confidence tracker revealed the Covid-19 crisis had driven down investment intentions among its members for the next 12 months by 11 percentage points to a record low of -43%. The monthly survey found investment and hiring intentions \u201cplumbed new depths\u201d last month despite some easing of the lockdown and an improvement in the overall confidence business owners have in the economy, which increased from -69% in April to -60%. Tej Parikh, the IoD\u2019s chief economist, said firms were more optimistic about their own recovery than the broader economic situation, though it was too early to say whether the small and medium-sized businesses that make up the bulk of the IoD\u2019s membership had turned a corner. He warned ministers that businesses would need support through the recovery period or many would go to the wall. \u201cThe government must pull out the stops this summer. If it holds back too much ammo for later in the year, firms\u2019 recoveries will be slowed,\u201d he said. Officials at the Treasury and Bank of England are concerned that businesses will delay spending on new plant and machinery, IT systems and upgrades to ageing properties while they cope with the coronavirus crisis, jeopardising the recovery. Ministers have come under pressure to announce tax cuts and other incentives to spur extra spending by consumers and businesses to prevent the recession turning into a depression lasting several years. Referring to the employment protection scheme that pays employees 80% of their wages if they cannot work, Parikh added: \u201cWhen the furlough scheme ends, employment could take a hit. The government should help companies fill the gap by reducing the cost of hiring. \u201cWith cash tight, smaller firms could also benefit from tax breaks to adjust to the new normal, while the debt businesses have built up will hold back the economy unless it\u2019s addressed.\u201d The report followed analysis by the stockbroker Peel Hunt of the cancelled investment decisions of listed companies, which it estimates has reached \u00a323bn.

      "bodyText": "Britain risks entrenching deep class, ethnic, gender, educational, generational and geographical divides unless the government acts to tackle inequality, a leading thinktank has said. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Covid-19 pandemic threatened to make life worse for the most vulnerable groups and urged ministers to seize the opportunity to forge an inclusive recovery. The IFS said it was not inevitable the crisis would exacerbate inequality but said that would be the outcome in the absence of better education and training, moves to ensure the survival of small businesses and the provision of catch-up lessons for children from poorer households. The Covid-19 report \u2013 part of a five-year IFS project on inequality \u2013 found that: Low earners were most likely to work in shut-down sectors, to have been furloughed or be at risk of unemployment. A gap in death rates between better-off and less affluent neighbourhoods, as well as between some ethnic minorities and the white majority, had widened further. Some minority ethnic groups, especially those of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin, were much more likely to work in shut-down sectors. Black groups were disproportionately represented in key worker occupations and had been contracting Covid-19 at far higher rates than the white majority. Workers under 25 were twice as likely as those over 25 to work in a locked-down sector. Mothers were more likely than fathers to take on the additional childcare and housework duties caused by the lockdown. Private schools were almost twice as likely to be providing online teaching as the state schools attended by children from the fifth most deprived families. Robert Joyce, the deputy director at IFS, and an author of the report, said: \u201cThe crisis has laid bare existing inequalities and risks exacerbating them, but some of its legacies might also provide opportunities.\u201d Ministers should be laying the foundations for a strong and inclusive recovery as well as dealing with the immediate crisis, Joyce added. \u201cIf, for example, we can limit now the severity of career disruption, the widening of health and educational inequalities, or the extent to which small firms that had a productive future are squeezed out by larger established competitors, policy\u2019s job in years to come will be much less difficult than if it is trying to limit or undo the damage.\u201d In a separate development, the head of an employers\u2019 organisation has called on the government to prioritise jobs and training for the young to aid recovery. In a letter to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the director general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said: \u201cRedundancies will rise fast over the autumn as support schemes, especially the job retention scheme, wind down. Past recessions show the impact of joblessness is deeply uneven.\u201d \u201cWithout immediate intervention, pre-crisis inequalities across regions, gender and race will worsen. Long-term unemployment will leave generational scars,\u201d Fairbairn added. \u201cTime is of the essence. Smart, fast policy is needed now to accelerate the process to minimise the human cost and in particular, protect the futures of our young people.\u201d",

This \u201cexceptional\u201d crisis measure gave the government temporary constitutional powers to introduce restrictions during the pandemic. Now the government is planning legislation allowing it to lift the state of emergency while keeping certain measures to avoid a second wave of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The number of patients in intensive care units in hospitals with the virus has dropped to below 1,000, from a spike of more than 7,000 in April, and the number of deaths each day is falling.

These measures would last until November, but could be changed according to circumstances. The law would not give the French authorities the power to reimpose a lockdown; if the virus suddenly returns, the government will have to seek a decree authorising new restrictions over the whole or part of France, Matignon, the French equivalent of Number 10, said.</p> \n  <p>France\u2019s external borders are currently closed to all but essential workers and those with a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to enter the country.

One in four tests conducted in the country come back positive, the WHO said, which indicates a high level of infection. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brazil restored on Tuesday detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website,</strong> following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated.<br>The detailed information, with cumulative totals and breakdowns by state, was restored to the website https://covid.saude.gov.br/, Reuters confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.</li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d</strong>. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms.</li> \n   <li><strong>A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased.</strong> The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment.</li> \n   <li><strong>The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned.</strong> Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised</strong>. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions.</li> \n   <li><strong>Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. </strong>Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have been </strong><strong>sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America</strong>, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day.</li> \n   <li><strong>The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned</strong>. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics</strong>. His government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of data on to pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the death toll or number of infections.</li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak</strong>, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>Face masks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June.</strong> \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d said the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Italy to help doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak returned home to a heroes\u2019 welcome</strong>.

Producers say the most noticeable difference for viewers will be in how the show has been filmed. Shooting resumed on Monday under physical distancing measures, including no kissing and actors over the age of 70 barred, appearing in storylines via Zoom calls. The move has ensured that fans of the 59-year-old soap do not run out of fresh episodes to watch. Louise Taylor and David Conn report: Premier League clubs should be braced for a collective \u00a3500m loss of revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic, Deloitte has warned. The accountancy group predicted the devastating drop in income will result from rebates to broadcasters and commercial partners and the collapse of matchday revenue with games behind closed doors. Deloitte expects clubs\u2019 2019-20 accounts to show a \u00a31bn drop in revenue with half of that to be lost permanently. The unusual receipt of broadcast money for this season\u2019s games in June and July will allow clubs, whose financial years end on 31 May or 30 June, to boost revenues in their 2020-21 accounts, potentially to collective record-breaking levels, particularly as next season marks the start of a new, more lucrative TV deal. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak so far today include: The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister. France saw a below-average increase in deaths. The death toll has risen by only 23 \u2013 well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks \u2013 to 29,319. That is the fifth-highest nominal total in the world. A US pharmaceutical company claimed a drug specifically designed to treat Covid-19 could be authorised for use as early as September. The chief scientist at Eli Lilly and Co told Reuters the feat could be achieved if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing. Hollywood productions will be allowed to resume from Friday, local authorities said. While work could resume, cinemas must remain closed, California state officials said. Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cordoba, where he caught Covid-19. Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid and failed to observe two weeks\u2019 quarantine, instead travelling to Cordoba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown. Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: \u201cOur evaluation is that 800,000 jobs will be lost in the coming months, or 2.8% of total employment.\u201d Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years, a leading Russian radio station has reported, indicating that the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least two times higher than official tallies for the month, The global economy will contract at least 6% this year, with the unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said. Airlines are set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast. With most of the world\u2019s airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely halve, falling from $419bn from $838bn last year. China was accused of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus. The European commission said Russia and China were running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns. in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Africa has passed 200,000, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s office for the region. According to data later published by the Africa Centres for Disease Control, 54 African countries reported 203,899 cases, 5,530 deaths, and 91,398 recoveries by Wednesday evening. Denmark, the first country outside Asia to ease its coronavirus lockdown, said on Wednesday the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it entered its second phase of reopening society last month. The Nordic country allowed restaurants, cafes and malls to resume business during May. Asylum applications in Europe fell to the lowest level for over a decade in April as borders closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, European Union figures show. The number of asylum applications declined to 8,730 during April, an 86% drop from 61,421 in February, according to figures obtained by Reuters. South Korea cases spiked again. South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases spiked to 50 new cases on Wednesday, after two consecutive days of fewer than 40 cases. \u201cAll but three of the locally transmitted cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area,\u201d the Yonhap News Agency reported. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch with news from your part of the world on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Brazil has confirmed a total of 772,416 cases, with 32,913 new infections in the last 24 hours, as the world\u2019s second worst outbreak after the US continues to surge. With another 1,274 fatalities, the death toll in Brazil has reached 39,680, the world\u2019s third highest after the US and UK. There has been no sign yet of an increase in cases from two weeks of protests across the US, the country\u2019s vice-president Mike Pence has claimed. He has told Fox Business Network: What I can tell you is that, at this point, we don\u2019t see an increase in new cases now, nearly two weeks on from when the first protests took effect. Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House task force Pence chairs, has expressed concern about the protests taking place during the pandemic. \u201cWhen you get congregations like we saw with the demonstrations, that\u2019s taking a risk,\u201d Fauci said on Wednesday in an interview on ABC. Last Friday, he said the mass protests were a \u201cperfect setup\u201d for spreading the virus. Mexico City will embark on a large-scale testing effort as the centrepiece of its plan to reopen its economy, its mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has said. The plan sees it diverge from the federal governments strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources. The goal will be performing some 100,000 tests per month by July and trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said. The Associated Press reported that it will be paired with an intensive information campaign. Film and TV production can resume in Los Angeles County on Friday, local authorities have said, but cinemas must remain closed. California state officials said earlier this week that cinemas could reopen as early as Friday, pending approval from local officials. Los Angeles County is the biggest movie market in the United States. Movie theatres closed their doors around the world in mid-March to help curb the epidemic and movie and television production also ground to a halt. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, has reported a record number of deaths for the second day running \u2013 even as its metropolis allowed shops to reopen. The epicentre of the Brazilian epidemic has recorded 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours, raising the state\u2019s confirmed death toll to 9,862, a fourth of the country\u2019s total fatalities, the governor\u2019s office said. That did not stop shoppers flocking to the 25 de Mar\u00e7o shopping district where around half of the businesses were open. Although stores considered essential, such as supermarkets and pharmacies, have remained open, most shops in S\u00e3o Paulo have been shut since March. Shoppers packed the streets. Stores allowed in only people wearing masks and provided alcohol gel. Some took the temperature of shoppers at the entrance. \u201cI\u2019m afraid because the virus is growing, but at the same time we have to go to work and buy things to sell, though always protected by a mask,\u201d said Vanessa Pereira, a saleswoman. The city\u2019s shopping centres will reopen on Thursday for four hours a day after agreeing with authorities on reducing public access as a precaution against the contagion. In Rio de Janeiro, the second hardest-hit Brazilian city, the mayor announced malls will also reopen on Thursday as part of a scheduled easing of restrictions. The decisions to reopen shops has been advocated by Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who has minimised the gravity of the outbreak and dismissed warnings by public health experts that the contagion is still surging. Brazil has 739,503 confirmed cases, the world\u2019s worst outbreak after the United States, and has suffered from at least 38,406 deaths. Earlier, Bolsonaro told an actress to \u201cget out of here\u201d after she criticised his response to the pandemic at a gathering of supporters outside his official residence in the capital Brasilia. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak so far today include: The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities.

Eli Lilly and Co could have a drug specifically designed to treat Covid-19 authorised for use as early as September if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing, its chief scientist has claimed. Lilly is also doing preclinical studies of a third antibody treatment for the illness that could enter human clinical trials in the coming weeks, the chief scientific officer Daniel Skovronsky has said in an interview with the Reuters news agency. Lilly has already launched human trials with two of the experimental therapies. The drugs belong to a class of biotech medicines called monoclonal antibodies widely used to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and many other conditions. A monoclonal antibody drug developed against Covid-19 is likely to be more effective than repurposed medicines currently being tested against the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 950 more deaths and 17,376 new cases, taking the official totals in the USA to 112,133 and 1,973,797, respectively.

Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister. Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cordoba, where he caught Covid-19. Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cordoba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when travellers were meant to quarantine for two weeks, and gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown. Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: \u201cOur evaluation is that 800,000 jobs will be lost in the coming months, or 2.8% of total employment.\u201d Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years, a leading Russian radio station has reported, indicating that the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least two times higher than official tallies for the month, The global economy will contract at least 6% this year, with the unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said. Airlines are set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast. With most of the world\u2019s airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely halve, falling from $419bn from $838bn last year. China was accused of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus. The European commission said Russia and China were running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns. in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Africa has passed 200,000, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s office for the region. According to data later published by the Africa Centres for Disease Control, 54 African countries reported 203,899 cases, 5,530 deaths, and 91,398 recoveries by Wednesday evening. Denmark, the first country outside Asia to ease its coronavirus lockdown, said on Wednesday the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it entered its second phase of reopening society last month. The Nordic country allowed restaurants, cafes and malls to resume business during May. Asylum applications in Europe fell to the lowest level for over a decade in April as borders closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, European Union figures show. The number of asylum applications declined to 8,730 during April, an 86% drop from 61,421 in February, according to figures obtained by Reuters. South Korea cases spiked again. South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases spiked to 50 new cases on Wednesday, after two consecutive days of fewer than 40 cases. \u201cAll but three of the locally transmitted cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area,\u201d the Yonhap News Agency reported. France\u2019s death toll has risen by only 23 \u2013 well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks \u2013 to 29,319. That is the fifth-highest nominal total in the world. On Tuesday, 87 deaths were reported. But the number of new confirmed cases was up by 545 to 155,136 after that figure stayed below the 500 threshold during the last three days, Reuters has reported. In the UK, the opposition Liberal Democrats are demanding the government commit to an inquiry into its handling of the country\u2019s epidemic as the prime minister Boris Johnson announces the easing of a series of lockdown measures, including allowing zoos to reopen, while abandoning chaotic plans for a full reopening of schools. Ed Davey, the acting leader of a party that accounts for 21 of the Commons\u2019 650 MPs, has said: Parents and teachers will be asking why the prime minister is talking just about theme parks and zoos when so many parents want to hear about the practical steps to reopen schools safely in the weeks ahead. The fact remains that a comprehensive test, trace and isolate system is still the only way to keep people safe as we move out of lockdown. Yet the government still hasn\u2019t delivered on this, and apparently won\u2019t be able to until September. Ministers can\u2019t even provide figures for the number of people being tested day-to-day. The prime minister needs to be utterly transparent about the barriers to opening schools, the limits to testing capacity and the issues affecting the test, trace and isolate system. As more and more questions are raised about key decisions throughout this crisis, Boris Johnson must now commit to an independent inquiry into his government\u2019s handling of this pandemic.

According to the department for health, 41,128 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Tuesday, up from 40,883 the day before, the PA News Agency reported. The Government figures do not include all deaths involving coronavirus across the UK, which is thought to have passed 52,000. Health authorities also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Wednesday, 170,379 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,003 positive results. Overall, a total of 6,042,622 tests have been carried out and 290,143 cases have been confirmed positive. The figure for the number of people tested has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d across all methods of testing. The owner of Zara will close as many as 1,200 stores around the world as the clothing retailer tries to boost online sales during the chaos wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, reports Jasper Jolly for the Guardian\u2019s business desk. Inditex said it would \u201cabsorb\u201d between 1,000 and 1,200 mainly smaller stores, with losses concentrated among older shops from brands other than Zara. The Spanish company\u2019s other brands include Bershka, Pull &amp; Bear and Massimo Dutti. Closures are expected to be concentrated in Asia and Europe. It is understood that the 107 Inditex stores in the UK are less likely to be significantly affected. Inditex said that \u201cheadcount will remain stable\u201d, with staff offered roles in other jobs such as dispatching online purchases. The total store count will fall from 7,412 to between 6,700 and 6,900 after the reorganisation, which will also include the opening of 450 new shops. Inditex, one of the world\u2019s largest clothing retailers, has been hit hard during the pandemic, with sales down 44% to \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.9bn) between 1 February and 30 April, the first quarter of its financial year. The company reported a net loss of \u20ac409m during the quarter. Almost a quarter of its shops remained closed by 8 June. Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent, has more details on Italian prosecutors\u2019 plans to question their prime minister today. She writes: The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven by relatives of coronavirus victims into alleged errors made by authorities at the beginning of the pandemic. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, will also question the health minister, Roberto Speranza and the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, over the failure by authorities to quarantine the towns of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro after outbreaks occurred there. The move came after grieving families of Covid-19 victims on Wednesday submitted the first 50 complaints to Bergamo prosecutors as they push for an investigation into possible criminal negligence by authorities. The files were brought together by members of NOI Denunceremo (we will denounce), a Facebook group set up in April. \u201cWe haven\u2019t identified culprits in the files but the other day we spoke to the prosecutor and explained that our main objective is to find out the truth,\u201d Luca Fusco, the president of NOI Denunceremo, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in convictions, we just want to understand what happened. If we understand what happened we can change a system that made mistakes.\u201d Travel restrictions at the European Union\u2019s external borders should be partially lifted by 1 July, the bloc\u2019s top diplomat has said, according to the Associated Press. Josep Borrell said on Wednesday that the European Commission will discuss a coordinated plan with member nations and \u201cput forward an approach for the gradual and partial lifting of these restrictions as of the 1st of July, with certain third countries.\u201d All but essential travel from outside Europe is restricted until 15 June. Many ministers from the 27-nation EU suggested earlier this month that they wanted this deadline extended until early July. As for the EU\u2019s internal borders, Borrell said the executive commission took note that several countries are in the process of lifting internal border controls imposed to keep out people from other member states. Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cordoba while the country was under its strict coronavirus lockdown that included two weeks\u2019 quarantine for people arriving in the country. A scandal erupted after Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cordoba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. He subsequently tested positive for coronavirus and all guests at the party were forced to quarantine themselves. Joachim\u2019s presence at the party, revealed by Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, caused an uproar in both Spain, which has one of the world\u2019s highest death tolls, and in Belgium, which has one of the highest per capita death tolls. After news of his The Belgian royal family said that Joachim had travelled to Spain for an internship. Since travelling for work was considered essential travel this allowed him to leave the country at a time when borders were closed. On Wednesday, Spanish authorities slapped Joachim with the fine, not over the party but because he did not quarantine after arriving in Madrid, as had been mandatory at the time, Belgian Flemish-language news website De Morgen reports. If he pays within 15 days he will only have to pay half. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the country\u2019s health and interior ministers are to be questioned over their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, reports AFP citing news agencies reported. Prosecutors from Bergamo, the city in the northern Lombardy region worst hit by the virus, have launched a wide-ranging investigation into the health crisis, which has officially killed over 34,000 people in Italy. They are looking in particular at why a red zone was not enforced in February around the towns of Nembro and Alzano, with regional officials and the government blaming each other. The government imposed its first red zone, around the town of Codogno, 24 hours after doctors discovered a patient with the virus. It would go on to shut down 10 other towns, and then large areas of the north before imposing a nationwide lockdown. Conte, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, and the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, would be called on by prosecutors in Rome later Wednesday, according to the Corriere della Sera and the Sole 24 Ore dailies. The team, lead by chief prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota, has already questioned the Lombardy region\u2019s head, Attilio Fontana, and his health minister, Giulio Gallera, who insist it is the role of the national government to decide whether certain areas should be shut. Guardian science editor Ian Sample explains how vaccines work, runs through some of the main obstacles to creating one for coronavirus and preparing it for public use, and tells us which scenario he thinks is most realistic in the next 18 months. Poland will open its borders with fellow European Union countries on Saturday and allow international flights from next Tuesday, as the country unfreezes its economy despite an increase in coronavirus cases. Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. However, it has been progressively loosening restictions on public life, with shopping centres, hotels and restaurants all reopening in May. \u201cIn some countries...this pandemic is still behaving in a very disturbing way, so for now we limit this decision (opening borders) to European Union countries,\u201d the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Poland has seen a recent rise in infections, mostly centred around coal mines in the south. On Monday a record 599 new cases were reported. As of Wednesday morning Poland, a country of around 38 million people, had reported 27,668 cases of the coronavirus and 1,191 deaths. Austria said on Wednesday it was lifting checks at its border with Italy and ending quarantine requirements for more than 20 European countries as of next Tuesday. The Coachella music festival in the Southern California desert is unlikely to take place this year, entertainment news website Billboard has reported. The move comes as Anschutz Entertainment Group, the parent company of the music festival\u2019s organiser Goldenvoice, is laying off 15% of the workforce, the report said. Earlier in March, Goldenvoice said the music festival had been postponed for six months until October due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Coachella, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, brings half a million fans to an open-air site in Indio, east of Los Angeles, over two weekends and was originally scheduled to take place on 10-12 and 17-19 April. France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown. Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: Our evaluation is that 800,000 jobs will be lost in the coming months, or 2.8% of total employment. The shock is considerable and calls for massive public policies to support and accompany all those affected. Such measures include the furlough scheme, tax breaks for companies and financial incentives to hire apprentices, he said. The Bank of France said on Tuesday the French economy will likely shrink about 10%, resulting from the countrywide strict lockdown imposed in March. The economy will not recover to pre-crisis levels until mid-2022, it said. Unemployment is expected to surge to above 11.5% by mid-2021, well above previous peaks, the bank said. France\u2019s economy shrank 5.3% in the first three months of the year, and statistics office Insee has said the contraction could reach 20 percent in the second quarter. The country is bracing for its worst recession since World War II. France is planning an outlay of some \u20ac45bn to support the sectors most in danger, according to the latest version of a budget presented by the government Wednesday. The government has pledged \u20ac15bn alone for the country\u2019s aviation industry, where thousands of jobs are on the line as the coronavirus crisis hammers the travel industry. A disenchanted supporter has confronted the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, outside his official residence, accusing the right-wing populist of \u201cbetraying\u201d the country with his response to Covid-19, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, in Rio de Janeiro. The woman challenged Bolsonaro outside the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada in \u200eBras\u00edlia on Wednesday morning, pulling out a poster with Brazil\u2019s official coronavirus death toll written on it: 38,000. \u201cThese are not 38,000 statistics. They are 38,000 families that are dying right now. 38,000 people who are crying,\u201d the woman told Bolsonaro. \u201cI voted for you. I campaigned for you ... and I feel you have betrayed our people.\u201d As Brazil\u2019s president walked away she shouted: \u201cPeople are dying and you are ignoring me!\u201d According to Brazilian newspapers, Bolsonaro - who is facing growing public anger for his handling of the pandemic - subsequently told the women to \u201cget out of here\u201d and accused her of talking \u201cabobrinha\u201d (courgette) - which roughly translates as talking cobblers. Brazil looks set to overtake the UK as the country with the second highest official Covid-19 death toll later this week, but on Tuesday Bolsonaro insisted it was time to get back to business. Authorities in Zimbabwe have started publicly naming people who have escaped from quarantine centres and urging the public to report them to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. Zimbabwe has seen a rise in confirmed cases of coronavirus in recent days, with most recorded at quarantine centres. More than 3,700 people are being detained after entering the country, mostly from neighbouring South Africa and Botswana, but dozens are fleeing the confinement complaining of filthy, unhygienic conditions and spreading infections. Zimbabwe had on Wednesday reported 314 cases of coronavirus, according to figures released by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, up from 56 recorded toward the end of May. Most of the new cases have been reported at the quarantine centres. The information minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, said on Tuesady this showed the effectiveness of the country\u2019s mandatory 21-day isolation regime. The German government on Wednesday eased entry restrictions for seasonal farm workers that were first introduced to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, AFP reports. From 16 June until 31 December, seasonal workers from the European Union and the passport-free Schengen zone will once again be allowed to freely enter Germany by land or air to help harvest crops, the agriculture minister, Julia Kloeckner, announced. \u201cUntil the end of the year, farmers can employ additional seasonal workers from abroad,\u201d Kloeckner said, warning however that they would have to follow strict hygiene rules. \u201cThis is the only way to work responsibly in times of a pandemic. It\u2019s in all our interests that farmers can keep harvesting and sowing.\u201d German farms usually require 300,000 foreign harvest helpers a year, mainly from Poland and Romania. But at the height of the coronavirus crisis in March the government closed borders and capped the number of seasonal workers allowed to enter the country at 80,000. Farmers even chartered special flights to fly in Romanian workers amid fears that strawberry and asparagus harvests could go to waste because of a shortage of labour. By early June, just under 39,000 seasonal workers had travelled to Germany, according to the agriculture ministry. Under the new guidelines, which come as Germany\u2019s coronavirus outbreak is deemed to be under control, harvest workers have to keep at least 1.5 metres (ft) from each other and work in small teams. If anyone falls ill with Covid-19, their team is to be isolated immediately and employers must notify the local health authorities. Google has said it will show commuters public transport alerts on its Maps software, in a bid to help people avoid overcrowding during the coronavirus pandemic. Transit alerts will appear whenever a trip is likely to be affected by Covid-19 restrictions, with mandatory precautions from official local data, the UK\u2019s PA Media reports. These include warnings if public transport services are suspended due to the pandemic. Google is rolling out the feature in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, France, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, the UK and the US. Public transport has been operating on reduced timetables since the outbreak started, with only key workers advised to make journeys if they have no alternative. Google is also introducing alerts on Maps for drivers to provide information on checkpoints and restrictions along their route, such as when crossing national borders \u2013 though this feature will only be available in Canada, Mexico and the US initially. Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years, a leading Russian radio station has reported, indicating that the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least two times higher than official tallies for the month, writes Andrew Roth, in the Russian capital. According to data released on Wednesday, Moscow had 5,799 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d \u2013 the number of deaths exceeding what would regularly be expected \u2013 for the month of May, while the city has reported around 2,750 deaths on Wednesday where coronavirus was the primary cause for the month. The Moscow health department later confirmed the number of excess deaths at 5,799 and revised up the number of people who died from coronavirus in May to 2,757. Statisticians and doctors have previously told the Guardian that 75% or more of excess deaths are likely to be tied to the coronavirus outbreak. The data is in line with several other major Russian cities, where total mortality data has shown thousands of deaths not reflected in official coronavirus tallies. St Petersburg last week issued 1,552 more death certificates this May than in the previous year, a nearly 32% rise barely reflected in the official coronavirus death toll for the month of 171. Moscow will report 15,700 deaths for the month of May, Russia\u2019s Ekho of Moscow radio station said on Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. Its editor, Alexey Venediktov, said the average death toll for May in 2017-19 was 9,996, indicating 5,704 excess deaths. Data on the city\u2019s mortality rate for May is likely to be released this week, and Ekho of Moscow\u2019s editor has correctly reported the figures in the past before their release. Russian officials have aggressively denied the data on coronavirus deaths is being massaged. Even if corrected upward to reflect more likely deaths from coronavirus, the death toll in cities such as St Petersburg or Moscow will likely remain lower than in the worst-hit cities like New York. Two of Britain\u2019s most influential conductors, Sir Simon Rattle and Sir Mark Elder, have warned of a \u201cdevastated landscape\u201d after the pandemic in which orchestras may not survive, writes Mark Brown, the Guardian\u2019s arts correspondent. Rattle and Elder said musicians in the UK felt \u201cout in the wilderness\u201d and called for more clarity from the government of when and how they can return to playing. The performing arts, including theatre, music and dance, will be some of the last activities to be resumed as the UK climbs out of the lockdown. With no income, many arts organisations are burning through reserves and, without targeted help, some may not survive. In a letter to the Guardian, Rattle, the music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Elder, the music director of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, describe classical music\u2019s situation as desperate. \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this; orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality.\u201d Iran on Wednesday announced more than 2,000 new coronavirus infections, in line with a recent surge in cases that its president, Hassan Rouhani, attributed to increased testing. The health ministry spokeswoman, Sima Sadat Lari, said the 2,011 infections confirmed in the past 24 hours had raised Iran\u2019s overall caseload to 177,938. The death toll reached 8,506, after 81 new deaths over the same period. In a televised cabinet meeting, Rouhani said: \u201cWhen more tests are done, then naturally more cases are identified.\u201d But the high number of recent cases \u201cdoes not have a negative aspect to it, and people should not worry\u201d, he was quoted as saying by AFP. The ministry says it has carried out more than 1m coronavirus tests since it reported the country\u2019s first cases on 19 February. There has been scepticism at home and abroad about Iran\u2019s official figures, with concerns the real toll could be much higher. Rising infection figures since a low in early May and lax observance of social distancing have worried authorities, which have reiterated calls for strict adherence to health protocols. Austria is to reopen its border with Italy and allow free travel from most other European countries from 16 June, the foreign minister has said, according to AFP. Last week, Austria relaxed restrictions for travel to some neighbouring states but had excluded Italy, one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. On Wednesday, the foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, told a press conference: \u201cYes, we are opening the border. Yes, travelling to Italy, to Greece, to Croatia, for example, will be possible.\u201d However, travel between Austrial and Sweden, Spain, Portugal and the UK will remain restricted. Travellers from those countries will still have to show a negative coronavirus test or undergo a two-week home quarantine. A travel warning will also stay in place for Lombardy in northern Italy, which emerged as a coronavirus hotspot during the pandemic, Schallenberg said, explaining that the government was urging Austrians to avoid travelling there. On 10 March, Austria was among the first in the EU to announce that it was closing its borders with Italy to try to curb the spread the coronavirus pandemic. Austria has been spared the brunt of the health crisis. On Wednesday, it reported 26 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 17,005, of whom 15,910 have recovered. The death toll stands at 673, with one new death announced on Wednesday. Germany is extending its coronavirus pandemic travel warnings for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August, the Associated Press reports. The government agreed on Wednesday to extend the guidance, first introduced on 17 March, to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak. Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and the UK. Also on Wednesday, the government announced the end of border controls for EU citizens coming to Germany. Almost all German states require travellers arriving from countries that have 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days to quarantine for two weeks. This is currently the case for fellow EU member state Sweden. Afghanistan\u2019s health minister has asked the nation to learn how to live with the coronavirus as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed 22,000 and Helmand recorded two more deaths from Covid-19, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii for the Guardian in Herat. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, the acting health minister, told the public on Wednesday to \u201clearn how to live with coronavirus, because it won\u2019t disappear in a matter of months or weeks\u201d. He was talking from one of the capital\u2019s Covid-19 hospitals and said the problem of compressed oxygen has been solved. \u201cI talked with all compressed oxygen producer companies, which are six in the capital, and we signed a contract with them so they will produce us more oxygen,\u201d Osmani said. Covid-19 patients and their relatives have been struggling with lack of compressed oxygen since early this week. \u201cThe oxygen lasts for only five minutes, then we are asked to go to private hospitals. Even if there is oxygen at private hospitals, I must buy the oxygen for 12,000 Afghanis ($155) from my own pocket\u201d, a family member of a patient told local television \u201cThe lack of oxygen is a big problem. Recently a patient died here and then my patient started losing hope. The other patient died just because of a lack of oxygen.\u201d Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases has passed 22,000, after the health ministry detected 684 new cases from 1,128 tests in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 22,143. Twenty one patients died overnight, raising the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll to 405. There have been 2,975 recoveries. The ministry has so far tested 50,658 suspected patients. Most of the new cases were reported in the capital, Kabul, where the health ministry detected 393 new cases out of 590 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area in both number of confirmed transmissions and deaths with 8,829 cases and 84 deaths. The western province of Herat recorded 96 new cases out of 163 tests in the last 24 hours as 10 patients died overnight. Herat has so far recorded 4,104 confirmed cases and 76 deaths. Wahid Qatali, the governor of Herat, said on Tuesday night that the actual number of infections in the province may be more than 60,000. In Helmand, two more patients died of Covid-19, bringing the total number of deaths to eight. Helmand recorded its first death on Saturday. Nearly all economic and social activities have resumed in Malaysia, after nearly three months in pandemic lockdown apparently successfully contained transmission of coronavirus. Malaysians can now travel for domestic holidays, get haircuts and shop at street markets, the Associated Press reports. Schools and religious activities also will gradually resume. Malaysia has had 8,336 confirmed infections and 117 deaths. Daily cases have dropped to only seven since Monday, the lowest since the lockdown started on 18 March. While happy to be back at work, hairstylist Shirley Chai told the American news agency that is nervous about the strict health rules for hairdressers, especially the one-hour limit for each client. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night. Very excited because everything is changing,\u201d she said at her salon in a Kuala Lumpur shopping mall. Malaysia has entered a \u201crecovery\u201d phase until the end of August with certain prohibitions still in place, but officials warn restrictions will be reinstated if infections soar again. Night clubs, pubs, karaoke bars, theme parks and reflexology centres will stay shut. Contact sports or those with many spectators, and activities involving mass groups, are still banned. The global economy will contract at least 6% this year, with the unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said. In the case of a second wave of contagion later in the year, economic output could shrink by as much as 7.6 percent, it warned. In both scenarios, recovery will be \u201cslow and uncertain\u201d. In its latest economic outlook report, the OECD said: The lockdown measures brought in by most governments have succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus and in reducing the death toll but they have also frozen business activity in many sectors, widened inequality, disrupted education and undermined confidence in the future. As restrictions begin to be eased, the path to economic recovery remains highly uncertain and vulnerable to a second wave of infections. With or without a second outbreak, the consequences will be severe and long-lasting. The OECD has published several tweets illustrating its forecasts. Suffice to say, the economic outlook is bleak, to say the least. As the OECD says in its report: The global economy is now experiencing the deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s, with GDP declines of more than 20% and a surge in unemployment in many countries. Even in countries where containment measures have been relatively light, early data are already making clear that the economic and social costs of the pandemic will be large. Growth prospects depend on many factors, including how Covid-19 evolves, the duration of any shutdowns, the impact on activity, and the implementation of fiscal and monetary policy support. Uncertainty will likely prevail for an extended period. Given this uncertainty, two scenarios have been developed to reflect the possible evolution of the global economy. In the double-hit scenario, it is assumed that renewed shutdowns are implemented before end of 2020, following another surge of the Covid-19 virus. Earlier on Wednesday, my colleague on the business desk, Phillip Inman, wrote more specifically about the OECD\u2019s forecasts for the UK. As traumatised US farmers continue to cull their animals in response to the slaughterhouse crisis, an Iowan pig producer has developed an on-farm method which he believes is quicker and more humane than other available options, writes Sophie Kevany for the Guardian\u2019s Animals Farmed project. The coronavirus crisis has hit US meat plants particularly hard. As a result there is a lack of slaughter capacity, and farmers are being forced to cull or \u201cdepopulate\u201d their animals on-farm. Approved methods include gassing with CO2, but the practice is controversial. \u201cDying this way is not a peaceful experience\u201d, even under normal circumstances, let alone in makeshift sheds or trailers, said president of welfare group, Mercy for Animals, Leah Garc\u00e9s. Gassing the animals is currently thought to be one of the fastest and most humane methods, leaving animals unconscious within two minutes and dead within 10. The carcasses are incinerated, composted or rendered for fat, fertiliser and pet food. But for Dwight Mogler of Iowa\u2019s Pig Hill Farms, that is too long. Mogler is a sixth-generation pig farmer with firsthand experience of gassing newborn pigs. \u201cI have talked to people who have been on site for a CO2 depopulation and we have used it for neonatal [new-born] pigs. It can take up to a minute,\u201d he said. Airlines are set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast on Tuesday, according to Reuters. With most of the world\u2019s airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely halve, falling from $419bn from $838bn last year. \u201cEvery day of this year will add $230 million to industry losses,\u201d the IATA\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said. The average loss amounts to almost $38 per passenger flown. In 2021, IATA warned losses could hit $100 billion as traffic struggles to recover and airlines slash fares to win business. \u201cAirlines will still be financially fragile in 2021,\u201d De Juniac said, predicting \u201ceven more intense\u201d competition. \u201cThat will translate into strong incentives for travellers to take to the skies again,\u201d he added. IATA forecast a rise in 2021 revenue to $598 billion. Airlines are counting the cost of weeks of lost business, a debt pile swollen by bailouts and a diminished demand outlook. Passenger numbers are seen falling to 2.25 billion this year before rising to 3.38 billion in 2021, still more than 25% below 2019 levels. Flags flew at half mast in Burundi on Monday, the morning after the announcement of the sudden death of the president, Pierre Nkurunziza, who many suspect died of Covid-19. The first lady, Denise Bucumi, who had been recovering from the coronavirus in a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, flew back to Bujumbura late on Tuesday, a source in the presidency told AFP on condition of anonymity. Condolences poured in from across Africa. John Magufuli, president of Tanzania, praised Nkurunziza\u2019s \u201cstrong leadership and his efforts to fight for peace, development and democracy.\u201d But critics regretted that Nkurunziza had died without justice being served for human rights abuses under his rule. His 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country. Members of the ruling party mourned Nkurunziza\u2019s death. \u201cIt is a catastrophe, it is as if the sky has crashed down on us. What will become of us without our supreme guide,\u201d one party leader told AFP, sobbing, on condition of anonymity. Gerard, a party member in Nkurunziza\u2019s home province of Ngozi, was quoted by the French news agency as saying he could not understand how Nkurunziza \u201chad died just like that \u2026 we are obliged to believe this official version, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Rumours swirled on social media, with some wondering if he had been poisoned, while others suspecting he had been infected by coronavirus. Burundi has largely ignored the pandemic, which Nkurunziza declared had spared Burundi thanks to God. Some in the country were gripped by anxiety over what comes next. \u201cI am very worried for the future of course, because we don\u2019t know what is going to happen in the coming days, if the CNDD-FDD is not going to tear themselves apart over the leadership,\u201d said Raoul, a young opposition supporter who works in a bank, and like many only gave his first name. China has been accused by Brussels of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus pandemic, writes Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. The European commission said Russia and China were running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d. While the charge against Russia has been levelled on many occasions, this is the first time the EU executive has publicly named China as a source of disinformation. French politicians were furious when a Chinese embassy website claimed in mid-April, at the height of Europe\u2019s pandemic, that care workers had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The unnamed Chinese diplomat also claimed falsely that 80 French lawmakers had used a racist slur against the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1, a European commission vice-president, told reporters: I believe if we have evidence we should not shy away from naming and shaming. What we also witnessed is a surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis, for example the claim there are secret US biological laboratories on former Soviet republics has been spread by both pro-Kremlin outlets, as well as Chinese officials and state media. Amid the continuing controversy in the scientific community, Greece has resumed production of chloroquine to treat people with coronavirus, AFP reports. Last week a major UK trial run by Oxford University halted its tests of the drugs, saying there was no evidence they worked against the virus, but scientists in Greece said they are continuing trials with a \u201ccalm and distant approach.\u201d Greek epidemiologists consider chloroquine effective, especially in the early stages of Covid-19. As the scale of the pandemic became apparent earlier this year, the company Uni-Pharma moved quickly to renew an old manufacturing licence for the drug, which was exported to Africa in the 1990s for the treatment of malaria. The licence was reactivated in March, just days before Greece closed its borders to contain the spread of the virus, Spyros Kintzios, Uni-Pharma\u2019s development director, told AFP. Five tonnes of raw material were imported from India and the laboratory went into \u201chigh-alert\u201d, said Evangelia Sakellariou, a chemist responsible for quality control in a laboratory in the Athens suburb of Nea Kifissia, was one of the first scientists to have tested the chloroquine tablets used in Greek hospitals. \u201cOn the weekend of 21 March we were working constantly, we were under pressure and in 30 hours we produced 24 million doses, which were then offered to the Greek national health system,\u201d she said of the pills, made under the brand name Unikinon. \u201cWhen I saw the first tablets, I felt relieved and happy to have made this effort for a good cause,\u201d Sakellariou added. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Africa has passed 200,000, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s office for the region. According to the latest update by the UN health agency, 201,157 people have tested positive for the virus across the 54 countries in Africa, of whom 90,374 have recovered and 5,486 have died, the UN health agency said. Hello everybody, this is Damien Gayle in the hot seat now for the next eight hours or so, bringing you the latest in coronavirus-related headlines and updates from around the world. As ever, I\u2019m keen to hear from readers. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage please drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter DM to @damiengayle. Denmark, the first country outside Asia to ease its coronavirus lockdown, said on Wednesday the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it entered its second phase of reopening society last month, reports Reuters. The Nordic country allowed restaurants, cafes and malls to resume business during May in the second phase of easing lockdown restrictions. In April it had allowed day care centres, schools, hair dressers and some small businesses to reopen. \u201cThe level of contagion in society is still very low,\u201d the Danish health authority said in a report on Wednesday, adding that the number of confirmed new infections had continued to fall despite more tests being carried out. The number of coronavirus-related deaths has hovered between zero and four per day in the last three weeks, after a peak of 22 deaths on 31 March. The number of hospitalisations has fallen to fewer than 100 since the beginning of June. \u201cThere is no sign yet of noticeable changes in the extent of contagion despite the gradual opening of society in April and early May,\u201d the report said. On Monday, the Danish government raised the maximum limit on public gatherings to 50 from 10 and allowed fitness centres and public swimming pools to reopen. It plans a further easing of restrictions on public gatherings in July and August. France is expected to end the official \u201cstate of health emergency\u201d introduced for the coronavirus crisis on 10 July. This \u201cexceptional\u201d crisis measure gave the government temporary constitutional powers to introduce restrictions during the pandemic. Now the government is planning legislation allowing it to lift the state of emergency while keeping certain measures to avoid a second wave of Covid-19. The number of patients in intensive care units in hospitals with the virus has dropped to below 1,000, from a spike of more than 7,000 in April, and the number of deaths each day is falling. A total of 29,296 people have died in France as a result of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures. \u201cGiven the positive developments in the health situation, at this stage, the government wishes to end the state of health emergency, which should remain an exceptional mechanism. However, this ending must be rigorously and progressively organised in order to continue to protect the French against a virus that is still circulating in France and could justify the continuation and, if necessary, even strengthening of measures currently in place in the weeks and months to come,\u201d a statement from Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe\u2019s office said. The new legislation would allow the government to control public movements as well as access to public transport, to order the closure of public establishments and to reinforce rules about wearing masks in public places. These measures would last until November, but could be changed according to circumstances. The law would not give the French authorities the power to reimpose a lockdown; if the virus suddenly returns, the government will have to seek a decree authorising new restrictions over the whole or part of France, Matignon, the French equivalent of Number 10, said. France\u2019s external borders are currently closed to all but essential workers and those with a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to enter the country. The country ended its strict two-month lockdown on 11 May. Most of France has been progressively allowed to return almost to normal, but restrictions still cover the Paris region. The bill is expected to be presented to MPs in the lower house, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale today for debate on 17 June. Experts suspect \u2013 though there is still no proof \u2013 that antibodies will confer immunity. The implications could be wide-ranging. Miranda Bryant reports: Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases for a second successive day, with 1,241 new infections, taking its total to 34,316. There were 36 new Covid-19 related deaths, taking the number of fatalities to 1,959, according to health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. There are 12,129 patients who have recovered, he said. Data from Indonesia\u2019s Covid-19 taskforce shows at least 287,470 people have been tested. A team of Polish scientists has designed a remote-controlled ventilator they hope will allow doctors to help critically ill patients breathe, but from a distance, in a bid to make medical personnel safer during the coronavirus pandemic. If the experimental RespiSave ventilator can be shown to work safely on humans, doctors can observe patients\u2019 vitals through an application, monitoring their condition and adjusting the machine\u2019s settings from anywhere in the hospital, the designers of the project told Reuters. Doctors would be notified if the ventilator gets disconnected or the patient\u2019s condition changes drastically. Respiratory failure requiring support with a mechanical ventilator is common in patients with severe Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The remote-control feature means the medical personnel can be in less frequent contact with these patients, said Lukasz Szarpak, a medical adviser on the project. Health care workers caring for critically ill patients are at particular risk of coronavirus infection, in some cases due to a lack of adequate personal protective equipment. The designers, who are among the first to come up with such a device, said they expect use of medical telemetry to expand, especially after the medical crisis associated with the coronavirus. Leszek Kowalik, the director of the project, said RespiSave will be much less expensive than a typical ventilator, although he did not specify the price of the device. While the technology is still being tested, Szarpak and Kowalik said they hoped it would be available in Poland within the next few months and eventually on a wider global market. Taiwan\u2019s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has announced that no new cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Taiwan today, the 59th consecutive day without a local infection. According to the CECC a total of 73,751 cases have been reported in the country, of which Covid-19 has been ruled out in 72,824 and confirmed after testing in 443 cases. Of the confirmed cases, there have been seven deaths, and 431 patients have been released from isolation, with the remaining five still in hospital. Dozens of scientific papers co-authored by the chief executive of the US tech company behind the Lancet hydroxychloroquine study scandal are now being audited, including one that a scientific integrity expert claims contains images that appear to have been digitally manipulated. The audit follows a Guardian investigation that found the company, Surgisphere, used suspect data in major scientific studies that were published and then retracted by world-leading medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. More here: Russia has reported 8,404 new cases of the coronavirus today, taking the nationwide tally of infections to 493,657. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said 216 people had died from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall death toll to 6,358. Ruchi Kumar reports on the women in Afghanistan whose food carts were forced out of business by Covid-19, so converted them into mobile disinfection units: Bulgaria will extend the epidemic emergency until the end of June to fight the spread of the coronavirus after an increase in new registered cases, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has said. The Balkan country has eased most of the restrictive measures it imposed in the middle of March, allowing restaurants and shopping malls to reopen. Borissov said the government did not plan to introduce new restrictions for the time being but appealed to people to keep social distancing. Bulgaria has so far recorded 2,889 coronavirus cases, of whom 167 have died. Over the past 24 hours it recorded 79 new cases. Meanwhile Hungary and Croatia will lift restrictions on cross-border travel from Friday as the pandemic has subsided and remains under control in both countries, Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said. Japan\u2019s lower house of parliament has approved an emergency budget worth nearly over \u00a3230bn, doubling the scale of measures to pep up the world\u2019s third-biggest economy after the coronavirus tipped it into recession, AFP reports. Consumer spending has slowed to a crawl despite Japan\u2019s relatively low infection numbers and death toll from the pandemic, prompting the first economic downturn since 2015. In response, lawmakers approved a second exceptional budget of 31.91tn yen (\u00a3233bn/$297bn), including subsidies for smaller businesses and cash handouts for medical workers. The budget bill will be sent to the upper house and is widely expected to be enacted as early as Friday. The cash \u2013 to be raised by issuing bonds \u2013 will also be used to help finance rescue programmes and loans for struggling businesses. The government said the size of the package, including loans and investments in addition to actual fiscal spending, is worth about 117tn yen, nearly the same size as the first extra budget enacted on 30 April. Combined with that initial stimulus package, Japan\u2019s total measures amount to 230tn yen when loan schemes are taken into account. That is 40% of GDP \u2013 trumpeted by prime minister Shinzo Abe as the world\u2019s biggest virus programme \u2013 and pushes Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio up to 257%, noted Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi TRUST. \u201cIt will be worth it to drive the recovery,\u201d said Oshikubo. \u201cThe two supplementary budgets alone should push up real 2020 GDP by three points. In addition, the state of emergency has now ended across Japan and the economy is set to improve.\u201d Rescue measures include subsidies to help small companies pay rent, subsidies for companies paying leave allowances to their employees, grants to medical workers and grants to help drug and vaccine development. Japan had recorded 17,251 coronavirus infections and 919 deaths as of Tuesday, a fraction of the toll seen in global hotspots. But a spike in infections prompted Abe to declare a nationwide state of emergency, handing regional governors the power to ask people to stay indoors and call for businesses to close. He lifted the emergency declaration last month but said it would take \u201cquite a long time\u201d for the country to fully return to normal. Their raucous clucking deprives residents of sleep. They leave the neighbourhood \u201cwrecked\u201d. And food left out for them attracts \u201crats the size of cats\u201d to an otherwise peaceful, leafy suburb. New Zealand\u2019s national lockdown to quell the spread of Covid-19 appears to have vanquished the virus, but it has had one unintended consequence: the re-emergence of a plague \u2013 not of frogs or locusts but of feral chickens, a flock of which is once again menacing an area of west Auckland. Residents of Titirangi, a suburb of fewer than 4,000 people and about 20-30 feral chickens, emerged from New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus lockdown to find a nightmare they thought had ended was not over. The feral chickens, which council contractors had been working to gently capture and rehome since their numbers peaked in 2019, had multiplied during the shutdown. More here: Plans by Nigeria\u2019s government to cut healthcare spending risk undermining the country\u2019s coronavirus response and severely impacting already strained services, health and transparency groups have warned. Funding for local, primary healthcare services will be cut by more than 40% this year in a revised budget expected to be passed into law in the coming weeks. The proposed cuts could affect immunisations, childcare, maternal healthcare and family planning services. Nigeria currently spends less than 5% of its federal budget on health. Dwindling oil sales, the crash in global oil prices and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic are understood to be the reason for the cuts. More here: Asylum applications in Europe fell to the lowest level for over a decade in April as borders closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, European Union figures show, compounding the challenges of people fleeing conflict and persecution, Reuters reports. The number of asylum applications declined to 8,730 during April, an 86% drop from 61,421 in February, according to figures obtained by Reuters from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The EU had shut its external borders in March and many of its 27 member states suspended registration of applications. The EASO figures also show a 44% drop in asylum applications from February to March, when states began imposing lockdowns. \u201cIt is clear the access that potential asylum applicants had was severely restricted over the past few months, especially initially,\u201d EASO executive director Nina Gregori told Reuters. \u201cThe situation for those in need of asylum has undoubtedly been very challenging. Already fleeing violence and persecution, the Covid-19 crisis has certainly compounded their situations.\u201d Most applications during 2020 through April were by Syrians followed by Afghans, Venezuelans and Colombians, EASO data show. It had already become more difficult for asylum seekers to reach Europe in recent years. The bloc has blocked off previous overland migrant routes and provided aid to Libya and Turkey to inhibit crossings by sea into the EU. In April, Italy said it would not let migrant boats operated by charities dock as its ports could not be considered safe because of the coronavirus pandemic. Malta also said it could no longer guarantee the rescue of migrants or allow their disembarkation during the coronavirus emergency. Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone. This is Simon Burnton taking on the live blog for the next few hours. If you have seen any stories that deserve our attention, or if you have any tips, comments or suggestions for our coverage then please let me know by sending me a message either to @Simon_Burnton on Twitter or via email. Thanks! Thanks for following along \u2013 that\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My esteemed colleague Simon Burnton will be taking over from here. In the meantime, the most important recent developments in the coronavirus pandemic are wrapped up in our global report below: This morning\u2019s papers are leading with a mix of coronavirus and statue-toppling news: Coronavirus cases in Mumbai, India have passed 51,000, according to the Indian Express. The last 24 hours alone saw close to 10,000 new confirmed infections, with 9,985. The BBC points out that the city has more cases than Wuhan, China \u2013 where the virus first emerged \u2013 had at its peak. India, which has the fifth-highest number of cases, has 276,146 confirmed infections in total. It has reported 7,750 deaths, which is likely to be an underestimate. Personal after-hours shopping trips, online beauty appointments and entertainment for those queuing outside will form part of Selfridges\u2019 coronavirus-era shopping offer when the retailer reopens on 15 June. The luxury department store group, which operates four shops in the UK, including its London flagship on Oxford Street, will not be able to reopen services such as beauty makeovers, hairdressing or its cafes and cinema because of Covid-19 restrictions. It is hoping a mix of virtual experiences and live entertainments \u2013 such as DJs \u2013 will help shoppers feel no less pampered. Property sales in most of England have swiftly rebounded to the same levels they were just before the lockdown, although London lags behind the rest of the country and markets in Scotland and Wales remain closed, according to website Zoopla. Pent-up demand has also meant firmer prices, said Zoopla, with the average asking price of sales agreed in the last week 6% higher than the same week in June last year. Its figures are in sharp contrast with those from Nationwide, which last week said house prices across the UK were falling at the fastest rate since the financial crisis. \u201cLower asking prices for homes sold over the lockdown period may drag down indices over May, but this new data suggests house price growth is set to remain positive in the next two months,\u201d said Zoopla research director, Richard Donnell. However, London\u2019s market has failed to rebound, with buyers seeking properties outside the capital, as work-from-home policies may leave many more employees no longer needing to commute into the city. Here are the key developments in the coronavirus pandemic from the last few hours: Argentina confirmed more than 1,000 new cases in one day for first time. Argentina confirmed more than 1,000 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday as the rate of new infections continued to rise just days after it extended lockdown measures in the capital Buenos Aires, the country\u2019s largest city and epicentre for the virus, Reuters reports. Argentina\u2019s Health Ministry logged 1,141 new cases in the past 24 hours, as well 24 deaths, pushing its totals to 24,761 cases and 717 deaths since the outbreak began in early March. 21 US states reported weekly case increases. On Tuesday, 21 US states reported weekly increases in new cases of Covid-19. Arizona, Utah and New Mexico all posted rises of 40% or higher for the week ended Sunday, compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis. Brazil restored on Tuesday detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website, following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated. WHO called for new lockdowns in Pakistan. The World Health Organization has told Pakistan it should implement \u201cintermittent\u201d lockdowns to counter a surge in coronavirus infections that has come as the country loosens restrictions, an official said Tuesday. South Korea cases spiked again. South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases spiked to 50 new cases on Wednesday, after two consecutive days of fewer than 40 cases. \u201cAll but three of the locally transmitted cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area,\u201d the Yonhap News Agency reported. A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased. The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment. The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned. Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June. Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions. There have been sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day. The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach. Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday. Economic shocks caused by the new coronavirus are set to fuel poverty, unrest and instability in heavily-indebted and politically fragile countries for years to come, found an international think-tank on Wednesday. The pandemic\u2019s impacts will undo years of socio-economic development for some countries, the Institute for Economics and Peace said in a briefing released alongside its annual index measuring peace levels around the world. \u201cThe worst is still to come,\u201d said Steve Killelea, head of the Australia-based IEP, which expects to see most of the peace indicators it measures fall for several years. \u201cThe countries which are going to suffer the most are those which are currently fragile because they are the ones which generally have higher levels of food insecurity, the governments are politically less stable and economies are less robust.\u201d Lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus have hit economies, with the International Labour Organization estimating some 200 million would lose their jobs and the World Bank predicting the global economy will shrink by 5% in 2020. Analysts predict it will take five years for world economies to recover back to their 2019 levels, said Killelea. In calming, non-coronavirus news: researchers have pioneered a new way of calculating the large green sea turtle population on Raine Island in the Great Barrier Reef. Using drones and a stripe of white paint on the back of adult turtles, the researchers from the Raine Island Recovery Project estimated there were 64,000 endangered green turtles at the Raine Island rookery. The new count shows there may be 1.73 times the number of turtles previously believed and they have now been able to adjust historical data to paint a more accurate picture of the area\u2019s endangered green turtle population: The founder US fitness brand CrossFit will step down from his position as CEO of the company following a disastrous few days that have seen the fitness program lose key partnerships, endorsements and the business of hundreds of affiliated gyms around the world. The move comes after a pair of offensive tweets by Greg Glassman. On Saturday, in response to a tweet from the research centre Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which stated \u201cRacism is a public health issue\u201d, Glassman tweeted \u201cIt\u2019s FLOYD-19\u201d, in reference to the police killing of George Floyd, whose death has sparked a global protest movement. He went on to say \u201cYour failed model quarantined us and now you\u2019re going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd\u2019s brutal murder sparked riots nationally. Quarantine alone is \u2018accompanied in every age and under all political regimes by an undercurrent of suspicion, distrust, and riots.\u2019 Thanks!\u2019\u201d On Tuesday, 21 US states reported weekly increases in new cases of Covid-19. Arizona, Utah and New Mexico all posted rises of 40% or higher for the week ended Sunday, compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis. Some of the new cases are linked to better testing. But many stem from loosened public health restrictions that have allowed people to gather in groups and go inside stores to shop, said public health officers in two California counties. Health officials believe other cases have been passed along by people not following social-distancing recommendations. It is too soon to see whether cases will also spike after protests swept the country over the 25 May death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, an African-American man, officials said. The number of new infections in the first week of June rose 3% in the United States, the first increase after five weeks of declines, according to an analysis of data from the Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. As always, it would be great to hear from you. Get in touch with questions, comments, tips and news from your part of the world on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Coronavirus cases and hospitalisations are spiking in parts of California and the US Southwest, prompting Arizona to reactivate its emergency plan for medical facilities and California to place counties where half its population lives on a watch list, Reuters reports. The uptick in cases, which could lead authorities to reimpose or tighten public health restrictions aimed at slowing the virus\u2019 spread, complicates efforts to reopen the US economy, which has been devastated by shelter-at-home rules. New Jersey, one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic, with over 12,000 deaths, lifted its stay-at-home order on Tuesday. More than 18 million of California\u2019s 39 million residents live in counties now on the watch list, which includes Los Angeles, Santa Clara and Fresno, a Reuters analysis showed. \u201cMany of the cases that are showing up in hospitals are linked to gatherings that are taking place in homes - birthday parties and funerals,\u201d said Olivia Kasirye, public health director of Sacramento County, one of the nine counties on the state watch list that may eventually require them to roll back reopening efforts. Arizona was among the first states to reopen in mid-May and its cases have increased 115% since then, leading a former state health chief to warn that a new stay-at-home order or field hospitals may be needed. Fujifilm Holdings Corp will spend $928 million to double capacity at a drug manufacturing facility in Denmark, which it has pledged to use in producing Covid-19 treatments, as the Japanese company steps up its pivot towards healthcare, Reuters reports. The investment in Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies will expand production lines for bulk drug substances and cultivate cells for producing viral vaccines, Fujifilm announced on Tuesday. It bought the facility in Hillerod, Denmark, in August from Biogen Inc for about $890 million. Fujifilm previously announced that the Denmark site would offer future manufacturing capacity to the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to speed-up the response to the global pandemic. It is an initiative launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and two other large charities, aimed at accelerating drug development and identifying a promising Covid-19 therapeutic candidate based on efficacy and safety data demonstrated in clinical trials. Fujifilm\u2019s pharma arm is testing its own anti-flu drug Avigan as a treatment for Covid-19. Podcast: The Rees-Mogg conga and how the pandemic has changed the UK parliament The US\u2019s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, calling Covid-19 his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d. \u201cIn a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world,\u201d Fauci said, speaking to executives at a conference of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d About 7 million people have been infected with the coronavirus and 400,000 people are known to have died. Many countries, including the US where more than 110,000 have died, are now relaxing quarantine rules despite rising rates of infection in some areas. \u201cThat\u2019s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn\u2019t over yet. And it\u2019s condensed in a very, very small time frame,\u201d said Fauci. In a videotaped discussion Fauci said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but he was surprised by how \u201crapidly it just took over the planet\u201d. Fauci attributed the rapid spread to the contagiousness of the virus and extensive world travel by infected people. The top White House infectious disease adviser said the coronavirus pandemic differed significantly from other recent public health crises including Ebola and HIV. Argentina confirmed more than 1,000 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday as the rate of new infections continued to rise just days after it extended lockdown measures in the capital Buenos Aires, the country\u2019s largest city and epicentre for the virus, Reuters reports. Argentina\u2019s Health Ministry logged 1,141 new cases in the past 24 hours, as well 24 deaths, pushing its totals to 24,761 cases and 717 deaths since the outbreak began in early March. Latin America has become the new front in the global coronavirus outbreak. Argentina\u2019s rising rate of infections, though, still remains markedly lower than neighbours Chile, which reported 3,913 cases on Tuesday, and Brazil, with 32,091 new cases. Argentina last week extended a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires, which accounts for the country\u2019s highest concentration of confirmed infections. Other areas have moved to \u201cmandatory and preventive social distancing.\u201d Much of the nation had been under a shelter-in-place order since 20 March. The country has a commercial flight ban until 1 September, one of the world\u2019s strictest travel measures during the pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated already worrisome trends when it comes to doing business in China amid slowing revenue growth, regulatory obstacles and the clout of the state-owned sector, a European business group said on Wednesday. Only half of European companies surveyed said that their mainland China revenues last year increased by 5% or more, the lowest proportion in a decade, according to a survey of members of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China conducted in February that involved 626 respondents in all, Reuters reports. A slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy was seen as the biggest business challenge by respondents. After widespread lockdowns to control the epidemic, China\u2019s economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter, and the government dropped a growth target for the full year. \u201cThe full extent of the negative impact from Covid-19 on revenue growth remains unclear, but the trend is undeniably bleak,\u201d said the report. The Yonhap News Agency reports that South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases spiked to 50 new cases on Wednesday, after two consecutive days of fewer than 40 cases: South Korea\u2019s new virus cases spiked again Wednesday as sporadic cluster infections continued in the greater Seoul area, prodding health authorities to consider more stringent social distancing in the densely populated area. The country added 50 new cases, including 43 local infections, raising the total caseload to 11,902, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). It marked a rebound after the country\u2019s new COVID-19 cases hovered below 40 for the second straight day. All but three of the locally transmitted cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area. More than 1,000 doves have died of starvation at Afghanistan\u2019s famed blue-tiled mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif after it closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, caretakers said Tuesday. Before the mosque complex shut amid a nationwide lockdown, flocks of the snow-white birds would gather at the popular tourist attraction, where visitors would feed them, AFP reports. But without any visitors to the 12th century wonder in Balkh province in northern Afghanistan, the doves have had little to eat, caretakers said. \u201cEvery day, about 30 doves die. We bury them outside the shrine,\u201d said Qayum Ansari, head of cultural affairs at the mosque, adding that more than 1,000 birds have starved to death in recent weeks. The doves have been a fixture for decades, with some visitors even considering them sacred. Local officials said authorities were ready to feed the birds if mosque managers allow it. Afghanistan\u2019s coronavirus crisis is worsening by the day, with authorities reporting 21,459 confirmed cases so far, though the real number is thought to be much higher. Experts say the country has one of the highest rates of tests coming back positive - about 40%, indicating high levels of undetected infections. Officials have warned the country faces a \u201cdisaster,\u201d with hospitals running short of beds as suspected cases surge. Boeing Co deliveries slowed even further in May from April as the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s crushing impact on airlines added to a year of crisis following the grounding of its 737 MAX planes, company data showed on Tuesday. The US planemaker said it handed over just four planes in May, down from the six it delivered in April, its lowest total for the month in six decades and about 87% fewer than it delivered to customers at the same time a year ago, Reuters reports. Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because airlines pay most of the purchase price when they actually receive the plane. Customers also canceled orders for another 18 planes last month, including 14 MAX jets that were the company\u2019s top-selling plane until a pair of crashes just over a year ago. While Boeing resumed production last week and expects to make deliveries of the MAX in the third quarter, many aircraft leasing companies and airlines, including Southwest Airlines , United Airlines, and Brazil\u2019s GOL have canceled or deferred delivery as the industry faces a collapse in air travel since January. World Tennis No 1 Novak Djokovic is thinking of skipping the US Open \u2013 if it is played \u2013 and instead returning to competition on clay ahead of the rescheduled French Open, Reuters reports. Speaking to Serbia\u2019s state broadcaster RTS on Tuesday, Djokovic said the restrictions that would be in place for the Grand Slam tournament in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic would be \u201cextreme\u201d and not \u201csustainable.\u201d Like many sports, tennis went on hiatus in March because of the Covid-19 outbreak. All sanctioned tournaments have been scrapped until at least late July. That includes the French Open, which was supposed to end last weekend but was postponed until September, and Wimbledon, which was canceled for the first time since 1945. The US Tennis Association is expected to make a decision as soon as next week about whether to hold the US Open. Main-draw play is scheduled to begin on 31 August. Women in Fiji struggling to cope with periods in the pandemic Talei Tora reports for the Guardian: The first time AnneMary Raduva, 16, and her sister Faith, 13, went shopping for sanitary pads after the coronavirus outbreak hit their home of Fiji, they noticed two things: there were barely any to choose from, and those that were available cost more than before the pandemic. The Pacific region, which is home to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities, has escaped the worst health impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak, but is feeling the full brunt of its economic effect. As imports have become limited and incomes have dropped, women in Fiji have reported that prices of sanitary goods have increased by between FJ$0.50 and FJ$3 per packet in a country where the minimum wage is $2.32 an hour. \u201cPads are sold from FJ$3 to $7 or more,\u201d said AnneMary. \u201cFor a family that is struggling financially, those extra dollars can be stretched to buy an extra loaf of bread, canned tuna, and a slice of butter. This is the reality and we have done our own informal survey and have spoken to a lot of people and the responses are very similar: food over sanitary pads.\u201d Brazil on Tuesday restored detailed COVID-19 data to its official national website following controversy over the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated, Reuters reports. The move came after days of mounting pressure from across the political spectrum and allegations the government was trying to mask the severity of the outbreak, now the world\u2019s second-largest. The official website reverted to showing cumulative totals of deaths and infections - as well as breakdowns by state, as it had done until last week. On Tuesday evening the latest daily numbers were uploaded to the site. They showed 32,091 new infections of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours for a cumulative total of 739,503 cases, and 1,272 new deaths, bringing the toll to 38,406 dead, the third highest after the United States and Britain. Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently sought to play down the severity of the coronavirus, dismissing it as a \u201clittle flu\u201d and urging governors to reverse lockdown measures battering the country\u2019s economy. Health experts had feared that by not publishing accumulated totals and releasing only deaths that occurred in the past 24 hours, cases in which someone tested positive for the coronavirus days after their death could disappear from public view. Here is our full story on the court decision: The World Health Organization has told Pakistan it should implement \u201cintermittent\u201d lockdowns to counter a surge in coronavirus infections that has come as the country loosens restrictions, an official said Tuesday. Since the start of Pakistan\u2019s outbreak in March, Prime Minister Imran Khan opposed a nationwide lockdown of the sort seen elsewhere, arguing the impoverished country could not afford it, AFP reports. Instead, Pakistan\u2019s four provinces ordered a patchwork of closures, but last week Khan said most of these restrictions would be lifted. That decision came as Pakistan\u2019s infection rate is worsening, as it is across all of South Asia, which until recently had lagged Western nations in virus tolls. Health officials said Tuesday they had recorded a total of 108,317 cases and 2,172 deaths \u2013 though with testing still limited, real rates are thought to be much higher. \u201cAs of today, Pakistan does not meet any of the pre-requisite conditions for opening the lockdown\u201d, the WHO said in a letter to Punjab\u2019s provincial health minister Yasmin Rashid. The health body recommended an intermittent lockdown cycle of two weeks on, two weeks off. Some 25% of tests in Pakistan come back positive for Covid-19, the WHO said, indicating high levels of infection in the general population. Hospitals across the country say they are at or near capacity, and some are turning Covid-19 patients away. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, it would be great to hear from you. Get in touch with questions, comments, tips and news from your part of the world on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The World Health Organization has told Pakistan it should implement \u201cintermittent\u201d lockdowns to counter a surge in coronavirus infections that has come as the country loosens restrictions. One in four tests conducted in the country come back positive, the WHO said, which indicates a high level of infection. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Brazil restored on Tuesday detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website, following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated. The detailed information, with cumulative totals and breakdowns by state, was restored to the website https://covid.saude.gov.br/, Reuters confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms. A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased. The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment. The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned. Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June. Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday. There have been sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day. The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach. A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics. His government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of data on to pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the death toll or number of infections. Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19. Face masks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June. \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d said the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Italy to help doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak returned home to a heroes\u2019 welcome. The medical brigade, comprising 36 doctors, 15 nurses and a logistics specialist, arrived in Milan on 22 March and were the first ever to be deployed to a European country. Up to 600 deaths in Kano, northern Nigeria, most within a single week in April, were caused by an undetected outbreak of Covid-19, officials said. Government investigations, which began after reports of hundreds of deaths caused alarm in Nigeria\u2019s second largest city, linked 50-60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths to the virus. Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data.",
