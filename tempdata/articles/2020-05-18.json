      "bodyText": "September 11, 2001 might be branded as the darkest day in our collective memory, but for Ray Cervai, it was the events of three days later that stood out for him personally. That was the day Ansett Australia grounded all flights, leaving the Melbourne businessman, who officially supplied the airline with merchandise, with more than half a million dollars of Ansett-themed products stored in his shed. \u201cIt felt like someone had shot me in the stomach,\u201d says the semi-retired Cervai. Almost 20 years on, another airline \u2013 Virgin Australia \u2013 entered voluntary administration. The collapse, like Ansett\u2019s, was precipitated by a massive global disruption, this time coronavirus. As the government fended off appeals for a bailout, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, pointed to Virgin Australia\u2019s 90% foreign ownership to declare: \u201cThis is not Ansett. This is not the end of the airline.\u201d As potential buyers mount bids to save Virgin Australia from collapse, the legacy of Ansett has evolved from an aviation powerhouse into a small but thriving community. While the airline may have stopped flying, the Ansett name and logo live on as a basketball club, a museum in regional Victoria, and a now-booming online retail business for Cervai. \u201cWe already had the news of 9/11 come in one morning that week, and then two days later, at four o\u2019clock in the morning, I woke up and heard someone in my house crying,\u201d Cervai says, referring to the news of Ansett\u2019s collapse after administrators determined it could not be rescued.

He says the week of Ansett\u2019s collapse was one of the worst weeks of his life. \u201cI was always more worried my Ansett business would go down rather than the airline itself.\u201d Unsure of what to do with the hoard of Ansett clothing, gifts, toys and other items he had, with no orders to fill, Cervai received a call a day after Ansett\u2019s collapse from someone offering to buy him out for 20 cents per T-shirt and 30 cents per jumper. \u201cI said, are you serious mate? Pardon my French but you can go and get fucked,\u201d he says. Instead, the semi-retired Cervai decided to start up a website to sell the items. While its sales were quiet in its early years, he says Ansett merchandise is now more popular than ever. \u201cNow it\u2019s selling like hotcakes, it\u2019s hard to believe,\u201d says the 73-year-old, who reports a recent sales spike over the past two years has peaked during the coronavirus lockdowns. He also attributes a part of the surge in sales to the indie pop band Client Liaison, which he supplied with Ansett props for a 2017 music video.

During lockdown reports of family violence to police dropped, and reports of concern to Oranga Tamariki, the country\u2019s welfare agency for children, fell by around 40%. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of child abuse and neglect in the OECD, and on average one infant is murdered every five weeks. Oranga Tamariki\u2019s chief executive, Gr\u00e1inne Moss, told the Guardian that reports of harm always drop over the school holidays, because the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d that usually identify harm \u2013 education, social and health workers \u2013 aren\u2019t around. But the prolonged nature of lockdown and the added stress of job losses among already strained families was creating \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, Moss said, and rises in family violence overseas are likely to hold true in New Zealand too, though no local research has been conducted yet. \u201cLockdown is a lot longer than the school holidays so we are right to be concerned that there is hidden, invisible harm occurring to children,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI have a serious level of worry about kids that we don\u2019t know about and kids that have never been reported to us and were locked down in situations where there is family violence, troubling dynamics in the house, maybe drugs and alcohol, or mental health problems.\u201d Moss said although Oranga Tamariki was \u201calways busy\u201d (last year there were 15,000 substantiated reports of abuse or neglect against children) she is aware that many children will be returning to school in a worse state than when they left, and teachers, school counsellors and health care workers will be conducting individual \u201cwelfare checks\u201d on children. \u201cSadly, in New Zealand every year is quite busy in terms of child abuse and neglect, [but this year] it\u2019s going to be particularly tough,\u201d Moss said. Moss said many of the tools social workers used to stay in touch with vulnerable children during lockdown \u2013 video and phone apps, craft projects and meal preparation kits delivered to homes as a family bonding activity \u2013 will continue after the Covid-19 crisis because they have proved so effective. She praised police and the large supermarket chains for assisting with welfare monitoring activities, including police providing \u201cspot welfare checks and holistic care\u201d at roadblocks around the country. Children\u2019s Commissioner Judge Andrew Becroft said lockdown also offered him the chance to interact with his clients \u2013 those in state care facilities and juvenile detention \u2013 via video chat, a method he intends to continue because he found it suited the children better. They seemed less intimidated and it offered a more immediate, frequent way to communicate with him, and their families. Becroft praised Oranga Tamariki\u2019s work during lockdown, and said the burden of the Covid-19 crisis has not fallen evenly but \u201chas disproportionately impacted those who were doing it tough beforehand\u201d. \u201cBubbles aren\u2019t transparent, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on inside families,\u201d Becroft said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a strong association between poverty and family violence and child abuse and neglect. It is therefore likely, knowing what we do in some of the overseas trends, that as stress from lockdown increased, it\u2019s likely that abuse and neglect will also commensurately increase.\u201d \u201cWe need to be concerned that abuse and neglect have gone up \u2013 even though I desperately hope that is not the case.\u201d During lockdown around 80 children were taken in care by Oranga Tamariki workers. Moss said her team planned carefully for any removals during the pandemic but: \u201cAt the end of the day we will break a bubble to save a child\u2019s life\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The closure of BuzzFeed News in Australia may have grabbed the headlines last week but the digital startup is just one victim on a growing list of media casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five editorial staff at BuzzFeed have lost their jobs, and on Monday a further 30 editorial job losses were announced due to the closure of the online news site 10 Daily. Across the country hundreds more have been stood down in an already fractured media landscape. It\u2019s unclear how many will ever return to their posts. \u2018Gut-wrenching\u2019 closures In the far north of the country the family-owned Cape and Torres News stopped the presses after 60 years in March when distribution became impossible and advertising dried up. In regional Victoria, locally owned mastheads entering their second century were forced to close as the coronavirus started to devour advertising revenue. Sunraysia Daily was supposed to be celebrating its centenary, but owners Elliott Newspaper Group made the \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d decision to suspend all newspaper publishing operations in Mildura, Swan Hill and Kerang, albeit promising they would come back when the economy recovered. The Public Interest Journalism Initiative is documenting the changes to newsrooms across Australia using a a visualisation tool. The Australian Newsroom Mapping Project aims to track the health of Australia\u2019s news industry and has already counted 157 newsrooms that have closed temporarily or for good since January 2019. \u201cThe crisis is unprecedented and for Australia it\u2019s a triple whammy of ongoing long-term affects of digital platforms, the coronavirus effect, which unfortunately may generate some irreversible changes, and the bushfires had some effect,\u201d Public Interest Journalism Initiative chairman Allan Fels told Guardian Australia. \u201cPublic interest journalism is an important part of our community and our political system. It keeps the public informed; it helps the community keep an eye on what governments, courts and others are doing; it\u2019s an antidote to corruption, malpractice and incompetence in management of the public sector and whistleblowing in the private sector.\u201d Advertising hits Some of the carnage predates the coronavirus, namely the bombshell announcement in early March that news agency Australian Associated Press and its 200 journalists and 100 photojournalists, who provide a daily staple of news, was to be shut down by major shareholders Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia. The staff have been suffering months of uncertainty after the company embarked on 11th hour talks with unexpected offers, and the fate of the 85-year-old agency due to shut next month is still unknown. The effects of an advertising industry badly hit by the coronavirus have not spared the biggest media companies. The country\u2019s two regional and community newspaper giants, Australian Community Media and News Corp Australia, have suspended printing dozens of non-daily publications and laid off or stood down hundreds of staff. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire chose to suspend printing 60 of its local newspapers including the Wentworth Courier and the Mosman and the Manly dailies in New South Wales and the Preston Leader and the Stonnington Leader in Melbourne. News Corp did not rule out redundancies at the suspended titles across NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. A report in The Australian on Monday said \u201cmany suspended community titles are likely to continue as digital-only\u201d and revealed that the company is realigning itself as a \u201cdigital publisher of high-quality journalism\u201d, suggesting the printed product at News Corp is winding down. At Murdoch\u2019s metropolitan mastheads \u2013 which include the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun \u2013 there has been forced leave, part-time work and nine-day fortnights. Michael Miller, the company\u2019s executive chairman, told staff \u201cfalling business confidence is impacting the advertising revenues of all media businesses\u201d. Layoffs come as audiences surge In magazines the picture is similarly bleak. Bauer Media has thrown 200 staff into unemployment and paused seven fashion, lifestyle and celebrity magazines, a move which has been described as having ripped the heart out of the industry. On Monday the company told staff the intention is to bring them all back in September. Some of the losses are not public yet. Guardian Australia can reveal Nine is undergoing a fresh round of redundancies at the Sydney Morning Herald, mainly on sections which stopped printing due to the coronavirus. The company declined to comment but sources say there are eight jobs losses, four directly attributable to the coronavirus. The ABC, bracing for budget cuts to be announced after June, has quietly laid off a huge chunk of its casual workforce with one week\u2019s notice, Guardian Australia understands. The casuals work across news and current affairs in TV news and radio programs and some have been working five days a week on six-month contracts. \u201cDue to the impact of COVID-19 on production, some of our usual casual shifts are not currently required,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cHowever, because of the circumstances the ABC continued to make payments to our impacted regular casual employees for a month. Further, the ABC is currently undertaking a review of all our casual employees to see if any are entitled to permanent employment based on the nature of their work with us.\u201d The regional papers that have survived the recent massacre and are still printing have nonetheless suffered serious declines in readership in the past year. Readership of News Corp\u2019s NT News is down 38.5% in the past 12 months to March 2020. Readership of Australian Community Media\u2019s Newcastle Herald and Launceston Examiner are both down more than 14%. The only stable publication in the category over the past year has been the Canberra Times, according to Roy Morgan readership data released this week. All of this media pain has come at a time when readers and viewers have flocked to news, with the top 10 news websites up by 54% on the previous four weeks at the end of March due to coronavirus news. A University of Canberra study found that news consumption had increased during the pandemic, with 70% of respondents saying they were accessing news at least once a day, compared to 56% in 2019. The news industry was under enormous strain coming into 2020 but the coronavirus has accelerated its decline. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance president Paul Murphy says the coronavirus \u201cbrought to a head the underlying crisis in the industry\u201d driven by the decline in the share of advertising for news companies in Australia. \u201cThe government has finally put in place that $50m regional fund recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last year,\u201d Murphy told Guardian Australia. \u201cI think most major media organisations are reporting bigger audiences and people are relying on trusted news sources \u2013 but the revenue just doesn\u2019t follow. \u201cThe two biggest holes are if nothing replaces AAP and finding a way to address the growing local and regional news deserts.\u201d Hope for \u2018tangible results\u2019 The industry is putting a lot of faith in the work on a mandatory code that will force the digital platforms such as Google and Facebook to compensate news media companies for using their content. The ACCC made the recommendation in the digital platforms report in mid-2019. A few weeks after its chairman Rod Sims warned that reform was \u201curgent\u201d because media companies were in great difficulty, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, instructed him to develop a mandatory code of conduct for the digital giants. Murphy says the state of journalism after the coronavirus is \u201cin the hands of the government and the ACCC to a great extent\u201d. \u201cThere has to be a way found to make these digital platforms pay for the content they\u2019re carrying,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re just going to continue seeing decline. I mean obviously there are other policy tools the government can use like tax concessions.\u201d Fels, a former regulator himself, is optimistic. \u201cI believe the mandatory code will lead to tangible results and if it doesn\u2019t the government will apply other pressure to Google and Facebook such as a tax on their revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cBroadly I am impressed with the measures the government has put in place already and the focus has mainly been on regional and suburban media. Of course we think it should be more but it is substantial.\u201d Murphy says no one can be sure in what form the suspended mastheads at ACM and News Corp will return. \u201cYears of redundancies and cost-cutting hollowed out those newspapers.\u201d \u201cIt depends on how the advertising market rebounds,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cPrint comes with considerable cost and if the advertising revenue is not there it may well accelerate the move to only publishing online.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What is the World Health Assembly? The World Health Assembly is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, attended by representatives of the United Nation\u2019s 194 member states. The two-day 2020 assembly will be held virtually \u2013 it usually happens in Geneva \u2013 because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis around the world. This year\u2019s assembly, the 73rd WHA, will be dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. This will be a critical assembly: the annual meeting comes at a time when the WHO has attracted unprecedented global attention for its coordination and advisory role during the pandemic. Influential states, most notably the US, have criticised the WHO for being slow to react, and alleged it has been biased towards China. The US has withheld funding from the WHO in response to its perceived Covid-19 failings. What is the proposal for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, and which countries are behind it? A key conference paper, already filed ahead of the assembly, and supported by 122 countries, including the members of the European Union and the African Group, the UK, Russia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, calls for a systemic review of the world\u2019s response to Covid-19. Initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with member states, a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation ... to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19. The draft motion does not mention China or Wuhan (the city where the virus was first detected) by name. But it urges the global health community to: ... identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions. And the paper argues the response to the pandemic must be global. The motion: \u2026 calls for the universal, timely and equitable access to and fair distribution of all quality, safe, efficacious and affordable essential health technologies and products including their components and precursors required in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic as a global priority. And China\u2019s position? Calls for an independent international investigation into the origins of Covid-19 have been viewed by Beijing as an attempt to blame it for the disease emerging and breaking out globally. When Australia first proposed a global inquiry last month, China said it was \u201cseriously concerned about and firmly opposed to this\u201d. \u201cSince the outbreak began, China has always acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner and taken a series of resolute, timely and forceful measures,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang then said. Australia led the charge publicly with calls for an inquiry that has now gathered the support of 62 countries, but it has come at the expense of further strain in Australia-China relations. Beijing has proposed massive tariffs on Australian barley and blocked some Australia meat imports, moves condemned by Canberra as attempts at economic coercion. But with growing international support for an inquiry, China\u2019s language has softened considerably. The foreign ministry argued the European Union-drafted motion to be dealt with at the World Health Assembly should be viewed in a different light from Australia\u2019s initial proposal. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press briefing last week. \u201cYou should not view them together from a political angle.\u201d Will Taiwan be a key issue? The presence of Taiwan at the meeting is likely to prove a divisive issue, and there is significant risk that valuable time \u2013 the meeting is strictly limited to two days \u2013 could be lost in the machinations of whether representatives of the Taipei government will be allowed in the meeting. Taiwan\u2019s administration was the first government in the world to deploy preventative measures to guard against the spread of Sars-Cov2 virus, and the island has been held up as global success story: it had only 440 cases and seven deaths, despite being just 180km from the Chinese mainland, where the pandemic began. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room. Besides the input from Taiwan as a country that has successfully combated Covid-19, the US push for its inclusion is part of a broader struggle between Washington and Beijing for influence within the WHO. Member states will vote on Taiwan\u2019s admittance to the assembly. A unanimous affirmation is required, and it appears increasingly like China will block Taiwan\u2019s admittance. Since the election of the pro-independence president, Tsai Ing-wen, in 2016, China has routinely vetoed Taiwan\u2019s inclusion into UN bodies. Taiwan participated in the WHA as an observer from 2009 to 2016, when the Beijing-friendly president, Ma Ying-jeou, was in office, but has not been invited since. What are the other issues up for debate? This will be an intensely political WHA \u2013 a meeting that often passes with little public commentary \u2013 because of the continuing Covid-19 crisis around the world, and the varying capabilities of government responses. The role of the World Health Organisation itself, and its response to the pandemic, will also be under extreme scrutiny, following accusations from the US, Australia and Germany, among others, that it was slow to respond to the initial outbreak and has displayed a bias towards China. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has weathered much of the criticism, in particular from the US president, Donald Trump, who said the organisation was \u201cvery China-centric\u201d and had given the US a \u201cfaulty recommendation\u201d about keeping its borders open. The WHO has been criticised for its response to pandemics before. In 2009, it declared the H1N1 flu outbreak as a pandemic, a decision later criticised by some governments that argued it triggered countries to take expensive measures against a disease that was ultimately milder than forecast. The agency and its then director general, Margaret Chan, also faced sharp criticism for not reacting fast enough to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in December 2013. The 2020 WHA will also address a global vaccine action plan, neglected tropical diseases, and polio eradication. with Reuters",

In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight.</p> <p>Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects.</p> <p>Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby.</p> <p>The Greek capital is embarking on one of the most ambitious rejuvenation schemes, which has been hastened by the pandemic, according to its mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis. He announced plans last week to allocate 50,000 square metres of public space for cyclists and pedestrians.</p> <p>At the heart of the scheme will be a four-mile \u201cgrand walkway\u201d uniting archaeological sites in the historic centre. Pavements will be widened, boulevards pedestrianised, squares enlarged and traffic banned from areas beneath the Acropolis. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9a0fdf660a2f0f455fcb666757e3f9565eb80a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9a0fdf660a2f0f455fcb666757e3f9565eb80a/0_178_5324_3195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cyclist rides down a deserted street in central Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cyclist rides down a deserted street in central Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bakoyannis, who became Athens\u2019 youngest mayor last year, openly admits that the pandemic played a role in accelerating infrastructure works that might have taken years to accomplish.</p> <p>\u201cWe have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are fast-forwarding all our public works,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to liberate public space from cars and give it to people who want to walk and enjoy the city \u2026 Athens will be cleaner, greener and better lit.\u201d</p> <p>In Budapest, 12 miles of temporary bike lanes have been introduced on some of the city\u2019s busiest roads over the past month.</p> <p>The city\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, who was elected last year on a largely green platform, had little trouble introducing the lanes after many people expressed their discomfort at the prospect of depending on the city\u2019s excellent but usually packed public transport system during the pandemic. </p> <p>The mayor\u2019s office said it was monitoring traffic levels and that some of the temporary lanes may remain once life gets back to normal. It is planning a public consultation over where and how to introduce more bike lanes in the future.</p> <p>Around 20 miles of temporary bike lanes have been set up across Paris, much to the disgruntlement of car lobbyists who have protested to city hall that their rights are being squeezed. Main roads such as the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Antoine, a major east-west route, are gradually being sealed off to private vehicles and there are proposals for a further 30 miles of bike lanes in the city.</p> <p>Many Parisians <a href=\"https://coupdepoucevelo.fr/auth/home\">are being offered \u20ac50</a> toward getting old bikes repaired as part of the French capital\u2019s \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) <em>planv\u00e9lo</em> to encourage the use of bicycles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d1b6c53ef2e2b20043c33763f952c1cddfdb2be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1b6c53ef2e2b20043c33763f952c1cddfdb2be/0_123_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those supporting the new push for bike travel point to recent studies, one of which showed the average journey by vehicle in Paris to is 2.5 miles \u2013 a comfortable distance by bike for most \u2013 and another indicating that the lack of exhaust fumes during lockdown has dramatically improved air quality in the city.</p> <p>The city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had made persuading people to abandon private cars in favour of bikes one of the pillars of her political programme even before she was elected mayor in 2014. Despite the car lobby\u2019s hopes that motorised vehicles can reclaim the city once the virus is under control, Hidalgo has said it is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollution.</p> <p>Dublin city council has set aside swathes of Ireland\u2019s capital for pedestrians and cyclists to facilitate physical distancing in a \u201ctemporary mobility plan\u201d that may become permanent. Authorities singled out College Green, which abuts Trinity College, and other parts of the city centre for what promises to be a bold transformation. </p> <p>The idea is to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to navigate the city when shops and other businesses reopen in a 12 to 18-month respite from traffic-choked streets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f49ab5587b7a2ee4080e34f09bde71c2a9ce354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f49ab5587b7a2ee4080e34f09bde71c2a9ce354/0_7_3217_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Dublin\u2019s temporary bike lanes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Dublin\u2019s temporary bike lanes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Authorities in Milan, among the most polluted cities in Europe, have said 22 miles of streets will be transformed over the summer as part of a scheme to reallocate space from cars to cycling and walking. Congestion in Milan, which is usually clogged with traffic, has fallen between 30 and 70% during the lockdown, and air pollution with it.</p> <p>Rome\u2019s council has approved the construction of 93 miles of temporary and permanent cycle routes as a way to be more sustainable while allowing people to adhere to physical distancing rules. As part of the government\u2019s economic decree, people in towns and cities with populations of 50,000 or more will also be able to claim up to \u20ac500 toward the cost of a new bike. The payment also applies to scooters, electric bikes and Segways.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Tour de France victory by the Colombian Egan Bernal precipitated a cycling boom in Bogot\u00e1. Hundreds of miles of public highways are closed to cars on Sundays, allowing cyclists to take to the roads free of exhaust fumes and the blare of car horns.</p> <p>This enthusiasm has made it easier for the mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, herself a keen cyclist, to introduce more bike lanes as part of plans to reduce public transport use to 35% of capacity in the country\u2019s effort to tackle the pandemic. Fifty miles of new bike paths were announced last week, on top of the 300 already in place. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60821569a4a030c2898ddf26f26b179b73563c69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60821569a4a030c2898ddf26f26b179b73563c69/0_0_4312_2587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists in Bogot\u00e1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists in Bogot\u00e1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ra\u00fal Arboleda/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Announcing that 7,000 people were using the bike paths in the working-class south of the city, Bogota\u2019s transport secretary, Nicol\u00e1s Estupi\u00f1an, tweeted: \u201cEvery day more Bogotanos are getting on, and staying on, their bikes!\u201d</p> <p>Similar developments are taking place from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/slow-streets-can-coronavirus-cure-brussels-of-addiction-driving\">Brussels</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/22/bicycles-are-the-new-toilet-paper-bike-sales-boom-as-coronavirus-lockdown-residents-crave-exercise\">Sydney</a>, while transport officials in many US cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom\">report</a> an \u201cexplosion in cycling\u201d. From \u201cslow streets\u201d programmes in California to the progressive closure of many streets in New York, some cities have said they plan to make the changes permanent.</p> <p>In Berlin it can take up to a decade to create a new bike lane, but during the coronavirus crisis, 14 miles of pop-up bike lanes, separated from car lanes by traffic beacons, have been introduced in anything from three to 10 days. Most will be here to stay, city officials have said, arguing that increasing numbers of Berliners \u2013 at the last count 43% \u2013 have no car, and that bikes will help lessen the burden on public transport.</p> <p>The ADAC, Germany\u2019s automobile association, has been highly critical of what it has called officials\u2019 \u201cexploitation of an emergency\u201d, which has been taking place in cities across the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe temporary reduction in car traffic, and incidentally bike usage as well, cannot be used to enforce the permanent reallocation of traffic space,\u201d Volker Krane, of the ADAC, told German media. He said the bike lanes did little to ensure the safety of bike riders. </p> <p>Even in some cities that have not introduced specific measures to encourage bikes, cyclists are making their presence felt. In the Jordanian capital, Amman, they spoke of the joy of seizing empty roads from the aggressive driving culture that normally dominates them, after cars were banned for about six weeks.</p> <p><em>Reporting team: </em><em>Helena Smith in Athens, Shaun Walker in Budapest, Kim Willsher in Paris, Rory Carroll in Dublin, Angela Giuffrida in Rome, Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogot\u00e1 and Michael Safi in Amman</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Athens has said he will \u201cliberate\u201d public space from cars. His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight. Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects. Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby. The Greek capital is embarking on one of the most ambitious rejuvenation schemes, which has been hastened by the pandemic, according to its mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis. He announced plans last week to allocate 50,000 square metres of public space for cyclists and pedestrians. At the heart of the scheme will be a four-mile \u201cgrand walkway\u201d uniting archaeological sites in the historic centre. Pavements will be widened, boulevards pedestrianised, squares enlarged and traffic banned from areas beneath the Acropolis. Bakoyannis, who became Athens\u2019 youngest mayor last year, openly admits that the pandemic played a role in accelerating infrastructure works that might have taken years to accomplish. \u201cWe have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are fast-forwarding all our public works,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to liberate public space from cars and give it to people who want to walk and enjoy the city \u2026 Athens will be cleaner, greener and better lit.\u201d In Budapest, 12 miles of temporary bike lanes have been introduced on some of the city\u2019s busiest roads over the past month. The city\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, who was elected last year on a largely green platform, had little trouble introducing the lanes after many people expressed their discomfort at the prospect of depending on the city\u2019s excellent but usually packed public transport system during the pandemic. The mayor\u2019s office said it was monitoring traffic levels and that some of the temporary lanes may remain once life gets back to normal. It is planning a public consultation over where and how to introduce more bike lanes in the future. Around 20 miles of temporary bike lanes have been set up across Paris, much to the disgruntlement of car lobbyists who have protested to city hall that their rights are being squeezed. Main roads such as the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Antoine, a major east-west route, are gradually being sealed off to private vehicles and there are proposals for a further 30 miles of bike lanes in the city. Many Parisians are being offered \u20ac50 toward getting old bikes repaired as part of the French capital\u2019s \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) planv\u00e9lo to encourage the use of bicycles. Those supporting the new push for bike travel point to recent studies, one of which showed the average journey by vehicle in Paris to is 2.5 miles \u2013 a comfortable distance by bike for most \u2013 and another indicating that the lack of exhaust fumes during lockdown has dramatically improved air quality in the city. The city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had made persuading people to abandon private cars in favour of bikes one of the pillars of her political programme even before she was elected mayor in 2014. Despite the car lobby\u2019s hopes that motorised vehicles can reclaim the city once the virus is under control, Hidalgo has said it is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollution. Dublin city council has set aside swathes of Ireland\u2019s capital for pedestrians and cyclists to facilitate physical distancing in a \u201ctemporary mobility plan\u201d that may become permanent. Authorities singled out College Green, which abuts Trinity College, and other parts of the city centre for what promises to be a bold transformation. The idea is to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to navigate the city when shops and other businesses reopen in a 12 to 18-month respite from traffic-choked streets. Authorities in Milan, among the most polluted cities in Europe, have said 22 miles of streets will be transformed over the summer as part of a scheme to reallocate space from cars to cycling and walking. Congestion in Milan, which is usually clogged with traffic, has fallen between 30 and 70% during the lockdown, and air pollution with it. Rome\u2019s council has approved the construction of 93 miles of temporary and permanent cycle routes as a way to be more sustainable while allowing people to adhere to physical distancing rules. As part of the government\u2019s economic decree, people in towns and cities with populations of 50,000 or more will also be able to claim up to \u20ac500 toward the cost of a new bike. The payment also applies to scooters, electric bikes and Segways. Last year\u2019s Tour de France victory by the Colombian Egan Bernal precipitated a cycling boom in Bogot\u00e1. Hundreds of miles of public highways are closed to cars on Sundays, allowing cyclists to take to the roads free of exhaust fumes and the blare of car horns. This enthusiasm has made it easier for the mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, herself a keen cyclist, to introduce more bike lanes as part of plans to reduce public transport use to 35% of capacity in the country\u2019s effort to tackle the pandemic. Fifty miles of new bike paths were announced last week, on top of the 300 already in place. Announcing that 7,000 people were using the bike paths in the working-class south of the city, Bogota\u2019s transport secretary, Nicol\u00e1s Estupi\u00f1an, tweeted: \u201cEvery day more Bogotanos are getting on, and staying on, their bikes!\u201d Similar developments are taking place from Brussels to Sydney, while transport officials in many US cities report an \u201cexplosion in cycling\u201d. From \u201cslow streets\u201d programmes in California to the progressive closure of many streets in New York, some cities have said they plan to make the changes permanent. In Berlin it can take up to a decade to create a new bike lane, but during the coronavirus crisis, 14 miles of pop-up bike lanes, separated from car lanes by traffic beacons, have been introduced in anything from three to 10 days. Most will be here to stay, city officials have said, arguing that increasing numbers of Berliners \u2013 at the last count 43% \u2013 have no car, and that bikes will help lessen the burden on public transport. The ADAC, Germany\u2019s automobile association, has been highly critical of what it has called officials\u2019 \u201cexploitation of an emergency\u201d, which has been taking place in cities across the country. \u201cThe temporary reduction in car traffic, and incidentally bike usage as well, cannot be used to enforce the permanent reallocation of traffic space,\u201d Volker Krane, of the ADAC, told German media. He said the bike lanes did little to ensure the safety of bike riders. Even in some cities that have not introduced specific measures to encourage bikes, cyclists are making their presence felt. In the Jordanian capital, Amman, they spoke of the joy of seizing empty roads from the aggressive driving culture that normally dominates them, after cars were banned for about six weeks.

Amid concern that authorities are deliberately playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic, seven candidates are seeking to replace the incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza, who is being forced to step down by opponents within the country\u2019s ruling CNDD-FDD party. Rights groups say the government is pressing ahead with the vote irresponsibly, and accuse the CNDD-FDD and its youth wing of crushing dissent and threatening those taking their own measures against coronavirus. Last week Burundi expelled the World Health Organization\u2019s expert team working on coronavirus. Campaigning politicians have held rallies attended by tens of thousands. The nation of 11 million people has reported 27 cases of Covid-19 so far but has only carried out about 520 tests in total. Officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear. Nkurunziza\u2019s spokesperson recently said that though the country may be hit by the pandemic, \u201cBurundi \u2026 has signed a special covenant with God, whether you believe it or not\u201d.

Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal. Ndayishimiye has promised to \u201cfight poverty and develop the country\u201d, claiming his party had taken 15 years to \u201clay the foundations\u201d for the future, and it was not the time to put \u201camateurs\u201d in power. Voters who spoke to journalists in Burundi last week were too fearful to give their names. A 45-year-old vegetable seller in the capital, Bujumbura, supported the ruling party because it had provided welfare. \u201cThey give us rice and beans and can build houses for the most vulnerable among us like elders or widows,\u201d she said. But a jobless 32-year-old supported the opposition. \u201cAll of us need change, many Burundians need \u2026 one to end this daily violence, these killings, this rampant corruption and economic embezzlement,\u201d he said. Medics and others have braved official threats to raise concerns that the true number of Covid-19 cases is much higher than the official count. A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital. A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients \u201cpresenting all the symptoms of coronavirus\u201d last week. Six staff responsible for taking samples at the National Institute of Public Health, the only place in Burundi that was carrying out tests, have become ill with the virus. \u201cSince then all activity is paralysed, no test can be carried out, it is a catastrophe,\u201d an employee of the institute said. The country\u2019s last election in 2015 led to violence that left at least 1,200 dead, displaced hundreds of thousands and resulted in a sustained crackdown on the opposition and media. Aid was cut off by donors and sanctions imposed. Last year the government shut down the UN human rights office after repeated criticism that members of the CNDD-FDD\u2019s youth wing and the security services were torturing, gang-raping and murdering political opponents. Rights groups say those attacks have increased in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s presidential, legislative and municipal elections. Nkurunziza will remain president until August, and a new constitution has given him sweeping powers to declare a state of emergency if the results are disputed. \u201cA perfect storm is brewing in Burundi, but after years of repression, few are left to bear witness and sound the alarm,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Burundi is one the poorest country in the world, by some measures. \u201cThe economic record of Nkurunziza\u2019s 15 years in power is catastrophic. He has taken Burundi backward on all levels, he has completely isolated the country from its traditional donors and even neighbouring countries. It is a calamity,\u201d said Aime Magera, an exiled spokesman for the main opposition National Freedom Council.",

The K-League club FC Seoul said the dolls, which had been dotted around stands currently off-limits to supporters due to the coronavirus outbreak, had been ordered inadvertently after a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with the supplier. Earlier this month the K-League became the first major football league to hold matches since the start of the pandemic, with the season\u2019s opening game watched by a worldwide audience of fans starved of live football. But FC Seoul\u2019s attempt to bring a touch of realism to Sunday\u2019s match against Gwangju FC backfired after social media users noticed that the mannequins looked more like sex dolls. Some pointed out that several were holding posters carrying the name of the popular live streamer BJ Chaero \u2013 reportedly the physical inspiration for the dolls\u2019 design \u2013 according to the Koreaboo website. The club said it had been the victim of a mix-up, insisting it had checked with the supplier and received assurances that the dolls were not intended for sexual use. Photographs taken at the largely empty stadium showed about 10 dolls spaced out among seats in front of life-size cardboard cutouts of the team\u2019s players. \u201cWe would like to apologise to the fans,\u201d FC Seoul said in a statement on Instagram. \u201cWe are deeply sorry.\u201d It added: \u201cOur intention was to do something light-hearted in these difficult times.

      "body": "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global infections pass 4.7 million</strong></h2> <p>There are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p> <h2><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%</strong></h2> <p>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</p> <h2><strong>Japan\u2019s </strong><strong>falls into recession </strong></h2> <p>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers.</p> <h2><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In Brazil, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52701524\">BBC</a> has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy</strong></h2> <p>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong> recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</p> <h2><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar. A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</p> <h2><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks</strong></h2> <p>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff#block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff\">Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions</a> are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global infections pass 4.7 million There are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187 people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25% US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. Japan\u2019s falls into recession Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019 In Brazil, the BBC has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile Spain recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar. A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday. WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room. India extends lockdown by another two weeks India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths.",

      "body": "<p>The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president.</p> <p>But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism.</p> <p>\u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838/25_33_1319_1965/671.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p>A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">report </a><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">last month concluded</a> that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">A lot are untested and uninsured</a>. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late.</p> <p>\u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson <a href=\"https://chicagocrusader.com/why-are-african-americans-dying-disproportionately-to-the-coronavirus/\">asked in a statement published on 7 April</a>, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution. We shouldn\u2019t say America was founded in 1776 \u2013 it started with slavery in 1619; so we\u2019re still invisible to that extent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13/0_0_3435_2305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe still make less, live under stresses and don\u2019t live as long. We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d</p> <p>Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fpolitics%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fblack-activists-officials-see-major-threat-souths-plans-reopen%2f\">group of activists</a>, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d.</p> <p>White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic. If the poor are not protected, the rich are in jeopardy, because you cannot separate by community the poor from the rich, the white from the black.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8/608_479_2392_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Kelly/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt was tested by the Great Depression and second world war and rose to the challenge.

The infrastructure that [George W] Bush and Barack had put together on pandemics was ignored. He dismantled the infrastructure and did not pay adequate attention to the threat.</p> <p>\u201cAs the threat changed, we didn\u2019t have ventilators and respirators. All our preparation was for a financial fight or a military fight. He should have declared a national testing mechanism. There should have been a national lockdown to break the back of it. The attention should have been early; it was not.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has sought absolution at press briefings that sometimes run for more than two hours with a mix of self-congratulation, bloated exaggerations, broadsides at reporters and bad science. He recently ad libbed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">jaw-dropping proposal to study the merits of injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients</a>. It has left his opponent in November\u2019s election, the former vice president Joe Biden, struggling to get a share of the limelight.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is using the daily press briefing as a platform to promote his politics while Biden is facing lockdown in his basement.

Biden\u2019s campaign fell apart after he quoted without attribution the then British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and was accused of plagiarism. Jackson, bidding to become the US\u2019s first black president, gathered 7m votes and finished first or second in 46 out of 54 primary contests. But he lost the nomination to Michael Dukakis, who went down to George HW Bush.</p> <p>Does it hurt that he will never be president? \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbecause I was a trailblazer, I was a pathfinder. I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a black person running. There were black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even blacks said a black couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his foreign policy positions at the time, he points out, became widely adopted: a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/08/thatcher-advisers-suspicious-jesse-jackson-visit\">he met Margaret Thatcher to plead for Britain</a> to drop its support for the apartheid regime). In 2000 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US\u2019s highest civilian honour.</p> <p>When Obama won in 2008, he praised Jackson for making his run possible. As Obama delivered his election night victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago before a crowd of 240,000, Jackson\u2019s tear-stained face was among the most indelible images. \u201cIt was a big moment in history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cried because I thought about those who made it possible who were not there \u2026 People who paid a real price: Ralph Abernathy, Dr King, Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, those who fought like hell [at the Democratic national convention] in Atlantic City in 64, those in the movement in the south.\u201d </p> <p>Some felt that Obama should have pushed faster and further on racial justice in his two terms. But Jackson ranks him among the US\u2019s top presidents. \u201cFirst, given America\u2019s history in terms of race, he inspired indescribable pride. No 2, his family and their decency and dignity were a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>He points to the Paris climate accords, Iran nuclear deal, rapprochement with Cuba and rescue of the economy as signal achievements. \u201cHe stabilised the ship when the ship was sinking and got it back above the water. And no scandal. Trump creates a desire for Barack all over again.

      "bodyText": "The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president. But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism. \u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing. Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart. \u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus. A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee report last month concluded that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise. \u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cA lot are untested and uninsured. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late. \u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore. \u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson asked in a statement published on 7 April, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d. He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution. We shouldn\u2019t say America was founded in 1776 \u2013 it started with slavery in 1619; so we\u2019re still invisible to that extent. \u201cWe still make less, live under stresses and don\u2019t live as long. We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out. \u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A group of activists, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d. White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis. \u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic. If the poor are not protected, the rich are in jeopardy, because you cannot separate by community the poor from the rich, the white from the black.\u201d Roosevelt was tested by the Great Depression and second world war and rose to the challenge. George W Bush faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks; Barack Obama the financial crisis. Trump had his shot at greatness with the coronavirus pandemic and few, outside his most ardent supporters, would dispute he threw it away. The first president elected with no previous political or military experience squandered a precious six weeks, instead golfing, holding rallies and prophesying that the virus would disappear \u201clike a miracle\u201d in warm weather rather than following the pandemic emergency plan bequeathed by Obama and building a rigorous nationwide testing programme. Is Trump responsible for tens of thousands of deaths? \u201cHe had an opportunity to move early on it and did not move early on it. The infrastructure that [George W] Bush and Barack had put together on pandemics was ignored. He dismantled the infrastructure and did not pay adequate attention to the threat. \u201cAs the threat changed, we didn\u2019t have ventilators and respirators. All our preparation was for a financial fight or a military fight. He should have declared a national testing mechanism. There should have been a national lockdown to break the back of it. The attention should have been early; it was not.\u201d Trump has sought absolution at press briefings that sometimes run for more than two hours with a mix of self-congratulation, bloated exaggerations, broadsides at reporters and bad science. He recently ad libbed a jaw-dropping proposal to study the merits of injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients. It has left his opponent in November\u2019s election, the former vice president Joe Biden, struggling to get a share of the limelight. \u201cTrump is using the daily press briefing as a platform to promote his politics while Biden is facing lockdown in his basement. But there\u2019s a real chance the more he talks, the weaker he gets.\u201d Jackson \u2013 whose activism began as a student trying to desegregate the public library in his birthplace of Greenville, South Carolina \u2013 ran against Biden in the 1988 Democratic primary. Biden\u2019s campaign fell apart after he quoted without attribution the then British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and was accused of plagiarism. Jackson, bidding to become the US\u2019s first black president, gathered 7m votes and finished first or second in 46 out of 54 primary contests. But he lost the nomination to Michael Dukakis, who went down to George HW Bush. Does it hurt that he will never be president? \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbecause I was a trailblazer, I was a pathfinder. I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a black person running. There were black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even blacks said a black couldn\u2019t win.\u201d Some of his foreign policy positions at the time, he points out, became widely adopted: a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa (he met Margaret Thatcher to plead for Britain to drop its support for the apartheid regime). In 2000 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US\u2019s highest civilian honour. When Obama won in 2008, he praised Jackson for making his run possible. As Obama delivered his election night victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago before a crowd of 240,000, Jackson\u2019s tear-stained face was among the most indelible images. \u201cIt was a big moment in history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cried because I thought about those who made it possible who were not there \u2026 People who paid a real price: Ralph Abernathy, Dr King, Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, those who fought like hell [at the Democratic national convention] in Atlantic City in 64, those in the movement in the south.\u201d Some felt that Obama should have pushed faster and further on racial justice in his two terms. But Jackson ranks him among the US\u2019s top presidents. \u201cFirst, given America\u2019s history in terms of race, he inspired indescribable pride. No 2, his family and their decency and dignity were a big deal.\u201d He points to the Paris climate accords, Iran nuclear deal, rapprochement with Cuba and rescue of the economy as signal achievements. \u201cHe stabilised the ship when the ship was sinking and got it back above the water. And no scandal. Trump creates a desire for Barack all over again. When he travelled around the world, he was the best face America\u2019s ever had.\u201d In March, Jackson endorsed Bernie Sanders, returning a compliment from 1988 when Sanders backed his campaign. \u201cHis ideas made the most sense to me,\u201d he explains. But after a promising start Sanders fell away, partly because of his failure to connect with older African American voters, where Biden dominated. \u201cHis campaign was [about] class without appreciating the caste dimension of poverty,\u201d Jackson explains by way of post-mortem. \u201cThere are 55 black members of Congress and he didn\u2019t have one. Maybe one or two black mayors, but he didn\u2019t cultivate an African American constituency.\u201d Biden, meanwhile, benefited from his \u201ckinship\u201d with Obama as well as Trump\u2019s repeated attacks that kept his profile up and his name on the front pages. \u201cThe opposition had no infrastructure for the black vote.

The TV gardener Monty Don, who is opening the show by giving RHS members a glimpse of the unseen parts of his Longmeadow garden, said outdoor spaces were \u201cdesperately important\u201d. \u201cI have written and spoken many times of my own battles with depression, and over the years have been much helped by medication, therapy, sun lamps, yoga and, not least, by an astonishingly supportive and long-suffering family,\u201d he said. \u201cBut none of this works without the balm of touching ground, of being nourished by the earth. \u201cPlant a seed that becomes a beautiful flower and your life is immeasurably enriched. Simply sit in a garden and listen to the birds and the world is set in a perspective that is empowering. \u201cGardens are fun and beautiful and rewarding - but much more than that, gardens are desperately important and we need them now more than ever for our physical and mental wellbeing.\u201d",

Experts say the answer may be linked to borrowing trends, the nature of Britain\u2019s financial system, and the UK\u2019s relationship with government spending. The schemes at a glance CBILS relies on banks lending out their own cash. However, it comes with a guarantee that the government will cover 80% of losses if a customer defaults and the bank cannot recover the full amount. The Treasury has amended the programme twice since its launch on 23 March, following a backlash over the terms and the slow pace at which the loans were being processed.

In Switzerland, banks are offering 100% government-backed loans worth up to 500,000 Swiss francs (\u00a3425,205), and an 85% guarantee for loans of up to 20m Swiss francs. A fragmented UK banking system After a boom in UK bank takeovers in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, regulators have tried to boost competition and even encouraged businesses to shift accounts to smaller lenders. Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, says this fragmented system may be partly the reason for the UK scheme\u2019s teething problems. For example, the UK\u2019s CBILS programme was launched with 40 banks on board. \u201cIn countries where the system is quite concentrated \u2013 with one, two or three big banks \u2013 in a sense it\u2019s easier to get these schemes off the ground.

The UK is more used to monetary than fiscal stimulus The UK\u2019s \u00a3330bn coronavirus business support programme is the largest in the country\u2019s history, but European peers are far more experienced when it comes to distributing state-backed cash and may have been able to get money flowing much quicker as a result. Countries such as France and Germany \u201cderive some benefit from experience\u201d, said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg. \u201cThey have the facilities in place and businesses have the attitude and proclivity to ask the government, in times like these, for help.\u201d The UK has instead relied heavily on monetary policy for economic stimulus, which tends to be faster and does not require tax hikes or an increase in government borrowing. The state-owned British Business Bank, meanwhile, is not used to managing programmes the size of CBILS and bounce-back loans. It has had to increase staffing and is still building new digital programmes to handle demand. CASE STUDIES Electronic filter maker in Durham, UK Anj Hampton, 45, is a director at Rasmi Electronics in Durham. The firm makes electronic filters that ensure radio frequencies from one machine do not disrupt another. The family-run business exports about 85% of its stock to Europe, but also sells to firms that supply the NHS at home. After factories shut down in China this year, Anj was struggling to get parts and fulfil orders and eventually had to send staff home. After three months, she was facing a cash squeeze and was looking for \u00a3200,000 to bridge the gap. She approached NatWest five weeks ago but was wrongly told that exporters were not eligible for CBILS. Anj said she put together evidence from the British Business Bank showing that she was still entitled to access the scheme but has not yet been granted a loan. The BBB\u2019s website has since been changed to clarify that exporters do qualify, but she\u2019s still waiting for funding. Property engineering firm in Paris, France Eric Malenfer, 55 is the CEO of Gexpertise Conseil, which helps design, survey and model buildings in both France and Tunisia. He had to cut his 220 staff down to part-time work after France went into lockdown last month and was looking for \u20ac2.5m in emergency loans to stay afloat. He approached both Credit du Nord and HSBC in France for a total of \u20ac2.5m. The application process took about two weeks, which he said was \u201cparticularly short\u201d, and he received the cash a week later. \u201cThe state reacted very quickly and the banking arrangements were implemented within deadlines that we did not imagine possible,\u201d Malenfer said. Cinema and events space in Frankfurt, Germany Andreas Lucas, 56, is the managing partner of Orfeo\u2019s Erben, a restaurant, bar, cinema and events space in Frankfurt, Germany. The site had to close on 18 March as the pandemic started to spread, and he had to put his staff on part-time furlough. He secured a \u20ac30,000 grant and a separate \u20ac35,000 micro-loan through the Wirtschaftsbank Hessen state development bank to help cover rent, staff benefits, and maintenance during the outbreak. He said it took less than 10 days between starting the application and receiving the cash. Lucas said it was \u201cone of the least bureaucratic\u201d experiences he has had in the past 30 years.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Contact tracing recruits \u2018told scheme on hold\u2019 Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to start the week. Ministers have been accused of \u201cmisstep after misstep\u201d over the rolling out of a viable contact tracing scheme to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Gove said yesterday that the government\u2019s app-based plan would be ready to launch by the end of the month and that \u201cjust over 17,000\u201d contact tracers had been hired to help. But emails sent this weekend by one of the companies handling the recruitment process said hiring had been paused while the government considered an alternative app. Attempts to get teachers back to work are also beset with problems but a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies today says that keeping schools closed will widen inequalities during lockdown. Another sobering statistic: more than three-quarters of black and Asian doctors in the NHS fear they will contract Covid-19. There was some more optimism about a possible vaccine for Covid-19 with news that production of a jab will begin this summer in Oxford even before clinical trials have established whether it will work. If the vaccine is successful, AstraZeneca will work to make 30m shots available by September, with a further 70m earmarked for the US and the rest of the world. The virus has now infected 4.7 million people around the world and caused the death of 315,000. You can follow all the day\u2019s developments in the pandemic at our live blog here, and catch up with overnight news at a glance. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Brexit stall \u2013 British negotiators will seek to re-energise Brexit talks with European officials this week by publishing a draft treaty mapping out the government\u2019s position. The UK believes talks have been \u201cdisappointing\u201d in settling disputed issues in part because European governments are being distracted by having to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Issues up for discussion in the talks are the car industry, fisheries and how to reduce bureaucracy at border checks. * * * Pakistan killings \u2013 Two teenage girls have been shot dead by members of their own family after a short video was posted online showing them in the company of a young man at a secluded spot. The pair, said to be aged 16 and 18, were killed and buried in their village in Pakistan\u2019s North Waziristan province where women are commonly subject to a strict \u201chonour code\u201d under which they are not allowed out alone. * * * Iran plea \u2013 The Foreign Office has refused a plea from Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe for the British ambassador to Iran to visit her before Tehran decides whether to return her to jail. The dual citizen was sentenced to five years\u2019 prison in 2016 but has been on furlough at her parents\u2019 home in Tehran during the coronavirus outbreak. Her lawyers wanted a show of solidarity from the UK ambassador but the Foreign Office believes a visit would be counter-productive. * * * Bloom time \u2013 The Chelsea Flower Show starts online today amid a boom in the popularity of gardening that has led experts such as TV gardener Monty Don to highlight the importance of green spaces in maintaining good mental health. Sue Biggs, the Royal Horticultural Society director general, says the government should stipulate that new homes must have private or communal gardens or a balcony. * * * Coronavirus Extra Green campaigners are calling for the restrictions on cars in cities from Brussels to Bogot\u00e1 will become a permanent feature. Australia has won the support of 110 countries for a resolution to the World Health Assembly later today calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. China, which is under mounting global pressure ahead of the meeting, is not mentioned in the wording of the resolution. The exodus of expats around the world to their country of origin has helped New Zealand\u2019s population pass 5 million for the first time.

      "bodyText": "Anti-Adani activists will bombard the world\u2019s largest insurance broker with calls, emails and social media messages in a virtual protest on Tuesday ahead of its annual general meeting in New York. Campaigners have already managed to speak directly with Marsh executives, who are understood to be considering a new climate policy at this week\u2019s meeting. The company is understood to be working for Adani to find insurance policies for the Carmichael mine. This year was supposed to be Australia\u2019s climate flashpoint. Activists had begun arriving in central Queensland for a \u201cred alert\u201d campaign of daily physical protests to disrupt construction of the world\u2019s most controversial coalmine. Instead, amid the coronavirus crisis, Adani has made sober, unhindered progress on its Carmichael coal project. Opponents have been forced to abandon plans for escalating civil disobedience. The Indian miner told Guardian Australia the campaign against it has \u201cfailed\u201d. But while the public health emergency has placed physical activism into hibernation at a critical point for Adani, the climate movement has pivoted its tactics in a way that some hope could more effectively disrupt the project and the global coal sector. \u201cIn many ways, we think the online rally will be more effective than a rally outside an office,\u201d says Carrie Tsai, the coordinator of Stop Adani Redfern. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a lot of people from the US to join the online rally. Marsh is based in the US and Stop Adani is a global campaign. Moving online has meant we\u2019ve been collaborating more with people around the globe. \u201cWe know the executives of Marsh are listening to our campaign, because they\u2019re on the other side of the phone.\u201d The school climate strikers, who protested in their hundreds of thousands last year, sought to maintain momentum during the enforced isolation of the coronavirus crisis by rallying from their bedrooms. Other groups have run targeted online campaigns. Galilee Blockade, which typically seeks to target businesses in the Adani supply chain, has focused on the construction firm BMD, which has a contract to build parts of the Carmichael rail corridor. Activists believe they can continue to run effective campaigns in isolation. \u201cDuring this pandemic our movement has turned to a lot of online organising to keep the community aware and informed of what the mining industry has been doing in this period,\u201d says Amy Booth, a spokeswoman for Frontline Action on Coal. \u201cThat has made so many people impassioned to take a stand as soon as restrictions allow them to, to head to the Galilee coal basin region to stop work. \u201cThe frontlines movement is still as strong as ever, and as soon as restrictions allow us to start being in areas where we need to stop work, we\u2019ll be doing just that.\u201d Meanwhile, work continues on the mine and Adani says it remains on schedule to send its first shipment next year. Many activists are sceptical about that timeline \u2013 especially given the likely impact of the Covid crisis on the world\u2019s coal markets. \u201cWe recognise how important it is to continue our operations where safe to do so to provide certainty of employment for our staff, contractors and the thousands of people across north and central Queensland who indirectly rely on our project for their livelihoods,\u201d an Adani spokeswoman said. \u201cAnti-mining activists and the so-called charities that fund and employ them have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at us to try and stop us building the Carmichael mine and rail project and they have failed. \u201cAfter more than eight years of working on our project we have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to Queenslanders and we continue to get on with the construction of the Carmichael project.\u201d",

The amount borrowed was nearly \u00a3100,000 (about half the value of her home at that time) at a rate of interest of 7.54%. Following a stroke, she moved into a nursing home in December 2019 so I am now in the process of selling her house to fund the care home fees. By lockdown in March, I had a buyer in place but activity has been frozen for the last three months. Meanwhile the debt repayable to the equity release firm is apparently increasing at \u00a3230 a week, which would reduce the equity available at the end of the lockdown period by over \u00a33,000. Do we know if the mortgage holiday payments will apply to this situation? IG A Because of the way that lifetime mortgages work, your mother has effectively been taking a mortgage holiday from the day the \u00a3100,000 of equity was released and the mortgage started. With the type of lifetime mortgage that your mother has, interest is charged on the loan each month but \u2013 instead of being paid to the lender \u2013 it is \u201crolled up\u201d which means added to the original loan amount. Each time interest is added to the loan, the total amount on which interest is charged goes up. This is the same as is happening with the misleadingly-named mortgage holiday with a standard mortgage. But instead of interest being added to the loan for its entire term \u2013 as with a lifetime mortgage \u2013 lenders tend to limit the period that interest can be rolled up \u2013 aka mortgage holiday \u2013 to three months. It also explains why when someone comes to the end of a mortgage \u2018holiday\u2019 he or she will find that the amount owed on the mortgage has gone up as has the monthly mortgage payment. So to answer your question, mortgage holiday payments won\u2019t apply to your mother\u2019s situation. If taking a mortgage holiday meant the lender waiving interest payments for the holiday period, it might apply to your mother but, sadly, it doesn\u2019t. On a more positive note, if the amount your mother owes is more than proceeds of the sale, you won\u2019t have to make up the difference because most lenders who adhere to the standards set by the Equity Release Council offer a no-negative-equity guarantee. This means that lenders promise not to make any equity-release customer (or their beneficiaries) pay back more than what the mortgaged property sells for. Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the \u2018Track and Trace\u2019 app itself while the government considers an alternative app,\u201d the emails said.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the email was \u201cwrong and could cause confusion\u201d, and recruitment for both the online and phone-based contact-tracing service was continuing \u201cat pace\u201d.</p> \n<p>The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: \u201cTest, trace and isolate is fundamental to managing and controlling this virus and safely easing lockdown \u2013 yet the government\u2019s approach has been increasingly chaotic, with misstep after misstep.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government is battling to maintain public trust for the difficult second phase of managing the crisis after replacing the blunt \u201cstay at home, save lives\u201d message with the more nebulous \u201cstay alert\u201d.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson acknowledged on Sunday he could understand the public\u2019s frustration.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have been accused of \u201cmisstep after misstep\u201d after applicants to become contact tracers for the NHS in England were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app. After struggles with sourcing personal protective equipment and building up sufficient testing capacity, track, trace and isolate is the latest major challenge for the government. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, insisted on Sunday that the track and trace scheme would be ready to launch nationwide by the end of the month, with \u201cjust over 17,000\u201d contact tracers already hired. But emails seen by the Guardian, sent this weekend by one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment process, Kent-based HR Go, said hiring had been paused. \u201cThank you for your online application for this role. Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the \u2018Track and Trace\u2019 app itself while the government considers an alternative app,\u201d the emails said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the email was \u201cwrong and could cause confusion\u201d, and recruitment for both the online and phone-based contact-tracing service was continuing \u201cat pace\u201d. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: \u201cTest, trace and isolate is fundamental to managing and controlling this virus and safely easing lockdown \u2013 yet the government\u2019s approach has been increasingly chaotic, with misstep after misstep.\u201d The government is battling to maintain public trust for the difficult second phase of managing the crisis after replacing the blunt \u201cstay at home, save lives\u201d message with the more nebulous \u201cstay alert\u201d. Boris Johnson acknowledged on Sunday he could understand the public\u2019s frustration. He wrote in the Mail on Sunday: \u201cI recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home \u2013 but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people.\u201d The NHS\u2019s digital arm, NHSX, has developed its own coronavirus tracking app, which will hold data centrally, instead of opting for an alternative from Google and Apple that operates in a decentralised way. If a user becomes unwell with symptoms of Covid-19, they can choose to let the app inform the NHS. They will be offered testing, and an anonymous alert will inform other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days. Thousands of contact tracers, many of them working from home, will work alongside the app, speaking to Covid-19 sufferers about whom they may have been in contact with, and giving advice \u2013 for example, urging them to self-isolate. Ministers want to be able to use the data gathered to analyse the spread of the virus. They hope this will allow them to reimpose lockdown conditions in local areas where a new outbreak is detected \u2013 a process Johnson has described as \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d. But the app is working against constraints in modern smartphones that only Google and Apple can work around, as well as arriving burdened with privacy concerns that could deter some members of the public from using it. People who had applied for contact-tracing jobs through the government\u2019s gov.uk website were told this weekend: \u201cAs and when the app (or an alternative) goes live, we will reconsider those applications already received, however please be aware that we have received an unprecedented number of applications for this role and therefore not all suitable candidates will be able to be put forward.\u201d Confronted by the Guardian about the claim in the email that an alternative app was being considered, a spokesperson for HR Go confirmed it had sent the emails, but insisted: \u201cWhat has been said is a miscommunication and false. We are not aware of any reason why Track and Track [sic] would not being continuing as it should. We will be communicating with the applicants directly to correct that once we have completed our internal investigations.\u201d The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS contact-tracing app is not on hold and it would be completely wrong to suggest otherwise. There is no alternative app and the NHS continues to work constructively with many other organisations that are helping to develop and test the NHS Covid-19 app.\u201d The Guardian revealed last week that the app\u2019s advisory board was split over whether it had the authority to tell the government to ditch its version and switch to the Apple and Google version. After a meeting on Thursday, it emerged that members argued their role on the board was limited to providing guidance on ethical questions, and not to branch out into a broader discussion of whether the app is the right tool for the job. Some government officials believe the NHSX app may not survive in its current form after trials on the Isle of Wight. Software for a decentralised version by Apple and Google is expected to be released on Tuesday. The government gave up trying to track every UK case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said at the time: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d But Ashworth and the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, have repeatedly called for community tracing. If the track and trace system is ready to roll out by the end of month, it would be in time to provide reassurance to parents and teachers that individual cases in English schools could be identified and isolated if they reopen to more pupils from 1 June, as the government is demanding. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 contact tracers of the 18,000 promised by Hancock had been hired, but government sources now say that number was out of date. Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on SkyNews, Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. \u201cWe\u2019re on course to meet that target.

Jane Halton, who is also a former head of Australia\u2019s health and finance departments, issued the warning at the National Press Club on Monday. Halton told reporters there is a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of developing a Covid-19 vaccine because \u2013 although 94% of vaccine candidates fail \u2013 there are 130 groups working on the problem worldwide. With seven different categories of vaccine on trial and 20 candidates in the \u201cother\u201d category, Halton said the scientific community is doing well to get the \u201cmaximum shots on goal\u201d. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has backed 10 candidates, including one in Australia that could go to human trials as early as July. If a vaccine is identified, production should be \u201cglobally distributed\u201d to guard against \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d, she said. A vaccine is critical to returning to work, global trade and tourism, \u201cso if we have vaccine nationalism, and one country looks after itself first, and at the expense of the rest of the world, everyone is going to continue to suffer\u201d, Halton said. The World Health Organization is working out a list of \u201cpriority recipients\u201d including first-responder health workers, the elderly and immunocompromised. \u201cNow, this is hard, because it\u2019s going to require people to cooperate. \u201cAnd the urge for domestic priority, I think, will be very significant.\u201d After a country has produced a vaccine and served its \u201cvulnerable citizens\u201d it will need to determine \u201cwhat share of that is going to vulnerable people around the world at the same time\u201d, Halton said. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re all in it together. As soon as there is a vaccine, I fear that we \u2026 may not be quite all in this together as we have been.\u201d Halton, a member of the WHO board for three years, said she could \u201cunderstand the concerns of our friends in China\u201d about being blamed for Covid-19 but defended a proposed investigation into the zoonotic origins of the virus as the best way to prevent it from happening in the future. Halton, also a commissioner in Australia\u2019s national Covid-19 Coordination Commission, warned against complacency now Australia has begun to ease restrictions. She said a \u201cit\u2019s all good\u201d attitude would reduce social distancing and could cause a \u201creally bad outcome\u201d for the elderly and immunocompromised. Halton said the Australian states do not work in \u201chermetically sealed spheres\u201d and although she understood states being nervous about taking down internal border controls, she was \u201cnot convinced\u201d current border controls were the best way to manage risk. Halton also foreshadowed a greater role for the commission in planning Australia\u2019s economic recovery after the immediate challenges of ensuring enough personal protective equipment had been met. The commission\u2019s chairman, Nev Power, has publicly backed a fertiliser plant and spruiked natural gas\u2019s role in powering domestic manufacturing since taking the role. \u201cWe will turn our focus to what is actually going to get our economy kickstarted,\u201d Halton said. \u201cWhat we want to be able to see is an increase in productivity in our economy.

Bone arrived in France on 16 August 1916 at the height of the Somme offensive. He toured the Somme battlefields in the south and worked quickly in pencil, pen, charcoal and chalk and by 6 October had sent home approximately 150 finished drawings. Bone helped to establish the Imperial War Museum in 1917 and became a trustee in 1920. Image: Watching Our Artillery Fire on Tr\u00f4nes Wood From Montauban, 1918, Muirhead Bone, 2:A - During the first world war, Brighton\u2019s Royal Pavilion was converted into a hospital for wounded soldiers. It was used as a hospital for wounded Indian soldiers from 1914 to 1916. Fighting on the western front, the Indian army would urgently need medical facilities, however it was felt that the appropriate facilities were not available in France. The pavilion was one of three buildings in Brighton used for this purpose. Image: Interior of the Pavilion, Brighton: Indian Army Wounded, c.1917, CHH Burleigh (1869-1956) \u00a9 the artist\u2019s estate., 3:B - Ruby Loftus was an outstanding factory worker who had mastered complex engineering skills in a short space of time and was brought to the attention of the War Artist's Advisory Committee. Dame Laura Knight was commissioned to paint her at work. Industrial machinery was a new element in Knight's work, but her technical accuracy was praised in contemporary reports: Knight, like Loftus, was proving herself in a traditionally male environment. Image: Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring, 1943, Laura Knight (1877-1970), 4:B - Vital Signs is a photograph by Israeli artist Ori Gersht (b.1967) of Sarajevo taken after the end of the war in Bosnia. The image combines a feeling of optimism with the scars of war. There is mortar damage on the concrete wall above the pool, alluding to the far-reaching repercussions of conflict, but in contrast, the overall feeling is one of rejuvenation, of signs of normal life returning to the city. Image: Vital Signs, 1999, Ori Gersht \u00a9 IWM, 5:B - John Worsley was an official war artist and the only war artist to be captured during the second world war. He was detained at the German POW camp Marlag O. Red Cross parcels served a vital role in sustaining the morale of POWs. Marlag O was unusual in that parcels were pooled by officers and shared out centrally. The result was a more equitable distribution and an almost constant supply of extra food. Image: The Contents of a Red Cross Parcel, 1944, John Worsley (1919-2000), photo credit: IWM Art, 6:C - John Piper was commissioned in April 1940 to undertake a series of pictures of Air Raid Precaution control rooms. He was taken in great secrecy to see the ARP headquarters in Bristol. The strange lighting, graphics and colours created a modernist space which bore some affinity to the theatrical sets Piper had been designing before the war. This was one of his first war art commissions, but he did not find the subject particularly engaging. Image: The Passage to the Control Room at South-West Regional Headquarters, Bristol, 1940, John Piper (1903-1992), 7:D - During the first world war, there was a shortage of farm labour as men were conscripted into the forces. There was also a need to grow more food due to the threat to supplies caused by German submarines. This led to the establishment of the Women\u2019s Land Army in February 1917. In 1919, artist Cecil Aldin was commissioned to produce this painting by Imperial War Museum\u2019s Women\u2019s Work Committee. Image: A Land Girl Ploughing, c.1918, Cecil Aldin (1870-1935), photo credit: IWM Art, 8:B - James McBey was a self-taught, successful and respectable outsider in the art world. It seems entirely in keeping with this impression we have of the artist that, while recording everything he saw as he went through Palestine and Syria with the British Expeditionary Force between 1917 and 1918, he also chose to paint the portrait of another outsider, Lawrence of Arabia, albeit one who was rapidly becoming a celebrity.

Her concoction ends up destroying her marriage, poisoning the family dog and ultimately killing her.

Her imaginary birthday party is crashed by a rowdy group of dirtbags played by Mooney, Pete Davidson, Redd and Heidi Gardner, all rendered as uncanny humanoids.

Built entirely around the deceptively simple refrain of \u201cAw man, I\u2019m all outta cash!\u201d, the show went all out with a bit of ratcheting insanity, leaving the audience as out of breath as Mooney\u2019s poor, pathetic struggling actor.</p> <h2><strong>Gumby</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"gumby\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uNKL9MMbjNg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The funniest segment from the season\u2019s funniest episode came with the glorious return of Murphy\u2019s cigar-chomping green curmudgeon, Gumby (dammit!), who crashes a Weekend Update segment in order to berate the hosts (he dismisses Colin Jost as \u201cheadshot\u201d and Michael Che as \u201cyou black bastard\u201d) and demand respect.

      "body": "<p>More than half a million people have been given suicide prevention training in the last three weeks by a UK charity which is warning about the potential impact of Covid-19 on the nation\u2019s mental health.</p> <p>The Zero Suicide Alliance, a collaboration of NHS trusts, charities, businesses and individuals, revealed that 503,000 people had completed its online course, which aims to spot the signs that a person needs help, during lockdown.</p> <p>The recent surge in the numbers taking the free course means that more than 1 million people have completed the online suicide prevention training since the charity was founded in 2017.</p> <p>It comes after concerns were raised about the mental health of frontline workers tackling the coronavirus pandemic, with NHS England launching a hotline to support staff last month. In 2018, there were 6,507 suicides registered in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2018registrations\">according to the Office for National Statistics</a>, three-quarters of them among men.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/nhs-staff-mental-health-services-coronavirus-labour\">NHS staff need access to mental health services, says Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The alliance\u2019s co-founder and chair, Joe Rafferty, said the true impact of the coronavirus on mental health was not yet known but warned that \u201cthe stress and worry of the coronavirus is bound to have impacted people\u2019s mental health\u201d. Speaking to the BBC, he added: \u201cSuicide is a serious public health issue and every single death by suicide devastates families, friends and communities.\u201d</p> <p>The charity\u2019s online training, which takes around 20 minutes and is funded in part by the Department of Health and Social Care, takes participants through how to help someone who may be considering killing themselves, as well as tackling the stigma around suicide and encouraging open dialogue.

      "bodyText": "More than half a million people have been given suicide prevention training in the last three weeks by a UK charity which is warning about the potential impact of Covid-19 on the nation\u2019s mental health. The Zero Suicide Alliance, a collaboration of NHS trusts, charities, businesses and individuals, revealed that 503,000 people had completed its online course, which aims to spot the signs that a person needs help, during lockdown. The recent surge in the numbers taking the free course means that more than 1 million people have completed the online suicide prevention training since the charity was founded in 2017. It comes after concerns were raised about the mental health of frontline workers tackling the coronavirus pandemic, with NHS England launching a hotline to support staff last month. In 2018, there were 6,507 suicides registered in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics, three-quarters of them among men. The alliance\u2019s co-founder and chair, Joe Rafferty, said the true impact of the coronavirus on mental health was not yet known but warned that \u201cthe stress and worry of the coronavirus is bound to have impacted people\u2019s mental health\u201d. Speaking to the BBC, he added: \u201cSuicide is a serious public health issue and every single death by suicide devastates families, friends and communities.\u201d The charity\u2019s online training, which takes around 20 minutes and is funded in part by the Department of Health and Social Care, takes participants through how to help someone who may be considering killing themselves, as well as tackling the stigma around suicide and encouraging open dialogue. A shorter introduction module, taking up to 10 minutes, is also available. In a letter sent earlier this month to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the shadow minister for mental health, Rosena Allin-Khan, a doctor, said staff needed access to post-traumatic stress disorder support and talking therapies, and that monitoring for increased suicide risk should be put in place. \u201cNHS and care staff are breaking down \u2013 I see it first-hand, working shifts. It is simply heartbreaking to see the toll this virus is taking on our frontline staff,\u201d she said. It came after a mental health hotline, open between 7am and 11pm, for NHS staff was launched last month. Health workers are able to call or text the free number, which is staffed by specially trained volunteers. The NHS Clinical Leaders Network, a professional network for clinicians in England, is warning that the pandemic is likely to prompt an increase in mental health problems for frontline health workers which needs to be prepared for. In a paper released on Monday, the group said that past outbreaks showed \u201cwe can expect notable increases in mental ill health and related issues for frontline workers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. It added: \u201cWhile preventing the spread of Covid-19 is still a public health priority, we\u2019re saying that this emergency will also leave a mental health legacy in its wake, a legacy that could inflict a damaging toll on NHS and other frontline staff as well as the public at large.\u201d The group added that urgent action was needed so health leaders did not \u201cwait until this problem is upon us\u201d. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d</p> <p>At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base.</p> <h2>The state that decides Trump\u2019s win</h2> <p>As part of his nascent return to the campaign trail during the pandemic, Trump made a trip to Snover\u2019s backyard, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, last week. He visited a medical equipment distributor and blasted Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for not easing virus mitigation measures sooner.</p> <p>\u201cNext year is going to be through the roof,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they have \u2013 they want to keep them closed. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7162af3d041d73955ac2ee8f764eb92ecfb5a80c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7162af3d041d73955ac2ee8f764eb92ecfb5a80c/0_0_5003_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters gather to welcome Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters gather to welcome Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Smith/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was only Trump\u2019s second outing since the pandemic hit, and the venue was carefully chosen. Northampton, which borders Allentown and is the subject of an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-promise\">Guardian series</a>, was one of only three counties statewide to vote twice for Barack Obama before falling for Trump in 2016; handing him the massive electoral prize of Pennsylvania \u2013 and the presidency.</p> <p>If Trump can win here again, political analysts say, he has a good chance of holding the White House.</p> <p>Christopher Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, said that the pandemic does not appear to have changed the race for Trump much in the Lehigh Valley.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this enormous thing happening, I don\u2019t see clear indicators that the race itself has changed here, in the sense that there\u2019s been only some modest movement in polls\u201d in recent months, Borick said. \u201cWhile the world has changed since the onset of the pandemic, the political calculus hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re lucky to get a president like him\u2019</h2> <p>Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 79, who has cut hair in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for more than 50 years, was also struck by tragedy this spring, when one of his best friends died from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHe and his wife caught a cold,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cHe was perfectly healthy, this was six weeks ago. She caught a cold, he caught a cold, so he said to his wife, \u2018I just can\u2019t breathe right\u2019. So they go to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>His friend fought for a week. \u201cWhen you talk about two people from Minnesota that died from it, they\u2019re just statistics,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re close to you, then you realize how real this thing is.\u201d</p> <p>Like a lot of older Democrats in a town that was once home to the legendary \u2013 and heavily unionized \u2013 Bethlehem Steel, D\u2019Ambrosio voted for both parties over the years before coming out as an early and enthusiastic Trump supporter. That support has not changed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019re so lucky that at this time in our life, we were able to get a president like him, at the right time,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protestor wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He dismissed criticism that Trump had made the country complacent by advising that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he did was damage control,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cPeople were starting to panic, buying everything, emptying the stores. He got it to calm down.\u201d</p> <p>Pennsylvania has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, mostly in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Last week Wolf announced an additional $16m in funding for food banks, where people have <a href=\"https://www.wtae.com/article/pennsylvanias-food-banks-getting-dollar16-million-in-funding/32196590\">queued up before dawn</a>, after the state shed about 2m jobs from mid-March onwards.</p> <p>Bruce Haines, a former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem, a crown jewel of the local tourism industry, said business had plunged.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like you turned off a lightbulb,\u201d Haines said on the phone from Florida. \u201cThe cancellation calls the week of 9 March were incredible. And it hit us blindly, because we were coming off our best year ever in 2019.\u201d</p> <p>Haines praised Trump\u2019s move to reopen the economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s right on target, and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd anybody who\u2019s a businessman knows that Trump\u2019s the right guy there, to bring us out of this downturn. Because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201d</p> <h2>A downward trend</h2> <p>Peg Ferraro, a Republican official popular with Democrats who for years was the only woman on the county council, retired last year and also spoke on the phone from Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, where you\u2019ve never been through it really before,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cI think he was absolutely correct in leaving it up to the governors \u2013 they know their states better than making blanket statements for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania last Thursday represented a headache for Wolf, who is in an escalating war with Republican officials over reopening the state county by county. True to a national pattern, Republicans from more rural districts in the state are less likely to see the pandemic as dangerous than Democrats, Borick said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a/0_0_4931_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump could still lose in the Lehigh Valley. Public approval of his handling of the coronavirus crisis has plunged nationally from about 50% in late March to just over 40% now, with about 55% disapproving, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/public_approval_of_president_trumps_handling_of_the_coronavirus-7088.html\">according to polling averages</a>. While there is plenty of time before the election to reverse that slide, polling in Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/pennsylvania/\"> shows a similar trend</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016 in Northampton county was narrow, spurred by record turnout. And his opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton, was disliked by voters in a way that Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, who grew up in Pennsylvania, does not appear to be.</p> <p>The unique logistics of the fall election could also go a long way in deciding the victor here, Borick said.

      "bodyText": "Few people understand the terrible cost of the coronavirus like Lee Snover, a Republican party chair in one of the key swing counties that could determine whether Donald Trump is re-elected as president in November. Snover, who helped deliver an upset victory for Trump in 2016 in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, lost her father to the virus this spring. Her husband fell critically ill, too, spending 17 days in an intensive care unit before recovering. Her mother, a cancer survivor, was also in intensive care for eight days before emerging. \u201cIt spread through my entire family,\u201d Snover said. Trump stands accused of driving up the coronavirus death toll by downplaying the public health threat and urging the country to \u201creopen\u201d too quickly. But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family. \u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base. The state that decides Trump\u2019s win As part of his nascent return to the campaign trail during the pandemic, Trump made a trip to Snover\u2019s backyard, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, last week. He visited a medical equipment distributor and blasted Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for not easing virus mitigation measures sooner. \u201cNext year is going to be through the roof,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they have \u2013 they want to keep them closed. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d It was only Trump\u2019s second outing since the pandemic hit, and the venue was carefully chosen. Northampton, which borders Allentown and is the subject of an ongoing Guardian series, was one of only three counties statewide to vote twice for Barack Obama before falling for Trump in 2016; handing him the massive electoral prize of Pennsylvania \u2013 and the presidency. If Trump can win here again, political analysts say, he has a good chance of holding the White House. Christopher Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, said that the pandemic does not appear to have changed the race for Trump much in the Lehigh Valley. \u201cDespite this enormous thing happening, I don\u2019t see clear indicators that the race itself has changed here, in the sense that there\u2019s been only some modest movement in polls\u201d in recent months, Borick said. \u201cWhile the world has changed since the onset of the pandemic, the political calculus hasn\u2019t.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re lucky to get a president like him\u2019 Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 79, who has cut hair in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for more than 50 years, was also struck by tragedy this spring, when one of his best friends died from the virus. \u201cHe and his wife caught a cold,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cHe was perfectly healthy, this was six weeks ago. She caught a cold, he caught a cold, so he said to his wife, \u2018I just can\u2019t breathe right\u2019. So they go to the hospital.\u201d His friend fought for a week. \u201cWhen you talk about two people from Minnesota that died from it, they\u2019re just statistics,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re close to you, then you realize how real this thing is.\u201d Like a lot of older Democrats in a town that was once home to the legendary \u2013 and heavily unionized \u2013 Bethlehem Steel, D\u2019Ambrosio voted for both parties over the years before coming out as an early and enthusiastic Trump supporter. That support has not changed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019re so lucky that at this time in our life, we were able to get a president like him, at the right time,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. He dismissed criticism that Trump had made the country complacent by advising that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d. \u201cWhat he did was damage control,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cPeople were starting to panic, buying everything, emptying the stores. He got it to calm down.\u201d Pennsylvania has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, mostly in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Last week Wolf announced an additional $16m in funding for food banks, where people have queued up before dawn, after the state shed about 2m jobs from mid-March onwards. Bruce Haines, a former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem, a crown jewel of the local tourism industry, said business had plunged. \u201cIt was like you turned off a lightbulb,\u201d Haines said on the phone from Florida. \u201cThe cancellation calls the week of 9 March were incredible. And it hit us blindly, because we were coming off our best year ever in 2019.\u201d Haines praised Trump\u2019s move to reopen the economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s right on target, and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd anybody who\u2019s a businessman knows that Trump\u2019s the right guy there, to bring us out of this downturn. Because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201d A downward trend Peg Ferraro, a Republican official popular with Democrats who for years was the only woman on the county council, retired last year and also spoke on the phone from Florida. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, where you\u2019ve never been through it really before,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cI think he was absolutely correct in leaving it up to the governors \u2013 they know their states better than making blanket statements for everybody.\u201d Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania last Thursday represented a headache for Wolf, who is in an escalating war with Republican officials over reopening the state county by county. True to a national pattern, Republicans from more rural districts in the state are less likely to see the pandemic as dangerous than Democrats, Borick said. Trump could still lose in the Lehigh Valley. Public approval of his handling of the coronavirus crisis has plunged nationally from about 50% in late March to just over 40% now, with about 55% disapproving, according to polling averages. While there is plenty of time before the election to reverse that slide, polling in Pennsylvania shows a similar trend. Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016 in Northampton county was narrow, spurred by record turnout. And his opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton, was disliked by voters in a way that Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, who grew up in Pennsylvania, does not appear to be. The unique logistics of the fall election could also go a long way in deciding the victor here, Borick said. Just last year, Pennsylvania for the first time approved absentee voting for everyone, potentially throwing the advantage in November to the party that shows better organization at standing up vote-by-mail and at getting people to the polls amid a potential second pandemic wave. And for all the president\u2019s support in the region, there is a resistance to Trump that is as galvanized as his base. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t run a one-car funeral,\u201d said Frank Behum, a former unionized steelworker and vocal Trump critic. \u201cEven my Republican friends, they\u2019re telling me they\u2019re not voting for that clown again. But you don\u2019t know \u2013 remember in the 1980s, people said they\u2019re not voting for Reagan either. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Intu Properties, one of Britain\u2019s biggest shopping centre operators, is seeking standstill agreements from its lenders as it battles for survival after a collapse in rent payments from retailers. The company, which owns Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, said it was likely to breach its debt commitments at the end of June as the stock market turmoil and downturn in the property market made it impossible to raise new funds. It is the latest warning from the debt-laden company, which was struggling before the Covid-19 crisis. Intu\u2019s centres will remain largely closed until at least 1 June, with only essential stores such as supermarkets and pharmacies currently allowed to open under the UK\u2019s coronavirus restrictions. The company has furloughed 60% of staff in its malls and 20% at its head office. More retailers are expected to open shops again from next month, according to the government plan to reopen the economy, however Intu said that the \u201cspeed of recovery once the UK comes out of lockdown\u201d remained unclear. The company is seeking standstill agreements from its creditors, meaning it would not have to pay back what it has borrowed until the end of 2021. In addition, it is looking for a pay-if-you-can interest agreement, to provide it with some stability until the property market settles. It had previously secured waivers from some lenders to prevent breaches of its debt commitments until 26 June. Intu said it could not guarantee that its creditors would accept its plans: \u201cThere can of course be no certainty as to whether any standstill can be achieved with all or some of the group\u2019s creditors, or as to the terms,\u201d the firm said. \u201cWhile the standstill is the primary focus, it is possible that earlier individual breaches, under certain of the group\u2019s financings, could occur over the coming weeks and the group will seek to address such instances as part of the wider discussions.\u201d Intu, like other retail landlords, has seen a collapse in the amount of rent received from its tenants since the start of the coronavirus crisis, many of whose stores remain closed. The company said at the start of the month it had collected 40% of the rent due by the end of March, up from 29% collected on the due date. It has also vowed to get tough with large well-capitalised tenants who are refusing to pay their rent. Intu has not ruled out potentially taking legal action for non-payment, although this is temporarily banned by the government. Even before the pandemic, Intu was struggling because of changes to the retail industry, as shoppers have moved online, and due to its \u00a34.5bn debt pile. Some of its biggest tenants, so-called \u201canchors\u201d including House of Fraser and Topshop\u2019s owner, Arcadia, have closed stores or requested rent reductions, while in April Debenhams collapsed into administration for the second time in a year. In March, Intu was forced to write down the value of its centres by nearly \u00a32bn, as the estimated value of its property portfolio dropped 22% in 2019 to \u00a36.6bn. \u201cEven before Covid-19 there was speculation that there would be around a 20% average devaluation on some of their assets,\u201d said Jonathan de Mello, a property analyst. \u201cWe have seen administrations of retailers because of this crisis, and the loss of anchor stores too, so valuations could be hit substantially more that, and could be potentially 20% or 40% [lower]\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Major League Baseball is still looking for ways to get its season underway, nearly two months after the campaign should have started. South Korea and Taiwan have already resumed baseball without fans during the Covid-19 pandemic, and MLB reportedly envisions <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29183345/mlb-safety-proposal-includes-10000-tests-per-week-social-distancing?platform=amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true\">an 82-game season beginning in early July</a>. But for that to happen, the owners and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) need to reach a labor agreement encompassing everything from salary distribution to testing guidelines to suitable playing facilities.</p> <p>This week, MLB owners approved a plan that would pay players a percentage of their 2020 salaries based on a 50-50 split between players and owners of MLB\u2019s revenue from the regular season and postseason. That is a non-starter for the players union, which refuses to agree to any deal that they feel represents a salary cap.</p> <p>So what exactly are the disagreements between the owners and players? And will those differences imperil any chance at the 2020 season?</p> <p><strong>Why are the players upset?</strong></p> <p>The players feel like they are being asked to inherit all the risk while making most of the financial sacrifices.

This week, however, the owners proposed a 50-50 revenue split \u2013 which would mean even less money for the players \u2013 because of the major losses they\u2019re taking without attendance.

      "bodyText": "Disabled people and their carers are being put at risk of catching coronavirus by returning to the workplace after being missed off the government\u2019s vulnerable list, the Guardian has learned. As Britain edges back to work, employers are understood to be denying some disabled people and carers paid leave to remain at home if they cannot provide a letter from the government showing proof of vulnerability, despite being at high risk from coronavirus or caring for someone who is. The government\u2019s register for extremely vulnerable people, which has previously been criticised for excluding a number of high-risk disabilities, is primarily designed to help signpost the need for food support. But it has emerged some employers are using the list as a condition for allowing employees to take paid leave. Disabled people and carers who were not on the list told the Guardian they had been required to go into work by their employer or face dismissal when they could not show proof of vulnerability, with one worker forced to self-isolate between shifts in order to protect their disabled child. They included key workers such as a teacher and a supermarket assistant. Harry Banes* has primary progressive multiple sclerosis but is having to go to work as a petrol station attendant. \u201cThe manager [has] little regard for social distancing.

However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says employers have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people if it is less safe for them to go to work than their non-disabled colleagues. This comes after researchers warned 8 million people with underlying health conditions should be exempt from plans to get the country back to work, amid fears that they would catch the virus. Most of those are not considered clinically \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d by the Department of Health and Social Care, and so instructed to shield entirely for 12 weeks, but are still highly vulnerable to coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "Cellphone location data suggests that demonstrators at anti-lockdown protests \u2013 some of which have been connected with Covid-19 cases \u2013 are often traveling hundreds of miles to events, returning to all parts of their states, and even crossing into neighboring ones. The data, provided to the Guardian by the progressive campaign group the Committee to Protect Medicare, raises the prospect that the protests will play a role in spreading the coronavirus epidemic to areas which have, so far, experienced relatively few infections. The anonymized location data was captured from opt-in cellphone apps, and data scientists at the firm VoteMap used it to determine the movements of devices present at protests in late April and early May in five states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado and Florida. They then created visualizations that tracked the movements of those devices up to 48 hours after the conclusion of protests. The visualizations only show movements within states, due to the queries analysts made in creating them. But the data scientist Jeremy Fair, executive-vice president of VoteMap, says that many of the devices that are seen to reach state borders are seen to continue across them in the underlying raw data. One visualization shows that in Lansing, Michigan, after a 30 April protest in which armed protesters stormed the capitol building and state police were forced to physically block access to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, devices which had been present at the protest site can be seen returning to all parts of the state, from Detroit to remote towns in the state\u2019s north. One device visible in the data traveled to and from Afton, which is over 180 miles from the capital. Others reached, and some crossed, the Indiana border. In the 48 hours following a 19 April \u201cOperation Gridlock\u201d protest in Denver, devices reached the borders of neighboring states including Wyoming, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Utah. In Florida on 18 April, devices returned to all parts of the peninsula and up to the Georgia border. In Wisconsin on 24 April, devices returned to smaller towns like Green Bay and Wausau, and the borders of Minnesota and Illinois. Following the initial wave of anti-lockdown protests in April, epidemiologists warned that they could lead to a new surge in cases. In North Carolina in late April, one of the leaders of the state\u2019s anti-lockdown protests tested positive for Covid-19 but said she would attend future rallies.

Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it\u2019s easier to maintain safe distancing.<br><br>Founded in 2002, K\u00fcrten\u2019s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/meat-plant-workers-us-coronavirus-war\">fewer and bigger</a>. \u201cWe are doing the exact opposite,\u201d K\u00fcrten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. \u201cAnd it\u2019s working really well.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers\u2019 specifications \u2013 often, as is the case today, with their help.</p> <p>At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. \u201cThis means they are calm,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don\u2019t understand what is happening at all.\u201d</p> <p>This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses K\u00fcrten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. \u201cThe animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields \u2026 They aren\u2019t driving off in a truck,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/eus-live-export-trade-puts-welfare-of-millions-of-animals-at-risk-report\">EU's live export trade puts welfare of millions of animals at risk \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Francesca Porta of the advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals adds: \u201cIt solves the problem of the stress of loading into a truck, the long journey to a slaughterhouse, and the unloading where the animal doesn\u2019t know where it is and then has to wait [for slaughter].\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year the Guardian reported that as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/something-is-wrong-meps-say-eu-is-failing-to-regulate-live-animal-exports\">the live animal export trade</a> booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players.</p> <p>\u201cIn Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,\u201d says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/animals-and-animal-products/animal-products/pork_en\">three companies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365/0_77_3000_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"K\u00fcrten's van with two dogs relaxing in front\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smaller slaughter companies struggle to compete against the handful of big players in Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harwart/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,\u201d says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. \u201cMore and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.\u201d</p> <p>K\u00fcrten is not slaughtering any animals today, but when he does the farmer is usually present. His methods differ depending on the animal: a bolt gun for cattle, electric stunning for pigs and sheep. He remembers the butcher visiting his family farm when he was younger, and the village shops that slaughtered animals themselves rather than have meat delivered. Since starting his training at 16, he has witnessed the industry reconfigure: \u201cI worked [back then] in a small shop \u2013 but these aren\u2019t around any more.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a feeling in our bones and hearts that there is something wrong with the system</p> <footer> <cite>Matthias Wolfschmidt, Foodwatch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\">EU </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> hygiene </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> regulations</a> that came into force in 2006. K\u00fcrten was able to find enough investment to ensure his business could comply with the new standards but many, he recalls, gave up. And while he still feels the pressure of high costs \u2013 including machinery and vets to oversee slaughter \u2013 K\u00fcrten says the business keeps growing. He\u2019s booked up months ahead.</p> <p>K\u00fcrten points to the <em>Natur Fleisch</em> (natural meat) stickers on the packages.

      "bodyText": "Inside the white trailer parked up by the farm, the small team headed by Matthias K\u00fcrten are moving fast. Their work has a rhythmical soundtrack: a bandsaw cutting through bones, fat slopped into buckets, murmurs of chatter and knives being sharpened. Diced meat for stew, steaks, soup stock, mince and liver are sealed with the inhale of a vacuum-packer, stamped by a sticker machine, and land in plastic crates with a thud. Ten days earlier K\u00fcrten had come to the farm and slaughtered seven cows and calves; the carcasses are hanging in a nearby cooling wagon. Now his team are back to process the meat. K\u00fcrten, a softly spoken man with a ready laugh, is Germany\u2019s only mobile butcher: a one-stop shop for livestock slaughter and meat processing. In Germany, slaughterhouses \u2013 as they are in the US and elsewhere in Europe \u2013 are increasingly being seen as coronavirus hotspots, as hundreds of workers have tested positive across the country in recent weeks. A plant in Dissen, Lower Saxony, is the latest to close after 92 workers tested positive. The cases have thrown the industry into the spotlight \u2013 particularly the close working and living conditions for employees. The federal government will this week discuss stricter measures to reduce the spread of the virus. But so far the coronavirus hasn\u2019t impacted K\u00fcrten\u2019s business. \u201cWe actually have more work,\u201d he says. \u201cOur customers are buying more.\u201d Partly he thinks people want to stock up and buy more to distribute among friends to help them out. Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it\u2019s easier to maintain safe distancing. Founded in 2002, K\u00fcrten\u2019s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting fewer and bigger. \u201cWe are doing the exact opposite,\u201d K\u00fcrten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. \u201cAnd it\u2019s working really well.\u201d Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers\u2019 specifications \u2013 often, as is the case today, with their help. At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. \u201cThis means they are calm,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don\u2019t understand what is happening at all.\u201d This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses K\u00fcrten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. \u201cThe animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields \u2026 They aren\u2019t driving off in a truck,\u201d she says. Francesca Porta of the advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals adds: \u201cIt solves the problem of the stress of loading into a truck, the long journey to a slaughterhouse, and the unloading where the animal doesn\u2019t know where it is and then has to wait [for slaughter].\u201d Earlier this year the Guardian reported that as the live animal export trade booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players. \u201cIn Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,\u201d says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just three companies. \u201cIt became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,\u201d says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. \u201cMore and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.\u201d K\u00fcrten is not slaughtering any animals today, but when he does the farmer is usually present. His methods differ depending on the animal: a bolt gun for cattle, electric stunning for pigs and sheep. He remembers the butcher visiting his family farm when he was younger, and the village shops that slaughtered animals themselves rather than have meat delivered. Since starting his training at 16, he has witnessed the industry reconfigure: \u201cI worked [back then] in a small shop \u2013 but these aren\u2019t around any more.\u201d He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the EU hygiene regulations that came into force in 2006. K\u00fcrten was able to find enough investment to ensure his business could comply with the new standards but many, he recalls, gave up. And while he still feels the pressure of high costs \u2013 including machinery and vets to oversee slaughter \u2013 K\u00fcrten says the business keeps growing. He\u2019s booked up months ahead. K\u00fcrten points to the Natur Fleisch (natural meat) stickers on the packages. It describes, he says, the personal relationships between the customer, farm and butcher, and that the product comes from animals \u201cthat in the summer are able to stand in the field\u201d. \u201cAn email is sent out saying a cow has been slaughtered and five hours later everything will be sold,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this is sent locally, among a circle of friends and acquaintances \u2013 not throughout Germany.\u201d Nothing, he\u2019s happy to say, ends up in the supermarket. In recent years the German slaughterhouse industry has been criticised for low pay and poor working conditions, particularly for the thousands of eastern European migrant workers it employs. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges for the slaughter industry today, as it will be in the next 10\u201315 years, is finding enough staff,\u201d says Thomas Bernhard, from the German Union of Food and Catering. In a series of interviews with German slaughterhouse workers, sociologist Marcel Sebastian at the Europa-Universit\u00e4t Flensburg, documented how they perceived the cultural shift from honest craft to source of moral stigma. \u201cThey struggled with this dramatic shift in public perception,\u201d says Sebastian. While many see him as a curious niche, K\u00fcrten remains optimistic. Dozens of red crates are filling up in preparation for tomorrow\u2019s customers \u2013 a startling amount from a few animals. K\u00fcrten finds particular satisfaction in wasting as little as possible. Shiva, his portly dog, follows him as he works, eagerly awaiting scraps. K\u00fcrten works six days a week, and it will be dusk before he attaches the trailer to his car and drives home to his second rottweiler, Achilles. Is he concerned about more people rejecting meat altogether in the future? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we were only producing half \u2013 or a third \u2013 [of the meat] we do now then we would be doing it right. We already have too much. A little bit less would be good.\u201d",

But first of all, it should be led by WHO rather than any country or regional organization. Second, the investigation needs to be scientific and fair. Not only China-related factors, but also those related to the US and other countries need to be included. Earlier confirmed cases than the previously known first infected case have continuously been found in the US. Among those diagnosed as having flu last winter, how many were coronavirus infections? All these clues shouldn\u2019t be missed.</p> \n   <p>Investigating the origin of the virus is only one part of the coronavirus fight. The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA? It is the US that should feel it failed the international community.</p> \n   <p><strong>The proposal that will eventually be adopted by the assembly will not be one that only meets US requests. No matter where the virus originated, the challenge is for all people around the world.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we are going to leave the live blog for this evening. If you need to catch up on the biggest news of the day you can read the summary here. Or in a shorter way: Australia reported its 99th confirmed death of a coronavirus patient NSW students will return to classrooms full-time from 25 May Australia has the backing of 122 nations for a global investigation into the Covid-19 outbreak Twelve McDonald\u2019s outlets in Melbourne\u2019s north and west have been shut due to a delivery driver testing positive for coronavirus New strict transport rules in NSW will mean a maximum of 12 people on a bus at one time, 32 in a train carriage, and 45 on a ferry Labor leader Anthony Albanese has backed reducing jobseeker below its current level but higher than the former newstart payment. Our international live blog will take you through the night for all the latest global coronavirus news. The Victorian department of health has confirmed the previous statement from the Villa Maria nursing home on a second test that the resident who initially had inconclusive test results for coronavirus has now tested negative. Students in New South Wales will be in classrooms full-time from Monday 25 May. I\u2019ve confirmed reporting by Nine and the ABC this evening. Most students in the state are currently at one day in classrooms per week. Premier Gladys Berejiklian is set to announce the change tomorrow. The ABC is reporting that students in NSW will return to classrooms full-time from Monday. They say premier Gladys Berejiklian will announce the change tomorrow. On the NSW-Queensland border closure until September, Kelly says the national cabinet has never provided advice on domestic borders, just the national border. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed it has been necessary to shut them down.\u201d He says it is a decision for the state government. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said the border between the two states will likely remain closed until September. He says national cabinet has discussed how reopening borders would fit into the three-step plan, and notes that yesterday there were more cases in Queensland than NSW. But he repeats it is ultimately a decision for the Queensland government. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is on ABC\u2019s RN Drive. He\u2019s asked about the decision to scale back the number of briefings to three times a week. He says they\u2019re still available to answer questions, but there\u2019s just less going on. At some of the last few briefings, he says just one journalist has turned up. Aboriginal health organisations say the Queensland government is holding back a $3.3m national rollout of rapid Covid-19 testing in remote Aboriginal communities, putting concerns for health worker safety ahead of conducting what they say is a \u201cgold standard\u201d test endorsed by the World Health Organization and already being used in other states and territories. I\u2019m Josh Taylor, I\u2019ll be taking you through the live blog for the rest of the evening. Thanks to my colleague Calla Wahlquist for her efforts this afternoon. Villa Maria Catholic Homes has released a statement saying that a resident of their Bundoora home did not return a positive test result to Covid-19. The test was inconclusive, but all inconclusive tests are being treated as positive by the Victorian health department. VMCH said a subsequent test was negative, but the home\u2019s still locked down. Here\u2019s the full statement: Over the weekend a resident at VMCH Bundoora Aged Care Residence was admitted to hospital with a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius. As this is a symptom of COVID-19, the resident was tested, with the initial test results being inconclusive (neither negative nor positive). The Department of Health is currently treating all inconclusive results as positive. As a result, the entire residence is now in lockdown until the Public Health Unit advises us this can end. The resident has subsequently returned home, as they are no longer displaying any symptoms. Further testing has produced a negative result, however the Department of Health are taking precautionary measures and have requested two more negative test results, to be undertaken 48 hours apart. Family members have been informed and all residents and staff are being closely monitored. All residents who have had close contact with the person are now in isolation within our residence. Staff who have had close contact with the person are in self-isolation at home. All other staff are being tested for COVID-19. Should any signs of ill health appear, we will seek medical attention immediately. On that note I will hand over to my colleague Josh Taylor who will take you through the evening. Imagine the sadness of swinging by to pick up a sausage and egg McMuffin, and seeing this sign. About 1,000 people work across the 12 McDonald\u2019s stores that were closed for deep cleaning. Of those, several hundred have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days because they were on shift when the delivery driver attended the restaurant, or worked shifts after the driver\u2019s visit. South Australia has also recorded no new cases of Covid-19. Again. The last person with the last active case of Covid-19 in SA was declared recovered on Friday. The state hasn\u2019t recorded a new case since 7 May, and before that it had 14 days with no new cases. Is it any wonder states like SA and WA don\u2019t want to play with states like Victoria and NSW? Western Australia recorded no new cases of Covid-19 overnight and currently has just three active cases. Let\u2019s go back to that Victorian update now. Victoria has recorded eight new Covid-19 cases overnight. There was a bit of double-counting so the total has only increased by six, to 1,567 of which 161 are confirmed to be cases of community transmission. One of the new cases was the residents of the Villa Maria aged care facility in Bundoora, mentioned earlier. Another one was the delivery driver whose positive test led to the closure of 12 McDonald\u2019s restaurants throughout Melbourne today. The driver was a contact of a case from the McDonald\u2019s Fawkner cluster, which now stands at 12 cases. Another case was a close contact of a person in the Sunshine Hospital outbreak, bringing the number of cases in that outbreak to three. Three more cases were returned travellers in mandatory quarantine, and two are under investigation. There were no new cases linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak, which stands at 99. The most telling line out of Kelly\u2019s press conference came right at the end \u2014 instead of daily briefings, the office of the national chief medical officer will now only be doing a press briefing on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. They have been doing daily briefings since early March. What if a vaccine for Covid-19 is developed and some people refuse to get it? Kelly says he is \u201cnot in favour of compulsory vaccination\u201d in cases of conscientious objection, but that he was sure there would be a \u201cvery strong uptake\u201d of a Covid-19 vaccine if one becomes available. Given how much we\u2019ve seen and the devastation that this virus has caused around the world, that people will be queuing up for vaccination rather than the opposite. Isn\u2019t there a risk that could create a pocket of anti-vaxxers in which the virus could spread? Kelly: There\u2019s always a pocket of people that are against vaccinations. What I\u2019ve found, though, in these sort of circumstances, where there has been death and severe illness, people are much more attuned to getting the vaccine than previously. We\u2019ve noticed, for example, almost double the number of flu vaccines have been delivered and injected already in this year compared with last year. And I think that\u2019s part of this sort of general sense that vaccination is a good thing. He was also asked about the risk to Australia of not being able to access a Covid-19 vaccine, if a successful vaccine is developed elsewhere first. One of the nine vaccine candidates is being developed in Australia. Kelly says Australia needs to guard against vaccine nationalism, because the virus does not know borders. We may not win the race, but we\u2019re part of the race, and we will be looking to develop a vaccine herein Australia. If it isn\u2019t the first vaccine that\u2019s available, we\u2019ll be looking to join that effort to vaccinate people \u2014 it\u2019s really important that we do that in a way that is global, because infections don\u2019t know borders. Let\u2019s go back to the deputy national chief medical officer, Paul Kelly. He was asked about the motion of inquiry which will go before the World Health Assembly tonight. (You can read an explainer on that here.) The motion of inquiry does not explicitly mention China. Kelly said that does not weaken the process. I think the most important thing \u2014 rather than apportioning blame to one particular country or another country \u2014 is that we get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened. And part of that is about the origin, where this virus came from \u2013 as we understand it, to be a zoonotic disease, spread from an animal or animals into humans \u2013 I think that\u2019s an important component of it. But there is much that\u2019s happened with this pandemic since the beginning and I think, looking at the entire way that it has spread so rapidly around the world and what\u2019s happened in different countries in the ways that different countries have approached that problem will be part of that investigation. And I hope that that resolution will be successful. One of the six new cases of Covid-19 reported overnight in Victoria is a resident at a Melbourne aged care home, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton has said. Sutton said there has been a single case detected at the Villa Maria Aged Care facility in Bundoora, in Melbourne\u2019s north. The resident is being well cared for and has been isolated in their room since developing mild symptoms. Staff have been using full PPE to care for the resident since they developed symptoms. Comprehensive contact tracing is under way and testing of all staff and residents will take place over the coming days. Residents and families are all being informed, and the department is working closely with the facility to ensure appropriate public health actions have been taken, including isolation, quarantine and cleaning. Kelly is asked to weigh in on the decision of some states \u2013 every state except Victoria, New South Wales, and the ACT, basically \u2013 to keep their domestic borders closed despite a flattening of the curve and easing of other restrictions. Kelly notes that the national cabinet, and national health advisors, never recommended internal state borders be closed. That\u2019s been a decision by various states, and it will be their decision as to whether to open them. But if you look at when those decisions were made \u2013 some weeks ago \u2013 we had a rapidly increasing number of cases each day right around Australia, but particularly in the south-eastern corner of the nation. When you look at what\u2019s happening now with just very few cases, only just over 100 cases in the last week, and only 11 in the last 24 hours \u2014 I think that things have changed a lot. But that\u2019ll be a decision for those states that have closed borders. Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia, the NT and Queensland introduced border restrictions in late March, at the peak of Australia\u2019s daily incidence rate and after all had imported a bunch of cases from the Ruby Princess\u2019s bungled arrival in Sydney. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, is addressing the media in Canberra now. Here are the latest numbers: There are 7,060 reported cases of Covid-19 in Australia Ninety-nine people have died Fewer than 700 of those recorded cases are still active \u2014 most people have recovered Forty-five people remain in hospital, 12 in intensive care and seven on ventilators. More than 1m Covid-19 tests have been conducted, and fewer than 1% of those tests are positive Kelly says the virus curve in Australia \u201ccertainly is very flat at the moment and remaining so, but we\u2019re watching very carefully because of the changes in restrictions that have occurred in the last week or so around Australia\u201d. He says he expects to see \u201csmall outbreaks going forward\u201d as restrictions are released. Network Ten\u2019s online news site, 10 Daily, will close at the end of the week, leaving 20 editorial staff out of work. It comes four days after BuzzFeed jettisoned its Australian news team, making five editorial staff redundant. More than 150 Australian newsrooms have closed since January last year. Like most online news outlets, 10 Daily had been smashing its performance targets since the coronavirus pandemic began. The pandemic has also hit ad revenue, but ViacomCBS Australia and New Zealand\u2019s chief content officer, Beverly McGarvey, said told staff the closure was not solely due to that. The recent impact of Covid-19 on the media industry has reinforced the need to continue to align our business with our evolving customer needs and global business model, but I want to stress that the changes are part of our broader strategy, not a reaction to recent events. Read Matilda Boseley\u2019s full story here: Thanks to Amy Remeikis for holding our hand through the day so far. While we wait for deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly, let\u2019s look to Western Australia, where the government has established a formal conciliation service to help tenants negotiate with their landlords about coronavirus-related tenancy disputes. You\u2019ll recall that the national cabinet resolved on 29 March that there should be a 6-month moratorium on evictions due to non-payment of rent, but the actual enforcement of that resolution has been left up to the states. Consumer Protection WA today announced the establishment of the Residential Tenancies Mandatory Conciliation Service, which aims to help \u201call sides to reach a fair and achievable solution through informal discussion\u201d. The mandatory conciliation service is tied to legislation that enforces the six-month moratorium on evictions and rent increases. Here\u2019s general manager, Trish Blake. It\u2019s a relaxed environment and gives people the power to choose the outcome in a non-adversarial setting. If you are involved in a dispute being conciliated by the service, you must take part in the process. This means you have to at least talk to the conciliator and be involved in a discussion with your landlord or tenant. The conciliator will be flexible to ensure you have every reasonable opportunity to participate and have your issues heard. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly will be delivering today\u2019s national update. Calla Wahlquist will take you through that. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more Covid and political news. We should have a better idea of what is happening with the barley tariffs by then, as well as the EU resolution. Thank you again for joining us. And please, take care of you. Footy is (almost) back. Training for the greatest game began today #GoPies The Korea Times has an article on the contagiousness (or otherwise) of people who have been re-infected with Covid-19, based on South Korea\u2019s information: Patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus after recovering from their first bout of the disease do not infect other people, health authorities said Monday. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said it will not apply 14-day self-quarantine rules to such patients after concluding that the virus detected from relapse cases does not make other people sick. \u2018There have been no secondary infections from people who were in close contact with such patients,\u2019 Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health ministry official, told reporters. \u2018Also, the results from culture tests back up the conclusion.\u2019 So far, officials have confirmed 447 relapse cases, about 4.5% of all infection cases. While we are discussing the proposed Covid-19 inquiry, this report from The Daily Beast is quite interesting. Let\u2019s remember that Australia is a middle power. It doesn\u2019t have the diplomatic grunt to pull this sort of thing off in the world stage. It can help, and nudge, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a country with 25m people. Asked to what extent the EU did the legwork on the resolution, as opposed to Australia, Marise Payne acknowledges the work the bloc did in getting the motion off the ground. This is the EU\u2019s motion. Not Australia\u2019s. It\u2019s an important distinction, despite some of the rah-rah headlines. Payne: We have been very clear about the opportunity to support the EU resolution going to the WHA, it is a very detailed piece of work and our support has been, all focused on making sure we achieve the most productive outcome, which is the comprehensive, impartial independent review. To have been able to work with the EU and many others in support of this resolution has been a important series of steps to bring us today. I don\u2019t want to preempt speculate about the outcome, those discussions will be under way later this evening, Australian time. Importantly, the encouragement and input of so many parties, is, I think a real signal of the importance of the call for an independent international review and the outcome we have all wanted to see. I think it\u2019s a win for the international community, and Australia as a strong and active part of the international community, we would see it that way. Is Australia now in a trade war with China? Marise Payne still says no. I think the trade minister has been clear about that, yesterday and again today. We deal with issues on their merits as they arise, and that is what we have been doing in relation to barley and other issues, in particular, and that is what we have consistently done. One thing Australia is very sure of in terms of the steps we are taking is the importance of being consistent, of being clear, and of ensuring that we are working through each issue as it comes to us. On her \u201cpoacher and gamekeeper comments\u201d from just a month ago, Marise Payne says the EU motion includes the words \u201cimpartial and independent\u201d. I think in what is a comprehensive resolution, you will see the review is specifically referred to as impartial, independent and comprehensive. They are three factors which we particularly have sought. The prime minister and I have also discussed a number of mechanisms within the WHO, including their independent oversight advisory body, which has the capacity to do some of this work, but that is to be determined after the resolution is dealt with by the World Health Assembly, and, of course, we\u2019ve also been very clear in relation to the time of an inquiry of this nature that there are countries around the world, including some of those who have been prepared to cosponsor or sign up to this resolution who are still dealing with some of the most difficult aspects of the response. They are at the peak level of the crisis, and some are yet to experience that level. So we are very aware of that in terms of the timing as well. The Australian foreign minister, who very, very, very rarely holds press conferences, particularly solo, has stepped out in Penrith to speak about the EU World Health Assembly motion. We are very encouraged by the growing levels of support for this comprehensive world health assembly motion that will be discussed later this week. This is a process that is under way and continuing, so I am very careful to be observant of that, but the number of countries that have indicated their support, in fact are cosponsoring the resolution, drafted by the European Union, is very encouraging and we hope to a positive outcome later this week. Mark McGowan says Gladys Berejiklian is \u201cpersistent\u201d but WA will not be opening its borders \u201cuntil we deem it is the right time for the health of Western Australians\u201d. The WA says keeping the borders with the east means more restrictions can be relaxed within WA. The City of Melbourne will give international students $200 vouchers to shop for food at Queen Victoria Markets as part of a $200,000 program to support the students, who are not eligible for any government welfare, and support the struggling markets. As Luke Henriques-Gomes reported, international students have been relying on food banks and restaurants giving away free food to survive. The markets are open but have seen a drop in trade. Students can apply online for the vouchers and collect them from Melbourne town hall from Tuesday, 26 May. The program was announced ahead of the city\u2019s 2020-2021 budget. Councillor Philip Le Liu said Melbourne\u2019s international student community needed support. Thousands of international students live in our municipality \u2013 many of whom have lost their jobs and have little access to government support. Our food voucher program is a simple but effective way we can help make this time less stressful. We must protect our education institutions and create a platform for recovery so that international students feel welcomed and supported in Melbourne.\u201d Higher education, particularly courses geared to international students, is a big industry in Melbourne. Almost two thirds of jobs in the City of Melbourne itself are linked to the \u201cknowledge sector\u201d, the council said. It looks like China may back the EU World Health Assembly motion, if the hawkish Global Times (state media) editorial is anything to go by - but only if certain conditions are met. The paper has published this: Will China oppose scientific research into the virus\u2019 origin? No, because it is a necessary move to fight COVID-19 in a scientific way and conducive to prevention measures and development of vaccines and medicines. Washington\u2019s smear that a Wuhan lab was the virus origin has been universally opposed by scientists, but the US is still irrationally calling for an investigation. It is obviously an unfair and unscientific appeal that China will never accept. Some people in Europe and Australia echoed the US proposal for an independent investigation, against which China is certainly vigilant. Do some people in Canberra and other places follow Washington politically and conceal their political intention toward China? A politicized appeal won\u2019t be supported at the assembly. Five Eyes doesn\u2019t represent the entire world and the US cannot control other countries at will. The US has messed up its COVID-19 fight but intends to shift the responsibility onto China. Such a plan is bound to backfire. We hereby call on all countries of the world, including Western countries, not to be held hostage by Washington\u2019s plot, to uphold the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2018s mission of serving the world\u2019s public health needs and jointly opposing any politicization of the organization. A scientific investigation should be carried out. But first of all, it should be led by WHO rather than any country or regional organization. Second, the investigation needs to be scientific and fair. Not only China-related factors, but also those related to the US and other countries need to be included. Earlier confirmed cases than the previously known first infected case have continuously been found in the US. Among those diagnosed as having flu last winter, how many were coronavirus infections? All these clues shouldn\u2019t be missed. Investigating the origin of the virus is only one part of the coronavirus fight. The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA? It is the US that should feel it failed the international community. The proposal that will eventually be adopted by the assembly will not be one that only meets US requests. No matter where the virus originated, the challenge is for all people around the world. The international community should be vigilant and reject the US attempt to politicize the investigation and create new disputes. Only a small number of WHO members will cheer for the island of Taiwan, putting on nothing but a farce. Asked if she believes Australia\u2019s internal borders should re-open (something Gladys Berejiklian really wants, particularly with Queensland), Jane Halton says: I can\u2019t speak for the commission, because obviously that\u2019s not my job. My job is to provide advice to business and to government. And this is obviously a difficult issue at the moment. And people are taking a fairly conservative approach to issues around borders. One of the things that I think we do need to understand is that our economy doesn\u2019t work in hermetically sealed spheres. And within the bounds of what is sensible, from a medical and other perspective, enabling businesses to move products around, enabling workers - to the extent that they can safely - to return to work, including if that means travelling across borders, I think is a sensible thing to do. Now, I understand people are very nervous about the speed at which we open up. And I do think that we all have to remind ourselves, and I think we\u2019ve all seen behaviour like this over the last few days. I think a lot of people go \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s all good now\u2019 \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen an absence of social distancing out in public. And I would remind people - it\u2019s not all good now. And you\u2019ve still got a grandma, or you\u2019ve got a friend who is immune-compromised, who, if you manage to pick up that virus and give it to somebody else, that could have a really bad outcome. So I\u2019m personally not convinced that our internal borders are the right way to manage our risks. I understand why people are nervous, but I would encourage people to think about how we maintain control, perhaps while enabling business to operate. The Virgin Australia bidding process is ticking along, as AAP reports, although the Queensland Investment Corporation bid appears to have lost its (unofficial) preferred partner - Canadian investment group Brookfield, which is not on this list. Four private equity firms are the leading candidates to buy Virgin Australia, the biggest regional casualty of the coronavirus crisis in the global aviation industry. Melbourne-based BGH Capital and American private equity firms Bain Capital, Indigo Partners and Cyrus Capital Partners made the shortlist from bids submitted last week, a source told Reuters. The administrators Deloitte have not named the parties but said on Monday they had shortlisted \u201ca small number of well-funded parties with strong aviation credentials\u201d who were invited to the next stage of the sale process. Phoenix-based Indigo Partners owns US airline Frontier Airlines and Chilean carrier JetSmart, while New York and London-based Cyrus Capital Partners was recently involved in collapsed British regional airline Flybe. BGH, a private equity firm founded in 2017, also on Monday entered into exclusive talks to acquire theme park and cinema owner Village Roadshow. Tentative offers were due on Friday and Deloitte Restructuring Services partner Vaughan Strawbridge said they had received more interest than anticipated. Chris Bowen says Labor has wanted to see \u201cmore Marise Payne in the debate and less George Christensen\u201d when it comes to Australia\u2019s response to China. But he says the \u201cprogress\u201d is welcome. If you want to know how the barley tariff situation is going, this speaks volumes: The ACT remains (known) active Covid case free Paul Karp is covering Jane Halton, the chair of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, speech at the press club: It was worth a shot, but as AAP reports, a federal court judge has dismissed a bid to have Qantas workers paid sick leave during the pandemic: Some 20,000 Qantas workers stood down in mid-March have been able to legally access some entitlements including annual leave but have been prevented from accessing sick, carers and compassionate leave. The company\u2019s position on Monday was backed by Justice Geoffrey Flick. He agreed with Qantas that the stand-down power served two important purposes; offering businesses financial relief and protecting workers from termination. Allowing staff to access sick leave while lawfully stood down because there was no work would \u201cgo against the very object and purpose of conferring those entitlements - namely an entitlement to be relieved from the work which the employee was otherwise required to perform\u201d, Flick said. Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine said the ruling was \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d. \u201cThis is about justice and the fact that workers who are battling serious illnesses should be allowed to draw down the significant sick leave they have accrued through years of hard work at Qantas.\u201d Qantas said in a statement: \u201cThe court has confirmed that employees who are stood down are not eligible to receive paid sick leave because there is no work to be absent from.\u201d Jane Halton, the chair of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, is speaking at the National Press Club. Halton says that although most vaccine candidates (94%) fail, and most of those at the first or second stage, nevertheless there is a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of developing one for Covid-19 because there are 130 groups around the world working on the problem. Halton warns that if a vaccine is developed, here will be a \u201csignificant\u201d call within the country and company that develops and produces it for \u201cdomestic priority\u201d - to vaccinate locals first. But she says if countries engage in \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d then \u201ceveryone will continue to suffer\u201d. The best way to restart global exports and tourism is to ensure widespread access worldwide. Instead, CEPI is working on protocols to prioritise first responders (such as doctors, nurses, paramedics) and vulnerable populations. I fear it will not be quite as ordered and together as we have been. Marise Payne will be holding a (rare) press conference at 2.30pm to discuss the EU motion for the World Health Organization investigation into the original Covid-19 response. If you want to know how far this has come, this was Payne on 19 April on Insiders, saying Australia did not want the WHO to conduct the investigation: David Speers: Could it be the World Health Organization, or do you agree they\u2019re too beholden to China? Marise Payne: Well, I don\u2019t think that it is so much about whether they are or are not beholden to China. And we share some of the concerns that the United States have identified in relation to the World Health Organization. That is certainly correct. I think it is about an independent mechanism, and I\u2019m not sure that you can have the health organisation, which has been responsible for disseminating much of the international communications material, and doing much of the early engagement and investigative work, also as the review mechanism. That strikes me as somewhat poacher and gamekeeper. David Speers: So it can\u2019t be the World Health Organization, in other words, to do this review? Marise Payne: Well, no, as I\u2019ve said, that strikes me as a bit poacher and gamekeeper. The EU motion, now co-sponsored by more than 100 countries, specifically mentions the WHO conducting the investigation. Scott Morrison has just confirmed he will give an address at the national press club next Tuesday. The ABS also reported more people were slipping on the social distance requirements, compared with March. Fewer people were taking the following precautions in late April to early May: Keeping distance from people (94% compared with 98% in March). Purchasing additional household supplies (21% compared with 47% in March). Purchasing additional medical supplies (8% compared with 29% in March). The proportion of Australians who said they were wearing a face mask remained about the same \u2013 17% in March and 15% in late-April to early-May. Almost half the nation, 46%, is working from home, while 89% of workers who aren\u2019t working from home report it is because they can\u2019t due to the nature of their job. The ABS has tallied up what has been stressing us out in the last month \u2013 and unsurprisingly, loneliness tops the list. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, Michelle Marquardt, said women were more impacted then men, with 28% of women reporting feeling lonely, compared with 16% of men: Around one in five people (19%) also reported that they were experiencing difficulties maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which was more of a problem for those aged 18 to 64 years (22%) than those aged 65 years and over (9%). The survey also highlighted changes to people\u2019s lifestyles during the period early-April to early-May, including: 22 % who said they are eating more snack foods such as chips, lollies and biscuits. 14% who said they are consuming more alcohol, and 10 per cent who said they are consuming less. 58% who reported spending more time in front of their television, computer, phone or other device. 29% who reported less frequent consumption of takeaway or delivered meals, while 38% spent more time cooking or baking.

For the record, the prime minister has been very firm on removing the jobseeker Covid supplement. That is due to expire (along with the jobkeeper wage subsidy) in late September. Here was Scott Morrison late last week, on why he doesn\u2019t want the rate to stay: It is also important that when you have what are effectively unemployment benefits through jobseeker at the levels that they are, that when you do that, that can provide in normal circumstances a disincentive with payments at that level for people to go and seek work. And that\u2019s why these arrangements with the Covid supplement are temporary arrangements. The reason the Covid supplement was put in place was because we knew that those who would otherwise be on jobseeker who might in better times be able to go and find employment, that during this period that would be very difficult. So we understood that. But as the economy reopens and as opportunities open up again, then, of course we would want to see people taking up those opportunities when they present. And so we will do that, I think, in a fair way and recognising that still, still there are few opportunities that are out there at present. Anthony Albanese says he doesn\u2019t believe that the jobseeker allowance should be kept at its current level \u2013 $1,100 a fortnight. That is still well under minimum wage. But Albanese says Labor won\u2019t be advocating for the whole Covid supplement ($550 a fortnight) to remain in place \u2013 but at the same time, he doesn\u2019t want it to return to the old $40 a day Newstart rate. What I said is, $40 a day isn\u2019t enough for people to live on. The government acknowledged that, when they increased jobseeker, that was basically the words that they used \u2018well we need to give people [enough] to live on. This doesn\u2019t change after the event. Now I don\u2019t think it should be kept at the level where it is, where jobseeker is higher than the aged pension. That\u2019s not a reasonable proposition. But it is the case I think that jobseekers shouldn\u2019t go back down to $40 a day. And on jobkeeper, all I\u2019m saying there is we\u2019ll need some sort of a transition \u2013 the idea that you have more than six million people being subsidised with $1,500 a fortnight on 18 May and on 19 May it just ends for all six million people that will produce a shock to the economy, and there needs to be a much more sensible, pragmatic transition out of the process. The Labor leader says he thinks Australia has learnt that on-shore manufacturing needs to be supported, after the initial panic over the lack of personal protective equipment. He also thinks that we might see less travel for meetings, now that everyone is used to teleconferencing. The problem is you can\u2019t always just snap back, there needs to be a transition and what I\u2019m saying is, we can transition into how can we improve things, how can we make our economy stronger, more resilient. How can we support more permanency in jobs, one of the issues that has been apparent during this crisis as well is those people who are in casual jobs, they have done it tougher and were the first place people to be laid off. They\u2019re the people [for who this will be much harder] and I think we need to recognise that as well. And I think we can do that and emerge stronger. It has been an opportunity where people have had a chance to think about things and the world has slowed down a little bit, for all of us. And I\u2019ve certainly been thinking about what sort of society, we want to have, how we can shape that, and how we can improve it. Anthony Albanese is speaking to John Laws on Sydney radio 2SM, and so far the interview has focussed on whether Albanese is pronounced Albanese or Albanese. I\u2019ll let your mind fill in the blanks. And by the way \u2013 he says it\u2019s Albanese. Speaking to the Seven Network this morning, Simon Birmingham said he hoped China would come on board the inquiry at the World Health Assembly: I hope that China will participate. I hope China will come on board at the World Health Assembly, joining many, many other nations in supporting the obvious need for an inquiry into Covid-19, its origins, its handling right across the world. Because we\u2019ve had a circumstance where hundreds of thousands of people have died, millions people have lost their jobs, billions of people had their lives disrupted, and the least the world can expect is an enquiry that allows us to learn the lessons so that we can try to avoid a repeat of this in the future. A key change in the motion can be found here, as Daniel Hurst has pointed out to me. The 15 April draft included this request the WHO director general: OP5.18 Plan for an evaluation, to be conducted in consultation with Member States at the earliest appropriate moment, on lessons learnt from the international health response to Covid-19, addressing the long-term consequences on health, , in order to assess, in line with the statement made by G20 leaders, gaps in pandemic preparedness with a view to establishing a global initiative on pandemic preparedness and response capitalising on existing structures and programmes to align priorities in global preparedness Which has been changed to this: OP9.10 Initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with Member States, 1. A stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation, including using existing mechanisms, 2. As appropriate, to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19, including, (i) the effectiveness of the mechanisms at WHO\u2019s disposal; (ii) the functioning of the IHR and the status of implementation of the relevant recommendations of the previous IHR Review Committees; (iii) WHO\u2019s contribution to United Nations-wide efforts; and (iv) the actions of WHO and their timelines pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic, and make recommendations to improve global pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response capacity, including through strengthening, as appropriate, WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme. Expect this resolution to be changed before the final vote \u2013 that sound you hear is hundreds of diplomatic cables flying back and forth as we speak, but here is the EU motion which will go to the World Health Assembly Australia is a co-sponsor, along with 61 other countries, but it is important to note that this is different to what Australia first suggested. The EU motion does not mention China, or even Wuhan. Russia is on board, but the United States, at this stage, is not. In an unforeseen consequence of the Covid lockdown, New Zealand has seen its fastest growth rate in modern history, growing from four million to five million in 17 years. Why? Everyone came home. As AAP reports: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has regularly thanked her \u201cteam of five million\u201d for helping New Zealand weather the Covid-19 wave, and as of today she has confirmation of that headcount. On Monday, Stats NZ released its quarterly estimate resident population figures which showed New Zealand notching the major milestone. As of 31 March, the South Pacific nation has 5,002,100 residents. In all likelihood, New Zealand has reached the figure because of the pandemic. \u201cCovid-19 has caused some unusual and unprecedented travel patterns,\u201d Stats NZ senior demographer Kim Dunstan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people that have been in New Zealand prolong their stay which has given some boost to migration. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had more New Zealand citizens returning from living overseas in recent months. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve also had fewer citizens departing New Zealand to live overseas. \u201cThe combined impact has seen an upswing in migration which has helped New Zealand reach that five million milestone.\u201d Presented without comment. There has been a lot of interest in this, from those who like to watch politics north of the border. Jackie Trad, who stepped down from the ministry and the deputy premiership earlier this month, after she was referred to the state\u2019s corruption watchdog over her alleged role in appointing a school principal, will be running in the next election, for South Brisbane. It is probably a good time to point out that the EU motion, which is the one we have been talking about today, is different to what Australia was originally calling for. The World Health Assembly is expected to endorse the motion. Not Covid related, but still very, very, very important \u2013 Luke Henriques-Gomes has an update on the robodebt situation. Paul Karp has spoken to ANU on where the business world is at, as restrictions begin to be lifted: Four-in-five self-employed Australians have reported their profits have taken a hit as a result of the Covid-19 contraction, with almost one third worried their businesses will not be viable in two months without improved conditions. The ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods study, released on Monday, provides fresh impetus for those arguing to reopen the Australian economy and will play into political debate about whether to extend the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme beyond September. Based on a survey of a representative sample of 3,155 Australians in mid-April, the report found self-employed workers have suffered a higher reduction in hours worked and income than employees. The longitudinal survey found 5.1% of self-employed workers said that the coronavirus had eliminated their profits completely, 21.6% said it had been reduced to its lowest point ever and 21.9% said it has reduced their profits \u2018substantially\u2019. You\u2019ll find more on where the independent inquiry Australia has been calling for on the Covid response, here Joel Fitzgibbon spoke to Sydney radio 2SM this morning. As the shadow agriculture minister, he had a bit to say about the current trade barney with China: China is more than one-third of our exports and you\u2019re going to be pretty hard-pressed to find new export markets that fill that void. So we have to get this relationship right and it\u2019s incumbent upon the government to do so. No one\u2019s arguing that there shouldn\u2019t be a Covid inquiry and by the way this relationship has been deteriorating for the last three years, not just since Covid emerged \u2026 [inaudible] rebuild the relationship and ensure we normalise our trading relationship. China will be an important market for us for decades to come, it will become increasingly a high-value market as the middle-classes continue to emerge and to capitalise on that and to draw benefit from that we do not in any way have to forgo our sovereignty or our national interest. Queensland\u2019s health minister and deputy premier, Steven Miles, says there have been two new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in Queensland overnight. There are now 13 (known) cases of coronavirus in Queensland. Four people are in hospital and one person is in the ICU. Miles is in Rockhampton, after an aged care nurse tested positive for Covid-19. There has been an investigation launched as the nurse was displaying symptoms when they went to work and returned to work after being tested for Covid, before the positive diagnosis came back. It\u2019s a government-run facility. The centre has been put into lockdown and all residents and staff have been tested as part of a rapid response, but all residents have been moved out of the facility while tests and monitoring continues. Still, China is due to make a decision on whether or not it imposes a tariff (up to 80%) on Australian barley exports in the next 24 hours. David Littleproud says if it moves forward with the threat, Australia will be off to the World Trade Organisation lickety-split: [Trade] minister [Simon] Birmingham has been quite clear on this that we reserve our rights and he has a strong record that when we believe that our case hasn\u2019t been understood properly, that we take it to the independent umpire. We\u2019ve done that with trading partners like Canada with wine, and India with sugar. So we will look at the judgement by China tomorrow. This has been something that\u2019s been in transition for 18 months; it\u2019s come to this junction. We\u2019ll work calmly and methodically through it. The Department of Agriculture personnel in China, in Beijing are telling me that it\u2019s been very constructive with Chinese officials on the ground. It\u2019s very calm, very methodical working through the questions they have and giving them the answers they\u2019re looking for. Now, whether that gets lost in the translation, we\u2019ll find out tomorrow. But we\u2019ll be very strong that we\u2019ll stand up to any trading partner where we believe they haven\u2019t understood our argument and we\u2019ll take it an umpire for them to determine. The call to investigate the initial response to Covid, as well as how the world reacted, does not mention China or Wuhan. Sixty-two nations lined up behind Australia to call for an independent investigation. David Littleproud told the ABC it wasn\u2019t about pointing fingers: This was always about investigation rather than conflict. And quite calmly and methodically, we\u2019ve asked why and how this has happened. How can we do better? What can we learn from this? That\u2019s the responsible thing to do when 300,000 souls have lost their lives around the world. We\u2019ve done that asking other nations to work with us, and I think we\u2019ll get better answers and even the Department of Agriculture, has put out there and I led this to the G20, looking at wildlife wet markets. Six pandemics since 1980 have originated from wildlife wet markets. It is important to understand whether they can be mitigated and if they can\u2019t, how do we transition these countries away from the wildlife element of a wet market. That\u2019s the responsible thing to do, that\u2019s a good global citizen and that\u2019s what Australia has led. Dave Sharma says just because the Chinese trade minister isn\u2019t picking up the phone to Simon Birmingham doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t discussions happening. The former ambassador says the embassies would still be talking to each other and there would be communications going back and forth. Which is an important point. The Greens are launching their economic recovery plan today. AAP has an update on the stock market situation: Shares are tipped to be slightly higher in early trade on the Australian market as part of what one expert said is the ASX\u2019s skittish recovery from coronavirus lows. The SPI 200 futures contract was higher by 32 points or 0.59%, to 5,436 at 8.00 AEST on Monday, indicating a small gain in early trade. This follows a thin positive lead from Wall Street where the three major US indexes closed higher on Friday despite weaker than expected US economic data, amid optimism that easing coronavirus restrictions would boost activity this month. CommSec chief economist Craig James says Australian equities have likely bottomed out and are undergoing a skittish recovery \u2013 as long as the nation continues to keep coronavirus cases low. He noted the ASX200 had risen over six of the past seven weeks NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has reported a man in his 60s, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, had died. Dr Chant said the man had underlying health conditions. The man is the 48th to die in NSW and the 99th death across Australia. Chief executive of Anglicare, Grant Millard says the situation at Newmarch House is now \u201cvery solid\u201d, and isn\u2019t concerned with a royal commission investigating the outbreak at the house. In the five weeks since the first case of Covid-19 at the home was diagnosed, 18 residents have died and 71 people have been infected. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any infection since 28 April. I think things are very much under control now. It was a vastly different situation two weeks ago. It was extremely challenging, everyone was stretched,\u201d he told ABC radio this morning. Millard was asked if all Covid-19 positive patients should have been transported to hospital at the beginning of the outbreak: It needs to be assessed on an individual basis. It really depends on the person\u2019s state of health ... These people are actually in their own homes, that\u2019s where they\u2019re comfortable. It\u2019s not as clear cut as saying, \u2018get someone at the hospital\u2019. But I think, given the challenges with staffing, and, at the same time we heard that there was no elective surgeries and hospital, and there was staff around, it does beg the question about whether they should have just gone off the hospital? I understand the public health outbreak at the time there were real concerns about what might have another Ruby Princess and I get that, but you just need to make this decision a case by case basis. Millard admitted there had been a break down in communication with families: I readily acknowledge that communication was a problem. We were scrambling to staff just to provide basic care, and we just didn\u2019t do a good enough job with communicating with families. Millard said he wasn\u2019t concerned about inquires by the royal commission into aged care and said he wasn\u2019t aware of any claims of compensation from families of those residents who died after contracting Covid-19. Transport apps in NSW will now tell you whether or not there is seat capacity on public transport at peak times as the state moves to keep public transport open, but maintaining social distancing. Gladys Berejiklian says there has been just one new case of Covid-19 diagnosed in New South Wales in the last 24 hours. They know where it came from \u2013 overseas. The person remains in quarantine. Daniel Andrews has announced a $2.7bn construction stimulus package for the state, in a bid to get the economy moving after the Covid restrictions: This is a package that is designed to make sure that tradies and all of us, because as those wages are earnt and the contracts are won, the money is invested and spent. They move around the Victorian economy, and that money flowing throughout the Victorian economy benefits all of us. Hundreds and hundreds of projects delivering thousands and thousands of jobs. That\u2019s exactly what we need right at this time, and I want to be clear with you that these projects, many of which are new, some of which were in the planning, but have been brought forward. Because we\u2019ve got to get the projects away quickly. These projects, some of them, the public housing maintenance for instance, will begin next week. The rest of them will be under way over the next three to six months. And we\u2019ll be pushing as hard as we possibly can to get those projects done closer to the three months than the six months. It\u2019s very, very important that we underpin demand. That we give to tradies and so many others across the economy, that sense of absolute certainty and confidence that this work is here and it\u2019s here right now. There\u2019s never been a better time for us to invest. Never been a more important time for us to invest in these jobs. This, of course, comes after our very significant business survival package, which included the best part of $2bn in grants to businesses hardest hit by the shutdowns. Payroll tax refunds to businesses right across the state, and of course, the Working for Victoria fund, which is all about trying to make sure that those who have lost their job can work for all of us doing deep cleaning, doing all sorts of other functions. Students are preparing to return to on-site learning in South Australia (which reported it was officially known Covid case free) and the ACT (which has also reported it was known Covid case free) today. Queensland students will all be back on-site from next Monday. New South Wales has also moved to a return and Victoria has laid out its plan. Federal Queensland Liberal MP Andrew Laming continues to cover himself in glory, photoshopping the Queensland premier, whose Polish grandfather was interned by the Nazis, and whose grandmother suffered abuse at their hands, as a Nazi in a social media post, protesting the Queensland restrictions. Annastacia Palaszczuk says she is not going to get into it with him: I\u2019m not going to comment. I\u2019m focused on dealing with a pandemic. If people have too much time on their hands and want to get involved in that sort of behaviour, I think that it speaks more about themselves than anyone else. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says there have been six more cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in his state in the last 24 hours. \u201cWe still have to acknowledge this is with us still, this is not over,\u201d he says. There had been hopes that Queensland would reopen its borders in June, but in case you missed it, Annastacia Palaszczuk just poured cold water over that. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, the Queensland premier says the decision will be reviewed at the end of this month, but borders may remain closed for another three to four months. Q: You\u2019ve said that you\u2019d review the border decision at the end of every month. Is it possible at the end of May, which is only a couple of weeks away, there may be a change? A: Look, I have to get the advice of the chief health officer. I would say that things would look more positive towards September. Having said that, I don\u2019t want to rule anything out. I will give you that advice at the end of May as quickly as possible. Q: So that\u2019s several months, we\u2019re talking about September, that\u2019s three or four months away before the border could reopen? A: Well, it\u2019s about the community transmission based on the expert advice. It\u2019s not my decision. It\u2019s based on the expert health advice. Q: Now, what about the prospect of a domestic travel bubble? Queenslanders being allowed to go to the NT? WA and South Australia? Would you be open to that? A: I could see that happening before New South Wales and Victoria. But that\u2019s a matter for the premiers there as well. They\u2019ll probably say the same thing. We\u2019ve got a little bit of community transmission. Not much, but they may say - no, we don\u2019t want Queensland at the moment. But look, at the end of the day, I really hope that we see an Australia where people can travel freely once again through all of our borders because that\u2019s the way that we work best together. But we\u2019re just in this unusual circumstance at the moment that no one wants to be in. So we have to take the health advice. But it\u2019s great to see some of the restrictions easing and people travelling around. Simon Birmingham may not be able to get a call back from his Chinese counterpart over trade tensions, but Australia\u2019s call for an independent investigation into the Covid reaction has gained traction overnight, with 62 countries, including Russia, signing on to have the immediate response evaluated. Queensland is set to review its border closures at the end of May, but Annastacia Palaszczuk says that September is looking more likely, given community transmission rates in Victoria and New South Wales. I have to get the advice of the chief health officer. I would say that things would look more positive towards September. Having said that, I don\u2019t want to rule anything out,\u201d she told the ABC. Speaking of that, McDonald\u2019s has closed 12 outlets across Victoria and staff have been told to be tested after a delivery driver tested positive for coronavirus. All 12 outlets will be shut and deep cleaned after being visited by the driver, who was asymptomatic and unaware he had Covid-19 at the time. With the health response having beefed up, restrictions are relaxing across the nation, leaving politicians time to concentrate, once again, on politics. The latest Newspoll has Scott Morrison\u2019s personal popularity remaining high, while the Coalition sits ahead of Labor 51 to 49. But there is a rough road ahead. The economy is, to put it mildly, not great. Federally, attention is being turned to the free childcare offer, jobkeeper and jobseeker, and how much longer to keep them going. There are reviews coming up for all three, and we\u2019ll bring you all the information as we get it. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day today, as well as the entire Guardian brains trust. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "The UK Foreign Office (FCO) is currently advising against all but essential international travel for an indefinite period. However, countries across Europe have begun to ease lockdown measures and border restrictions and prepare for the return of both domestic and international tourists.

Reciprocal travel deals \u2013 as proposed in a leaked European Commission document on 12 May \u2013 may be struck between countries with similar coronavirus risk profiles. For example, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have formed a \u2018travel bubble\u2019 allowing movement between those countries. A similar idea was proposed by the UK\u2019s transport secretary Grant Shapps on 18 May, whereby travel would be allowed to and from countries with an R-number \u2013 a key measure of transmission \u2013 below one to try to boost confidence in aviation travel. The so-called \u201cair bridges\u201d would permit re-entry without quarantine. At the UK border, all international passengers must now provide contact and accommodation information; they will also be strongly advised to download and use the NHS contact tracing app. And all except those on a list of exemptions (tbc) will also be required to self-isolate in their accommodation for 14 days on arrival.

Within an hour, it was up by 9%. Numbers that would, at any other time, have seemed unthinkably, impossibly bad were actually not quite as bad as the market had been expecting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/17/racing-in-ireland-to-resume-on-8-june-at-naas-with-busy-month-planned-horse\">Irish racing to resume on 8 June at Naas with its Classics quick to follow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A bookie\u2019s share price going up might seem like an odd cause for optimism as British racing works towards what is still only a possible return to action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/newcastle-will-host-first-horse-racing-meeting-on-return-for-sport-in-june\">two weeks from today</a>. Yet betting is a vital revenue stream for the industry, worth \u00a3100m in Levy yield alone in 2019-20. That is roughly \u00a38m a month, while a big Festival meeting like Cheltenham, Aintree or Royal Ascot could be worth at least \u00a31m in Levy income on its own.</p> <p>And since racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future, the country\u2019s second-biggest spectator sport will depend more heavily than ever on revenue generated from its off-course customers. In other words, everyone who bets on it, which remains a considerable number of people.</p> <p>Hills\u2019s trading statement states that racing contributes \u201cnearly a third of online UK sportsbook\u201d in terms of revenue. It also shows that the firm\u2019s online revenue from gaming products (mostly roulette and other fixed-margin casino games) was up in the seven weeks to 28 April \u2013 but only by 6%.

      "bodyText": "When William Hill released a trading statement at 8am last Friday which showed a 57% drop in total net revenue in what the firm described as the \u201ccoronavirus-impacted\u201d seven weeks from 11 March to 28 April, the news had an interesting effect on its share price. Within an hour, it was up by 9%. Numbers that would, at any other time, have seemed unthinkably, impossibly bad were actually not quite as bad as the market had been expecting. A bookie\u2019s share price going up might seem like an odd cause for optimism as British racing works towards what is still only a possible return to action two weeks from today. Yet betting is a vital revenue stream for the industry, worth \u00a3100m in Levy yield alone in 2019-20. That is roughly \u00a38m a month, while a big Festival meeting like Cheltenham, Aintree or Royal Ascot could be worth at least \u00a31m in Levy income on its own. And since racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future, the country\u2019s second-biggest spectator sport will depend more heavily than ever on revenue generated from its off-course customers. In other words, everyone who bets on it, which remains a considerable number of people. Hills\u2019s trading statement states that racing contributes \u201cnearly a third of online UK sportsbook\u201d in terms of revenue. It also shows that the firm\u2019s online revenue from gaming products (mostly roulette and other fixed-margin casino games) was up in the seven weeks to 28 April \u2013 but only by 6%. This might suggest that even during a lockdown, a significant chunk of Hills\u2019s client base decided that if they could not gamble on sport, they were not going to gamble at all. Football is the biggest money-spinner for the bookies these days, accounting for \u201capproximately half\u201d of Hills\u2019s online UK sportsbook. Yet if racing is responsible for \u201cabout a third\u201d of what is now an immense market for betting on sport, it is still going to be an essential part of their business as sport slowly resumes, with racing leading the way and, who knows, possibly having the sporting stage almost to itself for several weeks at least. With spectators barred from racecourses, meanwhile, the humble high-street betting shop, so often written off as out-of-date and in irreversible decline, could also have a role to play. A quarter of a century ago, online betting was ready to usher the high-street shop into the history books. This time last year, it cut the maximum FOBT stake from \u00a3100 to \u00a32-per-spin.

While all its betting-shop staff are furloughed, Hills has been \u201ctopping up payments to ensure they receive 100% of their pay\u201d, and the firm is planning a \u201cstaged opening of the retail estate in the second half of 2020\u201d assuming that the lockdown continues to ease.

      "bodyText": "Forces allied to Libya\u2019s UN-backed prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, have seized a key airbase from the renegade general Khalifa Haftar, dealing a huge strategic blow to the warlord\u2019s year-long campaign to capture the capital, Tripoli. Haftar launched a new assault to unseat the UN-recognised government in April 2019, triggering some of the most significant fighting on Libyan soil since the battle to overthrow Col Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Foreign powers \u2013 notably Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Russia \u2013 are increasingly active in this new chapter of the war, leading to fears of another drawn-out proxy conflict similar to Syria. What are the origins of Libya\u2019s war? Oil-rich Libya has been in chaos since the Arab spring movement and Nato bombing campaign that toppled Gaddafi in 2011. Attempts to build a democratic state after Gaddafi fell disintegrated into a new civil war between rival governments in 2014. Armed groups, including extremists such as Islamic State, have proliferated and the lawless country has also become a principal transit point for people from across Africa who want to reach Europe.

Since 2014 the fighting has mainly been between rival centres of political power in east and west Libya: the Tripoli administration, known as the Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Sarraj, and the Tobruk administration, which decamped to the eastern city after disputed elections. The Tobruk government appointed Haftar to lead the Libyan National Army (LNA) and restore its sovereignty.

Over the last few years foreign powers have increasingly intervened in Libya\u2019s civil war to defend their own strategic and economic interests. The GNA is backed by the UN and western countries, but its main allies are Turkey, Qatar and Italy. The LNA enjoys the support of Russia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, France and Jordan. The foreign parties have flooded Libya with weapons and drones, ignoring a UN arms embargo. Russia has sent mercenaries and Sudanese men have been recruited to fight alongside the LNA; in January the Guardian reported that Turkey sent Syrian recruits along with its own soldiers, to defend the Tripoli government. High-profile peace talks in Berlin this year did not result in any lasting truce. What is the humanitarian impact?

Perhaps that was a useful byproduct for some of those immersed in the almighty row that recently engulfed the Scottish scene.</p> \n<p>Celtic were the finest team in Scotland in 2019-20. The abbreviated season is surely a frustration for Neil Lennon and his players as outsiders look to diminish a ninth championship in succession. The sniping does not matter and how Celtic choose to celebrate is entirely up to them. There are of course deeper problems to ponder but a trophy retained by Monday morning Zoom call denies fans a moment in time. They will compensate for that as best they can.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/celtic-confirmed-as-scottish-champions-and-hearts-relegated-from-premiership\">Celtic confirmed as Scottish champions and Hearts relegated from Premiership</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The lead over Rangers \u2013 13 points with eight games to play \u2013 would have been pressed home and in Odsonne \u00c9douard, Celtic had the best player for good measure. Whereas clubs understandably object to being relegated when a season finishes short of a natural conclusion, the awarding of prizes when the situation was a fait accompli should be far less contentious. \u201cShould\u201d being the operative word.</p> \n<p>Celtic have cause to rue extenuating circumstances. Nine is Scotland\u2019s magic number, matching the record for successive league titles. This run has the backdrop of Rangers being out of the top flight for four seasons and football\u2019s coronavirus-triggered suspension.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5d46630-ffe4-4f18-972f-127154b9432a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WjarLBfO8jE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lennon and Celtic fans have no reason to care. When the objective is to be the leading side in Scotland, weakness of opposition is not their problem. The target has been met comfortably. Celtic drew two matches and lost two while returning a goal difference of 70. Celtic averaged 2.67 points \u2013 and 2.97 goals \u2013 per league fixture.</p> \n<p>Celtic deserve particular credit for a stirring response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-old-firm-derby-report\">defeat in the Old Firm </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-old-firm-derby-report\">match </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-old-firm-derby-report\">on 29 December</a>. Rangers sat two points behind their oldest foes with a game in hand. Giddy analysis \u2013 not from Steven Gerrard, it must be noted \u2013 suggested a title battle worthy of the name was imminent but Celtic returned from their subsequent mid-season break in inspired form while Rangers wilted.</p> \n<p>Gerrard has succeeded in separating Rangers from the rest as the Premiership\u2019s second force but there remains no compelling case to argue Celtic\u2019s stranglehold will be loosened anytime soon. It would take a seismic shift for them to be denied a perfect 10.</p> \n<p>A key Celtic strength lies in their sellable assets. Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Kieran Tierney earned the club almost \u00a345m without a domestic threat emerging. \u00c9douard has admirers in England and abroad, Callum McGregor and Ryan Christie likewise. The development of Kristoffer Ajer, Christopher Jullien, Jeremie Frimpong and Mikey Johnston could result in more football and balance sheet success.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c322f7253c140f807b439efb8249c38174061fe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c322f7253c140f807b439efb8249c38174061fe/0_180_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Lennon presided over the first of Celtic\u2019s nine title and has returned for the ninth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Lennon presided over the first of Celtic\u2019s nine title and returned for the ninth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It remains a troublesome balancing act to assemble a squad capable of making European inroads when Ross County, Hamilton and St Johnstone are the staple diet but Celtic have managed their resources smartly.</p> \n<p>There is symmetry to Lennon, who presided over the first of the nine titles, being back at the helm. The 48-year-old, by widespread acknowledgment more calm than during his first Celtic tenure, will take great pride in matching the record.</p> \n<p>He has done it from a complicated standpoint. There were murmurs of discontent when Lennon succeeded Brendan Rodgers, who made fundamental changes to Celtic. There have been bumps in the road \u2013 a comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/celtic-copenhagen-europa-league-match-report\">Europa League defeat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/celtic-copenhagen-europa-league-match-report\">by Copenhagen</a>, mainly \u2013 but Lennon has returned to the frontline with a minimum of fuss and arguably enhanced many elements of the team\u2019s performance.</p> \n<p>Historical comparisons are an Old Firm staple. Nonetheless, it feels futile to judge this Celtic against the one who cantered to nine titles from 1966. A year later, they were champions of Europe during a spell when Scottish clubs could go toe to toe with the best. Societal and economic changes are such that football \u2013 the game and business \u2013 is unrecognisable from that period. Many nations \u2013 including new ones \u2013 have left Scotland behind.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even Rangers\u2019 version of nine in a row, achieved from 1989, is not a valid parallel given they could compete financially against European giants. If those from Glasgow\u2019s blue half seek to demean their rivals\u2019 success on the basis of weakness elsewhere, the financial implosion at Celtic in the early 1990s is a counterpoint.</p> \n<p>It would be naive to disregard the modest scale of the challenge facing Celtic domestically. Only those with vested interests can suggest the championship monopoly or duopoly that has existed since Aberdeen were kings in 1985 is healthy. However, Celtic\u2019s place on top of the mountain is beyond question. It would be churlish to allow rancour to overshadow their achievement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has seemed impossible to decouple bitterness relating to Celtic\u2019s title win from the reality of it being a perfectly valid outcome. Perhaps that was a useful byproduct for some of those immersed in the almighty row that recently engulfed the Scottish scene. Celtic were the finest team in Scotland in 2019-20. The abbreviated season is surely a frustration for Neil Lennon and his players as outsiders look to diminish a ninth championship in succession. The sniping does not matter and how Celtic choose to celebrate is entirely up to them. There are of course deeper problems to ponder but a trophy retained by Monday morning Zoom call denies fans a moment in time. They will compensate for that as best they can. The lead over Rangers \u2013 13 points with eight games to play \u2013 would have been pressed home and in Odsonne \u00c9douard, Celtic had the best player for good measure. Whereas clubs understandably object to being relegated when a season finishes short of a natural conclusion, the awarding of prizes when the situation was a fait accompli should be far less contentious. \u201cShould\u201d being the operative word. Celtic have cause to rue extenuating circumstances. Nine is Scotland\u2019s magic number, matching the record for successive league titles. This run has the backdrop of Rangers being out of the top flight for four seasons and football\u2019s coronavirus-triggered suspension. Lennon and Celtic fans have no reason to care. When the objective is to be the leading side in Scotland, weakness of opposition is not their problem. The target has been met comfortably. Celtic drew two matches and lost two while returning a goal difference of 70. Celtic averaged 2.67 points \u2013 and 2.97 goals \u2013 per league fixture. Celtic deserve particular credit for a stirring response to defeat in the Old Firm match on 29 December. Rangers sat two points behind their oldest foes with a game in hand. Giddy analysis \u2013 not from Steven Gerrard, it must be noted \u2013 suggested a title battle worthy of the name was imminent but Celtic returned from their subsequent mid-season break in inspired form while Rangers wilted. Gerrard has succeeded in separating Rangers from the rest as the Premiership\u2019s second force but there remains no compelling case to argue Celtic\u2019s stranglehold will be loosened anytime soon. It would take a seismic shift for them to be denied a perfect 10. A key Celtic strength lies in their sellable assets. Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Kieran Tierney earned the club almost \u00a345m without a domestic threat emerging. \u00c9douard has admirers in England and abroad, Callum McGregor and Ryan Christie likewise. The development of Kristoffer Ajer, Christopher Jullien, Jeremie Frimpong and Mikey Johnston could result in more football and balance sheet success. It remains a troublesome balancing act to assemble a squad capable of making European inroads when Ross County, Hamilton and St Johnstone are the staple diet but Celtic have managed their resources smartly. There is symmetry to Lennon, who presided over the first of the nine titles, being back at the helm. The 48-year-old, by widespread acknowledgment more calm than during his first Celtic tenure, will take great pride in matching the record. He has done it from a complicated standpoint. There were murmurs of discontent when Lennon succeeded Brendan Rodgers, who made fundamental changes to Celtic. There have been bumps in the road \u2013 a comprehensive Europa League defeat by Copenhagen, mainly \u2013 but Lennon has returned to the frontline with a minimum of fuss and arguably enhanced many elements of the team\u2019s performance. Historical comparisons are an Old Firm staple. Nonetheless, it feels futile to judge this Celtic against the one who cantered to nine titles from 1966. A year later, they were champions of Europe during a spell when Scottish clubs could go toe to toe with the best. Societal and economic changes are such that football \u2013 the game and business \u2013 is unrecognisable from that period. Many nations \u2013 including new ones \u2013 have left Scotland behind. Even Rangers\u2019 version of nine in a row, achieved from 1989, is not a valid parallel given they could compete financially against European giants. If those from Glasgow\u2019s blue half seek to demean their rivals\u2019 success on the basis of weakness elsewhere, the financial implosion at Celtic in the early 1990s is a counterpoint. It would be naive to disregard the modest scale of the challenge facing Celtic domestically. Only those with vested interests can suggest the championship monopoly or duopoly that has existed since Aberdeen were kings in 1985 is healthy. However, Celtic\u2019s place on top of the mountain is beyond question. It would be churlish to allow rancour to overshadow their achievement.",

The revelatory arc his albums form over the two-plus decades before his death aged 36 in 1981 is a progression, a string of black diamonds in which Marley found new ways to tell hard truths. Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, Marley\u2019s music has been downloaded 27 times more than usual, a remarkable leap confirming that he and the Wailers provide healing sustenance in times of trouble.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMbvpftTEUs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QMbvpftTEUs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Within the Wailers\u2019 canon, Exodus holds a central place. There is a reason why it was voted album of the century by Time, why One Love was voted song of the millennium by the World Health Organization, and why it chimes with so many of our feelings right now. Exodus was the product of trauma, dislocation and exile, all crucially crowned by hope \u2013 it was a response to the politically motivated attempt on his life in 1976 at his Kingston home. Marley, with the Wailers and Chris Blackwell, executive producer and Island Records founder \u2013 distilled an immaculate album. Exodus, Jamming, Three Little Birds, and Curtis Mayfield collaboration One Love: these and others are dear to millions, partly because of their inclusion on the 1984 Legend compilation, still the top-selling reggae record ever.</p> <p>A key to its appeal is the tracklisting sequenced by Blackwell, who also came up with the idea of the seductive, beckoning slow rise of the opening track, Natural Mystic. This sequencing of an enormous number of songs (the Kaya album also came from those sessions) gave the record a messianic structure, with Marley leading the listener from the cosmic Natural Mystic through the wilderness of betrayal on side one that closes in the anthemic title track. He later reaches the sunny mountaintop of side two, with One Love the flag waving at its crest. This transition was clear, as if the turning of the record signified a new start.</p> <p>Gently tinted with disco drum machines and funk \u2013 to drummer Carlton Barrett\u2019s horror \u2013 Marley\u2019s own journey turned both inward and outward to weave Exodus. In this unprecedented time, listen to it for uplift, but also listen to The Heathen and Guiltiness to know you are not alone in your ominous suspicions.</p> <h2>The three albums to hear next</h2> <p><strong>African Herbsman (1973)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Tk-FoiX_0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b0Tk-FoiX_0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Exodus was outsold by Culture\u2019s rootsier Two Sevens Clash at the Rough Trade shop off Portobello Road, right near the old Basing Street studios where it was recorded. Ever since the implosion of the original Wailers trinity of Bob, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer after the release of Burnin\u2019, their second international release on Island Records, some purists have dissed the international Marley\u2019s supposedly watered-down flavour.</p> <p>Not that I agree, but I can hear what they are getting at on African Herbsman, a collection of singles released by Trojan Records. Sonorous, sensual and prayerful, these songs proved to be seeds for several later albums. Marley once explained to me that he could see more creative possibility in these little-heard babies \u2013 and he wanted to finally be paid royalties on dearly loved early compositions. All through his work, he would revisit these songs produced mostly by the elfin dubmaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lee-scratch-perry\">Lee Perry</a>, plus a couple by the band themselves sung with his bred\u2019ren. As Marley fondly said to me of those early trio days: \u201cWe used to have some nice times singing together.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Catch a Fire (1973)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ev_cSkMV5M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Ev_cSkMV5M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Dressed up in a costly flip-top Zippo lighter sleeve, this first international Wailers release was part of Blackwell\u2019s campaign to stop his island\u2019s reggae music from being filed under novelty records.

It would make these local heroes the darlings of musical cognoscenti everywhere that dug rock, but craved the Wailers\u2019 injection of personality, offbeat rhythm and pan-African authenticity.</p> <p>It was the Wailers\u2019 first chance to stretch out, and this is chocka with classics, plus a clarity of vision and concept then unknown in reggae albums. The truth behind Marley\u2019s image \u2013 the tender but tough revolutionary \u2013 is gorgeously present on tracks such as Slave Driver, Stir It Up and the nightlife commentaries Midnight Ravers and Kinky Reggae. The album was subtly sweetened during the mix by Wayne Perkins, an American musician recording at the same time; the bendy guitar filigrees that alienated purists were truly emotional and cemented the band\u2019s mass appeal.</p> <h2><strong>Uprising (1980)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mLssX_I914\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5mLssX_I914?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>With an estate among the most lucrative of any late musician, Marley famously died intestate, leading to decades of lawsuits. So let this monumental album, the final to be recorded and released in his lifetime, stand as his last will and testament. There is a very specific seriousness and commitment to Uprising, recorded when Marley was aware that he was gravely ill. The disco-tinged Could You Be Loved sounds as if it might be one of his tender love ballads, but is actually urging the listener to take their own moral reckoning; on Real Situation, he even manages to swing the line, \u201cIt seems like total destruction\u2019s the only solution.\u201d With its heartbreakingly limpid melody, Forever Loving Jah may be the most exquisite of Marley\u2019s odes to his deity, Haile Selassie; even those cynical about Solomon and Sheba\u2019s regal descendant must still be moved by that melody.</p> <p>As ever, Marley takes care to leaven his apocalyptic perspective with optimism. A personal favourite, Bad Card, brazenly opens, \u201cYou a go tired fe see me face / can\u2019t get me out of the race\u201d, summing up one of his greatest gifts and lessons to us: tenacity. Deliberately, he follows We and Dem (\u201cWe no have no friends in a high society\u201d) with Work (\u201cWe Jah people will work it out\u201d), drawing a line between Babylonians \u2013 narcissistic, ruthless controllers of society and the system \u2013 and those of positive intent. The album closes on the tune (acoustic, at Blackwell\u2019s suggestion) that would cement Marley\u2019s legend: the deep hymn of Redemption Song.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>Selassie </strong><strong>Is the Chapel (The Complete Bob Marley and the Wailers 1967-72: Vol 2)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LRlmCko58o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0LRlmCko58o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Compiled by reggae historians Roger Steffens and Bruno Blum from the Wailers\u2019 early, ill-fated period with on-again off-again manager Danny Sims and singer Johnny Nash, the complete series finally allowed fans to hear Selassie Is the Chapel.

Frankfurter Allgemeine\u2019s Christian Kamp joked that Lucien Favre, BVB\u2019s detail-driven coach, had even mapped out every move of his team\u2019s formation for the moments immediately after scoring.</p> <p>Yes, even the manner of post-goal festivities were examined forensically \u2013 when does an elbow bump go too far up the forearm, some asked \u2013 with Hertha\u2019s delight at their 3-0 win at Hoffenheim becoming a little bit too authentic. Their captain, Vedad Ibisevic, already implicated in the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/04/salomon-kalou-films-himself-breaking-covid-19-rules-with-hertha-teammates\"> now-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/04/salomon-kalou-films-himself-breaking-covid-19-rules-with-hertha-teammates\">suspended Salomon Kalou\u2019s infamous Facebook Live video</a>, hugged the assist provider Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt and his fellow forward Matheus Cunha after scoring the middle goal (which is discouraged by the DFL but not a punishable offence), with Dedryck Boyata forced into a social media apology for kissing Marko Grujic.</p> <p>\u201cThe emotions are part of [the game],\u201d said Hertha\u2019s debutant coach Bruno Labbadia. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly make sure I look after my team.\u201d</p> <p>By Sunday evening M\u00fcller, when substituted towards the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/union-berlin-bayern-munich-bundesliga-match-report\">Bayern\u2019s 2-0 win at Union Berlin</a>, got away with planting a gentle kick on the backside of the head coach Hansi Flick as an improvised salutation on his way to sit down (substitutes sit in the stand, not on the bench, with three seats between each player). M\u00fcller also dryly remarked that there was a touch of \u201cold men playing at 7pm\u201d about a dialled-down occasion, particularly at a stadium \u201cwhere the mood can tip the scales\u201d, but even if Bayern\u2019s victory required more attrition than Flick would have hoped, it seemed as if there was at least some sort of conditional new normal as the sun began to set in the capital.</p> <p>The global reaction to the Bundesliga\u2019s return was generally positive, with <em>Obrigado, Bundesliga</em> from Portugal\u2019s A Bola typical of the continent-wide relief that the raising of the curtain had passed relatively setback-free, though Spain\u2019s El Mundo Deportivo commented that it \u201cwould have been good if a minute\u2019s silence had been observed for the victims of coronavirus\u201d.

      "bodyText": "There was, said Thomas M\u00fcller, \u201ca tingling sensation because it was starting again\u201d. Not nervousness, he was quick to stress, but an opening day of the season feeling, as the Bundesliga got back out of the blocks. This time, it was with an atmosphere of the ultimate juxtaposition \u2013 in echoey stadiums, but with the whole world watching. \u201cGed\u00e4mpfte Freude\u201d \u2013 muffled joy \u2013 was how the headline in Monday\u2019s edition of Kicker put it, set across a photo of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s players saluting a cavernous, empty S\u00fcdtribune after their emphatic 4-0 Revierderby win over Schalke on Saturday afternoon. \u201cIt was spontaneous,\u201d said the midfielder Julian Brandt, and that was key to a weekend which was a string of unusual occasions. It was Brandt\u2019s teammate Erling Braut Haaland who had scored the first goal of the post-lockdown Bundesliga, a typically instinctive finish that was followed by an untypical, physically-distanced celebration by the corner flag in Signal Iduna Park\u2019s south-west corner. Frankfurter Allgemeine\u2019s Christian Kamp joked that Lucien Favre, BVB\u2019s detail-driven coach, had even mapped out every move of his team\u2019s formation for the moments immediately after scoring. Yes, even the manner of post-goal festivities were examined forensically \u2013 when does an elbow bump go too far up the forearm, some asked \u2013 with Hertha\u2019s delight at their 3-0 win at Hoffenheim becoming a little bit too authentic. Their captain, Vedad Ibisevic, already implicated in the now-suspended Salomon Kalou\u2019s infamous Facebook Live video, hugged the assist provider Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt and his fellow forward Matheus Cunha after scoring the middle goal (which is discouraged by the DFL but not a punishable offence), with Dedryck Boyata forced into a social media apology for kissing Marko Grujic. \u201cThe emotions are part of [the game],\u201d said Hertha\u2019s debutant coach Bruno Labbadia. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly make sure I look after my team.\u201d By Sunday evening M\u00fcller, when substituted towards the end of Bayern\u2019s 2-0 win at Union Berlin, got away with planting a gentle kick on the backside of the head coach Hansi Flick as an improvised salutation on his way to sit down (substitutes sit in the stand, not on the bench, with three seats between each player). M\u00fcller also dryly remarked that there was a touch of \u201cold men playing at 7pm\u201d about a dialled-down occasion, particularly at a stadium \u201cwhere the mood can tip the scales\u201d, but even if Bayern\u2019s victory required more attrition than Flick would have hoped, it seemed as if there was at least some sort of conditional new normal as the sun began to set in the capital. The global reaction to the Bundesliga\u2019s return was generally positive, with Obrigado, Bundesliga from Portugal\u2019s A Bola typical of the continent-wide relief that the raising of the curtain had passed relatively setback-free, though Spain\u2019s El Mundo Deportivo commented that it \u201cwould have been good if a minute\u2019s silence had been observed for the victims of coronavirus\u201d. The aspect not just of being entertained \u2013 and the general standard of play was way better than might have been expected after 66 days of unscheduled stoppage \u2013 but of viewing possible best practice is clear. Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s sporting director Fredi Bobic, who called the restart \u201ca historic day for the Bundesliga\u201d, also told Sky that the league could be a litmus test for all sports. \u201cWe also received a tremendous number of calls from American clubs for information,\u201d said the former Bolton striker. \u201cNot only from football clubs but also baseball, basketball and ice hockey. They all want to know how we\u2019re doing it and how we organised it. \u201c For beyond the wet-wiping of balls, electronic sensors to maintain a 1.5m distance between non-playing workers and the taking of journalists\u2019 temperatures, this was a TV hit.

      "body": "<p>China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has said his country would support a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the Covid-19 pandemic after the outbreak has been brought under control.</p> <p>Xi, speaking by video conference at the opening of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">World Health Assembly</a>, stressed that such an investigation must be conducted in an \u201cobjective and impartial manner\u201d and said Beijing would donate $2bn to the United Nations to help the global response to the outbreak. \u201cAll along we have acted with openness, transparency and responsibility,\u201d Xi said.</p> <p>Diplomatic tensions were expected to dominate the WHA, the governing body of the World Health Organization, which began a two-day meeting on Monday. More than 120 countries have backed a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/australia-wins-international-support-for-independent-coronavirus-inquiry\"> draft resolution</a> co-sponsored by the European Union and Australia calling for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19. The resolution does not specifically name China, but countries such as the US have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">accused Beijing</a> of suppressing information about the virus.</p> <p>Beijing has criticised such calls as an attempt to shift blame or politicise a global health issue. Xi\u2019s comments echo Beijing\u2019s previous statements that the international community\u2019s focus should be on cooperation and stopping the virus. In a media briefing on Monday, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described an investigation into the origins of the virus as \u201cpremature\u201d.</p> <p>China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/china-and-australia-how-a-war-of-words-over-coronavirus-turned-to-threats-of-a-trade-war\">reacted furiously</a> to Australia\u2019s earlier call for an independent investigation, retaliating by reinvigorating months-old trade disputes.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has said his country would support a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the Covid-19 pandemic after the outbreak has been brought under control. Xi, speaking by video conference at the opening of the World Health Assembly, stressed that such an investigation must be conducted in an \u201cobjective and impartial manner\u201d and said Beijing would donate $2bn to the United Nations to help the global response to the outbreak. \u201cAll along we have acted with openness, transparency and responsibility,\u201d Xi said. Diplomatic tensions were expected to dominate the WHA, the governing body of the World Health Organization, which began a two-day meeting on Monday. More than 120 countries have backed a draft resolution co-sponsored by the European Union and Australia calling for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19. The resolution does not specifically name China, but countries such as the US have accused Beijing of suppressing information about the virus. Beijing has criticised such calls as an attempt to shift blame or politicise a global health issue. Xi\u2019s comments echo Beijing\u2019s previous statements that the international community\u2019s focus should be on cooperation and stopping the virus. In a media briefing on Monday, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described an investigation into the origins of the virus as \u201cpremature\u201d. China reacted furiously to Australia\u2019s earlier call for an independent investigation, retaliating by reinvigorating months-old trade disputes. The Australian government has claimed the resolution as a victory despite suggestions from within its ranks that it had been \u201cwatered down\u201d. In a statement to the WHA, the Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said he was pleased there was support for an \u201cimpartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the global response\u201d. The Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan last December, has placed China under more scrutiny as critics call for an investigation into how the virus was able to spread across the world. It has now infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. The resolution on Covid-19 will be put forward on Tuesday if it gains backing from two-thirds of the 194 members of the assembly. \u201cChina\u2019s reluctance to allow the international community to investigate and its enthusiasm in creating all sorts of conspiracy theories pointing to non-China origins of the virus only make the world more eager to know the answer,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University in the US, with a focus on China. Allies of China such as Indonesia and Russia are among the countries demanding independent investigation, Hung noted. \u201cBeijing will find it difficult to resist without risking further damage of its international image,\u201d he said. In the run-up to the conference, calls for Taiwan to be allowed to join the meeting, led by the US, also threatened to anger Beijing, which has blocked Taiwan from attending since 2016. Joseph Wu, Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, said his country had not been invited to this week\u2019s meeting, adding that it had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. Wu said on Monday, just before the meeting began, that, after suggestions from allies and \u201clike-minded nations\u201d, Taiwan would not pursue its WHO bid for now. He expressed \u201cdeep regret and strong dissatisfaction\u201d that the WHO secretariat had \u201cyielded to pressure from the Chinese government\u201d. A report in the official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday \u201cthe US and other countries\u201d were \u201cdetermined to discuss Taiwan-related proposals for only one purpose: to politicise health issues and achieve their own interests at the expense of kidnapping the the World Health Assembly and hurting global cooperation\u201d. An article in the official People\u2019s Daily on Monday said: \u201cAny attempt to use the WHO as a tool for geopolitical games is tantamount to a challenge to humankind\u2019s right to health.\u201d An editorial in the Global Times said: \u201cA politicised appeal won\u2019t be supported at the assembly \u2026 The US has messed up its Covid-19 fight but intends to shift the responsibility on to China.

      "body": "<p>Last December I visited a charity that is very close to my heart: Acorns children\u2019s hospice.</p> <p>I had the privilege of chatting, telling stories and reading some of my poetry to an inspirational group of children and families. . And they performed some of their poetry for me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For me this is real. I\u2019ve lost two members of my family, and another couple have come close to the edge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have over the past 10 years met many children and young people using the services of this West Midlands charity. We have shared our love for poetry, talked about the importance of caring for all living beings, and our love of cake, music and Aston Villa football club.</p> <p> I am so inspired by the kids, and I also have an enormous amount of respect for the people who work there. I want to hug and kiss them, I want to tell them how much I love them, but I just shake their hands and act normal. <br><br>Not only do they care for these kids, some of whom are not expected to reach adulthood; they also look after their mums, dads, brothers and sisters, even grandparents. The existence of children\u2019s hospices is something many of us feel uncomfortable with \u2013 most people tend to associate hospices with older people. I was one of them, until I first visited.</p> <p>Those working and volunteering there do everything they can to make special memories for the children and their families. I have rarely been to a place where love, happiness and joy were so abundant. I have never felt a hint of doom or gloom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25bcd58bbd3faf1431d138dac08d5a68a029f00b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25bcd58bbd3faf1431d138dac08d5a68a029f00b/0_370_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benjamin Zephaniah at Acorns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have shared our love of cake, music and Aston Villa football club.\u2019 Benjamin Zephaniah at Acorns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Acorns Children\u2019s Hospice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m not one of those who call these times weird, strange, difficult or unprecedented. They are, but I\u2019m a vegan, animal rightist and environmentalist, so I thought a crisis such as this had to happen at some time. But since the start of this pandemic Acorns\u2019 600 or so children and young people have been on my mind. I am told most of the families are shielding their children at home, understandably doing everything to avoid them being infected with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>. <br><br>It was said that the illness is generally mild in children, but there is now evidence that children can be affected in ways the experts are only beginning to understand. This horrifies me. We all know the risks for adults with serious underlying health issues, but what about children and young people? With the emergence of a \u201cKawasaki\u201d-like<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/french-boy-dies-from-coronavirus-linked-kawasaki-diseae\"> Covid-19-linked disease</a>, I can only imagine how difficult it is for these families. They have to protect their precious children when services they rely on are no longer available, and when they are cut off from so many people who\u2019ve been been part of their support network.<br><br>We\u2019re all beginning to know more about what is happening in adult care homes, but I wonder what is happening to children\u2019s hospices all over the country. <br><br>At Acorns\u2019 three hospices, members of the public are turning up every few minutes with car-loads of donations. We\u2019re lucky to have such a giving society here in the UK.</p> <p>The staff are also reaching out to families through regular calls, letting them know they are not alone at this scary time.</p> <p>Over the course of this global emergency there have been times when we have seen the virus infect the rich and famous, powerful and influential, and humble world leaders. But as with all emergencies, it\u2019s the most vulnerable members of our community who get hit the hardest.</p> <p>I have just signed <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson-urged-launch-public-inquiry-bame-deaths-2848308\">a letter addressed to Boris Johnson</a> calling for an independent public inquiry into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">disproportionate impact</a> of Covid-19 on black and ethnic minority communities, because for me this is real. I\u2019ve lost two members of my family, and another couple have come close to the edge.</p> <p>I can\u2019t stop thinking about the kids at Acorns. I can\u2019t stop thinking about the elderly and the infirm, the young and vulnerable, the homeless, the families caring for a seriously ill baby or child.</p> <p>Once this terrible chapter comes to an end, what will the next chapter have in store? I would like to think we will retain the strong sense of compassion and community that has been so in evidence during this crisis, and try to turn our backs on division, deprivation and inequality. That\u2019s not too much to ask for, is it?</p> <p>\u2022 Benjamin Zephaniah is a poet<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Last December I visited a charity that is very close to my heart: Acorns children\u2019s hospice. I had the privilege of chatting, telling stories and reading some of my poetry to an inspirational group of children and families. . And they performed some of their poetry for me. I have over the past 10 years met many children and young people using the services of this West Midlands charity. We have shared our love for poetry, talked about the importance of caring for all living beings, and our love of cake, music and Aston Villa football club. I am so inspired by the kids, and I also have an enormous amount of respect for the people who work there. I want to hug and kiss them, I want to tell them how much I love them, but I just shake their hands and act normal. Not only do they care for these kids, some of whom are not expected to reach adulthood; they also look after their mums, dads, brothers and sisters, even grandparents. The existence of children\u2019s hospices is something many of us feel uncomfortable with \u2013 most people tend to associate hospices with older people. I was one of them, until I first visited. Those working and volunteering there do everything they can to make special memories for the children and their families. I have rarely been to a place where love, happiness and joy were so abundant. I have never felt a hint of doom or gloom. I\u2019m not one of those who call these times weird, strange, difficult or unprecedented. They are, but I\u2019m a vegan, animal rightist and environmentalist, so I thought a crisis such as this had to happen at some time. But since the start of this pandemic Acorns\u2019 600 or so children and young people have been on my mind. I am told most of the families are shielding their children at home, understandably doing everything to avoid them being infected with coronavirus. It was said that the illness is generally mild in children, but there is now evidence that children can be affected in ways the experts are only beginning to understand. This horrifies me. We all know the risks for adults with serious underlying health issues, but what about children and young people? With the emergence of a \u201cKawasaki\u201d-like Covid-19-linked disease, I can only imagine how difficult it is for these families. They have to protect their precious children when services they rely on are no longer available, and when they are cut off from so many people who\u2019ve been been part of their support network. We\u2019re all beginning to know more about what is happening in adult care homes, but I wonder what is happening to children\u2019s hospices all over the country. At Acorns\u2019 three hospices, members of the public are turning up every few minutes with car-loads of donations. We\u2019re lucky to have such a giving society here in the UK. The staff are also reaching out to families through regular calls, letting them know they are not alone at this scary time. Over the course of this global emergency there have been times when we have seen the virus infect the rich and famous, powerful and influential, and humble world leaders. But as with all emergencies, it\u2019s the most vulnerable members of our community who get hit the hardest. I have just signed a letter addressed to Boris Johnson calling for an independent public inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and ethnic minority communities, because for me this is real. I\u2019ve lost two members of my family, and another couple have come close to the edge. I can\u2019t stop thinking about the kids at Acorns. I can\u2019t stop thinking about the elderly and the infirm, the young and vulnerable, the homeless, the families caring for a seriously ill baby or child. Once this terrible chapter comes to an end, what will the next chapter have in store? I would like to think we will retain the strong sense of compassion and community that has been so in evidence during this crisis, and try to turn our backs on division, deprivation and inequality. That\u2019s not too much to ask for, is it? \u2022 Benjamin Zephaniah is a poet",

Young is not alone. Newspaper columnists such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1259963231302488070\">Allison Pearson blithely equate</a> asking schoolchildren to wear face masks with child abuse. Shutting British pubs, meanwhile, is a deprivation of liberty comparable to Communist totalitarianism.</p> <p>Particular ire is reserved for a group of people whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/doubt-essential-science-politicians-coronavirus\">profession is based on scepticism: scientists</a>. The team at Imperial College London \u2013 whose modelling predicted as many as half a million coronavirus deaths in Britain without lockdown measures \u2013 have been accused of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/lockdown-and-mathematical-guesswork/\">crude mathematical guesswork</a>\u201d. (By, er, Matt Ridley who presided over the crash at Northern Rock.)</p> <p>When the Telegraph <em>c</em>aught Neil Ferguson in breach of lockdown guidance, few were as cock-a-hoop as the paper\u2019s columnists. On social media, anti-lockdown outriders presented the professor\u2019s misdemeanours as evidence that his work was flawed. Imperial boffins had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShankerASingham/status/1257402773412470785?s=20\">ruined the economy</a>.</p> <p>It is no surprise that so many professional contrarians are paid-up lockdown sceptics. They are products of our distorted media ecosystem, which invariably privileges heat over light. For them, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about \u2013 even if what you are talking about amounts to social Darwinism.</p> <p>But the lockdown opponents are not just media \u201cpersonalities\u201d. Many of the Conservatives\u2019 most generous donors have <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8257513/Six-Tory-donors-urge-Boris-Johnson-ease-coronavirus-lockdown.html\">called for the economy to be re</a><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8257513/Six-Tory-donors-urge-Boris-Johnson-ease-coronavirus-lockdown.html\">opened</a>. (Because the views of party funders are, of course, a crucial consideration in a public health emergency.)</p> <p>Politicians have joined the chorus, too. David Davis \u2013 who still seems to believe that Brexit Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/08/german-industry-warns-uk-over-brexit\">will be saved by</a> the political clout of German car manufacturers \u2013 has become a convert to the sceptic cause. The former cabinet minister Steve Baker has called on his prime minister to end the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/03/boris-johnson-must-end-absurd-dystopian-tyrannical-lockdown2/\">absurd, dystopian and tyrannical lockdown</a>\u201d. Their colleague Daniel Kawczynski would like to see the Welsh Assembly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-52636162\">abolished</a> so his constituents can get to the seaside.</p> <p>How long before a British parliamentarian goes full \u201cplandemic\u201d and wonders aloud if Covid-19 is all a conspiracy? Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan and Maria Caulfield have already shown a fondness for sharing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/labour-urges-tory-mps-to-admit-keir-starmer-video-was-doctored\">far-right talking points</a>. Whoever does will doubtless receive far more column inches than the attention-seeking Irish politician, Mattie McGrath, who asked last week if the pandemic was \u201ca great con\u201d and was roundly ignored in local media, save a <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/miriam-lord-kelly-on-code-red-in-the-search-for-a-covid-19-villain-1.4253869\">savage lampooning</a>.</p> <p>Polls suggest that lockdown scepticism is very much a minority sport, but recent British history shows how quickly fringe views can become mainstream. When the former MEP and prominent Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan first got on board with Euroscepticism, it was a fringe concern. Now he is one of the guiding lights of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU \u2013 and, as it happens, a vocal lockdown critic, who <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2020/02/daniel-hannan-alarmism-doom-mongering-panic-and-the-coronavirus-we-are-nowhere-near-a-1919-style-catastrophe.html\">insouciantly proclaimed</a> in February: \u201cI\u2019m going to stick my neck out here. You\u2019re unlikely to be killed by the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>The echoes of Brexit in all this aren\u2019t hard to spot. The disavowal of expertise. The pitting of \u201cthe elite\u201d against \u201cthe people\u201d. It is striking that while by no means all Brexiters are lockdown sceptics, almost all lockdown sceptics are Brexiters. Having chastised the government for inaction in early March, Nigel Farage now demands a return to liberty for all. On social media, Brexit moneybags Arron Banks\u2019s Leave.EU is among the most belligerent anti-lockdown voices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-tests-advised-for-people-who-lose-taste-or-smell\">UK coronavirus tests advised for people who lose taste or smell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is easy to dismiss the lockdown sceptics as a rag-tag bunch bound together by instinctive contrarianism, libertarian ideology, vested interests and a fear of a shift towards big state Conservatism. But they have already succeeded in shifting public discourse \u2013 far-right activists have been organising anti-lockdown demonstrations in London. We may come to a point where there is almost no \u201cexpertise\u201d that cannot be somehow discredited by this brand of \u201cscepticism\u201d. And given the platform and power many of the people peddling it possess, they can attempt to make anyone look like a hypocrite or a useful idiot, undermining any sense of truth.</p> <p>There is so much to be rightly sceptical about right now. There is indeed plenty wrong with Britain\u2019s lockdown. Our government has just given private tech firms \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/we-need-urgent-answers-about-massive-nhs-covid-data-deal/\">unprecedented\u201d access</a> to our personal health data. Consultancy giants have been awarded massive contracts for PPE and testing without any open tender process. And how have so many businesses been able to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/boris-johnson-lockdown-work-guidelines\">exploit loopholes in lockdown restrictions</a>, forcing low-paid workers to work without adequate safety provision?</p> <p>These are the questions any self-respecting sceptic should be asking.</p> <p>Instead, the \u201clockdown sceptics\u201d are hoping to win a narrative battle, to shape what comes next. Britain\u2019s success \u2013 such as it is \u2013 in curtailing deaths will be adduced as proof that the lockdown restrictions were unnecessary. The experts cannot be trusted. The cure was worse than the disease.</p> <p>Carl Sagan would take one look at these contemporary sceptics and declare \u201cbaloney\u201d. It is high time we did likewise.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Peter Geoghegan is investigations editor of openDemocracy and author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, out in August.

The team at Imperial College London \u2013 whose modelling predicted as many as half a million coronavirus deaths in Britain without lockdown measures \u2013 have been accused of \u201ccrude mathematical guesswork\u201d. (By, er, Matt Ridley who presided over the crash at Northern Rock.) When the Telegraph caught Neil Ferguson in breach of lockdown guidance, few were as cock-a-hoop as the paper\u2019s columnists. On social media, anti-lockdown outriders presented the professor\u2019s misdemeanours as evidence that his work was flawed. Imperial boffins had ruined the economy. It is no surprise that so many professional contrarians are paid-up lockdown sceptics. They are products of our distorted media ecosystem, which invariably privileges heat over light. For them, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about \u2013 even if what you are talking about amounts to social Darwinism. But the lockdown opponents are not just media \u201cpersonalities\u201d. Many of the Conservatives\u2019 most generous donors have called for the economy to be reopened. (Because the views of party funders are, of course, a crucial consideration in a public health emergency.) Politicians have joined the chorus, too. David Davis \u2013 who still seems to believe that Brexit Britain will be saved by the political clout of German car manufacturers \u2013 has become a convert to the sceptic cause. The former cabinet minister Steve Baker has called on his prime minister to end the \u201cabsurd, dystopian and tyrannical lockdown\u201d. Their colleague Daniel Kawczynski would like to see the Welsh Assembly abolished so his constituents can get to the seaside. How long before a British parliamentarian goes full \u201cplandemic\u201d and wonders aloud if Covid-19 is all a conspiracy? Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan and Maria Caulfield have already shown a fondness for sharing far-right talking points. Whoever does will doubtless receive far more column inches than the attention-seeking Irish politician, Mattie McGrath, who asked last week if the pandemic was \u201ca great con\u201d and was roundly ignored in local media, save a savage lampooning. Polls suggest that lockdown scepticism is very much a minority sport, but recent British history shows how quickly fringe views can become mainstream. When the former MEP and prominent Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan first got on board with Euroscepticism, it was a fringe concern. Now he is one of the guiding lights of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU \u2013 and, as it happens, a vocal lockdown critic, who insouciantly proclaimed in February: \u201cI\u2019m going to stick my neck out here. You\u2019re unlikely to be killed by the coronavirus.\u201d The echoes of Brexit in all this aren\u2019t hard to spot. The disavowal of expertise. The pitting of \u201cthe elite\u201d against \u201cthe people\u201d. It is striking that while by no means all Brexiters are lockdown sceptics, almost all lockdown sceptics are Brexiters. Having chastised the government for inaction in early March, Nigel Farage now demands a return to liberty for all. On social media, Brexit moneybags Arron Banks\u2019s Leave.EU is among the most belligerent anti-lockdown voices. It is easy to dismiss the lockdown sceptics as a rag-tag bunch bound together by instinctive contrarianism, libertarian ideology, vested interests and a fear of a shift towards big state Conservatism. But they have already succeeded in shifting public discourse \u2013 far-right activists have been organising anti-lockdown demonstrations in London. We may come to a point where there is almost no \u201cexpertise\u201d that cannot be somehow discredited by this brand of \u201cscepticism\u201d. And given the platform and power many of the people peddling it possess, they can attempt to make anyone look like a hypocrite or a useful idiot, undermining any sense of truth. There is so much to be rightly sceptical about right now. There is indeed plenty wrong with Britain\u2019s lockdown. Our government has just given private tech firms \u201cunprecedented\u201d access to our personal health data. Consultancy giants have been awarded massive contracts for PPE and testing without any open tender process. And how have so many businesses been able to exploit loopholes in lockdown restrictions, forcing low-paid workers to work without adequate safety provision? These are the questions any self-respecting sceptic should be asking. Instead, the \u201clockdown sceptics\u201d are hoping to win a narrative battle, to shape what comes next. Britain\u2019s success \u2013 such as it is \u2013 in curtailing deaths will be adduced as proof that the lockdown restrictions were unnecessary. The experts cannot be trusted. The cure was worse than the disease. Carl Sagan would take one look at these contemporary sceptics and declare \u201cbaloney\u201d. It is high time we did likewise. \u2022 Peter Geoghegan is investigations editor of openDemocracy and author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, out in August.

      "bodyText": "The reopening of schools in 22 European countries has not led to any significant increase in coronavirus infections among children, parents or staff, a videoconference meeting of education ministers from around the EU has heard. With a debate raging in the UK over the risks of allowing children back into the classroom, some member states are planning summer lessons to aid pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Of the 22 countries where schools have reopened in waves over the last month, 17 have only allowed children to return to kindergarten settings, primary schools and final years of secondary level as part of a tentative lifting of the lockdowns imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Twenty countries have ensured that pupils leaving secondary school have been able to take examinations albeit in amended formats. The vast majority of the reopened schools have been open for just a fortnight, however, prompting Bla\u017eenka Divjak, the minister for education in Croatia, which holds the EU\u2019s rolling presidency, to suggest that the positive results need to be treated with some caution. Denmark became the first European country to tentatively reopen its nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools on 15 April after a month-long closure despite significant resistance from parents who accused the government of treating their children as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d. Divjak, speaking in a press conference at the end of the meeting of ministers, said the lack of significant increase in cases or any other negative impact should also be seen in the context of the special measures taken to make schools as safe as possible. She said: \u201cWhat has been emphasised very strongly is that these schools [have] very highly guarded conditions like smaller groups than in normal classes, usually groups of around 15 and \u2026 very close cooperation with health ministries and epidemiological services on a national level to provide schools and teachers and parents with very detailed recommendations on how to deal with the new situation. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t heard anything negative about the reopening of schools but it is probably too early to have final conclusions on that.\u201d The update on the state of play in the 27 EU member states came as France\u2019s education minister told parents it was more of a risk keeping their children at home than sending them to school now the strict lockdown had ended. Jean-Michel Blanquer was speaking as a second wave of pupils returned to secondary schools. Blanquer said the government\u2019s priority was to avoid youngsters who struggle at school or at home becoming \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of the Covid-19 crisis. At the start of the second week of the easing of France\u2019s strict eight-week lockdown, it was the turn of the two lower secondary school years to return to classes but only in \u201cgreen\u201d areas on the Covid-19 map where the virus has stopped circulating widely and hospital intensive care units are not under pressure. The Paris area is still \u201cred\u201d on the map along with a large part of eastern France, where pupils at secondary schools \u2013 known in France as \u201ccolleges\u201d \u2013 were told to remain at home. About 145,000 pupils from the two lower high school classes \u2013 6\u00e8me (ages 11-12) and 5\u00e8me (12-13) \u2013 were expected back in class in 4,000 secondary schools in the green zones on Monday. After visiting a secondary school in the Eure district in western France, Blanquer sought to reassure parents worried about allowing their children back. \u201cThere are always worries and questions, but even so we should not push school to one side in this current difficult period, because there will be terrible damage if we lose a generation of children who have been stopped from going to school for several months,\u201d Blanquer told journalists. \u201cIt\u2019s important to underline today\u2019s good news \u2026 the return to school is happening progressively, and not everyone is going back at the same time, but it\u2019s a start and an important start.\u201d Blanquer added he hoped to be able to reopen schools in the red zone and classes for older pupils in secondary and high schools soon. In an interview with RTL radio, Blanquer revealed that 70 cases of Covid-19 had been diagnosed since 40,000 primary and nursery schools reopened last week. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable this sort of thing will happen, but it\u2019s a minority,\u201d he said. \u201cIn almost all the cases, this happened outside of the school.\u201d Blanquer said the schools concerned had closed but added that not going to school was more of a risk than the virus. \u201cMany doctors say it is less dangerous to go to school than to stay at home. Our children mustn\u2019t be the victims of collateral damage of our health measures,\u201d Blanquer said. He said 70% of pupils were still following classes at home, but that an estimated 500,000 youngsters were in danger of \u201cdropping out\u201d. \u201cThis phenomenon is my main worry and above all it affects children from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have to get society used to going back to school. It\u2019s not a minor issue; it\u2019s fundamental.\u201d A decision when to open the other secondary school years and lyc\u00e9es will be taken by the end of this month, with a possible return at the beginning of June. Most schools break up for two months of summer holidays at the beginning of July. About 25 Covid-19 clusters have been reported since the end of the French lockdown on 11 May, but the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said it will be two weeks before the authorities know if there has been a second wave of cases. A total of 28,108 deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus in France since March.",

But the challenges are huge \u2013 not just the logistical feat of building new green transport infrastructure, but also persuading people to use it \u2013 and ensuring it does not come at an intolerable cost for the most vulnerable. As part of the plan in London, officials have temporarily stopped free travel for children and will charge over-60s to travel at peak times as part of a deal to secure a \u00a31.6bn bailout from the government. Angus Satow from Labour for a Green New Deal warned the bailout would lead to a hike in fares, make travel for under-18s much harder and reduce the rights of the disabled and elderly people. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see parts of London going car-free.

The idea of a 15-minute city \u2013 where everything you need is on or near your doorstep \u2013 has been championed by the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to help achieve an \u201cecological transformation\u201d of French capital. In London last week, some of the challenges of achieving such changes were apparent as images circulated of Londoners crowding on to buses and tubes to return to work. Dr Rachel Aldred, academic and transport expert at the University of Westminster, said: \u201cYou look at the people who are being told to go back to work, people who travel by public transport and don\u2019t have many alternatives \u2013 bus commuters in particular, who are disproportionately lower income, [from ethnic minorities], women \u2013 these are people who are suffering most at the moment but also have the most to benefit in terms of creating cleaner, more equitable, more liveable cities.\u201d Aldred said authorities must act swiftly and that a combination of dedicated bike lanes, particularly along main roads and bus routes, a rollout of e-bikes and e-scooters, and networks of pedestrianised or semi-pedestrianised neighbourhoods could bring huge benefits not just to city centres but to more deprived neighbourhoods that had the most to gain. \u201cI can see a virtuous circle where if we get this right, in two years\u2019 time, we will have more liveable neighbourhoods in our towns and cities.\u201d Aldred said that although cycling was often seen as a \u201ccity thing\u201d, many of the UK\u2019s towns and smaller urban areas were better suited to cycle networks. \u201cThe journeys people make to the shops or work or for leisure in towns are often shorter than in cities so creating safe walking and cycling routes could transform how people move around.\u201d She called on the government not only to provide financial support to local authorities who might not have direct experience of setting up these alternative transport systems, but also to set up a centre of excellence to provide practical advice. So far the government has backed an increase in active travel. New guidance was issued by the Department for Transport saying it expected councils to give more road space to cycling and walking.

For those who still need to make journeys by car, a relatively modest investment in charging infrastructure could see the UK follow in the footsteps of Norway, which has seen a revolution in electric car uptake in the past five years. \u201cFor electric cars the technology is basically there \u2013 it\u2019s a question of ensuring that those who need it have access, rather than electric cars being a minority middle-class status symbol,\u201d said Aldred. \u201cFor short to medium-distance trips, though, many people should be able to use a bike or e-bike rather than a car or e-car, so infrastructure for bikes of all types \u2013 much cheaper, greener, and more efficient than e-cars \u2013 should be prioritised.\u201d For many city dwellers across the UK, that is fast becoming a more realistic option. The Scottish government has announced \u00a310m to create pop-up walking and cycling routes and in Greater Manchester council leaders have unveiled plans to give more space for people walking and cycling, including the pedestrianisation of part of Deansgate, in the city centre. Back in London, as bike lanes spring up along Euston Road and Park Lane, and some major roads are closed to cars, Norman insists the capital has entered a new, dynamic era. \u201cIf it works, great \u2013 if not, then fail fast \u2026 this a radically different way of looking at our street space.\u201d And whatever emerges from the crisis, he is adamant there is no going back. \u201cOnce people have less pollution, can hear birdsong and cycle safely on a street they want it for their neighbourhood \u2026 These are things people are beginning to appreciate and will want to keep.\u201d",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other European countries followed suit on Monday.

      "bodyText": "Italians enjoyed their first meal out for two months on Monday, as the country eased its lockdown restrictions, with bars, restaurants and cafes back in business and St Peter\u2019s basilica in the Vatican open for visitors. After a gruelling lockdown period during the coronavirus pandemic, Italians were once again able to sip cappuccino and cold beers \u2013 albeit at a physical distance from other customers. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked for two and a half months. It\u2019s a beautiful, exciting day,\u201d Valentino Casanova, a barman in Caffe Canova in Rome\u2019s central Piazza del Popolo, told Reuters. A handful of visitors, including nuns, queued up outside St Peter\u2019s for the first time since 10 March. Police officers wearing face masks checked temperatures before allowing them to enter. Masses in churches across Rome also resumed. Worshippers sat apart on disinfected pews. In Venice gondoliers wearing face masks ferried passengers along the Grand Canal, while mothers with small children sat in cafes overlooking the Rialto. Clients in Milan got their hair done, while local markets in the city of Salerno reopened. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, described the ending of national curbs as a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d. Italy was the first European country to go into full lockdown, more than two months ago. It is now returning to a semi-normality, after nearly 32,000 deaths. Its economy has shrunk by 10%. Other European countries followed suit on Monday. Spain indicated that it would allow tourists to return from the end of June and Poland allowed restaurants to reopen as part of its third phase of lockdown easing. Greece welcomed the first visitors back to the Acropolis. Workers in masks and plastic face shields stood around the archaeological site in Athens, reminding people to keep apart as they entered through turnstiles. The country has recorded only 156 deaths from Covid-19. The president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, visited the Acropolis on Monday. She hailed it as \u201ca world monument that continues to inspire with its marbles shining under the sun\u201d. Greeks are now allowed to travel freely and to visit the country\u2019s two biggest islands, Crete and Evia. Shopping malls and zoos have reopened, together with sports facilities for those aged over 13. Wearing of masks is recommended but not compulsory, except on buses and trains. In Spain, almost three-quarters of the country progressed to the second phase of lockdown de-escalation. Millions of people were able to meet up in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe or restaurant terraces. In Valencia masked waiters laid out tables overlooking the municipal beach. The transport minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, said the country would end two-week quarantine restrictions at the end of June, and would fully reopen its borders. The move would take place at the same time internal travel restrictions were phased out. \u201cFrom late June, we\u2019ll start the tourism activity, I hope,\u201d \u00c1balos said. \u201cWe must make Spain an attractive country from the health point of view.\u201d The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area remain in the preliminary phase of what the government has called \u201cthe transition towards the new normality\u201d. The health ministry said that despite \u201chuge progress\u201d in and around the capital, the region would not yet be able to join the 70% of the country in the next phase. People in Barcelona and parts of the Castilla y L\u00e9on region will also remain in the so-called phase zero for the time being. Churches and cathedrals in some areas of Spain have been open and operating at the required 30% capacity for a week, but the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona\u2019s most visited tourist attraction, remains closed. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from coronavirus was 59 on Monday, the lowest figure in two months, the government said. The cumulative total rose to 27,709, with 231,350 confirmed cases of the virus. Over the weekend the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said his Socialist-led coalition would be seeking a final, month-long extension of the state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. Meanwhile, Ireland took a cautious step on Monday towards easing its lockdown by allowing some businesses to reopen and up to four people from different households to meet as long as they respected physical distancing. Gardening centres, hardware stores, bicycle repair shops and outdoor construction are among the handful of sectors cranking back to life, in the first phase of a five-stage plan to lift restrictions spread out over three-week intervals, with the fifth and final phase due to start on 10 August. \u201cWe all need to approach the coming days with care and caution, and to show some collective cop-on,\u201d said Simon Harris, the health minister, using an Irish term for common sense. \u201cWe want the shops to stay open, so there\u2019s no need to rush down to your local DIY centre or garden shop today.\u201d On Sunday the country reported 64 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest daily figure since mid-March. Testing and contact tracing has expanded, bolstering confidence in the ability to monitor and contain outbreaks.",

Christian Oyakhilome, a Nigerian pastor, founded the network\u2019s associated church, Christ Embassy, in Lagos in 1987. The church has at least 90 branches in the UK and an estimated 13 million followers around the world.

A presenter described the development as \u201cgood news\u201d according to the regulator. Oyakhilome has been critical of the lockdown measures that have forced places of worship to close around the world, and has himself propagated conspiracy theories about the virus. About 30,000 people attend his main branch in Lagos, the Nigerian coastal metropolis where a lockdown has been imposed since the end of March. In sermons in recent weeks, Oyakhilome has regularly cast doubt on the need for lockdowns, describing them and the wearing of protective face masks as unscientific. In one LoveWorld programme, he pointed to an image showing a link between 5G and the virus, saying: \u201cThis is real. The power is so much that plants that were close to the cells that were already set up in certain streets burnt.\u201d Last year Christ Embassy was condemned by the UK\u2019s charity watchdog, which found that there had been \u201cserious misconduct\u201d in the way that it was run. The Charity Commission found that Christ Embassy had made a large number of \u201cinformal grants and payments\u201d, including more than \u00a31.2m to LoveWorld TV between 2009-2011. Last month, Ofcom confirmed it was actively monitoring television and radio stations that might be broadcasting potentially harmful views about the causes and origins of Covid-19 that have \u201cthe potential to undermine people\u2019s trust in the advice of mainstream sources of information\u201d during the crisis. False claims that coronavirus is linked to 5G have spread widely around the world in recent months on several social media platforms.",

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old boy stabbed another teenager to death with a \u201cRambo-style\u201d knife during an argument over a phone charger, a jury has heard. The defendant, who cannot be identified due to his age, is accused of murdering Tyrone Hayman, 17, in Bristol. Jurors heard the pair were in Tyrone\u2019s flat in Bedminster, south of the city centre, when the incident took place shortly before 1.30pm on 14 December. The trial of the boy, who denies murder, is the first to take place at Bristol crown court since the Covid-19 lockdown. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said: \u201cThe two of them had an argument over the use of a phone charger that they were both using. \u201cDuring the argument, the defendant picked up a knife and he stabbed Tyrone. The knife went into Tyrone\u2019s chest and through to his heart. Tyrone ran out into the street. \u201cParamedics were shortly on scene but there was nothing that could be done to save his life.\u201d He said the defendant cycled away from the flat. Vaitilingam told jurors there was \u201cno dispute\u201d that the defendant had stabbed Tyrone. He said the boy initially refused to answer questions from police but had since provided a statement to the court. \u201cIt claims that the stabbing was an accident,\u201d Vaitilingam said. \u201cHe says he was holding the knife when Tyrone came towards him play-fighting. He says Tyrone accidentally impaled himself on the knife.\u201d Vaitilingam said it would be for jurors to decide whether the incident was murder or a \u201cterrible accident\u201d. The court heard that a girl in the flat with Tyrone and the defendant described the weapon as a \u201cRambo-style\u201d knife. She told police that the knife, which has never been recovered, belonged to the defendant. A postmortem examination found Tyrone died from a single stab wound to the left side of his chest. Before the case was opened, the judge, Mr Justice Garnham, spoke to jurors about how the court would operate. He said the trial was one of the first in England and Wales to take place since the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe criminal justice system is a vital part of how we live together as a community and your role as jurors is a vital part of that system,\u201d the judge told the panel. Every person attending court was asked to confirm that they did not have any symptoms of coronavirus. The judge said anyone who sneezed or coughed must use a tissue, dispose of it carefully and sanitise their hands. \u201cYou will already have experienced and seen the way that this building and courtroom have been adapted,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a one-way system around the courthouse and marked areas with seats and tables to maintain social distancing.\u201d Jurors were seated around the court, 2 metres apart, rather than in the jury box. Three courtrooms, which will be regularly cleaned and ventilated, will be used for the case. The trial, which is expected to last up to five days, continues.",

      "body": "<p>With support for Angela Merkel\u2019s governing coalition surging during the coronavirus pandemic, Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, has opted for a vicious bout of public infighting that could split the party in two.</p> <p>The national board of the anti-immigration AfD narrowly voted last Friday to strip party membership from Andreas Kalbitz, a key networker on the rabidly nationalist fringes of the party\u2019s eastern German branches.</p> <p>Kalbitz, a 47-year-old former professional soldier who heads the AfD in Brandenburg, was ousted over allegedly declining to inform the party of his former membership of a banned neo-Nazi group, German Youths Loyal to the Fatherland, when applying to join the party in 2013. He was last year also revealed to have been named by the German embassy in Athens as one of 14 neo-Nazis who travelled to the Greek capital in 2007 for a far-right rally.</p> <p>The AfD has struggled to formulate a coherent stance on the coronavirus and failed to leverage a grassroots anti-lockdown movement, and the expulsion of Kalbitz has caused a split through the party\u2019s leadership and set eastern against western delegates.</p> <p>The move was driven by J\u00f6rg Meuthen, an AfD co-leader from the party\u2019s middle-class libertarian wing.

      "bodyText": "With support for Angela Merkel\u2019s governing coalition surging during the coronavirus pandemic, Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, has opted for a vicious bout of public infighting that could split the party in two. The national board of the anti-immigration AfD narrowly voted last Friday to strip party membership from Andreas Kalbitz, a key networker on the rabidly nationalist fringes of the party\u2019s eastern German branches. Kalbitz, a 47-year-old former professional soldier who heads the AfD in Brandenburg, was ousted over allegedly declining to inform the party of his former membership of a banned neo-Nazi group, German Youths Loyal to the Fatherland, when applying to join the party in 2013. He was last year also revealed to have been named by the German embassy in Athens as one of 14 neo-Nazis who travelled to the Greek capital in 2007 for a far-right rally. The AfD has struggled to formulate a coherent stance on the coronavirus and failed to leverage a grassroots anti-lockdown movement, and the expulsion of Kalbitz has caused a split through the party\u2019s leadership and set eastern against western delegates. The move was driven by J\u00f6rg Meuthen, an AfD co-leader from the party\u2019s middle-class libertarian wing. The former economics professor represents the kind of conservatives who founded the party in protest against Greek bailout payments in 2013, and who previously defended the more extremist positions held by its politicians in the formerly socialist east by claiming their radicalism was exaggerated by the media. But since the German domestic intelligence agency\u2019s designation in March of an AfD faction known as the Wing (Fl\u00fcgel) as a far-right extremist group warranting state surveillance, their alliance has been under strain. \u201cWe are a traditional conservative party,\u201d Meuthen told ARD public television. \u201cWe need to demonstrate cohesion but we also need to clearly distance ourselves from extreme-right positions.\u201d On Saturday night, the Thuringian party leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, posted a video on Facebook in which he described the push to expel his ally Kalbitz as a \u201cpolitical act\u201d on behalf of Meuthen and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. H\u00f6cke, who is seen as the figurehead of the AfD\u2019s nationalist v\u00f6lkisch tendency, added: \u201cI won\u2019t allow the division and destruction of our party.\u201d Which side of the party will succeed in pushing out the other remains unclear. The AfD\u2019s other co-leader, Tino Chrupalla, and its two parliamentary leaders, Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland, were reportedly against ousting Kalbitz, who has vowed to take legal action against his expulsion and on Monday announced he would stay on as a member of the AfD\u2019s delegation in the Brandenburg state parliament. To complicate proceedings further, the original 2013 membership application in which Kalbitz had allegedly failed to acknowledge his neo-Nazi past appears to have gone missing. The AfD has been the largest opposition force in Germany\u2019s parliament since the 2017 elections. But the party\u2019s fortunes have plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic, with several recent polls putting its share of the vote below 10%. For Merkel the pandemic has prompted a political comeback. Her personal approval ratings have shot up on the back of a crisis management perceived as calm and competent, and her Christian Democratic Union party leads the polls on about 38% of the vote. The AfD, a populist outfit that in the past excelled at pinning the blame for complex geopolitical developments to single actors or ethnic groups, has wavered between accusing the Merkel government of shutting down the country\u2019s borders too late and accusing it of not lifting the lockdown earlier. On social media, Chrupalla has demanded a \u201creopening of the economy\u201d while simultaneously opposing proposed measures to control the spread of the coronavirus after lockdown restrictions are eased, such as contact tracing apps, immunity passports and mandatory vaccinations. The AfD has so far failed to exploit a burgeoning anti-lockdown protest movement that has brought together conspiracy theorists from the far right and the far left. In April, protest organisers claimed they had registered a new political party called Widerstand2020 (\u201cResistance2020\u201d) with which they would seek to enter the Bundestag in 2021.",

Asked whether the NHS app was working, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe are closely studying the first phase of the rollout and expect to be able to improve the app based on user feedback from the Isle of Wight. As with any tech project of this size, you would expect us to keep all options under review to make sure the app is as effective as possible.\u201d",

Eric Trump claimed Democrats were using the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed nearly 90,000 in America, for political gain. Both claims were made on Saturday. In the face of fierce opprobrium, Trump Jr said he had been \u201cjoking around\u201d.

On Monday, the Associated Press reported on how the Trump campaign is revving up \u201csmokescreen\u201d efforts to distract voters from the pandemic and economic crisis as the election gathers pace. Attacks on Biden such as those pursued by Trump Jr are thereby part of a wide-ranging attempt to echo attacks on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s opponent in 2016.

      "body": "<p>In AD 79, a society that thought it was modern, sophisticated and fully in control of its destiny was taught otherwise by nature. Sounds familiar? The eruption of Vesuvius that overwhelmed Pompeii, Herculaneum and many villas dotted around the Bay of Naples caught the Roman empire by surprise. The parallels with the coronavirus crisis are uncanny. So the British Museum\u2019s release this week of <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/pompeii-live\">Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum</a>, an online tour of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/26/life-and-death-pompeii-review\">harrowing 2013 blockbuster </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/26/life-and-death-pompeii-review\">show</a>, offers a troubling gaze into history\u2019s mirror.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/26/life-and-death-pompeii-review\">Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like the Pompeiians before us, we have been caught unprepared. The people there were proud of their fertile and even divine mountain \u2013 until it erupted. Their bodies have been cast from cavities in the hardened ash, huddled against the volcano\u2019s torrent of choking heat. Why did they not see this coming? Well, why didn\u2019t we?</p> <p>The exhibition, which you can revisit in this special screening of a filmed private view, brought together astonishing evidence of the wealth and comforts of Pompeii the moment before disaster. Frescoes and sculptures from bedrooms, dining rooms and even gardens revealed the style and splendour of wealthy homes in Pompeii.

      "bodyText": "In AD 79, a society that thought it was modern, sophisticated and fully in control of its destiny was taught otherwise by nature. Sounds familiar? The eruption of Vesuvius that overwhelmed Pompeii, Herculaneum and many villas dotted around the Bay of Naples caught the Roman empire by surprise. The parallels with the coronavirus crisis are uncanny. So the British Museum\u2019s release this week of Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum, an online tour of its harrowing 2013 blockbuster show, offers a troubling gaze into history\u2019s mirror. Like the Pompeiians before us, we have been caught unprepared. The people there were proud of their fertile and even divine mountain \u2013 until it erupted. Their bodies have been cast from cavities in the hardened ash, huddled against the volcano\u2019s torrent of choking heat. Why did they not see this coming? Well, why didn\u2019t we? The exhibition, which you can revisit in this special screening of a filmed private view, brought together astonishing evidence of the wealth and comforts of Pompeii the moment before disaster. Frescoes and sculptures from bedrooms, dining rooms and even gardens revealed the style and splendour of wealthy homes in Pompeii. Cookware, heaters, couches and lamps from pubs, shops and baths enhance the image of a world engagingly similar to our own. Anyone lucky enough to have walked the streets of Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum today will have felt this.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis will hopefully now be another measure by which the pandemic can be contained, especially as in some people it may be the only symptom or may precede other symptoms.

There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>M&amp;S said the sanitisers were initially priced at \u00a315 by mistake but the new \u00a311.50 cost is still significantly more than similar products sold elsewhere.

It was a question of logistics \u2013 the capacity wasn\u2019t there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers \u2013 simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice.</p> <p>This is odd because on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzvOwF48z4s\">15 March</a> he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK\u2019s \u201cworld-class\u201d modelling for the outbreak. Later, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fOUD_xw_60\">interviewed </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fOUD_xw_60\">again</a> on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between \u201cclamping down\u201d and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was \u201ccoming from the modelling community\u201d.</p> <p>This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government\u2019s decision on 12 March, when the UK had <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/\">590 confirmed active cases</a> and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">R value</a> \u2013 the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec2aee28f0886ce4f5d5d9b#block-5ec2aee28f0886ce4f5d5d9b\">nearly 35,000 people</a>, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1262407386884706305\">62,000</a>.</p> <p>Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline \u2013 a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI \u2013 scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn\u2019t listen to advice from the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---12-march-2020\">said</a>: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over \u2013 we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now.</p> <p>Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: everyone aged five and over now eligible for a test, Matt Hancock tells MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases.

      "bodyText": "A week ago Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee review of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response, said that some actions represented \u201cthe biggest failure of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetime\u201d. Last Thursday, when pressed by Kirsty Wark on BBC\u2019s Newsnight about why the community test, trace and isolate strategy in tackling the pandemic was abandoned as a policy on 12 March, Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), was commendably open and honest: \u201cI do not remember the truth of that [what Sage said] on 12 March \u2026 [but] testing has been critical for every country that has controlled the epidemic \u2026 in retrospect it was [a mistake] \u2026 we should have been testing earlier.\u201d On Saturday, however, when Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, and another core member of Sage, was asked the same question on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he responded differently. \u201cAdvice from the scientific community was always to test as much as possible,\u201d he said. It was a question of logistics \u2013 the capacity wasn\u2019t there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers \u2013 simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice. This is odd because on 15 March he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK\u2019s \u201cworld-class\u201d modelling for the outbreak. Later, when interviewed again on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between \u201cclamping down\u201d and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was \u201ccoming from the modelling community\u201d. This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government\u2019s decision on 12 March, when the UK had 590 confirmed active cases and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline R value \u2013 the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at nearly 35,000 people, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than 62,000. Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments. It\u2019s clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline \u2013 a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI \u2013 scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn\u2019t listen to advice from the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, said: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over \u2013 we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now. Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately. Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases. Four months into this epidemic, we are not even close to having a system ready for lifting the lockdown. As an editorial in last week\u2019s British Medical Journal declared: \u201cMeaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, divert focus and could lead to more deaths.\u201d The government has thus far provided the names of 60 contributors to Sage \u2013 but its core decision-making group should also be listed. Over the last two months, the British public has complied with social distancing meticulously. It has witnessed, at first hand, the greatest public health disaster in a century, and the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including more than 180 health workers and volunteers, and more than 200 care workers. The public deserves the hard data, scientific opinions and the minutes of Sage meetings \u2013 not recollections in the media from senior members \u2013 to help us all understand how we got here. \u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health at UCL, and a former director at the World Health Organization",

That can be a signal to the immune system to destroy the pathogen, but doesn\u2019t actually stop it on its own.</p> <p>They\u2019re different to <strong>neutralising antibodies</strong>, which bind to the virus and also prevent it replicating (because they \u2018stick\u2019 to the pathogen in a way that neutralises it). </p> <p>Moderna only has neutralising antibody results for <strong>eight </strong><strong>participants </strong>-- four with small doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine client and four at a larger dose.

      "bodyText": "And finally.... here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s stock market action: Goodnight. GW Time for a recap Global stock markets have enjoyed one of their best days since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, on hopes that stricken economies will return to more normal times soon. A day that began with Japan sliding into recession has brightened considerably, thanks to biotech firm Moderna. It reported encouraging early signs that its candidate Covid-19 vaccine could be effective. Early testing has showed that it produced antibodies to neutralise the virus in eight patients - encouraging Moderna to press on with larger trials. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell also boosted market confidence, by insisting that he has more ammunition to support the US economy if needed. Powell also warned that America could shrink by 20-30% this quarter, before starting to recover. France and Germany also fuelled the rally, by surprisingly backing plans for a \u20ac500bn reconstruction fund backed by collective borrowing. This all drove markets sharply higher, with the FTSE 100 posting its third-best day since the crisis began - up nearly 4.3% tonight. Oil prices also rallied sharply, lifted by hopes of a pick-up in demand. Gold also strengthened, hitting a seven-year high as some traders anticipated a surge in inflation once the pandemic is over. But there was gloom too. Germany\u2019s Bundesbank warned that the economic slump will intensify this quarter, after Europe\u2019s largest economy fell into recession late last week. In the UK, property firm Intu asked its lenders to relax the covenants on its loans after it suffered a slump in rental payments from stricken retailers. Budget airline Ryanair also savaged the UK government\u2019s handling of the crisis... while discount supermarket chain Aldi teamed up with Deliveroo. Our main UK Covid-19 liveblog is here, along with our global rolling coverage of the crisis: Wall Street is holding onto its strong gains too, with the Dow up 820 points or 3.4% at 24,505. But some of the companies who\u2019ve thrived in the lockdown, such as video streaming service Netflix and video conferencing site Zoom, are missing out on the rally. That\u2019s a clear sign that traders are anticipating a return to more normal economic times. European stock markets have also posted very strong gains tonight, after a late surge as the Macron-Merkel news hit the wires. Investors like the sound of a \u20ac500bn European Recovery Fund to fund economic reconstruction in parts of the EU most ravaged by Covid-19. Particularly if it comes as grants covered by all EC members (as today\u2019s announcement appears to suggest...) Here\u2019s the full closing prices: German DAX: up 593 points or 5.7% at 11,058 French CAC: up 220 points or 5.1% at 4,498 Italian FTSE MIB: up 549 points or 3.2% at 17,401 Spanish IBEX: up 304 points or 4.7% at 6,779 UK FTSE 100: up 248 points or 4.29% at 6,048 Edward Moya of OANDA sums up the day: Many traders had a nice weekend as some normalcy crept back into their lives. The return of German soccer, Nascar, and golf provided many households with some fresh entertainment. The start of the trading week was supposed to have some optimism with the global economic recovery, but no one anticipated this Monday\u2019s start. Risk appetite is running wild after Moderna\u2019s experimental vaccine showed promising early signs to create an immune-system response might be able to fight off COVID-19. Global equities are roaring higher on vaccine hopes combined with continued major economies reopening, and as the Fed continues to promise more stimulus is coming when it is needed. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has just posted its third best day since the Covid-19 crisis began. The blue-chip index of top UK-listed shares has closed 248 points higher at 6,048 points, a gain of almost 4.3%. That\u2019s the Footsie\u2019s biggest one-day percentage jump since 25th March, when it started to recover from its pandemic-induced slump, and its highest closing level this month. But as you can see, it is still down 20% this year: Germany and France\u2019s proposal for a joint rescue fund, on top of the encouraging vaccine news from Moderna, sparked a late surge into equities. Nearly every member of the FTSE 100 rallied, led by cruise operator Carnival (+14%), mining giant Anglo American (+11.6%) and airline groups IAG (+11%) and easyJet. In what looks like another significant development today, France and Germany have jointly proposed a new European Recovery Fund worth \u20ac500bn to help the region recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Importantly, this fund would be added to the European Union\u2019s budget and used to support sectors and regions across Europe, through grants rather than loans. The money would be raised through the financial markets by the Commission, meaning European member states would embrace the idea of joint borrowing Merkel has told reporters that the plan would help Europe recover from Covid-19: \u201cWe must act, we must act in a European way so that we get out of the crisis well and strengthened.\u201d here\u2019s With 30 minutes trading to go, the UK\u2019s stock market is sizzling. The FTSE 100 index is now up 200 points, or 3.6%, back over the 6,000 mark for the first time in nearly a week. Mining giants, energy companies, travel operators and other consumer-focused firms are leading the rally. Tech companies and supermarkets, though, are lagging. The oil price is pushing higher, lifted by hopes that lockdown restrictions will ease in the coming weeks and months. Brent crude has hit $35 per barrel for the first sime since April 9th, up from $20 per barrel a few weeks ago (before production curbs helped to address chronic oversupply problems). Moderna\u2019s interim vaccine results have boosted hopes that the global economy can return to a more normal state, says Edward Park, Deputy CIO at investment manager Brooks Macdonald. Park explains: Moderna are one of the first companies to trial a vaccine for COVID-19 and early positive results have boosted sentiment. Moderna said that the vaccine helped boost the immune systems of participants to levels equivalent to the level of protection to patients who had contracted COVID-19. Crucially, even if Moderna\u2019s candidate vaccine doesn\u2019t reach mass-market, today\u2019s results offer the encouraging prospect that someone will achieve this feat. As Park puts it: Whilst Moderna\u2019s success is still at an early stage, it helps improve the outlook not only for Moderna\u2019s specific vaccine but raises the probability that COVID-19 can be vaccinated against. There are many viruses that have no specific vaccine therefore a continued risk is that COVID-19 can never be eliminated. Moderna\u2019s early stage successes appear to suggest that coronavirus can be vaccinated against which improves the outlook for a return to normality and shortens the timeline for economic disruption in the interim. It\u2019s important to note that Moderna\u2019s phase one trial only included 45 participants (28 in Seattle and 17 in Atlanta, Georgia, according to USA Today). Today\u2019s results show that everyone tested so far has produced binding antibody levels similar to, or above, patients with Covid-19. These binding antibodies will stick to the virus. That can be a signal to the immune system to destroy the pathogen, but doesn\u2019t actually stop it on its own. They\u2019re different to neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus and also prevent it replicating (because they \u2018stick\u2019 to the pathogen in a way that neutralises it). Moderna only has neutralising antibody results for eight participants -- four with small doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine client and four at a larger dose. All eight have shown they do indeed have neutralising antibodies 43 days after injection - at or above levels seen in Covid-19 patients. That\u2019s encouraging enough for Moderna to press on with larger trials, as CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel explains: \u201cWith today\u2019s positive interim Phase 1 data and the positive data in the mouse challenge model, the Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July and, if successful, file a BLA [biologics license application]. \u201cWe are investing to scale up manufacturing so we can maximize the number of doses we can produce to help protect as many people as we can from SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Shares in Moderna have jumped by 30% at the start of trading in New York, after the biotech firm reported early signs of progress in its Covid-19 vaccine test. The broader market is getting a lift too, with Wall Street rising back to last week\u2019s hgihs. Dow: up 697 points or 2.95% at 24,383 points S&amp;P 500: up 71 points or 2.5% at 2,935 points Nasdaq: up 154 points or 1.7% at 9,168 points Travel company shares are now soaring in London, on hopes that a vaccine breakthrough could, perhaps, help the global economy to emerge from the Covid-19 lockdown sooner than previously feared. Budget airline easyJet are the top riser on the FTSE 100, up 11.5%, closely followed by cruise operator Carnival (+10%). Mining companies are also rallying hard, suggesting that investors are slightly more optimistic about global growth prospects. Anglo American (+9%), BHP Group (+8%) and Rio Tinto (+7%) would all benefit from increased demand for iron ore, copper, coal and other commodities if economies recovered strongly from the current slump. The few losers on the FTSE include supermarket chains Ocado (-1.2%) and Morrisons (-0.4%), whose sales have been boosted by the lockdown (although it\u2019s also driven up their costs and created major supply chain challenges). Wall Street is going to make a strong start to the week, when trading kicks off in 30 minutes: Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine appears to be showing \u201cpromising early signs\u201d, reckons Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Langreth. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s interim phase one study results: An experimental vaccine from Moderna Inc. showed promising early signs that it can create an immune-system response in the body that could help fend off the new coronavirus, according to sampling of data from a small, first human trial of the inoculation. The study was primarily designed to look at the safety of the shot and showed no major warning signs in a small phase 1 trial, the company said in a statement Monday. The trial is being run with the U.S. government, and Moderna plans to continue advancing it to wider testing. A vaccine is considered a crucial step toward lifting social-distancing measures and safely reopening economies, schools and events around the globe. The new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed over 300,000, spurring a global race by drugmakers, academic institutions and governments to find a vaccine. More here. Here are the key points from Moderna\u2019s announcement, of \u201cPositive Interim Phase 1 Data for its mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1273)\u201d (which is online here). After two doses all participants evaluated to date across the 25 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g dose cohorts seroconverted with binding antibody levels at or above levels seen in convalescent sera mRNA-1273 elicited neutralizing antibody titer levels in all eight initial participants across the 25 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g dose cohorts, reaching or exceeding neutralizing antibody titers generally seen in convalescent sera mRNA-1273 was generally safe and well tolerated mRNA-1273 provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs in a mouse challenge model Anticipated dose for Phase 3 study between 25 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g; expected to start in July Important to remember that this is only an early stage trial, but clearly it\u2019s raising hopes in the markets: CNBC has more details about Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine, which is driving markets higher: Moderna\u2019s closely watched early-stage human trial for a coronavirus vaccine produced Covid-19 antibodies in all 45 participants, the biotech company announced Monday, sending the company\u2019s shares surging as much as 30% in premarket trading. Each participant received a 25 microgram, 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose, with 15 people in each dose group. Study participants received two doses of the potential vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Data on a second dose was not available for the 250 mcg group, the company said. At day 43, or two weeks following the second dose, levels of binding antibodies in the 25 mcg group were at the levels generally seen in blood samples from people who recovered from the disease, the company said. Antibodies in the 100 mcg had antibodies that \u201csignificantly exceeded levels\u201d in recovered patients. Optimism that a vaccine to combat Covid-19 will soon be produced is also driving the markets higher today. Boston-based biotech company Moderna has just reported positive results from the first human trial of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine The vaccine candidate, known as mRNA-1273, produced Covid-19 antibodies in all participants, including at low doses, at similar or higher levels to people who had actually contracted the virus. Moderna says this is \u201cpositive interim clinical data\u201d from the trial, which involved 45 people (so quite a small sample). It also reports that mRNA-1273 was \u201cgenerally safe and well tolerated\u201d by human triallists. It also found that mRNA-1273 provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs in a mouse challenge model. Tal Zaks, Moderna\u2019s chief medical officer, says the results suggest that mRNA-1273 can be used to fight the pandemic: \u201cThese interim Phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection starting with a dose as low as 25 \u00b5g. \u201cWhen combined with the success in preventing viral replication in the lungs of a pre-clinical challenge model at a dose that elicited similar levels of neutralizing antibodies, these data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials. St\u00e9phane Bancel, Moderna\u2019s chief executive, has told the Financial Times he was \u201cthrilled\u201d, and that he could not have expected better data. Investors are excited too. The FTSE 100 is now up 3%, or over 170 points, to 5971, while the Dow is up 560 points in pre-market trading. The Dow Jones is now on track to jump back over 24,000 points when Wall Street opens in two hours, a gain of around 300 points. That would be its highest level in nearly a week, helped by Jerome Powell\u2019s pledge that the Fed can take more measures to help the US economy recover. Some analysts are now wondering whether the Dow can climb back to its record highs of 29,568 hit in February, and beyond, as Marketwatch reports: Paul Schatz, the president of Heritage Capital, said the Dow could hit 30,000 points by 2021 and 40,000 by 2023 as the U.S. economy recovers over the longer term. \u201cTo bet against the U.S. economy and consumer over the long-term is a loser\u2019s game,\u201d Schatz said in a first quarter note to clients. \u201cI firmly believe we will see Dow 30,000 in 2021 with Dow 40,000 coming by 2023. Once we get over this massive hurdle, there will be too many things working in favor to derail that train when it gets going.\u201d The odds of Britain introducing negative interest rates to combat the coranavirus downturn seem to be rising. Reuters has spotted that interest rate futures contracts from December 2020 have dropped into negative territory, a sign that more traders are betting that UK interest rates would fall below zero this year. Bank rate is already at a record low, just 0.1%. In comparison, the eurozone\u2019s headline rates is zero, with commercial banks being charged negative interest rates on their bank deposits at the ECB. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has fuelled speculation of further cuts. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Haldane suggested that pushing interest rates below zero and buying riskier assets couldn\u2019t be ruled out. As Haldane put it: \u201cThe economy is weaker than a year ago and we are now at the effective lower bound, so in that sense it\u2019s something we\u2019ll need to look at \u2013 are looking at \u2013 with somewhat greater immediacy. \u201cHow could we not be?\u201d Haldane also warned that Britain faces a return to unemployment levels seen in the 1980s recession, unless policymakers succeed in \u201creabsorbing\u201d people into good jobs quickly. Despite the latest tides of economic gloom, the mood in the markets remains solidly upbeat. European markets are holding onto their earlier gains, with the Stoxx 600 up 2% today. In London, the FTSE 100 is still pushing back towards the 6,000 mark - up 127 points at 5927. That means its recovered from last Thursday\u2019s wobble, when anxiety about the global economy sparked a selloff. Fawad Razaqzada of Think Markets says: It has been a very optimistic start to the new week with stocks, crude oil, copper, gold and silver all pushing higher this morning with the dollar index being flat. Sentiment has been boosted as many European countries including Spain, Italy and the UK reported the lowest number of Covid-19 related deaths for two months at the weekend and as several countries ease lockdown restrictions. Also providing a positive backdrop for risk is ongoing expectations for further policy stimulus, which explains why noninterest-bearish precious metals are rising along with stocks, as long-term government bond yields get depressed. These expectations were encouraged by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell when he suggested that the central bank was \u2018not out of ammunition\u2019 and could do more if needed. Germany will plunge much deeper into recession this quarter as its Covid-19 lockdown continue to bite, the Bundesbank has warned. In its latest monthly report, Germany\u2019s central bank predicts a severe drop in GDP in the April-June quarter, even though some lockdown measures are easing. It says: \u201cGerman economic output declined massively in the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken to curb it,\u201d As the containment measures continued in April and there should still be substantial restrictions despite easing, experts expect economic output to be significantly lower in the second quarter. The Bundesbank also points out that a wide swathe of Germany\u2019s economy has been hurt. Many consumer-related service sectors are affected, which severely restrict or even have to shut down their business activities. This included the hospitality industry, large parts of the stationary retail trade, travel service providers, other leisure and culture-related services and passenger transport. The manufacturing sector is also affected by the restrictions in Germany. Declining demand from abroad and disruptions in the global supply and value chains also caused downward pressure here. We learned on Friday that German\u2019s economy shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, its biggest drop since 2009. UK property firm Intu has been forced to ask for a \u2018standstill agreement\u2019 from its lenders, after being badly hurt by the coronavirus crisis. Intu told shareholders this morning that it will probably breach the commitments, or covenants, on its loans. It is now seeking relief from financial covenant testing, debt amortisation and facility maturity payments, possibly until 31 December 2021. The company, which owns Lakeside in Essex and the Trafford Centre in Manchester, has suffered a slump in rental payments as many tenants shut down during the lockdown. It was already suffering from problems on the high street - even before Covid-19 struck. Intu explains: Significant market uncertainty remains regarding the impact of Covid-19 on the operations of intu\u2019s centres which, with the exception of essential stores, remain semi-closed until at least 1 June 2020. Additionally, at this time, the speed of recovery once the UK comes out of lockdown remains unclear. The resulting impact on rental collections and valuations at the end of June is likely to result in breaches of covenants or material liquidity requirements if any such breaches are to be cured in accordance with the financing documents at that time. Ryanair chief Michael O\u2019Leary has also hit out at the UK government for mishandling the crisis, saying its plan to make overseas visitors quarantine themselves is \u201cidiotic and unimplementable\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: Budget airline Ryanair has stern words for rivals who have taken financial support from governments to keep afloat through the lockdown. In its latest financial results, Ryanair predicts a price war from operators who have taken billions of euros in help. It warns: When Group airlines return to scheduled flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be distorted by unprecedented quantums of State Aid (in breach of EU rules) under which over \u20ac30bn has been gifted to the Lufthansa Group, Air France-KLM, Alitalia, SAS and Norwegian among others. We therefore expect that traffic on reduced flight schedules will be subject to significant price discounting, and below cost selling, from these flag carriers with huge State Aid war chests. Shocking stuff. But keep reading the statement, and you see that Ryanair has tapped the UK\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), under which the government helps companies to keep borrowing: Ryanair\u2019s balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a current cash balance of \u20ac4.1bn (Ryanair recently raised \u00a3600m under the UK\u2019s CCFF) and 330 unencumbered B737s (77% of owned fleet). What a difference a month makes. Four weeks ago, there was panic in the energy markets as the US oil price plunged below zero. With demand slumping, traders feared that a supply glut would overwhelm the system. As the contract for oil delivery in May ticked towards maturity, US producers found they actually had to pay people to take the crude away. At the time, some commentators predicted that June\u2019s oil contract would also hit zero. But recent supply cuts seem to have helped, as have recent moves to ease lockdowns. So a barrel of US oil for delivery next month is now worth $31, up from $15 at the end of last month. Wall Street is expected to open higher today, helped by Jerome Powell\u2019s latest commitment to take further action to protect America\u2019s economy through the slump. Several European countries have lifted their ban on short-selling shares, in another sign that the panic created by Covid-19 has eased. France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria and Greece are all scrapping restrictions that prevented traders from selling shares they didn\u2019t own (hoping to buy them back cheaper). These bans were introduced in March, in an attempt to stem the alarming plunge in across stock markets. French markets watchdog AMF says the markets are calmer now, although relatively edgy: \u201cMarkets have partly reduced their losses, trading volumes and volatility have returned to levels that are still high compared to mid-February, however this reflects market participants\u2019 uncertainties in the current context The gold price has hit its highest level since 2012, amid predictions that the coronavirus outbreak will drive inflation up. Gold bullion is up 1.2% this morning at $1,760 per ounce for the first time since October 2012. It\u2019s now jumped by over 15% since the market crash in March, driven by concerns that the huge stimulus measures from governments and central banks will be inflationary. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Gold has emerged as a clear winner from the economic turmoil created by the pandemic. There has been more energy about gold bulls today and prices have driven up to above $1760, the highest since Oct 2012. The peak in that month of $1795 is the next target for bulls. Some economists argue that the pandemic will actually be deflationary - as demand will crumble as unemployment rises and firms go bust. But goldbugs point to the massive expansion in the money supply, arguing that precious metals are the best protection against an inflationary glut. The Covid-19 crisis will drag India into an unprecedented recession, Goldman Sachs has warned. Goldman\u2019s economists reckon India\u2019s GDP will shrink at an annualised rate of 45% in the current quarter. It had previously predicted a 20% tumble, but has revised its forecasts after India extended its tough lockdown until the end of May. Growth is expected to rebound sharply in Q3 (by an annualised rate of 20%), but India\u2019s economy is still expected to shrink by 5% during the year. European markets are a tranquil sea of green this morning, with the main indices up around 2%. That\u2019s a solid recovery from last week\u2019s dips, which sent stocks to a three-week low. Investors seem to be more hopeful about the global economic prospects, as governments try to lift lockdown restrictions. But, the long-term damage of the crisis is unknown, as Barclays economist Christian Keller put it to clients (via Reuters): \u201cThe economies of Europe and the U.S. likely bottomed out in April and are slowly starting to come back to life. \u201cHowever, incoming data from most economies highlight the depth of the contraction, raising risks of longer-term scarring that might undermine the recovery.\u201d The European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist has warned that the eurozone economy might not recover from the Covid-19 slump until 2022. Philip Lane told Spanish newspaper El Pais that the coronavirus is having a \u2018terrible\u2019 impact, and sounded notably cautious about the future, saying: In March the pandemic and the measures to contain it had already led to a substantial contraction of activity. This situation got worse again in April, where we saw a deep fall in activity everywhere. Now the picture is changing: some countries are beginning to loosen their lockdowns. How this will develop in the future depends a lot on how quickly the restrictions on economic activity can be eased, but also on how we adapt to living with the virus. The speed at which the economy bounces back will then hinge on whether consumers are more reluctant to consume and businesses hold back on investment. From today\u2019s perspective, it looks in any case unlikely that economic activity will return to its pre-crisis level before 2021, if not later. This crisis is truly unprecedented, which makes it harder to predict the precise shape the recovery will take. What we know for sure is that the steepest fall will be in the first half of the year, and these terrible economic conditions should recover little by little, week by week, month by month. A wave of optimism has lifted Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 by 128 points, or 2.2%, in early trading in London. Nearly every member of the blue-chip index is up, led by mining companies. Fresnillo (+8%), Glencore (+5%) and Anglo American (+5%) are all sharply higher, following Jerome Powell\u2019s pledge to unleash more firepower if needed. Travel companies are also being lifted, with British Airways parent company IAG (5%) and cruise operator Carnival (+5%). Oil companies are also higher, lifted by rising crude prices -- another sign that the markets are less pessimistic as some lockdown measures are lifted. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says the success of these moves will be crucial: It does feel like we\u2019re in the middle of a phoney war at the moment with all of us waiting to see how efficiently the various economies are able to re-open given all the social distancing that will be required Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The economic cost of the coronavirus continues to mount. Overnight, Japan has followed Germany, France and Italy into recession as its Covid-19 lockdown hit economic growth. Japan\u2019s GDP shrank by 0.9% in January-March, the second quarterly contraction in a row. Tom Learmouth, Japan economist for Capital Economics, says: \u201cThe sharp fall in output in the first quarter suggests the spread of the virus had already dealt a significant blow to economic activity in March.\u201d Economists predict a much sharper contraction this quarter, helping to drag the world economy into its worst slump in decades. America\u2019s top central banker, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has voiced his own concerns. He predicted that the US economy could shrink by 20% or 30% during the pandemic, with the recovery taking until late 2021. But crucially for investors - Powell also told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the Fed was certainly \u201cnot out of ammunition by a long shot\u201d - and could expand its lending programmes if needed. Here\u2019s the key part of the interview, with CBS\u2019s Scott Pelley: PELLEY: Has the Fed done all it can do? POWELL: Well, there\u2019s a lot more we can do. We\u2019ve done what we can as we go. But I will say that we\u2019re not out of ammunition by a long shot. No, there\u2019s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have. So there\u2019s a lot more we can do to support the economy, and we\u2019re committed to doing everything we can as long as we need to. PELLEY: What would the Fed\u2019s next steps be, potentially? POWELL: Well, to begin, the one thing we can certainly do is we can enlarge our existing lending programs. We can start new lending programs if need be. We can do that. There are things we can do in monetary policy. There are a number of dimensions where we can move to make policy even more accommodative. Through forward guidance, we can change our asset purchase strategy. There are just a lot of things that we can do. That\u2019s just the excuse investors need to look through the current economic gloom. Stocks have jumped in Asia-Pacific markets overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.5% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX gaining 1%. European markets are also heading for a strong morning - with the FTSE 100 jumping 2% at the start of trading. Traders are also watching Italy closely, where shops, restaurants and hair salons are reopening. The Italian government says it\u2019s taking a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d to put the country back on its feet. It\u2019s a key test of whether consumers will return to the shops...and whether a second wave of Covid-19 infections can be avoided.

Guterres says Covid-19 is the \u201cgreatest challenge of our age\u201d and has demonstrated the world\u2019s fragility, as nations go their own way. He adds that the crisis is an opportunity to rebuild a better world, but questions whether countries are up to it. Spain reports lowest death toll for two months Monday\u2019s overnight death toll in Spain is 59, the lowest figure in two months, the country\u2019s government says. The cumulative death toll rises to 27,709, while the number of confirmed cases increases to 231,606 from 231,350 the previous day, according to health ministry figures. Brian Cox says politicisation risks undermining public trust in science UK government ministers may be undermining public trust in science in the way they talk about it when defending their decisions, a leading scientist and broadcaster warns. Prof Brian Cox says he is particularly concerned about ministers saying they are just \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. The Royal Society professor for public engagement with science says the \u201cpoliticisation of science or scientific advice might deliver some short-term political advantages \u2026 But, this will have, I think, serious long-term consequences because it undermines public trust in science.\u201d Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica reopens Visitors are allowed to return to Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican after more than two months of lockdown. A handful of visitors queue up, observing social distancing rules and under the watch of police officers wearing face masks, before having their temperatures taken to enter the church.",

      "bodyText": "Share prices have risen strongly on global stock markets amid an easing of lockdown restrictions, the announcement of a Franco-German rescue package for Europe and rising hopes of a vaccine for Covid-19. In one of its strongest trading days since the crisis began in March, the FTSE 100, which measures the stock market performance of the City\u2019s leading companies, gained 248 points and ended the day at 6,048. Travel companies and airlines were among the biggest gainers, with the cruise operator Carnival up nearly 15%, British Airways owner IAG up 11% and easyJet up 10%. Mining shares also rallied on hopes of an upturn in global demand. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average opened strongly after Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts, reported encouraging results from early trials of a new vaccine. Oil prices also rose on optimism that the gradual opening up of European countries and individual US states marked a turning point in a crisis that has seen share prices tumble over the past three months. Despite its strong rise of more than 4% on Monday, the FTSE 100 is still down almost 20% on its pre-Covid level.

Germany\u2019s Dax index closed 5.7% higher while France\u2019s CAC ended 5.2% up.

In April, the IMF said it expected a 3% drop in activity this year followed by a 5.8% rebound in 2021, but the grim economic news since then has made Georgieva less optimistic. The IMF\u2019s managing director told Reuters that data had been worse than expected, adding: \u201cObviously that means it will take us much longer to have a full recovery from this crisis.\u201d With financial markets taking fright last week at growing trade tensions between the US and China, Georgieva also warned against countries resorting to protectionism. \u201cWe do need to keep trade flows open, especially for medical supplies, food and longer-term to find a pathway to overcome what is happening now with this crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to continue to build this more prosperous future for all by overcoming the scarring that may come from this crisis.\u201d",

So when she came across the Yellow Hearts To Remember Facebook group, it became a lifeline. \u201cI was absolutely desperate for that contact and to know that other people were having the same experiences, and the grief that I was going through alone was normal to some extent,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many Facebook messages from people I don\u2019t even know saying: \u2018We\u2019re in the same boat.\u2019\u201d The group was set up by David Gompertz, 83, with help from his family, after losing his wife, Sheila, to the virus. He felt the government\u2019s daily death toll figure didn\u2019t do justice to the scale of the loss from Covid-19, and wanted to create a group encouraging the bereaved to pin yellow hearts in their window, as a symbol of remembrance. \u201cI thought, if people as they walk the streets actually saw the extent of yellow hearts in their neighbourhood, it might tell them [how many have really died],\u201d he explained. But since the group\u2019s creation a couple of weeks ago, it has grown into something much more \u2013 a warm and welcoming community of thousands sharing stories and pictures of lost loved ones. \u201cI just do two or three minutes and weep, because the people on there are all sizes and shapes, ethnic groups and ages. It\u2019s just devastating,\u201d Gompertz said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t own it anymore. That Facebook page is owned by all those people who posted.\u201d One of those is Charlotte Compton, whose dad, 91-year-old James Jones, died in April after contracting coronavirus. Like many she faced the difficulty of organising a funeral and having to choose which family members were able to attend. \u201cThe toughest thing for me was, at the funeral, not being able to hug my family,\u201d she said. \u201cA social media platform is no substitute for that at all, but it\u2019s comforting to have some kind of virtual love from people you don\u2019t even know but who understand everything that you\u2019re going through.\u201d She also came across another Facebook group which encourages people to light a candle in their window at 8pm every Sunday to remember those who have died. \u201cIt sounds quite small, but I really found it very comforting,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt calm and peaceful because I just felt everybody who is in a similar situation can feel a sense of belonging and togetherness, some unity which somehow makes grief more bearable.\u201d Online groups and helplines have become crucial in bereavement support during a time when face-to-face interaction is no longer possible. Widowed and Young have recorded a significant increase in people joining their members-only website and Facebook group, up 12% on last year. While digital tributes are offering some solace to people grieving for coronavirus victims, families are now calling for a more permanent tribute. Ciavarella has written to Boris Johnson asking for his support in planting a forest of trees, one for each victim of the virus, as a lasting memorial.",

      "body": "<p>Waves of panic radiate from the government. Each day ministers sent out to steady the ship in press conferences and broadcast studios tip it a bit closer to capsizing. Asking Michael Gove to soothe the teachers on Sunday with his, \u201cTeachers will be safe in schools\u201d line was about as reassuring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\">those he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\">called \u201cthe blob\u201d</a> as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062803/characters/nm0375818\">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062803/characters/nm0375818\">Child Catcher</a> summoning children from their cellars. When there are differences of opinion between scientists on what counts as safe, only honesty about what is in doubt earns political trust. But daily, they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devisridhar/status/1261580396833226752\">blow </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devisridhar/status/1261580396833226752\">their credibility away</a>.</p> <p>Paralysis during their leader\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">brush with death</a> has given way since his return to alarm at their helmsman\u2019s zigzag steering. His 13-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/10/boris-johnsons-address-on-next-phase-of-coronavirus-lockdown-watch-in-full\">address to the nation</a> did more to hole the ship than buoy it in public opinion. No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/05/15/what-do-voters-make-new-lockdown-measures\">faced a backlash</a>. Stay alert? It hasn\u2019t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then.</p> <p>Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with \u201cTake back control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, but all that\u2019s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/as-lockdown-consensus-unravels-boris-johnson-divides-nation-and-party\">Opinium polls</a> showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March; that has fallen to -3. YouGov\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1261945246453293056\">+51 net approval rating</a> on 27 March has plunged to -2. Keir Starmer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/keir-starmer-approval-rating-boris-johnson-first-time-a4438786.html\">personal rating</a> overtook Johnson\u2019s last week. The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer\u2019s trouncing of Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/pmqs-keir-starmer-presses-boris-johnson-over-care-home-deaths\">at prime minister\u2019s questions</a> over the appalling care home death rates.</p> <p>Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/weird-hell-professor-advent-calendar-covid-19-symptoms-paul-garner\">warned</a> that Britain\u2019s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-tests-advised-for-people-who-lose-taste-or-smell\">between 50,000 and 70,000</a> people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add \u201closs of sense of smell\u201d to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.</p> <p>One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/boris-johnson-analysis-1922-committee-tory-mps-coronavirus-crisis-2855468\">slippery opponent</a>\u201d. How revealing: there\u2019s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour\u2019s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he\u2019s bereft when his old bluster can\u2019t beguile away deaths.</p> <p>Trust is ebbing away just when it\u2019s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school; it\u2019s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. \u201cOnly following the science,\u201d ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.</p> <p>Take Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1261329991708684294\">dumbfounding claim</a> on Friday: \u201cRight from the start we\u2019ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes \u2026 we\u2019ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.\u201d What sentient voter doesn\u2019t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes \u2013 some close to bankruptcy \u2013 were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.</p> <p>No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public\u2019s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.</p> <p>But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52684700\">will be tested</a> by early June \u2013 but will that be every week, with prompt results?</p> <p>\u201cFollowing the science\u201d often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">backed </a><a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">Johnson\u2019s plan</a> not to ban large gatherings, noting: \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don\u2019t want to disrupt people\u2019s lives.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/uk-governments-coronavirus-response-beset-by-mixed-messages-and-u-turns\">defended</a> a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/19/uk-coronavirus-live-lifting-lockdown-restrictions-boris-johnson-death-tollcovid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9c70008f080ee110447c85\">called</a> the UK \u201can international exemplar in preparedness\u201d and told doctors to have a \u201cmore adult\u201d conversation about the lack of PPE. She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenKentish/status/1260699964784750598\">reiterated advice</a> that it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d care homes would be infected.</p> <p>This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock\u2019s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out \u2013 almost double the number of individuals actually tested \u2013 were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRealityCheck/status/1261338261236019202\">instantly tripped up</a> by the BBC\u2019s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?</p> <p>Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/no-10-under-pressure-as-it-is-revealed-whitehall-chief-mark-sedwill-had-coronavirus\">Mark Sedwill</a> is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it\u2019s not fair he\u2019s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">union consultation</a>. When the British Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">backed the teachers</a>, doctors came under attack: that certainly won\u2019t end well.</p> <p>Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if \u201clevelling up\u201d is still Johnson\u2019s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones \u2013 for example, to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1261922521177260034/photo/1\">Wiltshire more than to Knowsley</a> on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories\u2019 favoured regular enemy, as they force him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\">raise</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\"> public transport fares</a> in London.</p> <p>But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel\u2019s refusal to lift the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">\u00a36</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">25-a-year NHS surcharge</a> on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn\u2019t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner \u2013 but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.</p> <p>Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public\u2019s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Waves of panic radiate from the government. Each day ministers sent out to steady the ship in press conferences and broadcast studios tip it a bit closer to capsizing. Asking Michael Gove to soothe the teachers on Sunday with his, \u201cTeachers will be safe in schools\u201d line was about as reassuring to those he called \u201cthe blob\u201d as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\u2019s Child Catcher summoning children from their cellars. When there are differences of opinion between scientists on what counts as safe, only honesty about what is in doubt earns political trust. But daily, they blow their credibility away. Paralysis during their leader\u2019s brush with death has given way since his return to alarm at their helmsman\u2019s zigzag steering. His 13-minute address to the nation did more to hole the ship than buoy it in public opinion. No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he faced a backlash. Stay alert? It hasn\u2019t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then. Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with \u201cTake back control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, but all that\u2019s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: Opinium polls showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March; that has fallen to -3. YouGov\u2019s +51 net approval rating on 27 March has plunged to -2. Keir Starmer\u2019s personal rating overtook Johnson\u2019s last week. The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer\u2019s trouncing of Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions over the appalling care home death rates. Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector warned that Britain\u2019s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant between 50,000 and 70,000 people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add \u201closs of sense of smell\u201d to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind. One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a \u201cslippery opponent\u201d. How revealing: there\u2019s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour\u2019s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he\u2019s bereft when his old bluster can\u2019t beguile away deaths. Trust is ebbing away just when it\u2019s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school; it\u2019s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. \u201cOnly following the science,\u201d ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew. Take Matt Hancock\u2019s dumbfounding claim on Friday: \u201cRight from the start we\u2019ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes \u2026 we\u2019ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.\u201d What sentient voter doesn\u2019t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes \u2013 some close to bankruptcy \u2013 were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust. No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public\u2019s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures. But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes will be tested by early June \u2013 but will that be every week, with prompt results? \u201cFollowing the science\u201d often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she backed Johnson\u2019s plan not to ban large gatherings, noting: \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don\u2019t want to disrupt people\u2019s lives.\u201d She defended a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d She called the UK \u201can international exemplar in preparedness\u201d and told doctors to have a \u201cmore adult\u201d conversation about the lack of PPE. She reiterated advice that it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d care homes would be infected. This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock\u2019s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out \u2013 almost double the number of individuals actually tested \u2013 were instantly tripped up by the BBC\u2019s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss? Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it\u2019s not fair he\u2019s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive union consultation. When the British Medical Association backed the teachers, doctors came under attack: that certainly won\u2019t end well. Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if \u201clevelling up\u201d is still Johnson\u2019s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones \u2013 for example, to Wiltshire more than to Knowsley on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories\u2019 favoured regular enemy, as they force him to raise public transport fares in London. But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel\u2019s refusal to lift the \u00a3625-a-year NHS surcharge on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn\u2019t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner \u2013 but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis. Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public\u2019s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

He is the 12th person to test positive to Covid-19 in a cluster that began at a McDonald\u2019s store in Fawkner, about 20km north of the CBD. It comes Melbourne abattoir Cedar Meats, the centre of an outbreak that was linked to 99 cases, reopened for business. About a thousand employees, most of whom are casuals, were affected by the restaurant closures. Several hundred people who were on shift either when the driver made their delivery or immediately after have been told to self-isolate and not return to work for 14-days. None of them have, to date, tested positive to the virus. McDonald\u2019s employees are covered by the Fast Food Industry Award. Part-time employees may be able to access sick leave, but most are casuals and will just have access to two weeks unpaid pandemic leave. They have been told they will not be able to return to work unless they have tested negative to Covid-19. The restaurants will be reopened in the next few days after they have been deep cleaned, provided replacement workers are available. The McDonald\u2019s outbreak began at the Fawkner branch on 8 May. Within five days three cases had been confirmed and the restaurant was closed for a deep-cleaning, with 92 employees tested and all close contacts of the confirmed cases told to self-isolate for 14-days. One week after the outbreak was first reported, the cluster had grown to 10. On Saturday an 11th case was reported, this time in an employee at the McDonald\u2019s in Craigieburn who was a relative of one of the employees of McDonald\u2019s Fawkner. The delivery driver was identified as a close contact of the Craigieburn case. Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said McDonald\u2019s searched CCTV footage to identify 12 restaurants which the delivery driver had visited while potentially asymptomatic for the disease. They are: Melton East; Laverton North; Yallambie; Taylors Lakes; Campbellfield; Sunbury; Hoppers Crossing; Riverdale Village; Sandown; Calder Highway northbound; Calder Highway southbound; and the BP Rockbank Service Centre outbound. \u201cWe have worked very closely with McDonald\u2019s and they have taken all steps required by us \u2014 and then some \u2014 and they have done a very extensive investigation very quickly on a Sunday evening,\u201d van Diemen said. She added: \u201cnobody will return to work at McDonald\u2019s until they have had a negative test.\u201d The Craigieburn and Fawkner outlets have already been cleaned and re-opened, but the staff from those stores remain under 14-day quarantine. The restaurants are currently staffed by employees from other stores. A spokesman from McDonald\u2019s Australia said the 12 stores were closed out of \u201can abundance of caution\u201d and that \u201cno other employees have tested positive for COVID-19 at this time\u201d. \u201cThe truck driver made deliveries to 12 restaurants and interacted with a small number of restaurant employees on each occasion while asymptomatic and unaware they had contracted COVID-19,\u201d they said. \u201cPotential close contacts and employees who have worked specific shifts during and after the truck drivers\u2019 delivery have been instructed not to return to work for 14 days and advised to be tested.\u201d",

Even before stay-at-home orders, women were wearing more trackpants, says Ganapathy. Muston explains: \u201cWe\u2019ve just come out the back over 10 years of athleisure, so already we have pretty high expectations around comfort.\u201d</p> <p>Raised on streetwear, sneakers and activewear, younger people were already resistant to uncomfortable clothing, but now Muston suggests that because shutdowns affected fashion on a \u201cmass level \u2026 the expectation is going to be raised further still\u201d, and it won\u2019t just be demand from younger consumers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee8b09007f037d7e2b2ce8eae9e00da2f5d78be0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee8b09007f037d7e2b2ce8eae9e00da2f5d78be0/0_1133_4480_4965/902.jpg\" alt=\"A track suit with a cropped, matching top.

Sportsgirl have noticed a decline in the day-to-night dressing category, with Ganapathy explaining it\u2019s not presently relevant to their customers\u2019 lives.</p> <p>Muston says it\u2019s also important to understand the \u201ceconomic impact of coronavirus and what that does to consumer spending\u201d.</p> <p>In Australia, a survey conducted by the Australian Fashion Council found 75-80% of textile, clothing and footwear brands have had their businesses negatively impacted by coronavirus. Muston says with this \u201cabsolute deluge of overstock that has to clear, how do you create new stock that\u2019s going to stand out? How do you justify that to the consumer? How do you justify that to the planet?\u201d</p> <p>Her answer is \u201cversatility\u201d. \u201cProducts that \u2026 can be worn for multiple things are going to be an easier sell. Maybe it\u2019s a top you can work out in but you can also wear it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cItems with longevity are most relevant,\u201d Kingham says of her customers. \u201cI think unprecedented times mean that people re-evaluate what is important.\u201d</p> <p>Muston notes that direct-to-consumer brands (such as the ones that have been flooding my Instagram feed) are excelling when it comes to differentiating themselves. \u201cThey often come with a problem-solving direction to them,\u201d she says. Because these brands do not have hundreds or thousands of products, they spend more time in research and development, investing in highly technical fabrics that breathe well, or never wrinkle; or shoes that \u201creally look at the arch of the foot and the position of the foot in the shoe\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb3b9e36137fbab621b9d9ed833f2ee67837266e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb3b9e36137fbab621b9d9ed833f2ee67837266e/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brands advertising how comfortable their clothing is on Instagram.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brands advertising how comfortable their clothing is on Instagram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ganapathy and Kingham both believe that as the lockdown eases, their customers will want to get very dressed up again \u2013 with Kingham suggesting a hunger for \u201cspecial pieces for evenings out\u201d; and Ganapathy saying \u201cI think party dressing and Christmas is going to be really big this year.\u201d <br><br>Muston is a little more cautious. \u201cYou always get trends that are seemingly opposing that run in parallel,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get revenge spending, where people want to go out and treat themselves. But some people \u2026 just don\u2019t have the finances.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a scene in the 1933 comedy Duck Soup where two Marx brothers \u2013 Chico and Harpo \u2013 repeatedly raise their legs up high, putting their thighs into the hands of an unwitting lemonade stand owner. Lately, my Instagram feed has been remarkably similar to this film, only instead of scruffy scamps in wide-legged \u201930s trousers, it\u2019s attractive young women showing off how flexible and comfortable their clothes are. In lockdown, trackpants became \u201cthe height of fashion\u201d. Anna Wintour wore a pair; Shalini Ganapathy, a buyer for young women\u2019s high street brand Sportsgirl, tells me their sales of the product increased 300% online, and on TikTok, videos of women dancing in sweats proliferated. It\u2019s not just trackpants \u2013 Sportsgirl also report huge increases in demand for \u201ccosy knitwear\u201d. In March, budget retailer Big W reported loungewear sales outstripped the sale of normal clothing, while Natalie Kingham, the buying director of high-end ecommerce store Matchesfashion, says \u201cloungewear, nightwear and activewear have been bestselling categories\u201d. Now, in Australia, stay-home orders are easing. People can visit friends and family, and by 1 June, the whole country will be able to eat in a restaurants again. But after months of elasticated waistbands, can we bear to go back to normal clothes? A quick search of social media suggests not. Jokes and complaints about jeans, bras and high heels are everywhere. Francesca Muston, vice president of fashion content for WGSN, one of the world\u2019s largest trend forecasting agencies, is inclined to agree with Twitter and Instagram\u2019s assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a normal again,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything will be fundamentally changed.\u201d Muston and Ganapathy both say the Covid-19 shutdowns have accelerated trends that were already rising in popularity. Even before stay-at-home orders, women were wearing more trackpants, says Ganapathy. Muston explains: \u201cWe\u2019ve just come out the back over 10 years of athleisure, so already we have pretty high expectations around comfort.\u201d Raised on streetwear, sneakers and activewear, younger people were already resistant to uncomfortable clothing, but now Muston suggests that because shutdowns affected fashion on a \u201cmass level \u2026 the expectation is going to be raised further still\u201d, and it won\u2019t just be demand from younger consumers. Muston says people working from home, exercising at home, dining in on delivery services and being entertained by streamed TV are trends they\u2019ve been tracking for over four years, and while they did not predict the shift would be \u201cso extreme \u2026 certainly there\u2019s a lot of evidence towards people spending more time at home anyway.\u201d People staying in more means a shift in our expectations of what a \u201cflexible\u201d outfit might look like. Sportsgirl have noticed a decline in the day-to-night dressing category, with Ganapathy explaining it\u2019s not presently relevant to their customers\u2019 lives. Muston says it\u2019s also important to understand the \u201ceconomic impact of coronavirus and what that does to consumer spending\u201d. In Australia, a survey conducted by the Australian Fashion Council found 75-80% of textile, clothing and footwear brands have had their businesses negatively impacted by coronavirus. Muston says with this \u201cabsolute deluge of overstock that has to clear, how do you create new stock that\u2019s going to stand out? How do you justify that to the consumer? How do you justify that to the planet?\u201d Her answer is \u201cversatility\u201d. \u201cProducts that \u2026 can be worn for multiple things are going to be an easier sell. Maybe it\u2019s a top you can work out in but you can also wear it out.\u201d \u201cItems with longevity are most relevant,\u201d Kingham says of her customers. \u201cI think unprecedented times mean that people re-evaluate what is important.\u201d Muston notes that direct-to-consumer brands (such as the ones that have been flooding my Instagram feed) are excelling when it comes to differentiating themselves. \u201cThey often come with a problem-solving direction to them,\u201d she says. Because these brands do not have hundreds or thousands of products, they spend more time in research and development, investing in highly technical fabrics that breathe well, or never wrinkle; or shoes that \u201creally look at the arch of the foot and the position of the foot in the shoe\u201d. Ganapathy and Kingham both believe that as the lockdown eases, their customers will want to get very dressed up again \u2013 with Kingham suggesting a hunger for \u201cspecial pieces for evenings out\u201d; and Ganapathy saying \u201cI think party dressing and Christmas is going to be really big this year.\u201d Muston is a little more cautious. \u201cYou always get trends that are seemingly opposing that run in parallel,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get revenge spending, where people want to go out and treat themselves. But some people \u2026 just don\u2019t have the finances. But more importantly it\u2019s about the fear.\u201d She says even if people are desperate to get dressed up and go out, they might be too nervous about the risk of contracting or transmitting Covid-19 to do so. Furthermore, she suggests the pandemic will result in a shift in values. \u201cThere was this idea of \u2018stealth wealth\u2019 after the last recession \u2026 this is going to be even more compounded.\u201d Muston believes as celebrities face backlash and previously less glamorous citizens such as healthcare workers and grocery store clerks are elevated to hero status, looking like a reality star in chafing raw denim and vertiginous heels may no longer hold the same appeal. But a more subdued, comfort-focused style of dress does not mean the end of people wanting to look nice. Ganapathy and Kingham have both noted sales increases in above-the-waist items such as earrings and smart shirting, for instance. \u201cShe can look good while being comfortable,\u201d Ganapathy says of her customer. \u201cI think that will play a big part in how she dresses moving forward.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll live forevermore in some kind of dystopian loungewear future,\u201d Muston says. But, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a breaking down of what are at the moment fairly clearly defined categories of fitness and activewear, casual-wear, formal and tailoring and party-wear. We need to start breaking down those boundaries because that\u2019s just not how people are living their lives.\u201d",

While the staged return of retail and hospitality will see many people resume employment, there are concerns the gradual return to normalcy could trigger a second wave of infections in Australia. The chief medical officer Brendan Murphy <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-11/coronavirus-update-australia-covid19-death-toll-brendan-murphy/12233110\">said recently</a> that prospect kept him up at night.</p> <p>The latest survey indicates that less than one in five people in the survey who have lost their jobs because of Covid-19 believe they\u2019ll be back in work straight away (18%) once the crisis has passed.

Men and women in the sample hold this view almost equally.

An equal number of respondents rejects that idea. Again the split between men and women is almost identical, but younger voters are more likely to believe the virus started in a lab than voters aged over 55.</p> <p>The Australian government has pushed back at persistent claims from the Trump administration the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan. The government has also determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document, but an open source compilation.</p> <p>Survey respondents this week were asked questions about the various conspiracy theories that have accompanied the global pandemic, with substantial majorities rejecting many of the high rotation hypotheses.

Just a quarter (25%) of the sample now feels it is too soon to consider easing restrictions. Women and voters aged over 55 are more worried about the end of lockdowns than other cohorts.

An equal number of respondents rejects that idea. Again the split between men and women is almost identical, but younger voters are more likely to believe the virus started in a lab than voters aged over 55. The Australian government has pushed back at persistent claims from the Trump administration the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan. The government has also determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document, but an open source compilation. Survey respondents this week were asked questions about the various conspiracy theories that have accompanied the global pandemic, with substantial majorities rejecting many of the high rotation hypotheses. More than 70% disagreed with the statement: \u201cThe number of Covid-19 deaths have been exaggerated by the media and governments to scare the population\u201d. 20% of respondents thought that was true. More than 70% (71%) disagreed with the statement: \u201cBill Gates played a role in the creation and spread of Covid-19\u201d. 13% of the sample thought that was true. Close to 80% (79%) disagreed with the statement: \u201cThe Covid-19 virus is not dangerous and is being used to force people to get vaccines\u201d. 13% thought that was true. More than 70% (75%) disagreed with the statement: \u201cThe 5G wireless network is being used to spread the Covid-19 virus\u201d. 12% thought that was true. This week\u2019s survey indicates the crisis has changed public attitudes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there has been a surge in support for health workers. Over half of respondents now feel more positive towards health and care workers (56%). People are also more sympathetic to people struggling with their mental health. Around one in five respondents also feels more positive towards people who are unemployed (21%) and homeless (21%). The survey continues to suggest Australians remain sanguine about experimenting with winding back the lockdowns. Just a quarter (25%) of the sample now feels it is too soon to consider easing restrictions. Women and voters aged over 55 are more worried about the end of lockdowns than other cohorts. It also indicates people remain happy with the performance of their governments \u2013 federal and state \u2013 during the crisis. The margin of error for the Guardian Essential poll is plus or minus 3%.",

The education minister, Dan Tehan, released the summary report on Tuesday, one month into the free childcare scheme, revealing concern that cost pressures will only grow as the economy reopens and more children return to care. The report confirms dissatisfaction with the package among centres that are ineligible for wage subsidies or have not reduced the number of children in care, with some even calling for an early end to the free childcare program, slated to last three to six months. Under the relief package announced on 2 April, the government suspended its usual childcare subsidies and instead offered to pay 50% of childcare centres\u2019 usual fees based on February enrolments. Childcare centres that opted into the new system were prohibited from charging families an out-of-pocket fee, with the expectation they would recoup the rest of their costs through the jobkeeper wage subsidy or limit costs by restricting the number of children in care, while prioritising children of essential workers. The government has claimed success on the basis that 99% of about 13,400 services remained operational as of 8 May, but many complained of an impending financial disaster as the $1.6bn of funding in three months would be insufficient to meet costs.

But the report said there were \u201cpockets of dissatisfaction with the relief package among services that have maintained high attendance regardless of the impacts of Covid-19, and among services that are ineligible for jobkeeper\u201d. Services with \u201ca significant proportion of their staff being ineligible (such as recently engaged casuals, or temporary visa holders)\u201d had the same complaint, it said.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, Bauld said she was sceptical. \u201cThe reason for having a visor which would cover the upper half of your face would be if you\u2019re regularly coming into contact with the public at closer range, and you might be exposed to somebody who is emitting those small droplets that we\u2019re all aware are very efficient at carrying the virus,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I could see how in some retail settings and other environments they wish to do that, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any strong evidence that they\u2019re something the public should be wearing on a routine basis.

While acknowledging some positive elements of visors and shields, she said it was noticeable that, in countries ahead of the UK in infection control such as Hong Kong and Singapore, plastic visors are not seen. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSo this is additional protective equipment for specific environments. \u201cI think we\u2019re somewhere away from recommending people [generally] wear plastic visors.\u201d However, Keevil thought it was possible visors could catch on. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of societal change thing, isn\u2019t it? As people start to see these then some people might start thinking: \u2018Why am I messing around with a homemade cloth cover?\u2019,\u201d he said.",

That could be a hard change to make and the new rules will be tough to police for the umpires since the assumption is that any transgression by the fielding side will be an unwitting one. Hopefully the penalty for offending bowlers will not be so draconian as for running on the pitch after delivering the ball (three strikes and you cannot bowl again in the innings). This measure will be another burden for the umpires, who will experience another change. For the first time since 2002 there will not be \u201cneutral umpires\u201d standing in Test matches. A combination of challenges over international travel, limited commercial flights and mandatory quarantine periods means that the committee has recommended that local match officials be appointed in Test cricket for the time being. So if England can fulfil their ambitions to play the Test series against West Indies and Pakistan in July and August, the likes of Richard Illingworth, Richard Kettleborough and Nigel Llong are likely to stand. There may even be a call to the recently retired Ian Gould.",

It went on for longer than usual, and covered a wide range of topics. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street has played down prospects of its new contact tracing system being up and running nationwide this month. </strong>The system is being piloted in the Isle of Wight. At one point Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he wanted to have the whole system up and running by the middle of May. But, when the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked when it would be fully operational, he just said that this would happen \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that 17,000 contact tracers were already in place and that the government was \u201cvery confident\u201d of getting the numbers up to 18,000 by the end of this week, as planned</strong>. The contact tracers are getting a range of training, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A decision is likely this week as to whether the government will go ahead with plans for some primary school pupils in England to start going back on 1 June (a fortnight today), the spokesman signalled.</strong> The UK government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan said Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils would go back \u201cno earlier than Monday 1 June\u201d. The spokesman confirmed that this was still the position, but he accepted that 1 June (the Monday after half term, for many pupils) remained an ambition. Asked when the government would be able to say if this would be the date, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that in practice this meant a decision this week, because next week is half term, the spokesman did not challenge this assumption. He said that the safety of pupils came first, but that the government was also aware of the damage being done to children from their not being in education.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government would publish its scientific advice about the safety of children being in school \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</strong> On Friday the government published<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/885631/Overview_of_scientific_advice_and_information_on_coronavirus_COVID19.pdf\"> an overview on this topic (pdf)</a>, he said. But the teaching unions want to see the full scientific advice. Asked when they would get it, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] papers are being published in batches, and the DfE papers will be published as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government does not necessarily need to have its new contact tracing system operational nationwide for it to move to the \u201cstep two\u201d stage of the lockdown relaxation measures set out in its plan, the spokesman suggested.</strong> He said various factors would be taken into account before the government moved to step two, such as the reproduction number. But he said the government had not made having the contact tracing system up and running an essential condition.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The quarantine rules being imposed on new arrivals to the UK will be reviewed every three weeks, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. </strong>He confirmed that the government is planning to issue more details of how the scheme will work \u201cin due course\u201d. But when the quarantine rules are introduced, they will be \u201csubject to rolling review every three weeks\u201d, the spokesman said, to ensure that they are in line with the latest scientific advice. That suggests that they will be reviewed in parallel with the existing lockdown regulations, which also have to be reviewed every three weeks. Those rules are next being reviewed on 28 May. The spokesman would not say whether this meant the quarantine rules could come into force on that date.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman insisted that there had never been an exemption for France.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb84a3c8f08c0a2409bb2ea#block-5eb84a3c8f08c0a2409bb2ea\">A joint statement from the British and French governments</a> on the night of the PM\u2019s TV broadcast clearly implied that an exemption for France was being planned. But the spokesman rejected this. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There was never an exemption for France. All the statement ever said was that there would be no quarantine in relation to France at this time. It was never correct to suggest that there was going to be an exemption for France only.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The spokesman claimed the original statement had been misreported by the media.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">to maintain the immigration health surcharge</a> - a charge paid by immigrants to cover their possible use of the NHS. </strong>This has become particularly controversial because it applies to people who are actually working themselves for the NHS. Asked to justify the charge, the spokesman said that the government committed to increasing it in its election manifesto and that it had raised \u00a3900m directly for the NHS by the end of the 2018-19 financial year.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that latest data showed that 38% of care homes in England have had a coronavirus outbreak. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that the decision to add loss of smell to the official list of coronavirus symptoms (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec261f98f08a1782fa7cbae#block-5ec261f98f08a1782fa7cbae\">11.29am)</a> was expected to increase the number of cases by 2%.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that the NHS Nightingale hospital at the Birmingham NEC was now on standby. </strong>Like the one at the ExCel centre in London, it has effectively been mothballed. The spokesman said that the Manchester one has patients. But another three of the seven in England, in Harrogate, Bristol and Sunderland, are open but without patients, he said. He said an eighth was being built in Exeter and would be operational at the end of the month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson was responsible for people not realising that Wales now has tighter lockdown rules than England. </strong>At the weekend <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-05-17/police-turn-away-people-travelling-to-pembrokeshire-from-england-over-weekend/\">English people travelling to Wales to walk in the countryside were turned away</a>, even though this is allowed in England. When Johnson announced the rules were being relaxed in his TV address, he was criticised for not being more explicit about how this only applied to England. But, when asked if he was responsible for English people being fined by Welsh police, the spokesman did not accept that. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We were very clear from the outset that people would need to respect the rules in Wales.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the prime minister was feeling \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d.</strong> Asked why the PM was not taking more press conferences himself (like Nicola Sturgeon, who almost always leads the Scottish government\u2019s one), the spokesman said: \u201cNot for a specific reason. The PM did the press conference last week and I\u2019m sure you will see him again shortly.\u201d </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Raab will appear with Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman indicated that the PM was happy about Sir Mark Sedwill being cabinet secretary and national security adviser.</strong> Some MPs reportedly want him to separate the two roles. In the Spectator last week <strong>James Forsyth</strong> wrote:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One hawk in government says that this issue has been compounded by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill staying on as national security adviser. They complain that in a well-functioning system the national security adviser would have challenged the cabinet secretary on the Huawei decision, but that can\u2019t happen when the national security adviser and the cabinet secretary are the same person. A break-up of Sir Mark\u2019s empire looks inevitable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman said today that Sedwill had been \u201csuccessfully fulfilling both roles since June 2018\u201d. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T15:13:59.530Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec27f8a8f0886ce4f5d5ac6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stevenmorris\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T12:29:06.472Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Welsh first minister has denied his government has been slow to offer Covid-19 tests to everyone in care homes in Wales.</p> \n  <p>Opposition politicians said the original decision not to test all residents and staff in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mark Drakeford</strong> insisted the government\u2019s position had been led by the science and initially the focus needed to be on care homes where there had been confirmed or suspected cases.

You can follow the Guardian\u2019s global coverage here Evening summary The government\u2019s new contact tracing app may not be ready for 1 June, when some primary schools could reopen. During the daily Downing Street press conference, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said it would be up and running in the \u201cweeks ahead\u201d but could not give a precise date. Previously the government said it wanted the new tracing system ready this month. Groups of up to six people from different households can meet outside in Northern Ireland. At a press conference, first minister Arlene Foster said that places of worship could reopen for private prayer, while drive-in cinemas, concerts and theatre would also be allowed under the further easing of lockdown measures. The health secretary has said 21,000 people have been hired to carry out contact tracing. Matt Hancock added that the number included 7,500 healthcare professionals who would provide call handlers with expert clinical advice. Anyone over five with coronavirus symptoms in the UK is now eligible for a test. Announcing the plans, Hancock said the measure would apply to anyone across the four nations with a continuous cough, high temperature or the loss of taste or smell The transport secretary has said more countries could be exempted from quarantine rules over time. A 14-day quarantine scheme for new arrivals to the UK will come into force \u201cearly next month\u201d. Ireland is the only country to be excluded because of a longstanding common travel area arrangement, but Grant Shapps said other countries where there were low incidents of coronavirus may also be excluded after consideration. Scotland could start lifting lockdown measures from 28 May. During a daily press briefing, first minister Nicola Sturgeon said a route map presenting plans to ease the lockdown would be published on Thursday. Under the first phase, people will be able to meet a member of another households outdoors while social distancing, while garden centres and recycling facilities will also be reopened. Loss of smell or taste is now being treated as a Covid-19 symptom in the UK. A statement from the four chief medical officers said people who experience anosmia should self-isolate. They added that the measure had been recommended after thorough consideration of emerging data and evidence on the virus. The government\u2019s immigration bill has been deemed as \u201cnot in the national interest\u201d by Labour. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds criticised the government\u2019s decision to not waive healthcare fees for all migrant workers in the NHS. The bill will undergo its second reading in the House of Commons this evening. The chief executive of the NHS tech department has said its apps lack \u201ccredibility\u201d, according to the Health Service Journal. Matthew Gould said NHSX were \u201closing goodwill and credibility because we keep doing non-compliant builds and launches.\u201d The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate continues to rise, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice. As of 5pm on Sunday, 411 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19 across 74 prisons, a 1.5% increase in three days, when last figures were available, while there were 540 infected prison staff across 71 prisons, a rise of 2% in the same period. The number of prisoner escort and custody services (Pecs) staff who have tested positive for Covid-19, rose from 19 to 23 in the period, an increase of 21%. There are around 80,300 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, while around 33,000 staff work in the public sector prisons. A total of 21 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died, as well as nine prison staff, including one Pecs worker. An inspection of three men\u2019s local prisons published on Monday revealed that prisoners with coronavirus symptoms at Wandsworth jail were locked in cells for up to two weeks without being released once, including for showers. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) conducted snap inspections at three jails - Wandsworth in south London, Altcourse in Liverpool, and Elmley on the Isle of Sheppey - to assess the response to the pandemic and found that the new restrictive regime designed to tackle the impact of the virus meant asymptomatic inmates were being released from cells for no more than 30 minutes a day. Here are the main points from Dominic Raab\u2019s press conference. Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, would not commit the government to having its new contact tracing app ready for 1 June. That is the date when, theoretically, the government might ask some primary school pupils in England to return to school. At one stage the government said it wanted its new contact tracing system up and running this month. But, asked if the app would be ready by 1 June, he just said: In terms of the app, it\u2019s still our intention to roll it out across the country for everyone to use in the weeks ahead, I can\u2019t be any more precise at this stage. But, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re making pretty good progress with it. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, stressed that the app would only be one part of the contact tracing scheme. He said: The app is one part of the test and trace system, the rest is much more of the tried and tested methodology used by Public Health England for this and many other diseases. As the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason reports, Raab also stressed that 1 June was only a provisional deadline. The government only said pupils might go back then if certain conditions were met. Van-Tam rejected claims that up to 200,000 coronavirus cases may have been missed because until today loss of smell was not treated as a symptom. (See 5.26pm.) He said most infected people with loss of smell had other symptoms too. So, he said, this new definition would only make a \u201cvery small\u201d difference to the overall case numbers. Van-Tam said he accepted coronavirus test results needed to be processed more quickly. Commenting on testing, he said: We are sending a clear message as scientists that it needs to be fast and we need to work as hard as we can to improve the timeliness of the testing system as we go along. Van-Tam said the government was currently considering whether to allow different households to meet up as part of a so-called \u201cbubble\u201d. In Northern Ireland Arlene Foster, the first minister, has announced the further easing of some lockdown measures, in addition to ones already announced like the opening of recycling facilities and garden centres. (See 10.25am.) At a press conference earlier she said: Outdoor gatherings of up to six people from outside the same household would be allowed. Places of worship could reopen for private prayer, provided people socially distanced. Drive-in religious services would be allowed, provided people stayed in their cars. Drive-in cinemas, concerts and theatre would also be allowed. Golfing would be permitted. Foster also the Northern Ireland executive was considering the case for allowing small weddings. Doctors have reported new possible outbreaks of Covid-19 in care and nursing homes in west London, two months after the area became a hotspot. \u201cJust when we thought there might be light at the end of the tunnel, two new or worsening care home outbreaks over the past 48 hours,\u201d said Dr Anna Down, clinical lead at a GP practice with 1,000 residents on its books in 15 privately-run nursing homes. \u201cIs this a whole new spike or just more evidence that this awful virus is way more pervasive and persistent than we thought?\u201d An increase in testing of residents and workers is exposing further cases, but there has also been a rise in the number of hospitalisations. You can read the full report from our colleague Robert Booth here: If you missed it earlier, here is a video of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announcing that anyone in the UK aged five and over who has coronavirus symptoms will be eligible for a test. From today, recognised symptoms include the loss of smell and taste, as well a persistent cough and a high temperature. Meanwhile in the Commons the government\u2019s flagship immigration bill is receiving its second reading. The bill repeals EU freedom of movement, instead seeing EU and non-EU migrants treated equally. Addressing MPs on Monday afternoon, home secretary Priti Patel said: Since publishing the details of the new points-based system in February, our world has undoubtedly changed. But what has not changed is this government\u2019s unwavering support for our NHS and its incredible professional staff. They are the very best of Britain. She reiterated the promise of a fast-track NHS visa, which would make it easier and quicker for medical professionals to work in the health service, but made no concession to permanently scrap the surcharge many migrant healthcare workers will pay to access it. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, told the Commons: Nobody should have barriers placed in front of them when their work is essential in helping us all. The issue has been mishandled by this government from the start of the crisis. Additional fees for NHS staff to access the very health care that we are thanking them for providing is no way to mark their extraordinary service throughout this process. Full details of the new rules will not be published until later this year but are also expected to include minimum salary thresholds for migrants. The system will come into force in January, after the Brexit transition period ends. Q: The Welsh first minister said Wales had gone a week without a conversation with the UK government. Is it just ignoring Wales? Raab says that is not the case. He does not know when the two government\u2019s last spoke. But the UK government is trying to develop an approach for the whole of the UK. He claims a repository of goodwill has been built up. Van-Tam says he had a conversation with one of his Welsh counterparts late last week, and will have another this evening. And he says Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, is in touch with his counterparts from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland almost daily. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Raab says the UK government has been very mindful of the need for anyone from England wanting to go to one of the other countries of the UK, like Wales, to have to follow rules there that might be different. Q: Why do migrant care workers have to pay the NHS surcharge, which charges them to access the health system that in many cases they serve? Raab says there are no plans to change the rules. But the government recognises that many people come to this country and make a valuable contribution. Q: You did include an exemption for health workers. So why not carers? Raab says this is always being kept under review. He says he understands the point. Q: Why did you not introduce quarantine earlier? Van-Tam says quarantine was introduced for some people arriving from China, and from certain parts of Italy. Iran was covered too, he says, although he says he cannot remember the exact details. But he says at that point the virus was fairly limited. Then it spread internationally. He says, as the incidence decreases in the UK, the case for using quarantine again gets stronger. Q: Does the UK want a global inquiry into the causes of coronavirus? The proposed WHO one does not mention China in its wording. Raab says the UK wants a review that does get to the bottom of what happened. Q: What is Sage recommending in relation to the notion of \u201cbubbles\u201d that would allow two households to meet up? Van-Tam says Sage is currently looking at this. It would not be appropriate to say more at this stage, he says. Q: Are you running late with the contact tracing scheme? And why are some test results coming back so late? Raab says they are making good progress with contact tracing. And he says they only said the step two measures (including some primary school pupils in England going back) would only happen not before 1 June. It was a conditional deadline, he says. Van-Tam says the app was only going to be one part of the contact tracing system. He says testing does have to be carried out more quickly. Q: Will the contact tracing app be ready by 1 June, when you want children back in schools? Raab says it will be rolled out in the coming weeks. He cannot say more at this point, he says. Van-Tam says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of cases affecting children are very mild. Do children have a higher infection rate than adults? He says data from around the world suggests the infection rate is about the same for children, although perhaps a bit lower for young children. Can they infect adults? He says the data on this is sparse. But he says it is clear that children are not high-output transmitters in the way they are with flu. And so is it safe to open schools? He says the key calculation is whether or not it will push the reproduction number, R, above 1. He accepts this is a difficult issue, because there are disadvantages in keeping children out of school. Van-Tam says health officials thought very carefully about adding anosmia (loss of smell) to the official list of coronavirus symptoms. He says it does not often occur early in the illness. And it is very rare for it to appear on its own. Q: Prof Tim Spector (see 10.50am) estimates that between 100,000 and 200,000 cases may have been missed because of the exclusion of this from your list. What is your estimate of how many cases have been missed? Van-Tam says he does not know anyone else who has tried to work out this figure. But most of the people with loss of smell have developed other symptoms too. So he thinks this change will make a relative small difference to the overall numbers. Q: Is the government preparing for a second wave? Raab says the government is very keen to avoid a second wave. Van-Tam says the government absolutely wants to avoid a second wave. That is why it is being so careful about lifting restrictions step by step. But he says it is nevertheless proper to prepare for one. People might hope and pray this virus will go away. But we will only be \u201cout of this\u201d when a vaccine is available. So we have to learn to live with it for months or years to come. And he says we don\u2019t know much about this virus yet. The flu virus goes away in the summer and comes back in the winter. He says it is not clear yet whether the same applies to this coronavirus. The first question is from Danny from Bury. He wants to know when the government will publish its plan for economic recovery once the crisis is over. Raab says a roadmap has already been published. But it is a conditional one, he says. And here is the latest chart for deaths. Van-Tam is going through the daily slides. This one shows mobility data, based on Apple map requests. He says it a noticeable increase in walking and driving, but not in public transport use. Raab says the government has adopted a balanced approach, influenced by the overriding need to avoid a second peak. Raab is summarising government strategy. This is a standard feature in these press conferences, even though regular viewers will be very familiar with the script. Raab is reading out the latest testing and death figures. He says the number of people in hospital is down 13% from last week. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, has arrived for the daily UK government press conference. He is with Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England. The Department for Health and Social Care has released the latest daily figures for coronavirus deaths in the UK. A further 160 deaths have been recorded, taking the total to 34,796. An earlier post originally quoted Matt Hancock saying that 750 of the 21,000 people recruited to carry out contact tracing were healthcare professionals. (See 3.39pm.) In fact Hancock said it was 7,500 out of the 21,000. As the Independent\u2019s Rob Merrick points out, that it more than double the number of healthcare professionals they were originally expecting to hire. A man who was taken to intensive care after contracting Covid-19 has been able to go rollerskating just two weeks after leaving hospital. Clayton Jean-Charles, 55, from Greenwich, south London, was taken to University hospital Lewisham on 11 April after experiencing symptoms including a high temperature, sore throat and shortness of breath. The plumber was moved to an intensive care unit when his condition worsened, and put on a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. Jean-Charles, who has four adult daughters, was able to go home to his wife on 29 April after almost three weeks in hospital. Within two weeks, he went rollerskating in Greenwich Park, a hobby he took up around a year ago. I still have a bit of a way to go to get back to full health, the fact that I was well enough to go rollerskating in the park less than two weeks after being discharged shows how much better I am. The Science Media Centre has some expert reaction to the decision to include loss of smell as an official symptom of coronavirus. It is a good move, the academics quoted say. Prisoners with coronavirus symptoms were locked in cells for up to two weeks without being released once, including for showers, inspectors have revealed. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) conducted snap inspections at three jails - Wandsworth in south London, Altcourse in Liverpool, and Elmley on the Isle of Sheppey- to assess the response to the pandemic. In a report published today chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said: The vast majority were locked up for nearly the whole day with usually no more than half an hour out of their cells. We found some examples of even greater restrictions. In one prison, a small number of symptomatic prisoners had been isolated in their cells without any opportunity to come out for a shower or exercise for up to 14 days. The jail in question, Wandsworth, had made the decision \u201cin consultation with Public Health England, and as a result of the lack of space for a protective isolation unit.\u201d The Victorian prison\u2019s \u201cphysical limitations\u201d had a \u201csevere impact\u201d, the report said. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, used her daily press briefing at lunchtime to announce the expansion of testing to five-year-olds, several hours earlier than Hancock\u2019s statement. She said it was a result of cooperation on mass testing between NHS Scotland and the Scottish and UK governments and would use a network of drive-through testing centres, which has been dogged by problems between the two governments over sharing test results. \u201cIt will help more people to know if they have the virus and it will also be very helpful as we build towards our strategy of test, trace, isolate and support; something that as you know will be especially important as we start to emerge gradually from the lockdown,\u201d she said. This collaboration follows a sharp rise in tensions between the UK and devolved governments over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to unilaterally ease lockdown restrictions in England earlier this month. Sturgeon said many people could find it hard to reach the five rapid testing centres installed by the Department of Health and Social Care at airports outside Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen, and a fifth city centre site in Perth. To help those unable to travel to them, the British army\u2019s mobile testing units would be used more widely in Scotland, she said. Restaurant chains Bella Italia and Caf\u00e9 Rouge are on the brink of collapse after owner Casual Dining Group filed an intent to appoint administrators for the businesses on Monday. A spokesman for the company said: \u201cThese notifications are a prudent measure in light of the company\u2019s position and the wider situation. \u201cThese notifications will also protect the company from any threatened potential legal action from landlords while we review the detail of the Government advice, and formulate a plan for the company in these difficult times.\u201d In the Commons the Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards asks for an assurance that Wales will get its fair share of any vaccine produced. Hancock says the deal with AstraZeneca means that, if the Oxford vaccine works, there will be 100m doses for the UK. Here is a Guardian video explaining how contact tracing works. Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy asks what protection there will be for people who cannot go to work because they are shielding until 30 June. Hancock says of course all the protections already in place will remain. Hancock says this crisis has demonstrated just how important social care is. (On 24 July last year, on the day he became prime minister, Boris Johnson said in a speech: \u201cI am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared.\u201d Ten months later that plan still has not been published.) Asked when dentists will be able to operate again, Hancock says dentists are doing emergency appointments. As for restarting dentistry more broadly, Hancock says he is working on this. He says he wants to get it up and running, but it has to be safe. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health committee, asks how low the daily number of new cases has to be for the contact-tracing scheme to be able to operate. Hancock says having 21,000 contact tracers should be enough given the current level of new cases, according to the latest ONS figures. But he is willing to hire more, he says. Hancock is now responding to questions from Jonathan Ashworth, his Labour shadow. He says 62% of care homes have not had an outbreak. (He is referring to England.) He says there was no large-scale removal of people from hospitals to care homes at the start of this crisis, despite some people implying otherwise. There was no large-scale removal of people from hospital into care homes towards the start of this crisis, as has been implied by some. In fact, the number of people moving from hospitals into care homes has fallen throughout this crisis and those movements have been done with care. This crisis has shown that there are many lessons for reform in the social care sector, not least the much closer integrated working with the NHS that we\u2019ve seen in these crisis days. He says the contact-tracing app is \u201csuccessfully\u201d being piloted. He says the government is preparing for the national rollout. He says Ashworth was wrong to criticise the involvement of the private sector in testing. He says he thought that wing of the Labour party had left the shadow cabinet. Hancock says contact tracing is being rolled out. Hancock says 21,000 contact tracers have now been hired. At the weekend the figure was 17,000, and Hancock had set himself a target of 18,000 by this week. Hancock says the 21,000 include 7,500 healthcare professionals. Today I can confirm that we have recruited over 21,000 contact tracers in England. This includes 7,500 health care professionals who will provide our call handlers with expert clinical advice. They will help manually trace the contacts of anyone who\u2019s had a positive test and advise them on whether they need to isolate. They have rigorous training with detailed procedures designed by our experts at Public Health England. They have stepped up to serve their county in its hour of need and I want to thank them in advance for the lifesaving work that they\u2019re about to do. Hancock says the plan has been to slow the spread and protect the NHS. The plan is working, he says. He says he wants to tell MPs about the next steps. First, the government is protecting care homes, he says. It has announced a \u00a3600m package of support. Second, the list of coronavirus symptoms has been updated. Third, eligibility for testing is being expanded. Anyone over five with symptoms is now eligible for a test, Hancock says. And he says that applies to the whole of the UK. Yesterday we conducted 100,678 tests. Every day we are creating more capacity and that means more people can be tested, and the virus has fewer places to hide. Today, I can announce to the house that everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test. That applies right across the UK in all four nations from now. Anyone with a new continuous cough, a high temperature or the loss or change of sense of taste or smell can book a test by visiting nhs.uk/coronavirus. Nicola Sturgeon announced this for Scotland earlier. (See 12.42pm.) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a Commons statement. He says coronavirus has been the most serious public health threat for 100 years. But we have got through the peak, he says. TV companies have agreed guidelines for producers to follow to allow television programmes to start filming again in a way that minimises the risk from coronavirus. The document is available here. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says this should enable TV production to start again in the coming weeks. In a statement Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said: Great British television is keeping us company throughout the crisis, and I\u2019m keen to get cameras rolling as soon as it is safe to do so. This is a significant step forward in getting our favourite shows and soaps going again. Our creative industries are Britain\u2019s global calling card, and I want to see them get back to doing what they do best safely. And this is from Carolyn McCall, the ITV chief executive. Our production teams are now working hard to bring many more much loved shows back for viewers. This requires really innovative thinking, but above all, the safety and well-being of all those who work on the programmes is paramount. Working with partners across the industry, and with the support of DCMS, we have created clear guidelines to give producers a framework within which they can ensure that their production is safe. Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that protecting the human rights of prison inmates is \u201can absolutely key priority\u201d after an expert body warned they were being breached during the coronavirus pandemic. The Scottish Human Rights Commission, a statutory body, warned MSPs today that it believes the Scottish Prison Service is breaching the European convention on human rights on degrading and inhumane treatment. (See 12.30pm.) Asked about the commission\u2019s warnings, which it says followed repeated meetings with the justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, the first minister said: I can\u2019t stress enough at the best of times, but particularly these times, that human rights for people in our prisons are very important and we will always seek to operate in a way that respects and protects that. SPS said these restrictions affected only 23 prisoners who were being isolated on medical advice. A spokesman said reductions in access to showers, telephones and outdoor exercise was regrettable. \u201cIt is not a desirable state of affairs, but they are in lockdown for health reasons,\u201d he said. He said SPS had a duty \u201cto try and preserve the health and wellbeing of everybody in a confined environment\u201d. So far, six inmates have died in Scottish jails with Covid-19 symptoms; of the 23 in isolation with symptoms, one has confirmed Covid-19. Scotland\u2019s prison population, which was at 8,300 in late November last year, fell last week to below 7,000 for the first time in 13 years, at 6,961. Around 160 prisoners have been released early to relieve overcrowding and help physical distancing under Scotland\u2019s emergency powers, but the overall population has fallen sharply because the courts have largely closed down due to the pandemic. In the Commons Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is now taking questions. He has just told MPs that the government will publish details of its proposed quarantine scheme for new arrivals to the UK soon and that it will come into force \u201cearly next month\u201d. He said that initially it would be a \u201cblanket\u201d scheme (although the government has already said Ireland will be excluded, because of the longstanding common travel area arrangement). But Shapps said that the government would later consider the cases for excluding other countries, where there were low incidents of coronavirus. Prof Brian Cox, the scientist and broadcaster, has said that ministers may be undermining public trust in science in the way they talk about it when defending their decisions. He said he was particularly concerned about ministers saying they are just \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. Speaking at a Science and Media Centre press briefing, Cox, who is the Royal Society professor for public engagement with science, said ministers use the mantra of \u201cfollowing the science\u201d as a defence to difficult questions about the coronavirus outbreak. He said: The politicisation of science or scientific advice might deliver some short-term political advantages. It\u2019s very tempting, I think, to blame the science if a decision is made which subsequently turns out to be suboptimal in some way. But, this will have, I think, serious long-term consequences because it undermines public trust in science ... We need to see how ministers made the decisions, and how they may have changed their minds as new knowledge became available, because this is the way to enhance the public trust. I think you can see why there\u2019s concern in the scientific community over the, \u2018we are following the science message\u2019. It almost seems sometimes like a defence that some ministers appear to have been coached to deploy, when asked a difficult question. Police Scotland officers have spoken to the writer Neil Gaiman who admitted to travelling more than 11,000 miles from New Zealand to his house in Skye in breach of Scotland\u2019s lockdown rules, PA Media reports. The American Gods and Good Omens author said he travelled to Scotland so he could \u201cisolate easily\u201d after he and his wife Amanda agreed they \u201cneeded to give each other some space\u201d. Writing on his blog, he described how he flew \u201cmasked and gloved\u201d from Auckland airport to Los Angeles (LAX) and then on to London before borrowing a friend\u2019s car and driving north to Skye. But only essential journeys are permitted under lockdown rules in Scotland. A statement from the Scottish police force confirmed the 59-year-old had been given \u201csuitable advice\u201d. Inspector Linda Allan said: Officers have visited Neil Gaiman and spoken to him about his actions. He has been given suitable advice about essential travel and reminded about the current guidelines in Scotland. And the Department of Health in Northern Ireland has recorded a further six coronavirus deaths, taking the total to 482. The full details are here. Public Health Wales has recorded a further four coronavirus deaths in Wales, taking the total to 1,207. In the Commons Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has just started taking questions. He began by saying that there have now been more than 2m claims for help from the self-employed income support scheme, for sums worth a total of \u00a36bn. He said money would arrive in bank accounts in six days. NHS England has announced 122 new coronavirus deaths in hospital, bringing the total number of hospital deaths in England to 24,739. Of the 122 new deaths announced today, 27 occurred on 17 May; 59 occurred on 16 May; 29 occurred on 15 May; six occurred on 14 May; and one occurred on 13 May. The full details are here. The chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair has condemned plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on international travellers arriving in the UK as \u201cidiotic\u201d. On Monday morning, Michael O\u2019Leary claimed the proposals had \u201cno medical or scientific basis\u201d, adding that the use of face masks onboard would \u201celiminate\u201d the spread of coronavirus. Ryanair announced last week that it would operate nearly 1,000 flights a day from 1 July, subject to European countries lifting flight restrictions and \u201ceffective public health measures\u201d being put in place at airports. International travellers will be asked to quarantine for a fortnight when they enter the UK, either in accommodation of their choice or provided by the government. An implementation date for the measure is yet to be announced. O\u2019Leary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: It\u2019s laughable that this government can come up with any plans for a quarantine that will be strict and fully enforced when already they are exempting the Irish, the French ... It is idiotic and it\u2019s unimplementable. You don\u2019t have enough police in the UK to implement a two-week lockdown. Downing Street has said there will not be an exemption for France, but there would be an exemption for Ireland as part of the common travel area. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe theatre is facing insolvency and the risk of closure because of the coronavirus pandemic. The digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee has called for more financial support to be given to creative institutions. In a letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, the committee\u2019s chairman, Conservative MP Julian Knight, said it would be a \u201ctragedy\u201d if the South Bank theatre were to close. He said: Shakespeare\u2019s Globe is a world-renowned institution and not only part of our national identity, but a leading example of the major contribution the arts make to our economy. For this national treasure to succumb to Covid-19 would be a tragedy. The theatre has warned it faces the \u201cbiggest threat to its future\u201d since it opened in 1997, the DCMS committee said in a statement. Last week the Old Vic\u2019s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, also warned that it was in a \u201cseriously perilous\u201d financial situation caused by the Covid-19 crisis. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over. It went on for longer than usual, and covered a wide range of topics. Here are the main points. Downing Street has played down prospects of its new contact tracing system being up and running nationwide this month. The system is being piloted in the Isle of Wight. At one point Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he wanted to have the whole system up and running by the middle of May. But, when the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked when it would be fully operational, he just said that this would happen \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. The spokesman said that 17,000 contact tracers were already in place and that the government was \u201cvery confident\u201d of getting the numbers up to 18,000 by the end of this week, as planned. The contact tracers are getting a range of training, he said. A decision is likely this week as to whether the government will go ahead with plans for some primary school pupils in England to start going back on 1 June (a fortnight today), the spokesman signalled. The UK government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan said Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils would go back \u201cno earlier than Monday 1 June\u201d. The spokesman confirmed that this was still the position, but he accepted that 1 June (the Monday after half term, for many pupils) remained an ambition. Asked when the government would be able to say if this would be the date, he replied: You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can. When it was put to him that in practice this meant a decision this week, because next week is half term, the spokesman did not challenge this assumption. He said that the safety of pupils came first, but that the government was also aware of the damage being done to children from their not being in education. The spokesman said the government would publish its scientific advice about the safety of children being in school \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. On Friday the government published an overview on this topic (pdf), he said. But the teaching unions want to see the full scientific advice. Asked when they would get it, the spokesman said: The Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] papers are being published in batches, and the DfE papers will be published as soon as possible. The government does not necessarily need to have its new contact tracing system operational nationwide for it to move to the \u201cstep two\u201d stage of the lockdown relaxation measures set out in its plan, the spokesman suggested. He said various factors would be taken into account before the government moved to step two, such as the reproduction number. But he said the government had not made having the contact tracing system up and running an essential condition. The quarantine rules being imposed on new arrivals to the UK will be reviewed every three weeks, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. He confirmed that the government is planning to issue more details of how the scheme will work \u201cin due course\u201d. But when the quarantine rules are introduced, they will be \u201csubject to rolling review every three weeks\u201d, the spokesman said, to ensure that they are in line with the latest scientific advice. That suggests that they will be reviewed in parallel with the existing lockdown regulations, which also have to be reviewed every three weeks. Those rules are next being reviewed on 28 May. The spokesman would not say whether this meant the quarantine rules could come into force on that date. The spokesman insisted that there had never been an exemption for France. A joint statement from the British and French governments on the night of the PM\u2019s TV broadcast clearly implied that an exemption for France was being planned. But the spokesman rejected this. He said: There was never an exemption for France. All the statement ever said was that there would be no quarantine in relation to France at this time. It was never correct to suggest that there was going to be an exemption for France only. The spokesman claimed the original statement had been misreported by the media. The spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision to maintain the immigration health surcharge - a charge paid by immigrants to cover their possible use of the NHS. This has become particularly controversial because it applies to people who are actually working themselves for the NHS. Asked to justify the charge, the spokesman said that the government committed to increasing it in its election manifesto and that it had raised \u00a3900m directly for the NHS by the end of the 2018-19 financial year. The spokesman said that latest data showed that 38% of care homes in England have had a coronavirus outbreak. The spokesman said that the decision to add loss of smell to the official list of coronavirus symptoms (see 11.29am) was expected to increase the number of cases by 2%. The spokesman said that the NHS Nightingale hospital at the Birmingham NEC was now on standby. Like the one at the ExCel centre in London, it has effectively been mothballed. The spokesman said that the Manchester one has patients. But another three of the seven in England, in Harrogate, Bristol and Sunderland, are open but without patients, he said. He said an eighth was being built in Exeter and would be operational at the end of the month. The spokesman rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson was responsible for people not realising that Wales now has tighter lockdown rules than England. At the weekend English people travelling to Wales to walk in the countryside were turned away, even though this is allowed in England. When Johnson announced the rules were being relaxed in his TV address, he was criticised for not being more explicit about how this only applied to England. But, when asked if he was responsible for English people being fined by Welsh police, the spokesman did not accept that. He said: We were very clear from the outset that people would need to respect the rules in Wales. The spokesman said the prime minister was feeling \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d. Asked why the PM was not taking more press conferences himself (like Nicola Sturgeon, who almost always leads the Scottish government\u2019s one), the spokesman said: \u201cNot for a specific reason. The PM did the press conference last week and I\u2019m sure you will see him again shortly.\u201d Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said. Raab will appear with Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England. The spokesman indicated that the PM was happy about Sir Mark Sedwill being cabinet secretary and national security adviser. Some MPs reportedly want him to separate the two roles. In the Spectator last week James Forsyth wrote: One hawk in government says that this issue has been compounded by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill staying on as national security adviser. They complain that in a well-functioning system the national security adviser would have challenged the cabinet secretary on the Huawei decision, but that can\u2019t happen when the national security adviser and the cabinet secretary are the same person. A break-up of Sir Mark\u2019s empire looks inevitable. But the spokesman said today that Sedwill had been \u201csuccessfully fulfilling both roles since June 2018\u201d. The Welsh first minister has denied his government has been slow to offer Covid-19 tests to everyone in care homes in Wales. Opposition politicians said the original decision not to test all residents and staff in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry. Mark Drakeford insisted the government\u2019s position had been led by the science and initially the focus needed to be on care homes where there had been confirmed or suspected cases. He said: Governments act on advice. Ministers don\u2019t pluck policies out of the air. They rely on the advice we are given. The advice changed on Thursday, we made the decision on Friday, we published it on Saturday. The advice has changed because up until now our focus has been on responding to those care homes where there has been an actual or suspected case of coronavirus. But eight out of 10 care home homes in Wales have had no confirmed case of coronavirus. Now with coronavirus declining in the community and probably having peaked and just be beginning to decline in the care home sector too, we want to put more attention on stopping coronavirus from getting into those eight out of 10 care homes where there has been no case. Students will have to wait until they complete their online courses to find out whether they are of a high enough standard to justify tuition fees, according to the universities watchdog. The Office for Students (OfS) will use responses to the annual National Student Survey, published in April, as well as students\u2019 grades and graduate jobs to determine the success of online courses, according to its chief executive, Nicola Dandridge, who appeared before the committee this morning. \u201cIf however it transpires that online learning is not what they expected, not what they wanted, not leading to the outcomes, they will tell us that and we will intervene. Likewise if we find that students who are studying online, don\u2019t get the graduate outcomes and aren\u2019t getting the jobs. [...] But we\u2019re not prejudging online as good or bad until we assess it,\u201d she said. Dandridge said that because the OfS does not have an inspection system it is unable to directly monitor online courses. She added that the regulator was in dialogue with students\u2019 unions to get real time information on poor-performing courses. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be bunging lectures online, it\u2019s got to be more sophisticated than that,\u201d she said. Many students have complained about their low quality online teaching. OfS chair, Michael Barber, who also appeared before the committee, said that despite the uncertainty students should be expected to pay for now because universities are in a \u201ctransition phase\u201d. \u201cWe should go into this with a very positive frame of mind that universities are going to do all they can,\u201d he said. In the meantime, if students have urgent concerns, the regulators said individuals should complain to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, or seek legal recourse. Dandridge said that tuition fee refunds would \u201cdepend on what is offered to them and whether that represents a breach of contract\u201d. Universities could reopen campuses when it is still \u201cdangerous\u201d to do so amid increased financial pressures, MPs have been warned. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said leading the decision to institutions could be problematic as competition to attract students may encourage them to reopen prematurely. Universities have been urged not to make any promises to students that studies will resume as normal in the autumn by the higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS). Addressing a virtual education select committee, Grady called upon the government to publish firmer guidance on universities full reopening campuses next term. They will be wanting to promise students that they\u2019ll be reopening next semester in order to attract those students rather than them go somewhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that we can just sort of leave what that guidance should look like to numerous different universities, when they\u2019re also in competition with each other to try and attract students, I think would be incredibly dangerous.\u201d Grady also reiterated calls for universities to be given more government funding to reduce financial pressures if students choose to cancel or defer their places in September. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has expressed concern that police officers have been assaulted and coughed and spat at as they have enforced the lockdown in Wales. \u201cThis is simply and absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he said. Drakeford said that there had been some examples of people breaking the Welsh \u201cstay at home\u201d rules by travelling from England to Wales over the weekend. He said one family of four from Birmingham had been found on Pen y Fan, a mountain in the Brecon Beacons, south Wales. A man who had driven from Devon to Brecon was also caught. The man claimed he was there to buy dog food. The first minister said he would look at evidence from the four police forces in Wales about the level of fines people who break the rules should incur. There have been calls from some police chiefs for fines to be increased. Jeane Freeman, Scotland\u2019s health secretary, has said that all care home staff in Scotland will be offered testing for coronavirus, regardless of whether there are any cases in the home they work in. She added that they will have to be tested repeatedly for the measure to be effective. Details of the new advice will be laid out in parliament tomorrow. Scotland will publish a route map presenting plans to gradually lift the coronavirus lockdown in the country on Thursday, said Sturgeon. The map \u201cwill give a more detailed indication of the order in which we will carefully and gradually seek to lift current restrictions,\u201d she added. We will continue to take a cautious approach that ensures the virus is suppressed while seeking as much normality as possible when it is safe to do so. If there is \u201cprogress in suppressing the virus\u201d, the first phase of lifting lockdown measures will begin on May 28. Under the first phase, members of the public will be able to meet up with a member of another household while socially distancing, while some outdoor sporting activities, such as fishing, will be allowed to resume. Garden centres and recycling facilities will also be reopened, while some of those who cannot work from home will be asked to return to work. From today, Scotland is widening the number of people who can be tested for Covid-19. Anyone over the age of five who has any of the recorded symptoms for the virus will be able to book in for a test. Tests will be available at drive-in testing sites as well as at 12 mobile testing units across Scotland. Tests at drive-in centres have already been made available to over-65s, key workers and to anyone who needs to work and who cannot work from home. They are also already available to people who live with anyone in those groups. For health workers or their household members, testing is available through the NHS. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has begun Scotland\u2019s daily Covid-19 briefing. As of 9am today, 14,394 positive cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the country \u2013 an increase of 57 from yesterday. A total of 1,427 patients are in Scottish hospitals with Covid-19 symptoms. Of those, 1,005 people have been confirmed to have the virus, while 422 are suspected of having it. Last night, 63 people were in intensive care with confirmed or suspected coronavirus. A further two people have died after contracting the disease in the past 24 hours, taking Scotland\u2019s total death toll to 2,105. However, Sturgeon urged people to take into account the fact that recorded deaths are usually lower over the weekend. The Scottish Human Rights Commission, a statutory body that advises ministers and MSPs, has tabled a complaint that the Scottish prison service is allegedly breaching the rights of inmates during the coronavirus crisis. The SHRC has told the Scottish parliament\u2019s justice committee it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d the prison service is breaching the European convention on human rights which prohibit inhumane and degrading treatment in prisons. It told MSPs the commission \u201chas knowledge of\u201d inmates confined to their cells for 24 hours a day for extended periods without access to showers or outdoor exercise; inmates who are confined to cells for Covid-19 reasons given limited telephone access to lawyers; some prisoners \u201cunable to maintain any form of telephone contact with their families\u201d. In a letter to the committee, Judith Robertson, the commission\u2019s chair, said: \u201cThe commission is deeply concerned about the current conditions being experienced by some people within Scotland\u2019s prisons. People in prison are likely to be more vulnerable to the risks and impacts of Covid-19. \u201cMeasures taken to protect health cannot override people\u2019s fundamental rights. It is not acceptable to confine anyone to their cell for 24 hours a day, with no access to shower facilities or outdoor exercise, and with limited contact with the outside world. \u201cGiven the serious nature of our concerns, we have urged the Scottish government to take action to ensure that all prisoners are being held in conditions which are fully in accordance with the state\u2019s human rights obligations. To date, we have not received the assurances we would wish to see in this regard.\u201d Only a limited number of inmates and staff are thought to have contracted Covid-19 in Scotland\u2019s prisons, but emergency measures have been put in place to reduce transmission inside prison. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, has authorised the early release of some prisoners to relieve pressure on jails. A new survey from thinktank CLASS has found that 60% of workers are three months or less away from defaulting on their recent or mortgage. The poll of 2,026 workers in the UK also found that further 26% were just one month away from defaulting on their rent or mortgage. Meanwhile, one in five of those surveyed \u2013 including carers, delivery drivers and supermarket staff \u2013 feared losing their job within the next months due to the coronavirus recession. Dr Faiza Shaheen, the director of CLASS, said: It is shocking that over half of all workers fear they are so close to being without a roof over their heads. Millions of people \u2013 including those now on universal credit and those not qualifying for the furlough scheme \u2013 will be increasingly desperate as their mortgage and rent holidays end. Protecting workers now requires us looking past emergency measures to a recovery plan. It is up to the chancellor to seize this opportunity, to build a bridge from the furlough scheme and unemployment benefits to green jobs and a fairer society. Amid the continued coronavirus crisis, other government business is rolling on \u2013 including talks with the US over a new, post-Brexit trade deal. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has just released a statement calling the just-ended first round of talks \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d. That is, however, more or less as much as we learn from the 560-word statement on the virtual talks, which took place from 5 to 15 May. It says: Both sides are hopeful that negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement can proceed at an accelerated pace. The meetings were positive and constructive, reflecting the mutual commitment to secure an ambitious agreement that significantly boosts trade and investment between our economies, the first and fifth largest in the world. A list of 30 subjects discussed included \u201cmarket access for goods, agriculture\u201d, but this was the only mention of what still seems the most difficult subject \u2013 whether the US will demand access to foodstuffs produced to lower standards, such as chlorine-washed chicken, which the UK government has so far resisted. There is a long way to go. Cyclists have been warned to keep an eye out for thieves after an insurer reported a 46% rise in claims for stolen bikes during the lockdown. Admiral home insurance said the rise happened over the seven weeks from 23 March, compared with the same period in 2019, despite claims for general thefts falling. As bicycle sales boom while people try to keep active and avoid using public transport, Admiral urged cyclists to make sure they kept their bikes securely. David Fowkes, head of household underwriting at Admiral, said bikes had become an easier target than homes during the lockdown. Our data shows just how more common bike theft has been during the lockdown; in the last seven weeks, 37% of the theft claims we\u2019ve received were for stolen pedal bikes, compared with just 12% last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re warning all cyclists, whether they\u2019ve been cycling for years or have just bought their first bike, to be vigilant, keep an eye out for thieves and step up their bike security.\u201d This is from the UK government\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care. Here is the statement from all four chief medical officers in the United Kingdom saying that anosmia (loss of smell) is now being treated as a coronavirus symptom. (See 11.08am.) That means people who lose their sense of smell should self-isolate, even if they do not have other symptoms. The statement says: From today, all individuals should self-isolate if they develop a new continuous cough or fever or anosmia. Anosmia is the loss or a change in your normal sense of smell. It can also affect your sense of taste as the two are closely linked. We have been closely monitoring the emerging data and evidence on Covid-19 and after thorough consideration, we are now confident enough to recommend this new measure. The individual\u2019s household should also self-isolate for 14 days as per the current guidelines and the individual should stay at home for 7 days, or longer if they still have symptoms other than cough or loss of sense of smell or taste. The statement is from the four chief medical officers in the United Kingdom: Prof Chris Whitty (England); Dr Gregor Smith (Scotland); Dr Frank Atherton (Wales); and Dr Michael McBride (Northern Ireland). A \u201cmental health minute\u201d recorded by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has been broadcast on all UK radio stations to mark the start of Mental Health Awareness Week. The message, which was aired at 10.59am and encouraged listeners to \u201creach out to someone\u201d, also featured England football captain Harry Kane, singer Dua Lipa, actor David Tennant and boxer Anthony Joshua. Prince William told listeners: \u201cWe\u2019re all connected and sometimes just talking about how you\u2019re feeling can make a big difference. So right now, let\u2019s join together across the UK and reach out to someone.\u201d Tennant said: \u201cRight now, we need each other more than ever and in the weeks and months ahead of us, we will all have an important role to play in being there for one another.\u201d The broadcast, produced by Radiocentre and Heads Together, marked the first time that all commercial, community and national and local BBC stations jointly aired the same message. I\u2019m Amy Walker. I\u2019ll be joining my colleague Andrew Sparrow to help steer you through today\u2019s UK coronavirus updates. People who experience a loss of smell or taste are being advised to get tested for Covid-19, in a change of guidance from the UK government that experts say is well overdue, Sarah Boseley reports. Her full story is here. Hugh Pym, the BBC\u2019s health editor, did not find much evidence of crowding at Liverpool Street station in London this morning. Prof Tim Spector, the head of the department of genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has restated his claim that the NHS is under-estimating the real number of people infected with coronavirus. His claim is based on the data thrown up by the Covid symptom app launched by Kings. Speaking on the Today programme, Spector claimed there were 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with coronavirus who are not being told to self-isolate. He blamed Public Health England (PHE) and the wider tracking strategy, saying an insistence that only temperature and cough were the major symptoms was missing thousands of cases. Spector said 1.5 million people were logging onto the King\u2019s app and tracking a wide range of symptoms and changes. He went on: It tells us that we\u2019ve got at least 100,000 cases at the moment of people who are infected. And this is from our data, although the NHS would underestimate that because they\u2019re not counting all the symptoms ... At the moment, people are being told to go back to work if they\u2019re a care worker, and they\u2019ve got something like loss of smell or taste or severe muscle pains or fatigue - things that we know and we\u2019ve shown are related to being swabbed positive. This country is missing the ball in underestimated cases but also putting people at risk, and continuing the epidemic. So we really do need to tell Public Health England to get in line with the rest of the world, and make people more aware. There\u2019s no point telling people to be alert if they don\u2019t know the symptoms. Northern Ireland is taking its first steps in the process of easing the lockdown today. Garden centres and recycling facilities are opening. Angling is also allowed again. Marriage ceremonies involving someone with a terminal illness are also permitted. The Northern Ireland executive is also expected to announce further relaxation measures this afternoon, with the region set to formally move to phase one of its five-step exit plan (pdf). As PA Media reports, Ken Mills was first in line for Palmerston Recycling Centre in Belfast ahead of its reopening at 9am this morning. \u201cI\u2019ve had a two-hour wait, but I don\u2019t mind because I am getting rid of a lot of stuff that has been cluttering the garage,\u201d he said. This morning the Daily Telegraph has splashed on a story (paywall) saying that a study from Australia suggests that the risk of coronavirus spreading in schools is extremely low. Here\u2019s an extract. Coronavirus does not spread widely in schools, according to a major study which is being considered by government advisers ... The study examined by the government advisers was conducted by Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance. It was cited by the country\u2019s officials when they announced that children should return to the classroom and found schools had a \u201cvery limited\u201d role in transmission of the virus. The scientists found that across 15 schools in New South Wales, 10 secondary and five primary, 18 people \u2013 nine teachers and nine students \u2013 had confirmed coronavirus. Of the 735 students and 128 staff who were in close contact with the virus carriers, only one secondary school pupil caught it from another student and one primary school pupil caught it from a teacher. You can see this in the graphic below. The Telegraph has splashed the story, obviously, because it is relevant to the dispute between the government and teaching unions about whether it would be safe for pupils in England to start returning to school from next month. (See 9.38am.) But on the Today programme this morning Prof Kristine Macartney, director of Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation, Research and Surveillance, argued that this study should not be seen as the final word on the matter. It was just a preliminary report and more research was needed, she said. She stressed that the situation in Australia was very different from the situation in the UK. It is very important to note that Australia\u2019s epidemic has been different to many other parts of the world. We closed our borders down very quickly, and that was particularly effective for us. In total in Australia we\u2019ve only had a little over 6,000 cases and our curve has really gone down to just a handful of cases per day now. It has been in that context that we\u2019ve been able to keep schools open by and large. Asked if her study should be used to persuade teachers in the UK that it was safe to go back to work, she replied: I think it\u2019s important to take our study in the context in which it was done. I think it\u2019s really a complex decision, once you are talking about returning to the workplace, returning to school, opening up transportation. All of these things need to be really carefully considered ... And so no one single piece of information, certainly from another country, can provide the answer to the UK or anywhere else. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT union, which represents head teachers, told the Today programme this morning that teachers wanted more clarification on whether schools were centres of transmission. He said: Specifically around the transmission from children to adults, we\u2019ve been told over the weekend - it\u2019s been asserted by the government publicly over the weekend - that there isn\u2019t the level of risk that we fear. However, we haven\u2019t yet seen the scientific underpin of that. There\u2019s been some commentary and I want to invite the government today to write to me so that I can talk to the 31,000 school leaders that we represent, particularly in the primary sector, and say this is why the government has made that assessment. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was doing the morning interview round on behalf of the government this morning. Here is a summary of what he\u2019s been saying. Dowden said he did not expect Premier League football to resume until \u201cprobably mid-June at the earliest\u201d. He said the Premier League would need to find a way for it to go ahead safely behind closed doors before the government gave approval. He said he was looking at increasing the number of free-to-air matches as this could be helpful in terms of discouraging people from leaving their homes to watch football games. He explained: There is a rule at the moment that at 3pm you can\u2019t show matches on TV because people were watching it in the football stadiums. Clearly that is not going to be the case at the moment, so some of those slots may be available for free-to-air, so we are looking to see whether we could do that as part of the wider broadcasting package. He defended the proposals in the immigration bill, which is getting its second reading this afternoon. \u201cThis means that finally we determine exactly who comes into this country and we can attract the brightest and the best from around the world - not just from confining it to within Europe,\u201d he said. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here is the agenda showing what\u2019s coming up. 9.30am: The Commons education committee takes evidence from the National Union of Students, the University Alliance, the University and College Union and the Office for Students about coronavirus. 12pm: Downing Street is due to hold its daily lobby briefing. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily government briefings. 2.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 3pm: Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, makes a statement in the Commons about coronavirus. Around 4.30pm: MPs begin debating the second reading of the immigration bill. 5pm: Hancock is expected to take the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. Here\u2019s some reaction to the government\u2019s announcement yesterday that if the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University proves successful in human trials then up to 30 million doses for the UK could be available by September. Prof Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said he thought a vaccine was not likely to be widely available until next year. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think we have a very high chance of seeing a number of vaccines that work because we know a lot about this target and I think there\u2019s good scientific rationale to say it\u2019s not such a hard target as others. My gut feeling is that we will start to see a number of candidates coming through with good evidence early towards next year - possibly something this year - but they won\u2019t be readily available for wide scale use into the beginning of next year as the kind of most optimistic estimation. This may come as a disappointment to readers of this morning\u2019s Daily Mail splash, which is suggesting a vaccine could be available for widespread use more quickly. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says Labour cannot support the government\u2019s immigration bill, labelling it a \u201cthreat\u201d to the health and social care sector. The legislation, which will undergo its second reading in the House of Commons today, brings to fruition the promise of an \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d first outlined by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove when they were fronting the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum. But Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think that it is totally unfair on the one hand to be saying thank you to those foreign-born workers we have in our NHS and then charging them for actually using it. The home secretary has actually waived it for those health care staff who have had their visas extended from October. She then promised to review it for other staff in the NHS. She apparently now isn\u2019t reviewing it. I think that\u2019s the wrong thing to do, and I think it really does speak to whether we value what people have been doing to help us through this crisis or not. He said the government\u2019s proposals were \u201cnot fair\u201d and \u201cnot in the national interest\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s because they are deeming people who are low skilled to be unwelcome in this country.\u201d As passenger numbers coming into the capital are expected to rise today with extra trains put on, two travellers were this morning on their way out of London at King\u2019s Cross. PC Jason Kelly, who was on his way to north Hertfordshire after a night shift, told PA Media: Up until a week ago, in the early morning there were only two people on the train. When they changed the lockdown last week that went up to about 30 or 40 people. He wasn\u2019t confident passengers would be able to stick to social distancing measures once numbers rise further, adding: For some people it\u2019s just like a normal day, people have got fed up with it (coronavirus), they\u2019ve had enough. Meanwhile, another police officer on his way home to Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire from King\u2019s Cross said through a lot of the lockdown he had been the only passenger on his train. \u201cIt\u2019s been marvellous, but now everything is going back to normal,\u201d he said. He said he did not feel unsafe while travelling but did not think other commuters would try to keep 2 metres apart. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even [stick to physical distancing] in the shops,\u201d he told PA Media. \u201cThat said, everyone has been very good on the Tube - everyone wears a mask and tries to sit far apart.\u201d Good morning, folks. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here kicking off the UK live blog today. Extra trains are expected to take thousands more people back to work under Downing Street\u2019s plan to accelerate economic activity as lockdown restrictions designed to halt the spread of Covid-19 are eased. But King\u2019s Cross station, one of the capital\u2019s busiest transport hubs, was almost deserted this morning \u2013 despite more trains running as part of the effort. Regular announcements urged people to stick to physical distancing measures, while the concourse was dotted with stickers reading: \u201cProtect your NHS, stay 2m apart\u201d, while regular announcements urged people to stick to social distancing measures. It comes as a new survey suggests that more than a third of people say they could rethink the way they travel after the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said he is hoping Premier League football behind closed doors will be able to start by mid-June. \u201cI had some very constructive discussions on Thursday with the FA, the EFL and the Premier League. We\u2019re working hard with them to try and get it [football] back, I\u2019m aiming for, for mid-June but the number one test is public safety,\u201d he told Sky News this morning. It comes after Germany\u2019s Bundesliga restarted last weekend. The Guardian reported last week that a planned resumption of play on 12 June was looking less likely \u2013 and kick-off a week later is now a possibility after safety concerns were raised. Yesterday, the government announced that if the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University proves successful in human trials then up to 30 million doses for the UK could be available by September. In other news, MPs on parliament\u2019s education select committee will discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on schools and children\u2019s services at 9.30am today.",

      "body": "<p>Labour has expressed concern at coronavirus lockdown measures being eased at the start of June after ministers conceded that a key part of the test-and-trace regime to contain new outbreaks, a phone app, would not be ready for weeks.</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that anyone over the age of five with coronavirus symptoms would be eligible for a Covid-19 test. The news is expected to lead to a surge in people visiting the gov.uk website to book home test kits or drive-through appointments.</p> \n<p>Until now, eligibility was limited to certain groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.</p> \n<p>But there are fresh worries about the NHS phone app, which is designed to be downloaded by millions to curb the spread of Covid-19, as the organisation representing local public health leaders said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the level of government engagement on the issue.</p> \n<p>Amid ongoing questions about the scheme, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer acknowledged that the country needed to go \u201cbigger and faster\u201d when it came to testing.</p> \n<p>While ministers announced on Monday that they had exceeded the 18,000 target for applicants to become contact tracers in the new system, with more than 21,000 now confirmed, the national rollout of the app has been held up.</p> \n<p>Last week, Hancock said it would be ready by mid-May.

      "bodyText": "Labour has expressed concern at coronavirus lockdown measures being eased at the start of June after ministers conceded that a key part of the test-and-trace regime to contain new outbreaks, a phone app, would not be ready for weeks. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that anyone over the age of five with coronavirus symptoms would be eligible for a Covid-19 test. The news is expected to lead to a surge in people visiting the gov.uk website to book home test kits or drive-through appointments. Until now, eligibility was limited to certain groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups. But there are fresh worries about the NHS phone app, which is designed to be downloaded by millions to curb the spread of Covid-19, as the organisation representing local public health leaders said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the level of government engagement on the issue. Amid ongoing questions about the scheme, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer acknowledged that the country needed to go \u201cbigger and faster\u201d when it came to testing. While ministers announced on Monday that they had exceeded the 18,000 target for applicants to become contact tracers in the new system, with more than 21,000 now confirmed, the national rollout of the app has been held up. Last week, Hancock said it would be ready by mid-May. But answering questions at the daily Downing Street press conference, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said this would now happen \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. The app, which is intended to notify authorities of new Covid-19 cases so people who have been in contact with them can be contacted and self-isolate, is being tested on the Isle of Wight. It has been downloaded by about 60,000 people there, just under half the island\u2019s population. Raab was unable to confirm that the app would be ready for national use by 1 June, the earliest date for the so-called stage two of the lockdown easing, which will see some primary pupils return to school, and the reopening of some non-essential shops. \u201cIn terms of the app, it\u2019s still our intention to roll it out across the country for everyone to use in the weeks ahead. I can\u2019t be any more precise at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re making pretty good progress with it.\u201d Raab added: \u201cWe are learning all the way as we go through this pandemic, not just on the scientific side but on the innovation, that we need to get a grip on it.\u201d Making a statement earlier in the House of Commons, Hancock said he was \u201cready and preparing for rolling out that system\u201d, but gave no date. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said he was concerned at the new timetable. \u201cMinisters promised tracing would be in place by the middle of this month,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deadline has now slipped again even though a tracing service is vital for a safe easing of lockdown restrictions. The government\u2019s failure to bring in a functional test, trace and isolate regime exposed yet again the slowness of ministers to get a grip of this crisis.\u201d Separately, in a statement released on Monday, the Association of Directors of Public Health said its members would work closely with the government to implement the new tracking regime, but listed a series of areas where it had concerns. The organisation was \u201cdisappointed at the limited extent the government has involved local government in the development of all aspects of the test, track and trace programme\u201d, the statement said. Among a series of recommendations, the statement urged greater cooperation, more localism and efforts to avoid duplication in operating the new system. Downing Street had indicated earlier that the introduction of the app might not be necessary either for the new system to operate, or for the lockdown to be eased further. \u201cIt is possible to do track and trace work separately to the app, and that\u2019s obviously something that happened previously. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to do that again,\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said. Asked whether the app was necessary for the changes on 1 June, he said that this decision would be based on the five tests the government has set, including the rate of infection. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, speaking alongside Raab at the briefing, echoed this point, saying the app was \u201cone part of the test and trace system\u201d and that a more vital element was the work of the contact tracers. But as the government announced an expansion of testing for anyone with possible coronavirus symptoms, he agreed with a questioner who asked whether some test results were coming back too slowly. \u201cFrom that perspective you are absolutely right that we need to do it bigger, and faster, and as fast as we can,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are sending a clear message as scientists, that it needs to be fast, and we have to work as hard as we can to improve the timeliness of the testing system as we go along.\u201d At the press briefing, Raab stressed that the 1 June date for the next stage of the easing was not confirmed: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said, of course, that the steps that we might take with step two, will only ever be taken at the earliest on 1 June.

The bookseller intends to ask shoppers to set aside any book they touch on trolleys which will be wheeled away into storage for at least 72 hours before being put back on shelves in an effort to protect customers from the spread of coronavirus, in a move first reported by consumer writer Harry Wallop. James Daunt, the chief executive of Waterstones, said the retailer has been advised that the virus cannot survive for long on cardboard or paper but will be taking extra precautions to give them time to \u201cself heal\u201d. Other measures to protect staff and customers will include perspex screens in front of tills, limits on the number of shoppers, a one-way system in stores and the closure of cafes as Waterstones adapts to physical distancing measures required by the government along with thousands of other retailers. The retailer has seen online sales rise more than 300% during lockdown as the closure of all bookstores since the end of March as well as enforced leisure and limited options for entertainment have strengthened demand. With staff saying they felt unsafe, the stores closed shortly before the UK government imposed a high-street lockdown. But already the virus had prompted an unprecedented demand for books with a 17% rise in sales. Daunt said classics, including lengthy \u201cbucket list\u201d books by Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust and pandemic-inspired literature such as Albert Camus\u2019s The Plague, had all proved popular, although the bestseller in Waterstones has been Rutger Bregman\u2019s uplifting book, Humankind, which argues that most people\u2019s instincts are good. \u201cReading was quite robust before lockdown and if anything this has been positive [for promoting reading]. But there has been an extraordinary subtle change in what people are reading,\u201d said Daunt. He said the closure of stores had generally hit sales of new books as it has made browsing and picking up on staff recommendations more difficult. He said Waterstones was now preparing for further change as the high street reopened. \u2018The expectation is that in most retailers behaviour will change,\u201d Daunt said. \u201cPeople will generally be coming out to shop with greater purpose, they are not just coming to while away the hours but generally they are going to pick up books,\u201d he said. Waterstones was hoping to reopen all its stores, when allowed under the government\u2019s planned gradual relaxation of lockdown. But he said it was difficult to judge how busy they would be.",

A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn\u2019t done rather more to protect the nation\u2019s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry.</p> <p>The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness.

An emotional fragility that can barely be kept at bay. Other people\u2019s anger he can just about deal with. It\u2019s their compassion that will get him in the end. The Dear Matt text in which he is dumped with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>For his Commons coronavirus statement, it was all Matt could do to hold it together for an hour. Hardly surprising as he knows better than anyone that much of what he\u2019s saying is pure fantasy. Though the truth might set him free, he\u2019s just not quite ready for the admission of failure. So he began as if the coronavirus was a mild inconvenience, rather than the worst public health crisis for 100 years.</p> <p>We\u2019d passed the peak \u2013 please, no one tell him about the probability of a second wave \u2013 and by and large everything was totally in control. The government had done brilliantly, hospitals had coped and NHS mental health services were there for anyone who needed them. Provided they were able to wait six months without falling apart completely for a referral to a professional.</p> <p>Care homes had had a protective ring thrown round them from the very start of the pandemic. As a description of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis it could hardly have been more inaccurate. But this wasn\u2019t about the public. It was about throwing a protective ring around Matt\u2019s psyche. This was as close to reality as he could bring himself to get.</p> <p>There were a few new announcements. From now on anosmia \u2013 a lack of smell or taste \u2013 would be added to a persistent dry cough and high temperature as coronavirus symptoms. And anyone with any of these symptoms could now get a test if they could log on to the NHS website and find a testing station with capacity to see them. Best of all, Matt was able to report that he had beaten his target of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/17/uk-contact-tracing-applicants-wrongly-told-hiring-paused-in-latest-misstep\">recruiting 18,000 tracers</a> \u2013 he didn\u2019t know if they were yet trained \u2013 and now had 21,000 people on the books. Though given Hancock\u2019s dodgy record on false accounting, it was quite possible that some of the new recruits may have been counted twice.</p> <p>Some politicians believe you need to be cruel to be kind. Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, takes the opposite view and is kind to be cruel. He\u2019s long since stopped being angry with Hancock over the government\u2019s mishandling of the crisis and now just talks to him like an awkward teenager in whom he\u2019s disappointed. It had been a bit late to include anosmia, hadn\u2019t it? There hadn\u2019t always been a protective ring around care homes, had there? And what was the point in easing lockdown restrictions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/phone-app-delay-raises-concerns-about-easing-lockdown-on-1-june\">before there was a comprehensive test and trace system up and running</a> to replace them?</p> <p>Matt was now on the verge of breaking down. His eyes bloodshot as he tried to hold it together. Pleading for one last chance to make the relationship work. There was definitely a protective ring around care homes. Things would change. Get better, he promised. Having already forgotten that his new test and trace operation was supposed to have kicked in two days ago. Just one last chance, he pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ready and preparing,\u201d he said, apparently unaware that the two were mutually exclusive. You\u2019re either ready or you\u2019re preparing. A few Tory backbenchers tried to put a socially-distanced arm around him and reassure him he was doing OK, but most just melted away. Matt left the chamber alone. Hopefully to have a long sob in private. He might just find it cathartic.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, Priti Patel made a rare public appearance as she reintroduced her immigration bill. Most of us have long since concluded that the home secretary has been kept hidden because she is fundamentally useless. But now some MPs were wondering if she might not also have had the coronavirus. Because there was a total lack of taste in announcing plans to keep low-paid overseas workers out of the country, when they are doing more than most to keep the NHS, care homes and food deliveries running.</p> <p>Still, Patel did want to pay a small tribute to those doing jobs she considers unskilled. Not least because she has also proved that being home secretary is low-skilled work. So, as a compromise, she proposed that everyone should continue clapping key workers at 8pm on a Thursday. Just to help them on their way to the deportation centre. She\u2019s all heart, Priti.</p>",

We will have to act European in order to get well out of this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Macron, who has described the current crisis as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-delivers-a-moment-of-truth-on-the-meaning-of-the-eu\">moment of truth</a>\u201d for the EU, said the bloc had failed to show sufficient solidarity at the start of the pandemic, emphasising that the new cash would be given out in grants rather than loans.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhat is sure is that these \u20ac500bn will not be repaid by the beneficiaries \u2026 We are proposing to do real transfers [of money] ... that\u2019s a major step.\u201d</p> <p>Austria\u2019s chancellor Sebastian Kurz nevertheless made clear that the Franco-German initiative would face resistance from some northern EU member states.</p> <p>He tweeted: \u201cJust had a good exchange with the Prime Ministers of Denmark, Netherlands &amp; Sweden on the expected proposal by the EU Commission on the recovery fund and the updated [EU long term budget].</p> <p>\u201cOur position remains unchanged. We are ready to help most affected countries with loans. We expect the updated [budget] to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling.\u201d</p> <p>While the proposal is a significant move towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/european-union-italy-unity-failure-debt-germany-netherlands\">sharing debt</a>, a move that has been firmly resisted in the past by the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Finland, among others, the recovery fund would have a strict shelf-life and \u201cvolume\u201d, according to a paper published by Berlin.</p> <p>The Dutch government in particular has been concerned at any move that could institutionalise debt-sharing and unconditional grants, claiming that there is a moral hazard in bailing out member states that have failed to prepare for economic difficulties.</p> <p>Merkel stressed during the press conference that the recovery fund should be seen as a \u201cone-off effort\u201d and that \u201cbecause of the unusual nature of the crisis, we are choosing an unusual path\u201d.</p> <p>There is growing anxiety that the different speeds at which EU countries recover from the pandemic, and the lockdowns it has enforced, could prove to be an existential threat to the bloc. Earlier this month the European commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ursula-von-der-leyen\">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, conceded that companies in rich countries including Germany had been given an unfair advantage by the relaxation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/ec-president-warns-state-aid-is-unlevelling-the-playing-field-in-europe\">EU\u2019s state aid rules</a>.</p> <p>The commission\u2019s recent economic forecasts suggest that Germany will also have a far less dramatic contraction of its economy than most other member states. In contrast, Greece\u2019s gross domestic product is forecast to shrink the most, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/coronavirus-threatens-future-eurozone-brussels-economic-social-divisions-pandemic\">by 9.7%</a>, owing to the closure of its tourist industry. GDP in Italy and Spain is expected to contract by 9.5% and 9.4% respectively.</p> <p>Von der Leyen, who is expected to unveil the commission\u2019s own plan next week, welcomed the Franco-German announcement, in a coordinated statement.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces, and rightly puts the emphasis on the need to work on a solution with the European budget at its core.</p> <p>\u201cThis goes in the direction of the proposal the commission is working on, which will also take into account the views of all member states and the European parliament.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The comments were echoed by Charles Michel, the president of the European council, which comprises the heads of government and state of EU member countries.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d the former prime minister of Belgium said. \u201cIn order to reach an agreement, all 27 EU member states will be involved. I call all 27 member states to work in a spirit of compromise as soon as the [European commission] has tabled a proposal. Relaunching and transforming our economies impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic is key.\u201d</p> <p>Macron conceded that a French-German deal alone \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean an agreement from the 27\u201d. A European council of the 27 heads of state and government is expected to debate the proposal next month.</p>",

He said: \u201cWhat is sure is that these \u20ac500bn will not be repaid by the beneficiaries \u2026 We are proposing to do real transfers [of money] ... that\u2019s a major step.\u201d Austria\u2019s chancellor Sebastian Kurz nevertheless made clear that the Franco-German initiative would face resistance from some northern EU member states. He tweeted: \u201cJust had a good exchange with the Prime Ministers of Denmark, Netherlands &amp; Sweden on the expected proposal by the EU Commission on the recovery fund and the updated [EU long term budget]. \u201cOur position remains unchanged. We are ready to help most affected countries with loans. We expect the updated [budget] to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling.\u201d While the proposal is a significant move towards sharing debt, a move that has been firmly resisted in the past by the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Finland, among others, the recovery fund would have a strict shelf-life and \u201cvolume\u201d, according to a paper published by Berlin. The Dutch government in particular has been concerned at any move that could institutionalise debt-sharing and unconditional grants, claiming that there is a moral hazard in bailing out member states that have failed to prepare for economic difficulties. Merkel stressed during the press conference that the recovery fund should be seen as a \u201cone-off effort\u201d and that \u201cbecause of the unusual nature of the crisis, we are choosing an unusual path\u201d. There is growing anxiety that the different speeds at which EU countries recover from the pandemic, and the lockdowns it has enforced, could prove to be an existential threat to the bloc. Earlier this month the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, conceded that companies in rich countries including Germany had been given an unfair advantage by the relaxation of the EU\u2019s state aid rules. The commission\u2019s recent economic forecasts suggest that Germany will also have a far less dramatic contraction of its economy than most other member states. In contrast, Greece\u2019s gross domestic product is forecast to shrink the most, by 9.7%, owing to the closure of its tourist industry. GDP in Italy and Spain is expected to contract by 9.5% and 9.4% respectively. Von der Leyen, who is expected to unveil the commission\u2019s own plan next week, welcomed the Franco-German announcement, in a coordinated statement. She said: \u201cIt acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces, and rightly puts the emphasis on the need to work on a solution with the European budget at its core. \u201cThis goes in the direction of the proposal the commission is working on, which will also take into account the views of all member states and the European parliament.\u201d The comments were echoed by Charles Michel, the president of the European council, which comprises the heads of government and state of EU member countries. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d the former prime minister of Belgium said. \u201cIn order to reach an agreement, all 27 EU member states will be involved. I call all 27 member states to work in a spirit of compromise as soon as the [European commission] has tabled a proposal. Relaunching and transforming our economies impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic is key.\u201d Macron conceded that a French-German deal alone \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean an agreement from the 27\u201d. A European council of the 27 heads of state and government is expected to debate the proposal next month.",

These included measures \u201cminimising the extent to which care workers are moving between different units\u201d. However, they were not published until last Thursday \u2013 a fortnight later.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, at least another 2,500 people died in English care homes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Last week, Boris Johnson admitted there had been \u201can appalling epidemic in care homes\u201d.</p> \n<p>DHSC said it would not comment on leaked documents and said the study would be published shortly. It stressed that it started working on new guidance and funding as soon as it received early results from the report.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are working around the clock to make sure care homes, and our frontline social care workforce, are getting the support they need to protect their residents and tackle coronavirus,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cOur help to care homes, which includes financial support, infection control training and supplies of PPE, has meant that two-thirds of England\u2019s care homes have had no outbreak at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour attacked the slowness of the government response. \u201cThe prime minister was warned about the risks of care workers moving between homes spreading the virus at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on 25 March,\u201d said Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister. \u201cYet it has taken ministers until now to fund care homes to reduce their reliance on bank and agency staff.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the pandemic had \u201cbrutally exposed how insecure, undervalued and underpaid care work is.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe prevalence of zero-hours contracts, high vacancy rates and high staff turnover have fuelled the reliance on agency and bank staff with all the problems that brings.

      "bodyText": "Temporary care workers transmitted Covid-19 between care homes as cases surged, according to an unpublished government study which used genome tracking to investigate outbreaks. In evidence that raises further questions about ministers\u2019 claims to have \u201cthrown a protective ring around care homes\u201d, it emerged that agency workers \u2013 often employed on zero-hours contracts \u2013 unwittingly spread the infection as the pandemic grew, according to the study by Public Health England (PHE). The genome tracking research into the behaviour of the virus in six care homes in London found that, in some cases, workers who transmitted coronavirus had been drafted in to cover for care home staff who were self-isolating expressly to prevent the vulnerable people they look after from becoming infected. At least 22,000 people are estimated to have died in care homes in England and Wales directly or indirectly from Covid-19. While the peak appears to have passed, the crisis is far from over for the country\u2019s 400,000 care home residents, with some providers reporting fresh outbreaks and hospitalisations at the weekend. During flu pandemic planning in 2018, a report from social care directors warned ministers that frontline care workers would need advice on \u201ccontrolling cross-infection\u201d. A 2019 PHE document about flu pandemic preparations called \u201cInfection prevention and control: an outbreak information pack for care homes\u201d urged operators to \u201ctry to avoid moving staff between homes and floors\u201d. But the DHSC\u2019s social care plan, published on 16 April, mentions nothing about restricting staff movements between homes in its chapter on \u201ccontrolling the spread of infection in care homes\u201d. Results from the PHE study, conducted over Easter weekend from 11 to 13 April, have been known about inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) since at least the end of last month, but were only circulated last week to care home providers, councils and local directors of public health. It was referenced as part of a \u00a3600m infection control plan, which adult social care directors said came \u201ctragically late in the day\u201d given the peak of deaths in care homes appeared to have already passed. The study warned: \u201cInfection is spreading from care home to care home, linked to changed patterns of staffing, working across and moving between homes.\u201d The infection could be introduced by \u201cbank staff\u201d \u2013 floating workers used to fill temporary vacancies in different homes \u2013 it said, adding that workers were often asymptomatic so \u201cby the time local health protection teams are informed of an outbreak substantial transmission may already have occurred\u201d. The existence of the study was flagged to care operators and councils last week when the care minister, Helen Whately, announced details of a \u00a3600m \u201cinfection control fund\u201d for care homes to allow providers to pay extra to carers who normally work in several homes in exchange for working in only one facility. The new plan to cut infection rates in care settings included instructions to councils and operators to \u201ctake all possible steps to minimise staff movement between care homes, to stop infection spreading between locations\u201d and that \u201csubject to maintaining safe staffing levels, providers should employ staff to work at a single location\u201d. The \u00a3600m funding is \u201cintended to help providers pay for additional staff and/or maintain the normal wages of staff who, in order to reduce the spread of infection, need to reduce the number of establishments in which they work\u201d. Documents seen by the Guardian show that on 30 April, shortly after a sharp rise of 4,300 care home deaths in a fortnight in England and Wales, DHSC officials had drafted plans for \u201ccomprehensive infection prevention and control measures\u201d in care homes. These included measures \u201cminimising the extent to which care workers are moving between different units\u201d. However, they were not published until last Thursday \u2013 a fortnight later. In the meantime, at least another 2,500 people died in English care homes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Last week, Boris Johnson admitted there had been \u201can appalling epidemic in care homes\u201d. DHSC said it would not comment on leaked documents and said the study would be published shortly. It stressed that it started working on new guidance and funding as soon as it received early results from the report. \u201cWe are working around the clock to make sure care homes, and our frontline social care workforce, are getting the support they need to protect their residents and tackle coronavirus,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cOur help to care homes, which includes financial support, infection control training and supplies of PPE, has meant that two-thirds of England\u2019s care homes have had no outbreak at all.\u201d Labour attacked the slowness of the government response. \u201cThe prime minister was warned about the risks of care workers moving between homes spreading the virus at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on 25 March,\u201d said Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister. \u201cYet it has taken ministers until now to fund care homes to reduce their reliance on bank and agency staff.\u201d She said the pandemic had \u201cbrutally exposed how insecure, undervalued and underpaid care work is. \u201cThe prevalence of zero-hours contracts, high vacancy rates and high staff turnover have fuelled the reliance on agency and bank staff with all the problems that brings. We need a fundamental rethink of social care as we emerge from this pandemic, and an essential part of this must be to ensure that care workers get the pay, status and career progression this vital sector deserves.\u201d The DHSC also examined three US studies of care home outbreaks showing high levels of transmission by asymptomatic carriers and staff members working in more than one facility. A report published in March about an outbreak in February at a home in Washington state where 23 people died found \u201cstaff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and inter-facility spread\u201d. Care operators have been increasingly reliant on flexible workers to fill shifts, with absence rates caused by self-isolation among permanent staff running as high as 25% at the peak of outbreaks. Until recent weeks, shortages of PPE exacerbated concerns that care staff risked spreading the illness and family members have complained of loved ones put at risk by care workers travelling to and from work without changing clothes. Vic Rayner, the executive director of the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care providers, said: \u201cStaff have always been extremely concerned with the potential for spreading the virus. It would be the last thing any of them want to do. \u201cThey have been putting the wellbeing of the people they are caring for above themselves. Good care homes have been implementing restrictions on movement from day one and have been buying out agency staff at their own cost [so they only work in one home]. \u201cThe challenge here is they are looking for restrictions on movement when we are already running with a high level of vacancies in the sector, people self-isolating with symptoms and now the roll out of testing of asymptomatic staff which will increase the numbers self-isolating again.\u201d",

Similar measures are scheduled to start 1 June in the rest of the country, while classes will resume the same day. \u201cWe need to maintain discipline, not relax this discipline since we\u2019re almost there,\u201d said L\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly called Amlo. \u201cI have a lot of faith and many expectations that we\u2019re going to finish taming this pandemic.\u201d The decision to resume comes amid questions over the Amlo administration\u2019s coronavirus response, which has depended heavily on disease modeling and involved little testing and no contact tracing. Mexico has also come under pressure from the United States to reopen its economy as factories near the border form important links in continental supply chains. Companies wanting to resume construction, mining and manufacturing activities could apply for permission starting Monday, Amlo said. But the move to reopen the economic comes amid an ongoing row over the scale of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus crisis. Amlo has been infuriated by a string of stories in foreign media outlets alleging that his government has undercounted Covid-19 deaths. Amlo returned to the theme at his daily press conference on Monday, accusing international media of wanting to damage his government and spreading disinformation. Physicians and public health experts express disquiet that the country is opening too quickly and the model used to guide Mexico\u2019s Covid-19 response is unable to produce granular information for knowing which municipalities to open. \u201cWe\u2019re at the peak and this peak could last a week or two weeks or who knows how long. It remains to be seen,\u201d said Asisclo de Jes\u00fas Villag\u00f3mez a former president of Mexico\u2019s college of critical care medicine. \u201cI think they should be taking measures for when things reopen, but not putting a date on it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re flying blind,\u201d added Xavier Tello, a physician and healthcare consultant. He said Mexico only tests suspected Covid-19 cases if symptoms are severe \u2013 something producing low coronavirus statistics. Still, the coronavirus tsar, Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, has insisted that \u201cthe curve is flattening\u201d and Amlo has told the country \u201cwe\u2019re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d A poll published on Monday by the Reforma newspaper found 67% of respondents believed the \u201cworst is yet to come\u201d with Covid-19, while 68% said people were already casting aside practices like social distancing and staying at home. The 324 municipalities scheduled to reopen were chosen if there were no recorded Covid-19 cases over the previous 28 days and cases were not rising in neighbouring municipalities. Analysts found flaws in the selection process, however; no Covid-19 tests were carried out in two-thirds of the municipalities reopening, according to an investigation by Valer\u00eda Moy, director of the NGO M\u00e9xico, \u00bfC\u00f3mo Vamos? Many of the chosen municipalities are also small and isolated and among the most marginalised in Mexico. More than 200 of the municipalities set to reopen in Oaxaca are governed by traditional rules known as \u201cuses and customs\u201d which are common in indigenous communities. The governors of Jalisco and Chihuahua states said municipalities there would remain closed to conform with statewide Covid-19 restrictions. Local officials in Oaxaca and Guerrero states also seemed unwilling to reopen. \u201cWith the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic, it\u2019s the indigenous population, which will be the most vulnerable [because] we don\u2019t have a comprehensive health system,\u201d Abel Bruno Arriaga, mayor of Malinaltepec in the rugged La Monta\u00f1a region of Guerrero, told El Universal.",

The bill follows the promise of an \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d first outlined by Johnson and Michael Gove during the 2016 referendum. Speaking in the Commons during the second reading debate, home secretary Priti Patel said: \u201cThe bill before us today will play a vital role in our recovery plans for the future. It will end free movement and pave the way for our new points-based immigration system. \u201cA firmer, fairer and simpler system that will attract the people we need to drive our country forward through the recovery stage of coronavirus laying the foundation for a high wage, high skill, productive economy.\u201d She highlighted the promise of a fast-track NHS visa, saying it would make it easier and quicker for medical professionals to work in the health service. Promoted by Johnson during last December\u2019s general election campaign, the NHS visa promises lower fees and rapid processing for qualified applicants such as overseas doctors who have secured an NHS job offer. The government has announced some proposals for the new system, suggesting points will be awarded for being able to speak English to a certain standard, having a job offer from an approved employer, and meeting a salary threshold of \u00a325,600. The plan will have to be approved by parliament. In a separate development, public recognition of the important role in the Covid-19 crisis of low-paid and so-called \u2018low-skilled\u2019 workers will change the tone of the immigration debate, a thinktank said on Monday. Two-thirds of the public (64%) agree that \u201cthe coronavirus crisis has made me value the role of \u2018low-skilled\u2019 workers, in essential services such as care homes, transport and shops, more than before\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A growing number of councils in England are warning parents not to expect schools to open on 1 June, as new union guidance for teachers suggests it will not be safe to mark children\u2019s books. Bury council in Greater Manchester is the latest to confirm that primary schools will not reopen for some pupils on the government\u2019s target date at the start of next month, pointing out that Covid-19 infections in the area are still too high. Tamoor Tariq, lead member for children\u2019s services, schools and families, said: \u201cWhile high levels of Covid-19 infection in the north-west remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be reopening schools on 1 June.\u201d The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will meet union leaders on Tuesday, as pressure builds on government to reopen primary schools in England to reception, year 1 and year 6. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents 19,000 members, said it would \u2013 with some caveats \u2013 support schools preparing to reopen from that date, after being reassured by government scientific advisers last week. A number of multi-academy trusts, which are independent of local authorities and close to government, have also supported the 1 June return to school. A growing number of councils including Liverpool, Hartlepool, Rochdale and Wigan have, however, told parents not to expect schools to reopen on the government\u2019s deadline. Stockport council, also in Greater Manchester, has said its schools will not be ready to reopen to more pupils until 10 June at the earliest, while Slough council in Berkshire warned its parents many schools in the borough would not be accepting more children until 8 June. Brighton and Hove city council also wrote to parents and carers on Monday warning of possible delays to reopening because of safety concerns. \u201cThe council\u2019s advice is that education provision in Brighton and Hove should only reopen to more children when education leaders are confident that it is safe for the children and staff. This may not fit with the expectations or timescales outlined by government,\u201d the letter said. Meanwhile in Essex the county council told parents that some schools may not be able to offer full-time provision for the year groups identified by the government to return first, adding that \u201cany new arrangements may not be introduced exactly from the 1st June\u201d. Fresh guidance for teachers from the country\u2019s biggest teaching union suggests it will not be safe to mark children\u2019s books and renews calls for PPE in schools. The National Education Union (NEU), with 450,000 members, remains unconvinced by government assurances and has issued its own guidance to primary schools, warning it is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that circumstances nationally would allow for wider reopening on 1 June. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the advice from the Sage committee on the return of schools would be published \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, giving no timeframe. \u201cWe continue to want to work with schools in order to get more children back into an education setting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now past the peak of the virus and it is right that we plan for the first phase of a controlled and careful return of some year groups from 1 June at the earliest. As we have always said, safety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child\u2019s education from not getting them back to the classroom.\u201d On the ground, headteachers say government ambitions to get all primary children back into school for a month before the school holidays are \u201cunworkable\u201d. There are also concerns that parents will be too scared to send their children to school, particularly those who are BAME because of mounting evidence that members of ethnic minority groups are particularly badly affected by the virus. Paul Harris, chief executive of the Tapscott Learning Trust which runs five primary schools in the east London borough of Newham, which had the worst mortality rate in England and Wales, said parents in his community were \u201cvery, very scared\u201d. There have been 15 deaths from Covid among the families of staff and pupils in the Tapscott community. \u201cWhen you knock on the door, all the curtains are shut.

We are trying to build up trust, but they have barricaded themselves in because they are scared.\u201d The NEU meanwhile has urged its members to insist on social distancing of 2 metres in schools, though government guidance has acknowledged young children will find it impossible to observe the same rules as adults and advises instead classes of fewer than 15 and well spaced desks. The NEU guidance says: \u201cGiven that the science does not yet show that children do not transmit the virus, the NEU believes that schools should operate in the same way as other workplaces and maintain social distancing in classrooms and in movement around the school.\u201d The guidance, which is also for members of GMB, Unite and Unison working in schools, provides a comprehensive checklist, including advice on everything from lidded bins to sanitising library books.

Top stories There are rising hopes for a coronavirus vaccine after a human trial in the US produced positive results in its group of eight volunteers. Here\u2019s a look at five organisations in the race to develop a vaccine. And in Geneva, China has joined 120 countries backing a push for a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d into the outbreak of Covid-19, despite earlier criticising Australia and other countries calling for such an investigation. However, there are growing suspicions that Chinese trade sanctions, including a new punitive 80% tariff announced on Australian barley overnight, are a form of retaliation.

Hundreds of McDonald\u2019s employees in Melbourne are the latest to be stood down because they may have come into contact with a delivery driver who tested positive. Australia\u2019s death toll from the virus rose to 99 yesterday.

The research says many areas have had fires reoccurring much too frequently to allow forests to recover, risking the beginning of ecosystem collapse. Court documents show Papua New Guinea\u2019s commerce minister is suing the Australian Financial Review over a series of articles about a multinational oil company, ASX-listed Horizon Oil, and its dealings in PNG in 2011. Former senior public servants have called for the reintroduction of a carbon price, saying it would be the least economically damaging way to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The interviews were aired on ABC TV\u2019s Four Corners last night. Aboriginal health organisations say the Queensland government is holding back a $3.3m national rollout of rapid Covid-19 testing in remote Aboriginal communities. Last month the federal government announced funding for a rapid-testing program in Aboriginal communities which cuts wait times to 45 minutes. World An unpublished UK government study has found temporary care workers transmitted Covid-19 between care homes. The study used genome tracking to investigate outbreaks. The US attorney general has dismissed the possibility of an \u201cObamagate\u201d investigation. William Barr says he does not expect a justice department review of the FBI\u2019s handling of 2016 election interference to lead to the criminal investigation of Barack Obama or Joe Biden, despite Donald Trump stoking the pseudo-scandal. A gunman who killed three US sailors and injured eight people at a military base in Florida last December planned meticulously and was radicalised overseas for at least five years, US officials said on Monday. The FBI learned of contacts between the gunman and an al-Qaida operative after breaking the encryption on locked cellphones.

And the Australian has a story about a student activist facing expulsion from the University of Queensland being threatened with criminal prosecution. Coming up The search for a fisherman who fell overboard off Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast resumes this morning. The ABS is due to release payroll data, showing how far jobs and wages fell at the end of April. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 A leading bookstore in the UK will keep quarantine measures in place when it reopens \u2013 but only for its books. Waterstones will ask shoppers to set aside any books they touch while browsing on trolleys, which will then be wheeled into storage for at least 72 hours before the books are put back on shelves. The retailer says it will be taking the extra precaution so its goods can \u201cself-heal\u201d from any potential exposure to coronavirus.

The preliminary study found that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher risk of death than those who were not. The pre-print of the study, which has been published online without peer review, comes with many caveats. None of those caveats include Trump\u2019s analysis. Those behind the research \u201caren\u2019t big Trump fans\u201d, the president said as an explanation for why he\u2019s taking the unproven drug. The research was a \u201ca very unscientific report\u201d, Trump said.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1.full.pdf\">research</a> was conducted by the VA and academic institutions including the University of Virginia School of Medicine. It analyzed the cases of 368 male coronavirus patients nationwide, 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. This was not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of drug testing, which would randomly assign hydroxychloroquine treatment to some patients and not to others. Instead, researchers looked back on cases \u2013 and weren\u2019t able to account for why doctors chose to treat some patients with the antimalarial drug and not others. It could be that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher chance of death because doctors chose to give the most severely ill patients the unproven drug.</p> \n<p><em>Maanvi Singh contributed reporting</em></p>",

But the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been warning since April that the drug should not be used for that purpose because it could cause irregular heartbeats and other cardiac trauma. The drug is not approved as a treatment for Covid-19 and Trump has not been diagnosed with the disease, to public knowledge. Trump\u2019s claim to be taking the drug was made as he attacked an administration whistleblower who went before Congress last week and described internal pressure to endorse the drug as an effective coronavirus treatment. The whistleblower, Rick Bright, was the former director of a federal agency in charge of vaccines. On Monday, Trump called Bright a hypocrite and then riffed on the supposed benefits of the drug, which the FDA advised has \u201cnot been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many people are taking it \u2026 The frontline workers many many are taking it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it. I\u2019m taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now, yeah. A couple weeks ago I started taking it. Because I think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day.\u201d Sean P Conley, Trump\u2019s physician, said in a memo that after \u201cnumerous discussions\u201d with the president \u201cfor and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks\u201d. Previously, Trump had endorsed the injection of disinfectants or light into the body to fight coronavirus \u2013 recommendations that were followed by a spike in calls to poison control centers. But Trump had never before claimed to be trying one of the home remedies himself. A string of studies around the world have suggested that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine do little to prevent or treat Covid-19, and the FDA has cautioned against the use of either drug for Covid-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial \u201cdue to risk of heart rhythm problems\u201d. The drugs \u201ccan cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia\u201d, the FDA said. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease doctor and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, has repeatedly warned that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug. The United States passed two grim milestones for coronavirus cases on Monday, surpassing 1.5m confirmed cases and 90,000 deaths, according to numbers recorded by Johns Hopkins University. Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment in March, a claim that was amplified for weeks on Fox News. But alarming reports in April about the health risks tied to the drug silenced that talk until the Bright episode. Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, told Congress last week that he was removed from his post after resisting pressure by the administration to make \u201cpotentially harmful drugs widely available\u201d, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The FDA has issued repeated warnings about the dangers of the drugs in question. \u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,\u201d the FDA commissioner, Stephen M Hahn, said in a statement issued in late April. \u201cThe FDA will continue to monitor and investigate these potential risks and will communicate publicly when more information is available.\u201d Trump acknowledged research finding that US veterans treated with hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t seem to fare better than those who weren\u2019t given the drug. The preliminary study found that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher risk of death than those who were not. The pre-print of the study, which has been published online without peer review, comes with many caveats. None of those caveats include Trump\u2019s analysis. Those behind the research \u201caren\u2019t big Trump fans\u201d, the president said as an explanation for why he\u2019s taking the unproven drug. The research was a \u201ca very unscientific report\u201d, Trump said. The research was conducted by the VA and academic institutions including the University of Virginia School of Medicine. It analyzed the cases of 368 male coronavirus patients nationwide, 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. This was not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of drug testing, which would randomly assign hydroxychloroquine treatment to some patients and not to others. Instead, researchers looked back on cases \u2013 and weren\u2019t able to account for why doctors chose to treat some patients with the antimalarial drug and not others. It could be that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher chance of death because doctors chose to give the most severely ill patients the unproven drug.

      "bodyText": "An end to home schooling looks like it\u2019s on the horizon in Australia, with many states now planning phased returns to classroom education. But the months of isolation and social distancing have seen parents and children drawing on deep reserves of creativity like never before. For Sydney\u2019s Simon Greiner, aka @TheCardboardDad on Instagram, isolation meant an escalation to his already impressive efforts to create a magical play world for his kids out of cardboard. Greiner started building his astonishing contraptions at the request of his four-year-old son. As each brief got filled, the next became more elaborate and specific \u2013 such as a \u201cgiant hand\u201d, \u201ca helicopter I can go in with a spinning propeller\u201d, \u201ca real castle I can go in with a drawbridge\u201d or \u201ca wrecking ball that lets me smash something down\u201d. Soon they were coming in at an \u201calarming frequency\u201d, Greiner says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice way to play with my kids in a way that they really appreciate, and that I appreciate on a slightly different level,\u201d Greiner says. Greiner\u2019s partner had already started hoarding cardboard before physical distancing was mandated (\u201cthere was a whole wad of it beneath the couch\u201d), but an increase in deliveries due to the lockdowns compounded the collection. Old projects have to be surreptitiously recycled: Greiner says there is a \u201cgraveyard\u201d of some of the bigger inventions on the family\u2019s back porch \u2013 out of sight, out of mind until they become something else. Anna Ryan-Punch and her 11-year-old son Luka have also been creating elaborate constructions with recyclables, though many of his projects have been set by his school inquiry class. They included building a machine of his choosing out of ordinary household bits and pieces. He designed and built a zipline out of a cup, some marbles, a bull clip and string. \u201cWe had to raid and rinse out a lot of the recycling bin,\u201d Ryan-Punch says. \u201cIt ended up being pretty hilarious, despite us both going, \u2018Oh no we have to build another thing\u2019.\u201d Much more palatable to all involved were the cooking tasks, which required Luka to research something that interested him, draw a plan or recipe, and then follow it \u2013 with yields including scrambled eggs and chocolate chip cookies. Some parents, meanwhile, have been going off the map by necessity. For artist Lily Mae Martin and her nine-year-old daughter Anja, following the school curriculum at home hasn\u2019t been a great success, so they started self-directed learning. Projects involved making paper dolls of the family together, using blocks to help Anja keep up with maths, and pulling apart an antique clock to study its mechanisms. Martin also painted a series of pictures of native animals at her daughter\u2019s request so they could both learn more about them. \u201cI think making kids feel safe and keeping their love of learning alive matters more at the moment,\u201d Martin says.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Trump claims to be on dubious anti-virus drug The US president, who has repeatedly touted the malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine despite studies suggesting it is of little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients and could even put them in greater danger, claims to be taking it as a preemptive measure. Trump made the comments as he attacked the credibility of a whistleblower who has publicly testified about internal pressure to endorse the drug as an effective coronavirus treatment. Official data highlight pandemic\u2019s wealth inequities Some areas of New York City have seen death rates nearly 15 times higher than others, according to data released by New York City\u2019s health department, showing the disproportionate toll taken on poorer communities. For the first time, the data shows a breakdown on the number of deaths in each of the city\u2019s more than 60 zip codes. EU recovery fund welcomed The president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, both applaud the Franco-German plan for a \u20ac500bn (\u00a3447bn) recovery fund. Lagarde calls the proposal \u201cambitious, targeted and welcome\u201d, while S\u00e1nchez says it is a \u201cpositive step in the right direction\u201d. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for [the] EU to put forward a proper financial package. We should keep moving forward,\u201d S\u00e1nchez adds. Known global death toll exceeds 317,000 According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,782,539 people have been infected and at least 317,566 are known to have died since the pandemic began. By far the worst affected nation is the US, where at least 90,194 people are known to have perished. Qatar imposes 11-day lockdown Qatar will close all shops and halt all commercial activities from 19 to 30 May, state news agency QNA reports, citing a decision by Qatar\u2019s cabinet. The closure excludes pharmacies, food supply stores and food deliveries. Prominent South Sudanese figure tests positive South Sudan\u2019s vice-president, Riek Machar, and his wife Angelina Teny have both tested positive, his office says. It adds that some of his office staff and bodyguards have also tested positive. Italy suffers lowest daily death toll since early March Italy registers 99 more deaths on Monday, the lowest daily rate since early March, and 451 new infections, down by more than 200 since Sunday. There is also a significant fall in new infections in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, from 326 on Sunday to 175 on Monday. Belgium suffers deadliest April since second world war A total of 14,790 people died in April in Belgium \u2013 the worst toll since the country was under Nazi occupation in the 1940s, according to a study. The total is substantially higher than the normal April death toll, which is usually fewer than 9,000 people, researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) found. UK confirms 160 more deaths The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care releases its latest daily figures, which show a further 160 deaths, taking the total to 34,796.",

      "bodyText": "Fans of The Archers had been worrying about young Johnny\u2019s hair loss, Lynda\u2019s recovery after the Grey Gables explosion and Kirsty\u2019s impending marriage to a birdwatching slave master when the coronavirus changed everything. Instead, 12 scripts and five weeks of storylines that were about to be written were summarily binned, the show\u2019s editor, Jeremy Howe, has revealed. In the early days of the pandemic it felt less like recording in Ambridge and \u201cmore like fighting the Battle of the Alamo\u201d, Howe said, as producers set about coming up with new ways of making the programme. Regular broadcasts of The Archers ended in early May to be replaced by three weeks of classics, also known as repeats, from the archives. Next week, the Radio 4 soap returns with life in Ambridge under lockdown. Writing in the Radio Times, Howe says: \u201cWe had to start from scratch, and we had to figure out a new way to make The Archers so that everything \u2013 absolutely everything \u2013 could be done remotely. It was probably the biggest challenge the programme has ever had to face.\u201d Actors have had to create their own home studios with a microphone on a stand, linked to a computer, and as many duvets as they can find to cocoon themselves in. Before the lockdown, there was lots of communal cricket practice banter and chats in the pub, now restored to its proper name of the Bull rather than The B at Ambridge. The new Archers will reflect contemporary events with newly written stories. Howe said: \u201cI told the team: keep it simple.\u201d Howe said he had been humbled by how well and creatively The Archers\u2019 production team, cast and writers had risen to the challenge of working during the lockdown. The Archers, the world\u2019s longest-running soap opera, has been a fixture of British life since 1951. Originally \u201can everyday story of country folk\u201d it now bills itself as a \u201ccontemporary drama in a rural setting\u201d. The show returns properly on 25 May with stories which feature David and Josh Archer, Tracy Horrobin and police officer Harrison Burns. Howe said there would initially be far fewer characters because of the logistical complexity of what they were doing, but there were plans to bring other favourite characters into the spotlight. He quoted David Archer, who once said: \u201cThe sun will always rise and there will always be cows to be milked. Life always goes on.\u201d Howe promised: \u201cSo it will be in The Archers.\u201d",

Andy Burnham said he did not want to gratuitously criticise central government but said its focus had been \u201cvery, very nationally driven\u201d and was creating problems in the regions. The government has faced criticism over its easing of the nationwide lockdown and plans to reopen schools in a fortnight, with council leaders from across the north of England saying it is too early to lift the restrictions in their areas. In Yorkshire and the north-east of England, the rate of infection is double that in London, according to latest figures from Public Health England. Burnham has pressed for the eight regional metro mayors \u2013 who represent nearly 12 million people in England, or one in five of the population \u2013 to be given a seat at the table of the government\u2019s Cobra meetings, alongside the London mayor Sadiq Khan and leaders of the devolved nations, but this has not yet been agreed by ministers.

On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks.</p> \n  <p>But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">raised concerns across Russia</a>, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-russia-defends-its-exceptionally-precise-covid-19-death-data\">nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus</a> had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death.</p> \n  <p>Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease. In Russia, the April data will only be made available in late May, and the May data is likely to come out in late June. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T11:21:54.655Z\">at 12.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec268b08f0886ce4f5d599f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T10:54:43.849Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Macron and Merkel to present joint EU recovery plan</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will present a joint plan to spur EU recovery from the coronavirus crisis</strong>, after weeks of debate over how to deploy billions of euros needed to quickly end a painful recession.</p> \n  <p>Europe is just beginning to emerge from the lockdowns to halt the outbreak, which has taken a huge bite out of national economies and raised the prospects of damaging recessions that could last for months.</p> \n  <p>But despite widespread recognition that the hardest-hit countries will be unable to repair the economic damage on their own, divisions among EU members on how to craft an overall response have hampered comprehensive action so far.</p> \n  <p>The bloc has pledged to muster \u20ac500bn in emergency funding, and the European commission is hoping to propose a budget that could be used to unleash stimulus worth one trillion euros.</p> \n  <p>Macron and Merkel aim to define \u201ca French-German initiative to respond to the Covid-19 crisis at the European level, in the areas of health, the economic recovery, the environmental and digital transition, and industrial sovereignty\u201d, the French presidency said.</p> \n  <p>They will meet via video conference, beginning at 3.30pm (2.30pm BST), followed by a joint declaration and press conference at around 5pm, AFP reports.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T11:20:43.800Z\">at 12.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec266088f08a1782fa7cbf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T10:42:26.642Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>A big day in Greece, where over 200 of its prime archaeological sites have been re-opened</strong> almost two months to the day after being closed as part of containment measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The reopening of sites in Athens\u2019 historic centre \u2013 capped this morning by the country\u2019s head of state visiting the Acropolis \u2013 has sparked a frenzy of activity to properly prepare the antiquities for the post-lockdown age.

this week\u2019s meeting of a key <strong>World Health Organization</strong> body due to Chinese pressure, its foreign minister has said, adding they had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. </p> \n  <p>Non-WHO member Taiwan had been lobbying to take part in the <strong>World Health Assembly</strong>, which opens later on Monday.</p> \n  <p>Taiwan has said it wanted to share with the world its successful experience at fighting the coronavirus, having only reported 440 cases and seven deaths thanks to early detection and prevention work. </p> \n  <p> But China, which considers democratically-ruled Taiwan its own with no right to attend international bodies as a sovereign state, strongly objected to Taiwan taking part in the assembly unless it accepted it was part of China, something the Taipei government refused to do. </p> \n  <p>Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, <strong>Joseph Wu</strong>, told reporters: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite all our efforts and an unprecedented level of international support, Taiwan has not received an invitation to take part. </p> \n   <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses deep regret and strong dissatisfaction that the World Health Organization Secretariat has yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and continues to disregard the right to health of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the pandemic, which Taiwan has strongly disputed. </p> \n  <p>The <strong>United States</strong> has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing. </p> \n  <p> Taiwan attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan president, <strong>Tsai Ing-wen</strong>, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects. </p> \n  <p>Wu said that Taiwan had agreed the issue of its participation would be put off until later in the year so the shorted assembly can focus on the coronavirus.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Understandably, countries want to use the limited time available to concentrate on ways of containing the pandemic.</p> \n   <p>For this reason, like-minded nations and diplomatic allies have suggested that the proposal be taken up later this year when meetings will be conducted normally, to make sure there will be full and open

The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement.

Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded.

In a report published on Tuesday ahead of unemployment figures expected to show the first signs of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the labour market, the Resolution Foundation said younger and older workers were the most likely to have lost their jobs or had their incomes reduced. The thinktank said ministers should be considering job guarantees to prevent young people being permanently scarred by the crisis. Here is the full story on Trump\u2019s hydroxycholorquine claims: Donald Trump has told reporters at the White House that for \u201ca couple weeks\u201d he has been taking a malaria drug as a defense against Covid-19 \u2013 despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. The drug is not approved as a treatment for Covid-19 and Trump has not been diagnosed with the disease, to public knowledge. Trump\u2019s claim to be taking the drug was made as he attacked an administration whistleblower who went before Congress last week and described internal pressure to endorse the drug as an effective coronavirus treatment. The whistleblower, Rick Bright, was the former director of a federal agency in charge of vaccines. On Monday, Trump called Bright a hypocrite and then riffed on the supposed benefits of the drug, which the FDA advised has \u201cnot been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many people are taking it \u2026 The front line workers many many are taking it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it. I\u2019m taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now, yeah. A couple weeks ago I started taking it. Because I think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories\u2026 I take a pill every day.\u201d Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Trump claims he is taking hydroxychloroquine. The president said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine. This is the dubious treatment for coronavirus that Trump had fiercely touted in the past but thatwas found to have a very mixed effect on patients. The US Food and Drug Administration cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Some areas of New York City have seen death rates nearly 15 times higher than others, according to data released by New York City\u2019s health department, showing the disproportionate toll taken on poorer communities.For the first time, the data shows a breakdown on the number of deaths in each of the city\u2019s more than 60 ZIP codes, Reuters has reported. The highest death rate was seen on the edge of Brooklyn in a neighbourhood dominated by a large subsidised-housing development called Starrett City. Qatar will close all shops and halt all commercial activities, from 19 to 30 May, state news agency QNA has reported, citing a decision by Qatar\u2019s cabinet. The closure excludes pharmacies, food supply stores and food deliveries. Italy registers 99 more deaths on Monday, the lowest daily rate since early March, and 451 new infections, down by more than 200 since Sunday. There is also a significant fall in new infections in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, from 326 on Sunday to 175 on Monday. Bars, restaurants, shops, hairdressers, museums, libraries and churches reopened on Monday as Italy continues its gradual move out of lockdown. A total of 14,790 people died in April in Belgium \u2013 the worst toll since the country was under Nazi occupation in the 1940s, according to a study. The total is substantially higher than the normal April death toll, which is usually fewer than 9,000 people, researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) find. UK confirms 160 more deaths. The country\u2019s department of health and Social care releases its latest daily figures, which show a further 160 deaths, taking the total to 34,796. Quarantine for UK arrivals expected to cover air, rail, car and sea.Enforced quarantine measures at the UK border expected to be unveiled this week are to cover arrivals by sea, car and international rail, as well as air, the Guardian understands. Macron and Merkel present joint EU recovery plan. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have presented a joint plan to spur EU recovery after weeks of debate over how to deploy billions of euros needed to quickly end a painful recession. The full text of the plan is here. EU may give green light to sale of possible Covid-19 treatment.The European Union may give an initial approval for sale of the drug remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment, the head of its medicines agency says, fast-tracking the drug to market amid tight global competition for resources. UN chief calls for \u201cend to hubris\u201d. The pandemic should serve as a wake-up call to a world that must be more united, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, says. Spain reports lowest death toll for two months. Monday\u2019s overnight death toll in Spain is 59, the lowest figure in two months, the country\u2019s government says. The cumulative death toll rises to 27,709, while the number of confirmed cases increases to 231,606 from 231,350 the previous day, according to health ministry figures. Brian Cox says politicisation risks undermining public trust in science. UK government ministers may be undermining public trust in science in the way they talk about it when defending their decisions, a leading scientist and broadcaster warns. Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica reopens. Visitors are allowed to return to Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican after more than two months of lockdown. A handful of visitors queue up, observing social distancing rules and under the watch of police officers wearing face masks, before having their temperatures taken to enter the church. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan with any questions, comments, tips or news from where you live.

The music monthly Q is one of 10 magazines that could disappear from newsagents\u2019 shelves as one of the UK\u2019s biggest publishers considers the future of print titles as the coronavirus crisis hastens the shift of readers and advertisers online. The German-owned Bauer Media, which owns magazines in the UK including Grazia and Empire as well as the Kiss, Magic and Absolute radio networks, said that many already struggling magazines will not be sustainable after the pandemic passes. The publisher said that following a review of its portfolio it is considering closing, selling, merging or moving to digital-only format Q, Simply You, Your Horse, Planet Rock, Sea Angler, Mother &amp; Baby, Golf World, Practical Photography, Car Mechanics and Modern Classics. Chris Duncan, the chief executive of UK publishing at Bauer, said: The pandemic and lockdown has further accelerated the trends already affecting the publishing industry. Bauer publishes nearly 100 magazines in the UK, and some titles that were already challenged, unfortunately, are not expected to be sustainable after the crisis. We must protect the long-term health of our business and ability to invest in future growth by re-shaping our portfolio. Police and protesters have clashed in Santiago amid a city-wide lockdown as local officials warned that food shortages have hit one of the Chilean capital\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods. Reuters reports that a group of protesters threw rocks and burned piles of wood along a street in the destitute neighbourhood on Santiago\u2019s southern fringe. Images on social media and local television showed police spraying tear gas and water cannons to disperse the growing crowd. The municipality said families were going hungry in the poorest sectors of El Bosque, a neighborhood where many work informally, or not at all. The city district has been under quarantine since mid-April, city officials said. Qatar will close all shops and halt all commercial activities, from 19 to 30 May, state news agency QNA has reported, citing a decision by Qatar\u2019s cabinet. The closure excludes pharmacies, food supply stores and food deliveries. If Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, he is going against the advice of his own administration. The FDA has warned against using hydroxychloroquine or a related compound, chloroquine, for treating or preventing Covid-19 without medical supervision in a hospital, or as part of a clinical trial. In late April, the FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said: While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered. The FDA will continue to monitor and investigate these potential risks and will communicate publicly when more information is available. Here\u2019s the clip of Trump saying he\u2019s been taking hydoxychoroquine: \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it,\u201d Trump said of the antimalarial drug. So far, the scientific evidence that the drug works as a treatment has been thin. It has not been widely investigated as a prophylactic measure. Extraordinary news emerging from the White House \u2013 the president has mentioned that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine. This is the dubious treatment for coronavirus that Trump had fiercely touted in the past but that was found to have a very mixed effect on patients. No studies so far have shown that it had a good effect on patients and regulators have advised it not be taken outside of a hospital or clinical trial setting. Trump said earlier at the White House that he was taking it, it is understood as a prophylactic. The US Food and Drug Administration cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Before recent results from larger trials showed the anti-viral medicine was not good for Covid and could be harmful, Trump was promoting it, including at White House briefings, as a possible miracle cure. Local authorities across Mexico have resisted President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s call to lift emergency measures in municipalities without confirmed cases, warning that the pandemic is far from over. Mexico has registered nearly 50,000 cases and more than 5,000 deaths, and its testing rate ranks among the lowest in Latin America, with just 0.4 tests per 1,000 people. But, on Monday, approximately 300 municipalities throughout the country \u2013 called \u201cmunicipalities of hope\u201d \u2013 were given the green light to restart economic activities and lift sheltering-in-place recommendations. Similar measures are scheduled to start 1 June in the rest of the country, while classes will resume the same day. L\u00f3pez Obrador said: We need to maintain discipline, not relax this discipline since we\u2019re almost there. I have a lot of faith and many expectations that we\u2019re going to finish taming this pandemic. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is planning a nationwide study of up to 325,000 people to track the virus\u2019 spread into next year and beyond, Reuters reports. Citing the director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute, Dr Michael Busch, the news agency says the study is expected to launch in June or July and will test samples from blood donors in 25 metropolitan areas for antibodies. Busch is leading a preliminary version of the study \u2013 funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \u2013 that is testing the first 36,000 samples. The CDC-funded portion, to be formally announced this week, will expand the scope and time frame, taking samples over 18 months to see how antibodies evolve over time, said the CDC\u2019s spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. She said researchers aim to publish results on a rolling basis. The president of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde has also welcomed the proposed \u20ac500bn recovery fund, saying it would bring much-needed relief to the worst-hit EU countries. \u201cThe Franco-German proposals are ambitious, targeted and welcome,\u201d Lagarde said in a joint interview with four European newspapers, after announcement of the plan sent the euro higher and reduced Italian bond yields. The proposals \u201copen the way for long-term borrowing by the European Commission and above all allow significant direct budgetary aid to the member states worst affected by the crisis\u201d, Lagarde told the newspapers Les Echos, Handelsblatt, Corriere della Sera and El Mundo. Sudan has extended a lockdown of the state of Khartoum by an additional two weeks from Tuesday, the state news agency has reported. The country had registered 2,591 cases and 105 deaths as of Saturday. South Sudan\u2019s vice-president Riek Machar and his wife Angelina Teny have tested positive, his office has said. It also said that \u201ca number of his office staff and bodyguards\u201d had also tested positive. France\u2019s highest administrative court has ruled that the government must lift a blanket ban on meetings at places of worship imposed as part of measures to combat the epidemic, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. After receiving complaints from several individuals and associations, the Council of State said that such a ban on freedom of worship caused \u201ca damage that is serious and manifestly illegal\u201d. It told the government to lift the ban within the next eight days. The latest government decree bans all gatherings in places of worship, even after the lockdown was eased from 11 May. Funerals are excepted and are limited to 20 people. But the Council of State ruled this ban was \u201cdisproportionate in nature.\u201d It remains to be seen what move the government will take to respect the decision while retaining a safe environment in churches, mosques and other places of worship. Bruno Retailleau, who leads the right-wing Republicans in the French upper house, the S\u00e9nat, said the decision was \u201cgood news for religious freedom, which is a fundamental right\u201d. In the UK, the opposition Labour party has expressed concern at lockdown measures being eased at the start of June after ministers conceded that a key part of the test-and-trace regime to contain new outbreaks, a phone app, will not be ready for weeks. The health secretary Matt Hancock announced that anyone over the age of five with symptoms would be eligible for a test. The news is expected to lead to a surge in people visiting the gov.uk website to book home test kits or drive-through appointments. Until now, eligibility was limited to certain groups including key workers, those aged over 65 years, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups. But there are fresh worries about the NHS phone app, which is designed to be downloaded by millions to curb the spread of Covid-19, as the organisation representing local public health leaders said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the level of government engagement on the issue. The Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg and her colleagues have filmed a physically distanced dance for the country\u2019s Constitution Day. It was aired on 17 May on the government-owned broadcaster NRK. Mass gatherings and parades are not permitted at least until mid-June to try and slow the spread of the virus. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has welcomed the \u20ac500bn (\u00a3447bn) recovery fund proposed by France and Germany to help regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson will be taking you through the next few hours of this blog. Thanks for your company, and all your emails and tweets, so far today. The United Arab Emirates will extend a nightly curfew by two hours, starting this week, after reporting an increase in the number of coronavirus cases. The curfew, which currently runs from 10pm to 6am, will start at 8pm as of Wednesday until further notice, Saif Al Dhaheri, spokesman for the national emergency crisis and disaster management authority, told a press conference. On Monday the UAE reported 832 new infections and four deaths from Covid-19, taking its count to 24,190 cases with 224 deaths. French health authorities reported 131 new coronavirus deaths on Monday, constituting a slowing increase of 0.5% and bringing the total to 28,239. The country\u2019s death toll remains the fourth-highest in the world behind the US, the UK and Italy. The ministry said the number of people in intensive care with Covid-19 fell by 4.3% to 1,998, below the 2,000 threshold for the first time since 22 March. On a lighter note, here is a scene from a barber\u2019s in Rome today. I can\u2019t be the only person who could desperately do with a similar service sooner rather than later. The Czech Republic is planning to ease travel between the central European country and other countries deemed safe from risks of coronavirus from 8 June, its health minister Adam Vojtech has announced. It was among the first countries in Europe to ban entry by foreigners and even banned most Czechs from travelling abroad to keep the spread of the infection under control in March. Some restrictions have been eased but the country is still not open for foreign tourism and Czechs are required to present a negative coronavirus test upon return or go into quarantine. Discussions have been underway to open borders with neighbours such as Austria and Slovakia, which have also taken steps to relax their border regimes, Reuters reports. Vojtech said he had proposed that, as of 8 June, travel to and from a list of risky countries \u2013 to be determined but currently likely to include Spain, Italy or France \u2013 would be subject to the current requirements, while others deemed safe \u2013 such as Austria, Slovakia or Croatia \u2013 would be exempt. The list of risky countries would be updated continuously, he added. The prime minister, Andrej Babis, said last week that borders with Slovakia and Austria could be fully opened from 8 June. Separately, the foreign minister Tomas Petricek said today that borders with all neighbouring states \u2013 Poland, Germany, Austria and Slovakia \u2013 could be open by mid-June, the news agency CTK reported. The foreign ministry also said Czech tourists may be allowed to travel to Greece from July. Here are synopses of the biggest stories from the last few hours: Italy registers 99 more deaths on Monday, the lowest daily rate since early March, and 451 new infections, down by more than 200 since Sunday. There is also a significant fall in new infections in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, from 326 on Sunday to 175 on Monday.

The German government has released the full text of the French-German Initiative for the European Recovery from the Coronavirus Crisis. This comes after today\u2019s meeting between Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, which we trailed earlier in the blog. Here is the text, written in English and covering four key points. The Guardian has seen a protocol prepared by Spain\u2019s top football division, La Liga, ahead of a planned return to action. It would be following in the footsteps of Germany\u2019s Bundesliga. Sid Lowe has the story: The 23-time Olympic swimming champion, Michael Phelps, has said the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll on his mental health. [Phelps] has spoken in the past about his struggles with depression and said that being under lockdown during the pandemic has been a struggle. \u201cThe pandemic has been a challenge I never expected,\u201d he told ESPN in an article published on Monday. \u201cAll the uncertainty. Being cooped up in a house. And the questions. So many questions. When is it going to end? What will life look like when this is over? Am I doing everything I can to be safe? Is my family safe? It drives me insane. I\u2019m used to traveling, competing, meeting people. This is just craziness. My emotions are all over the place. I\u2019m always on edge. I\u2019m always defensive.\u201d Here is our full story: The president of Turkey, Tayyip Erdogan, has said a four-day lockdown starting on 23 May will be imposed nationwide as part of efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus during the Eid al-Fitr religious holiday. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said schools would not reopen in this academic year and education would continue in person in September with the new academic year. Erdogan said mosques would begin allowing mass prayers for midday and afternoon prayers as of 29 May, Reuters reports. He said the house arrest period for prisoners who were released as part of coronavirus measures had been extended for two months Coronavirus cases in Belgium have continued to fall amid a simmering political row over nurses\u2019 pay and conditions, reports Jennifer Rankin. Nurses protesting over wages, staff numbers and a government decree that makes it possible for them to be forced to come to work turned away from the official motorcade when prime minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s visited the Saint Pierre hospital in Brussels on Saturday. \u201cPolitics constantly turns its back on our appeals for help,\u201d one anonymous nurse told the Francophone state broadcaster RTBF. \u201cThe teams are understaffed and the burnout rates show it. We are asking for our work to be valued and for more staff on our teams.\u201d The piece in full: Nigeria\u2019s government has extended a coronavirus lockdown on the northern region of Kano after it became a hotspot for new infections. The head of the country\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, Boss Mustapha, said the lockdown on the economic hub \u2013 which includes Nigeria\u2019s second biggest city \u2013 would be prolonged for two weeks. The authorities will also start to impose \u201cprecision\u201d lockdowns in any other areas that report a \u201crapidly increasing number of cases, when the need arises\u201d, he said. The outbreak in Kano has become a major cause of concern after medics and residents last month began reporting a spike in deaths, AFP reports. Regional officials at first put the \u201cunexplained\u201d fatalities down to other ailments, but government investigators later said coronavirus was suspected in most cases. Neighbouring states to Kano have also begun reporting suspicious surges in death tolls that authorities are scrambling to investigate. Nigeria has confirmed 5,959 infections and 182 deaths from Covid-19 across the country. Kano is the second hardest-hit region with 825 confirmed cases and 36 fatalities. The region has already been under lockdown for a month but enforcement has been lax and measures have been eased sporadically for people to buy food during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Here is another dispatch from our Rome correspondent, Angela Giuffrida. Some Italians are savouring the deep joy of being able to eat out once again. \u201cI can taste the fullness of the flavour much more,\u201d said Sandro Urbani as he drank a glass of white Sangiovanni wine outside Caff\u00e8 Barrique in the Umbrian town of Orvieto. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I\u2019ve been on a diet over the past few months and all of a sudden I can eat a slice of salami.\u201d Angela\u2019s full piece can be found here: The reopening of schools in 22 European countries has not led to any significant increase in coronavirus infections among children, parents or staff, a videoconference meeting of education ministers from around the EU has heard. The assertion comes on the same day that France\u2019s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, revealed that 70 cases of Covid-19 had been diagnosed since 40,000 primary and nursery schools reopened last week. Daniel Boffey and Kim Willsher have more: Italy registered 99 new coronavirus deaths on Monday, the lowest daily rate since early March, and 451 new infections, down by over 200 since Sunday. There was also a significant fall in new infections in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, from 326 on Sunday to 175 on Monday. Bars, restaurants, shops, hairdressers, museums, libraries and churches reopened on Monday as Italy continues its gradual move out of lockdown. However, the prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned that citizens must not drop their guard and must still respect social distancing rules and use face masks. \u201cToday the country is getting moving again but it is still a long road,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the newspaper, Leggo. The government now has a major challenge reviving the economy, which this year is expected to enter the deepest recession since the Second World War. Conte added that his government is \u201cnot deaf to the many difficulties that citizens are facing\u201d and that it \u201cintends to face them one by one\u201d. Italy has 225,886 confirmed cases of Covid-19 to date, including 32,007 deaths and 127,326 survivors. The UK\u2019s Department for Health and Social Care has released its latest daily figures for coronavirus deaths. A further 160 deaths have been recorded, taking the total to 34,796. For more on this, please join our UK coronavirus live blog: Uber has announced it will cut around 3,000 jobs, in addition to the 3,700 it announced earlier this month, as coronavirus-led restrictions sap demand for ride-hailing services. The company\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, explained the cuts in an email to employees on Monday. The business has suffered a near-total collapse as large parts of the US and the rest of the world shut to combat the spread of the virus. Nearly two-thirds of Uber\u2019s revenue is generated in the US and Canada, where stay-at-home orders were issued in the middle of March. The company said trip requests had plummeted 80% globally in April, but were slowly recovering. Khosrowshahi also said the company would wind down its office in Singapore over the next 12 months, and move to a new \u201chub\u201d in the Asia-Pacific region. Uber would also close down about 45 of its offices, including the office at Pier 70 in San Francisco. The company, which is also in talks with GrubHub Inc to reinforce its food delivery business, said it plans to reduce investments in several non-core projects. Sweden, whose softer approach to the coronavirus pandemic has garnered worldwide attention, recorded its deadliest month in almost three decades in April, according to statistics released today. Sweden has stopped short of introducing the restrictive lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe, instead opting for an approach based on the \u201cprinciple of responsibility\u201d. It has kept schools open for children under the age of 16, along with cafes, bars, restaurants and businesses, and urged people to respect social distancing guidelines. A total of 10,458 deaths were recorded in the country of 10.3 million inhabitants in April, Statistics Sweden said. \u201cWe have to go back to December 1993 to find more dead during a single month,\u201d Tomas Johansson, population statistician at Statistics Sweden, said in a statement. In total, 97,008 deaths were recorded in Sweden during the whole of 1993, which in turn was the deadliest year since 1918, when the Spanish flu pandemic ravaged the country. Johansson told AFP there was no official breakdown explaining the high death toll in December 1993 but said there was a flu epidemic at the time. According to preliminary data, the number of deaths has been on the decline since the end of April, including in Stockholm \u2013 the epicentre of the Swedish epidemic \u2013 where the highest number of deaths were recorded in early April. The Swedish approach to coronavirus has come under criticism both at home and abroad, particularly as the number of deaths has far exceeded those in neighbouring Nordic countries, which have all imposed more restrictive containment measures. On Monday, Sweden reported a total of 30,377 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 3,698 deaths. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from coronavirus was 59 on Monday, the lowest figure in two months, the government said. The cumulative death toll rose to 27,709, while the number of confirmed cases rose to 231,606 from 231,350 the previous day, according to health ministry figures. Figures include data for more than 24 hours as the ministry changed its methods on Monday, Reuters reports. It was the second day in a row that the number of deaths was under 100. Play resumed in Germany\u2019s top football division, the Bundesliga, during the weekend in a development that made headlines far beyond the world of sport. Andy Brassell has looked at how it all went. The global reaction to the Bundesliga\u2019s return was generally positive, with Obrigado, Bundesliga from Portugal\u2019s A Bola typical of the continent-wide relief that the raising of the curtain had passed relatively setback-free, though Spain\u2019s El Mundo Deportivo commented that it \u201cwould have been good if a minute\u2019s silence had been observed for the victims of coronavirus\u201d. The aspect not just of being entertained \u2013 and the general standard of play was way better than might have been expected after 66 days of unscheduled stoppage \u2013 but of viewing possible best practice is clear. Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s sporting director Fredi Bobic, who called the restart \u201ca historic day for the Bundesliga\u201d, also told Sky that the league could be a litmus test for all sports. \u201cWe also received a tremendous number of calls from American clubs for information,\u201d said the former Bolton striker. \u201cNot only from football clubs but also baseball, basketball and ice hockey. They all want to know how we\u2019re doing it and how we organised it.\u201d Here is Andy\u2019s piece in full: I\u2019m back with you now for the next three hours or so of global coronavirus news and updates. Thanks a lot for all your valued communications so far today \u2013 please email any tips, observations, comments or feedback to nick.ames@theguardian.com or direct message me @NickAmes82. A French court has ruled that the Paris police can no longer use drones to track people not respecting social-distancing rules. The ruling is a victory for two rights groups who claimed the use of drones to carry out surveillance of the population was a threat to individual privacy. Patrick Spinosi, lawyer for the Human Rights League in France said there was no reason the decision could not be \u201capplied to the whole of France\u201d. \u201cIt is applicable from today and so from now, no drones can be used. It\u2019s a great victory,\u201d Spinosi told AFP. According to a report by the upper house of parliament, the S\u00e9nat, French police carried out 251 drone surveillance flights between 24 March and 24 April, during the strict lockdown. Two French plaintiffs, the Human Rights League and the digital advocacy group Quadrature du Net, filed a case against the Paris drone flights with the State Council. The interior ministry and police insisted they were not trying to identify anyone, but to watch for illegal gatherings so they would know where to send officers to break them up. The State Council said the cameras in the drones could identify individual people and \u201cthere are risks they could be used in contravention of personal data protection rules\u201d. The court said in future the government and police would need a specific decree setting out conditions for using drones and also obtain the approval of the national data privacy authority CNIL. If the authorities wish to continue using drones, they have been ordered to fit them with technology that would prevent the cameras from identifying those being filmed. The French authorities often use drones in normal times to keep an eye on demonstrations. During the lockdown drones were used in the French capital and elsewhere, notably on the French Riviera, to send messages warning people they were breaking the rules during the eight week lockdown that ended on 11 May. Qatar Airways cabin crew will begin wearing protective suits while passengers will have to wear face masks on board, the airline has said. Cabin crew have already been wearing face masks and gloves but will also wear suits over their uniforms, while face masks will be mandatory for passengers from May 25. In a statement, the state-owned airline said interactions between employees and passengers will also be reduced. \u201cWe have introduced these additional safety measures onboard our flights to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of our passengers and cabin crew, and to limit the spread of coronavirus,\u201d chief executive Akbar al-Baker said. Within Qatar, anyone not wearing a face mask can be fined 200,000 riyals ($50,000) and could face a prison sentence of up to three years. Earlier this month, the International Air Transport Association, the body representing global airlines, came out in favour of passengers wearing masks onboard. On short and medium-haul flights, different sets of cabin crew will operate the outbound and inbound flights. The airline is laying off 20% of its workforce, including cabin crew. It has been one of the few airlines to continue regular flights during global coronavirus lockdowns, maintaining services to around 30 destinations. It is scheduled to resume flights to destinations in had suspended due to the pandemic by June. The global economy will take much longer to recover from the coronavirus pandemic than initially expected, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said it was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, with only a partial recovery expected next year. Speaking to news organisation Reuters, Georgieva said data from around the world was worse than expected. \u201cObviously that means it will take us much longer to have a full recovery from this crisis,\u201d she said, without giving a specific target date for a rebound.

Under the new measures, buses, taxis and three-wheeled rickshaws will return to the streets with restrictions. Buses in the capital cannot carry more than 20 passengers, each of whom will be screened before boarding, said Delhi\u2019s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday. \u201cCorona will stay, and we will also survive,\u201d Kejriwal said, outlining the new guidelines for the city of 20 million people that has one of highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the country. The southern state of Karnataka also lifted some restrictions on the movement of trains, taxis and buses within the state. Transportation from outside the state will remain suspended except for essential services. I\u2019m taking a break for the next hour, so will leave you in the capable hands of my colleague Amy Walker. Slovakia is next on the list of European countries attempting a slow return to something resembling normal life. It will reopen shopping malls, theatres and cinemas from Wednesday, under strict hygienic conditions, the prime minister, Igor Matovi\u010d, has confirmed. The central European country, which has had far fewer Covid-19 cases than most western European nations, will also reopen kindergartens and the first five grades of elementary schools from 1 June, Matovi\u010d told a press conference. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is backing calls for an independent review of the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, but only after the virus is under control. Here is a video report: Omid Djalili, Whoopi Goldberg and Sanjeev Bhaskar have joined forces to appeal for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) participants to take part in Covid-19 research to help establish why people from BAME populations are at greater risk from coronavirus. People from all minority ethnic groups are at greater risk of getting severe illness with Covid-19 compared with the white population in the UK \u2013 with recent studies saying they are twice as likely to die from the virus as white people. The actor-comedians Djalili and Bhaskar, and the Oscar-winning Goldberg, urged BAME people to join coronavirus research studies in a bid to help find the reasons behind the link. Speaking on a video released to support recruitment for the research \u2013 which will be conducted by the Centre for BME Health, supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) \u2013 Djalili said: \u201cAs you know we are in the middle of a devastating pandemic and it seems people from these populaces are affected disproportionality and we want to find out why, now. \u201cThere are a lot of tests and trials going on but very few people from these communities are putting themselves forward for research. We need to get on with this to help people not just here, but globally, so if you know anyone from these backgrounds, relatives or friends, please pass on this message. The sooner we do it the more lives we can save. Now. Thank you.\u201d To take part in the research, or to view more information, visit this section of the NIHR\u2019s website. Denmark is one of Europe\u2019s greatest success stories when it comes to dealing with Covid-19. It has just announced that all adults will be allowed to book a Coronavirus test this week. The country began easing its lockdown four weeks ago with no obvious adverse effects, while cafes and restaurants are now open. Below are a couple of extracts from a Reuters report into how it has coped. \u201cThe quick shutdown and the fact that Danes actually listened to messages from authorities about good hygiene and social distancing are the main reasons we\u2019ve come this far,\u201d said Hans Jorn Kolmos, a professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark. Contrary to the French and Italians, Danes are less likely to hug and kiss as a form of greeting, which has also been a factor in limiting the spread, Kolmos said. Coronavirus-related deaths and the \u2018R\u2019 reproduction rate \u2013 a measure of transmission \u2013 are falling. Health authorities on Friday reported no deaths for the first time since 13 March. Health experts now say Denmark is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to be hit by a second wave of the Covid-19 infection that has so far killed 548 people in the country. When the Copenhagen caf\u00e9 Coffee Collective opened its doors to seated customers on Monday, it was quieter than usual. Most enjoyed their coffee alone at tables placed apart, while some sat outside at tables on the street. \u201cI think it was a good decision (to shut down early), because we can see now on the numbers that everything has worked better than in some neighbouring countries,\u201d said Ellen Vallentin Asmus, a graphic illustrator, enjoying a coffee at the cafe for the first time in two months. \u201cI think in Denmark there\u2019s a strong culture of following the rules and listening to the government, and I think that has helped with everyone taking the restrictions and social distancing seriously,\u201d said Sydney-Johanna Stevns, a strategist at a research and design lab in Copenhagen. \u201cMentally it\u2019s nice to be out and have something of a normal life again.\u201d If you are just joining today\u2019s global coronavirus blog, do remember that we are always pleased to hear from you.

Germany is hoping to replace a travel warning that is in place for all touristic trips abroad until 15 June with softer guidelines, the country\u2019s foreign minister Heiko Maas has said. He warned, however, that there would be no quick return to holidays as usual. \u201c15 June is not the starting date for taking holidays \u2013 15 June 15 is the date when we need to make a decision on whether we will lift the global travel warning and we\u2019re working on replacing this travel warning with travel guidelines,\u201d Maas said. Reuters reports that Maas also said he wanted summer holidays to be possible, but stressed that this needed to be done in a responsible way and added that it was too early to say in which countries Germans were most likely to be able to take holidays. Additionally, he said that if there were a second wave of coronavirus infections, new restrictions would need to be introduced. As you have probably read, Italy is cautiously getting back up and running. Here is how things look aboard a socially-distanced gondola in Venice. Hungary and Slovenia have agreed on a road map towards a gradual reopening of their border by 1 June, the Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on his Facebook page today. Hungary has started lifting coronavirus restrictions in Budapest, though residents returning to shops or travelling on public transport will have to wear face masks. \u201cRestarting our economies is not possible without restarting international cooperation,\u201d Szijjarto wrote, adding that annual trade between the two European Union member states was worth more than \u20ac2.5bn. \u201cTherefore, without jeopardising the protection of health, which is a priority, an easing of restrictive measures imposed at the borders is needed.\u201d A phased reopening is the government\u2019s strategy to head off deeper and more lasting harm to the economy, which is expected to shrink by about 4% this year, according to a Reuters survey. As of Monday, Hungary had reported 3,535 cases of coronavirus, 462 deaths and 1,400 recoveries. Slovenia had reported 1,466 cases and 104 deaths. Szijjarto said a lockdown in the two countries had helped prevent the large-scale spread of the coronavirus, allowing for a gradual restarting of economic activity. \u201cTaking all this into account, we have started working on a gradual phase-out of measures restricting border crossings, setting 1 June as a target date,\u201d Szijjarto wrote. The situation regarding travel restrictions around Europe is, to put it mildly, pretty complex. It\u2019s a constantly-shifting state of affairs, with controls easing in some places and being stepped up in others. This guide by Antonia Wilson provides a country-by-country look at where things currently stand. It\u2019s a useful one to bookmark, as it is being updated whenever things change. More news from the World Heath Organization\u2019s assembly, where its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he will initiate an independent evaluation of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic at the \u201cearliest appropriate moment\u201d. He also vowed transparency and accountability on the WHO\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe all have lessons to learn from the pandemic. Every country and every organisation must examine its response and learn from its experience. WHO is committed to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement,\u201d he said. He thanked early high-level speakers for their \u201cstrong support for WHO at this critical time\u201d and said the review must encompass responsibility of \u201call actors in good faith\u201d. \u201cThe risk remains high and we have a long road to travel,\u201d Tedros added. Preliminary serological tests in some countries showed that at most 20% of populations had contracted the disease and \u201cin most places less than 10%\u201d, he said. France\u2019s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told parents it was more of a risk keeping their children at home than sending them to school now the strict lockdown has ended, reports Kim Willsher in Paris. \u201cThere are always worries and questions, but even so we should not push school to one side in this current difficult period, because there will be terrible damage if we lose a generation of children who have been stopped from going to school for several months,\u201d Blanquer told journalists. \u201cIt\u2019s important to underline today\u2019s good news \u2026 the return to school is happening progressively, and not everyone is going back at the same time, but it\u2019s a start and an important start.\u201d Here is Kim\u2019s piece in full: Our US live blog is now up and running alongside this and our UK coronavirus blog. It is being steered by Martin Pengelly, and you can join it here: The coronavirus pandemic should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the world which must be more united in responding to the crisis, the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has said. Guterres said Covid-19 was the \u201cgreatest challenge of our age\u201d and had demonstrated the world\u2019s fragility, as nations went their own way in tackling the pandemic, Reuters reports. He added that the crisis was an opportunity to rebuild a better world, bu questioned whether countries were up to it. Despite great scientific and technological advances in recent decades, a virus had \u201cbrought us to our knees\u201d, the United Nations chief said at the start of this week\u2019s virtual meeting of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) World Health Assembly. He said the pandemic had exposed the frailties not just in health systems but in international institutions, tackling the climate crisis, cyber-security and nuclear disarmament. \u201cCovid-19 must be a wake-up call. It is time for an end to the hubris,\u201d Guterres said, slamming countries for their disjointed approach. \u201cWe have seen some solidarity, but very little unity in our response to Covid-19. Different countries have followed different, sometimes contradictory strategies and we are all paying a heavy price. \u201cMany countries have ignored the recommendations of the World Health Organization. As a result, the virus has spread across the world.\u201d He said Covid-19 was now spreading in the southern hemisphere, where its impact might be \u201ceven more devastating\u201d. Guterres reiterated his call for a WHO-led international response, expanded mental health services and policies to address the social and economic problems caused by the crisis. \u201cUnless we control the spread of the virus, the economy will never recover,\u201d he said. The former Portuguese prime minister and former head of the UN refugee agency said the recovery from the crisis must lead to more equal and sustainable economies. It is \u201can opportunity to rebuild differently and better\u201d, he said, referring to the climate crisis and flawed social protection systems. \u201cInstead of going back to systems that were unsustainable, we need to make a leap into a future of clean energy, inclusivity and equality, and stronger safety nets, including universal health coverage.\u201d But he asked: \u201cWe can do it, but will we? Either we get through this pandemic together, or we fail.\u201d More than 100 countries are now backing calls for a global investigation into the origins and spread of Covid-19. Ahead of a virtual meeting of the World Health Organization Assembly, which will be devoted to Covid-19, several dozen countries have called for an inquiry \u201cto identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population\u201d. The draft text does not mention China, whose government has previously declared its opposition to any international inquiry. The text also calls for all countries to have \u201cunhindered timely access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics, medicines and vaccines, and essential health technologies\u201d targeted at Covid-19. It additionally calls for action to tackle disinformation and misinformation that undermine the public health response. \u201cThe European Union and its member states have spearheaded a draft resolution that will be presented at the WHO assembly tomorrow [Tuesday],\u201d a European commission spokesperson said, adding that 110 countries were now co-sponsoring the text. The text was drawn up with the support of several dozen countries, including Australia, Brazil, Japan, India, Russia, Turkey and the UK. Earlier this month the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said there was a need \u201cto look independently at what happened, standing aside from the battlefield between China and the United States, who blame each other for the events in a bidding war that has only exacerbated their rivalry\u201d. The European Union may give an initial green light in the coming days for sale of the drug remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment, the head of its medicines agency has said on Monday, fast-tracking the drug to market amid tight global competition for resources. The US, which has angered the EU with aggressive tactics in a procurement race during the global pandemic, has yet to issue a similar approval for the drug, made by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead. Demand for remdesivir has been growing as there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cIt might be that a conditional market(ing) authorisation can be issued in the coming days,\u201d the head of the European Union\u2019s medicines agency, Guido Rasi, told a hearing in the EU Parliament in Brussels. An EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a drug to be sold for a year in the 27-nation bloc before all necessary data are available on its efficacy and side effects, Reuters reports. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has already recommended the compassionate use of remdesivir, which allows a drug to be administered to patients even before its sale has been authorised. EMA\u2019s recommendation on compassionate use matched an emergency authorisation granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier in May, after Gilead provided data showing the drug had helped Covid-19 patients. But the EU is now moving rapidly to the next step in the authorisation procedure. Russia\u2019s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said that the country\u2019s coronavirus epidemic has \u201cpositive dynamics,\u201d as dozens of regions begin lifting quarantine restrictions and allowing businesses to reopen. \u201cThe coronavirus situation in our country remains complicated, but we can still say that we have managed to put a stop to growth in new cases,\u201d Mishustin claimed during an online conference on Monday, adding: \u201cCautiously speaking, we have positive dynamics.\u201d The deputy prime minister Tatyana Golikova said that the growth rate for the sickness was down 23.4% across Russia and 47.5% in Moscow. On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks. But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease. The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus. He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had raised concerns across Russia, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus. Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease. Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death. Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease. In Russia, the April data will only be made available in late May, and the May data is likely to come out in late June. The French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will present a joint plan to spur EU recovery from the coronavirus crisis, after weeks of debate over how to deploy billions of euros needed to quickly end a painful recession. Europe is just beginning to emerge from the lockdowns to halt the outbreak, which has taken a huge bite out of national economies and raised the prospects of damaging recessions that could last for months. But despite widespread recognition that the hardest-hit countries will be unable to repair the economic damage on their own, divisions among EU members on how to craft an overall response have hampered comprehensive action so far. The bloc has pledged to muster \u20ac500bn in emergency funding, and the European commission is hoping to propose a budget that could be used to unleash stimulus worth one trillion euros. Macron and Merkel aim to define \u201ca French-German initiative to respond to the Covid-19 crisis at the European level, in the areas of health, the economic recovery, the environmental and digital transition, and industrial sovereignty\u201d, the French presidency said. They will meet via video conference, beginning at 3.30pm (2.30pm BST), followed by a joint declaration and press conference at around 5pm, AFP reports. A big day in Greece, where over 200 of its prime archaeological sites have been re-opened almost two months to the day after being closed as part of containment measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The reopening of sites in Athens\u2019 historic centre \u2013 capped this morning by the country\u2019s head of state visiting the Acropolis \u2013 has sparked a frenzy of activity to properly prepare the antiquities for the post-lockdown age. All personnel have to wear face masks and, on dictate of social distancing, stickers have been placed outside entry points to prevent crowd buildups outside ticket booths. Individual sites, according to size, will have caps on the number of visitors they can accept. In sites beneath the fifth century BC Acropolis, including Hadrian\u2019s Library, workers could be seen earlier today in protective suits with weed cutters as they cleaned up the areas in anticipation of the tourist season beginning. The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said he hopes to reopen the country to foreign tourists by 1 July after managing to keep confirmed cases of Covid-19 and casualties low after early enforcement of measures in a rare success story for Europe. Enforced quarantine measures at the UK border expected to be unveiled this week are to cover arrivals by sea, car and international rail, as well as air, the Guardian understands. Jamie Grierson, our home affairs correspondent, reports. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, in his address to the nation on 10 May announcing the gradual easing of lockdown measures, served notice that quarantine would be imposed on air passengers arriving in the country. But the plans, which are still being drawn up and are expected to be announced within days, are set to extend to all arrivals into the UK with a number of exemptions, reportedly including hauliers and Covid-19 research scientists. Ministers have suggested travellers will be asked to quarantine for 14 days when they enter the UK, either in accommodation of their choice or provided by the government if there are no other options. An implementation date has not yet been announced. Here is Jamie\u2019s piece in full: Anti-lockdown protests in the US may have had the effect of spreading Covid-19 to far-away areas, cellphone location data provided to the Guardian suggests. There are fears the protests will play a role in spreading coronavirus to parts of the country that have, to date, experienced relatively few infections. Jason Wilson reports: Hello everyone \u2013 as Jessica says, I\u2019ll be taking you through the next few hours of global coronavirus news and updates. As always, your tips, feedback and observations are warmly welcomed. You can email me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or send a direct Twitter message @NickAmes82. That\u2019s all from me today, I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Nick Ames who\u2019ll be running the blog for the next few hours. Thanks for your emails, and of course thanks for following the blog. Southern European countries ease lockdowns. Italy is reopening bars, cafes, restaurants and hairdressers - with social distancing measures in place - for the first time since its lockdown began. Meanwhile in Spain, almost three quarters of the country progressed to the second phase of its lockdown de-escalation, allowing millions of people to meet up in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe and restaurant terraces. Global infections pass 4.7 million. There are 4,727,625 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,482 people have died over the course of the pandemic. The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,564 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,742 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Japan falls into recession. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. It reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. New virus cases in Russia under 9,000 for first time since 1 May. 8,926 new infections were recorded in the last 24 hours, as anti-virus restrictions ease and officials say the situation is stabilising. Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019. The BBC has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d. They could run out of space in two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday and joined some in a series of push-ups . Taiwan blocked from WHO meeting following Chinese pressure. Taiwan had been lobbying to take part in the World Health Assembly, which opens later on Monday, but did not get invited due to Chinese pressure, its foreign minister said, adding they had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. Thailand\u2019s economy contracts for first time since 2014. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered borders and devastated the tourism-reliant country, caused the economy to shrink for the first time in six years. Ryanair chief accuses UK of mismanaging coronavirus crisis. Michael O\u2019Leary described the UK\u2019s planned introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for travellers arriving from abroad as \u201cidiotic and unimplementable\u201d. Coronavirus brought Belgium its deadliest April since the second world war, according to a study, as the country begins slowly to lift lockdown measures. A total of 14,790 people died in Belgium last month as Covid-19 swept the country \u2013 substantially higher than the normal April total of deaths below 9,000, researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) found. Not since the Nazi occupation of the 1940s has Belgium had such a high mortality rate in April, the month when high winter death rates usually drop off with the onset of spring, the researchers found. \u201cMortality in Belgium is exceptionally high, reaching unprecedented levels, especially in the period from 1 to 12 April,\u201d the university said in a statement. There were 639 deaths on 10 April, \u201cmore than double the number that would have been expected for that day\u201d. It said: April 2020 was the deadliest April since the Second World War, both in absolute numbers and per capita. Belgium has been hit hard by the pandemic, suffering one of the world\u2019s highest per capita death tolls, though the virus appears to be easing and lockdown restrictions are starting to be lifted, AFP reports. The government has also been praised by the World Health Organization for keeping more accurate tolls than some of its neighbours, and the per capita rate may be higher because of this. Support for president Donald Trump in Pennsylvania has not wavered despite his coronavirus missteps, and could be key to him winning reelection, Guardian US national affairs correspondent, Tom McCarthy, reports. Few people understand the terrible cost of the coronavirus like Lee Snover, a Republican party chair in one of the key swing counties that could determine whether Donald Trump is reelected as president in November. Snover, who helped deliver an upset victory for Trump in 2016 in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, lost her father to the virus this spring. Her husband fell critically ill, too, spending 17 days in an intensive care unit before recovering. Her mother, a cancer survivor, was also in intensive care for eight days before emerging. \u201cIt spread through my entire family,\u201d Snover said. Trump stands accused of driving up the coronavirus death toll by downplaying the public health threat and urging the country to \u201creopen\u201d too quickly. But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family. \u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base. Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican has reopened to visitors after being closed for over two months under Italy\u2019s lockdown orders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. A handful of visitors queued up, observing social distancing rules, and were watched by police officers wearing face masks before having their temperatures taken to enter the church, which has been closed since 10 March. Italy was the first country to go into a full lockdown over two months ago, bringing the economy to its knees. The official death toll from the virus in the country now stands at around 32,000. The government started lifting restrictions on 4 May, and on Sunday joggers, walkers and cyclists were plentiful on the streets of Rome\u2019s historic centre. Restaurants, bars, cafes, shops and hairdressers, among other businesses, were all expected to reopen on Monday, with public masses also resuming. In the face of much opposition, including from Pope Francis, churches in Rome were shuttered at the beginning of the coronavirus emergency in early March. Most, however, opened shortly thereafter, with entry reserved for prayer only. \u201cI share the joy of those communities who can finally reunite as liturgical assemblies, a sign of hope for all society,\u201d Francis said on Sunday during his live-streamed prayer. Health ministers from around the world are expected to call for an independent evaluation of the World Health Organization\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic during a WHO meeting on Monday. Though they have opposing views of the WHO\u2019s performance, China and the United States are likely to join the consensus for an independent evaluation during a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, diplomats said. The call will be made in a resolution being presented by the European Union at the annual two-day meeting. The text also calls for timely and equitable access to safe and efficacious diagnostics, medicines and vaccines against the disease which has killed more than 300,000 people worldwide. A fragile consensus emerged after more than a week of intense negotiations on the EU text, which could still change, the diplomats said. A European diplomat told Reuters: It looks like the resolution will be adopted. Politically speaking, there is agreement for now on an evaluation of the whole system and an investigation into the origin (of the virus), but not immediately. It is important we were able to agree to the resolution, everybody. The EU resolution is supported by a host of countries including Australia - a vocal critic of WHO and of China - as well as Britain, Canada, India, Japan and Russia. Names on a draft resolution seen by Reuters showed support from 116 of the 194 countries in the WHO. The text calls on the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to initiate an \u201cimpartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d of the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19, including the effectiveness of existing mechanisms \u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\u201d. It backs continued work, including through scientific \u201cfield missions\u201d, to identify the zoonotic or animal source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier to reach humans. Almost three quarters of Spain progressed to the second phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation on Monday, allowing millions of people to meet up in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe and restaurant terraces. The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area remain in the preliminary phase of what the government has called \u201cthe transition towards the new normality\u201d. The health ministry said that despite \u201chuge progress\u201d in and around the capital, the region would not yet be able to join the 70% of the country in the next phase. People in Barcelona and parts of the Castilla y L\u00e9on region will also remain in phase-0 for the time being. However, as elsewhere in Spain, people in phase-0 areas can now shop in small stores without appointments, and places of worship have reopened at 30% capacity. Spain recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months on Sunday as the latest figures from the health ministry showed that 87 people had died from Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, down from 102 the day before. The country has confirmed 231,350 cases of the virus using PCR tests, and reported 27,650 deaths. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that his Socialist-led coalition would be seeking a final, month-long extension of the state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. The last lockdown extension was hard-won and was bitterly opposed by the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox party. Both parties have argued that the state of emergency is no longer necessary. It\u2019s week two of the end of lockdown and on Monday it was the turn of the two lower secondary school years to return to classes in France but only in \u201cgreen\u201d areas on the Covid-19 map, meaning departments where the virus has stopped circulating widely and hospital intensive care units are not under pressure. Classes in years 6\u00e8me (ages 11-12) and 5\u00e8me (12-13) opened on Monday with around 150,000 pupils expected back at one desk in two in 4,000 secondary schools. All staff and students must wear masks and schools are enforcing strict health measures, including distancing. The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has revealed that 70 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed since 40,000 primary and nursery schools reopened last week. Blanquer said the schools concerned had closed but insisted that not going to school was more of a risk than the virus. \u201cMany doctors say it is less dangerous to go to school than to stay at home. Our children mustn\u2019t be the victims of collateral damage of our health measures,\u201d Blanquer told RTL radio. The consequences could be psychological or nutritional and lead to students - particularly the estimated 500,000 youngsters in families with financial and social difficulties - dropping out of the system, he said. \u201cThis phenomenon is my main worry. We have to get society used to going back to school. It\u2019s not a secondary issue, it\u2019s fundamental,\u201d Blanquer said. A decision when to open the other secondary school years and lyc\u00e9es will be taken by the end of this month, with a possible return programmed for the beginning of June. Around 25 Covid-19 clusters have been reported since France ended its strict eight-week lockdown a week ago - Monday 11 May - but the French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said it will be another two weeks before the authorities know if it has resulted in a second wave of coronavirus cases. France has reported 28,108 deaths attributed to Covid-19 since March. There was an unexpected jump in the number of deaths in care and nursing homes in the last figures published on Sunday, but this was reported to be a recalculation of figures. Otherwise, the number of new cases and patients in hospital and intensive care with the virus is falling. France\u2019s coronavirus figures for 17 May: Confirmed cases: 142,411 (+120) In hospital: 19,361 (+152 gross, -71 net) In intensive care: 2,087 (+24 gross, -45 net) Hospital deaths: 17,466 (+54) Care home deaths: 10,642 (+429) Total deaths: 28,108 (+483) Sent home: 61,213 (+147) The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 7,000 in Afghanistan, following a continued surge of transmissions in Kabul and Herat, while war rages on across the country. Over the past 24 hours, 408 new cases were confirmed and three patients died of Covid-19, taking the total number of infections to 7,072 and the death toll to 173. There have so far been 801 recoveries. The heath ministry has pledged to increase the number of daily tests - 23,497 people have so far been tested in Afghanistan. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, said last week the country is waiting to receive more testing kits from the World Health Organization to increase daily testing capacity to around 2,500 in the first phase, 5,000 in the second and finally to 10,000 tests a day. Majroh warned over the weekend that \u201cif people continue not to heed, we will witness a big catastrophe among families\u201d. He said the ministry has a three-phase plan to ease the lockdown and \u201caccording to our plan, the lockdown should be in place for one year so we can get back to normal life\u201d. The capital, Kabul, is the country\u2019s worst affected area in both the number of deaths and transmissions, with 2,066 confirmed cases and 25 deaths reported in the city of around six million. The first case of Covid-19 in Afghanistan was reported in Herat as thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Herat has so far recorded 1,248 confirmed cases and 24 deaths. Of three new deaths, two were reported in the eastern province of Khost, where its deputy health director was wounded when a bomb hit his vehicle on Saturday. War is raging on with full intensity across the country. At least seven people were killed and 40 wounded when an explosion rocked central Ghanzi province on Monday morning. Javid Faisal, spokesman for the office of national security council, said the war had killed hundreds over the last week. \u201cAt least 249 Taliban were killed and 138 wounded by Afghan National Security Forces in the past week. Meanwhile, the Taliban harmed close to 300 civilians. This catastrophic war is a human tragedy that kills Afghans only, and without distinction,\u201d Faisal said. The Philippines has reported seven new coronavirus deaths and 205 additional infections. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total deaths from the outbreak had increased to 831, while confirmed cases have risen to 12,718. But 94 more patients recovered, bringing total recoveries to 2,729. Meanwhile, Malaysian health authorities reported 47 new coronavirus cases, bringing the cumulative total to 6,941 cases. The health ministry also reported no new deaths, keeping total fatalities at 113. Ireland today takes a cautious step to easing its two-month lockdown by allowing some businesses to reopen and up to four people from different households to meet as long as they respect social distancing. Gardening centres, hardware stores, bicycle repair shops and outdoor construction are among the handful of sectors cranking back to life on Monday. It is the first phase of a five-stage plan to lift restrictions spread out over three-week intervals, with the fifth and final phase starting on 10 August. \u201cWe all need to approach the coming days with care and caution, and to show some collective cop-on,\u201d said Simon Harris, the health minister, using an Irish term for common sense. \u201cWe want the shops to stay open, so there\u2019s no need to rush down to your local DIY centre or garden shop today.\u201d On Sunday the country reported 64 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest daily figure since mid March. Testing and contact tracing has expanded and speeded up, bolstering confidence in the ability to monitor and contain outbreaks. However officials worry about a resurgence, with some speculating that the construction sector could become a hotbed similar to nursing homes and meat processing plants. In Northern Ireland, authorities allowed gardening and recycling centres to reopen, a cautious approach that mirrors its southern neighbour. The head of the European Union\u2019s medicines agency, Guido Rasi, has said initial authorisation for remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment could be granted in coming days \u201cIt might be that a conditional market authorisation can be issued in the coming days,\u201d Rasi told a hearing in the EU parliament in Brussels. The European Medicines Agency has already recommended the compassionate use of US pharmaceutical company Gilead\u2019s remdesivir, which allows a drug to be administered to patients even before it has been fully authorised Thailand\u2019s economy shrank for the first time in six years because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered borders and devastated the tourism-reliant country. Forty million tourists were expected to arrive in Thailand this year, drawn to its sandy beaches, nightlife and street food culture. But the outbreak has sharply bruised the country\u2019s cash cow, with tourist vendors reporting as early as mid-January a drop in visitors after China \u2013 Thailand\u2019s largest source of tourists \u2013 went into lockdown. Data released on Monday by its economic planning agency showed a nearly 40% drop in tourist arrivals in the first three months of 2020, compared with the same period last year. The decrease has translated to the economy shrinking 1.8% year-on-year in January-March. Thailand has not seen a contraction since 2014 when it was brought to a standstill by political riots that clogged the streets of Bangkok and led to a coup two months later in May. The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) also forecast the economy to shrink by 5-6% in 2020 - the sharpest drop since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. The International Monetary Fund sets a grimmer outlook, predicting a 6.7% contraction for 2020 - which could make Thailand the worst performer among its peers in Southeast Asia. The country entered a state of emergency in late March and has banned all international flights until the end of June. It has more than 3,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and more than 50 deaths. Yemen, already pushed to the brink of famine by a five-year war, could see a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d food security situation due to the coronavirus pandemic, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has said. The conflict between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has caused what the United Nations describes as the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. Some 80% of Yemen\u2019s population are reliant on aid and millions face hunger. Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, the FAO\u2019s assistant director-general, told Reuters: The health system was already under heavy stress and will now be overwhelmed if Covid-19 continues to spread and, in addition, it will affect the movement of people and the movement of goods. That situation could be really catastrophic if all the elements of worst case scenarios come to be, but let\u2019s hope not, and the UN are working on avoiding that. Yemen, alongside Syria and Sudan, is one of the most vulnerable states in the Middle East in terms of food security. Lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus are likely to impact humanitarian supply chains keeping a large part of the population fed, the UN agency said in a report on Monday. The internationally recognised government has reported 128 Covid-19 infections with 20 deaths in areas under its control. The Houthis, who control most large urban centres, have announced four cases with one death, both in Sanaa. The World Health Organization said last Monday the virus was circulating undetected in Yemen, increasing the likelihood of a devastating outbreak among a malnourished population that would overwhelm a shattered health system with limited testing capacity. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, will hold a video conference later on Monday with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, a statement from Macron\u2019s office said. The statement added that the two leaders will present a new Franco-German initiative at the end of the meeting, around 3pm GMT. It gave no details on what the new initiative might entail, but a source close to Macron told Reuters it would touch on public health, economic recovery, green and digital transition, and industrial sovereignty. France and Germany have struggled to present a united front in the coronavirus crisis, with France leading a push by mostly southern European countries to convince fiscally conservative countries like Germany to issue joint European debt to help them weather the economic impact. The two countries, long the engines of EU integration, have also fared differently in dealing with the pandemic, with the number of deaths in France three times higher than in Germany, according to official figures. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by coverage of the pandemic, try our list of non-coronavirus articles that our readers spent the most time with over the weekend. India began evacuating thousands of villagers and halted port operations ahead of a cyclone expected to hit its east coast this week, piling pressure on emergency services grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. The cyclone, expected to make landfall on Wednesday, comes as India eases the world\u2019s longest lockdown, imposed in April against the virus, which has infected more than 96,169 people and killed 3,029. The states of Odisha and West Bengal sent disaster management teams to move families from homes of mud and thatch to places of shelter from the severe cyclonic storm, Amphan, which is expected to gain strength in the next 12 hours. \u201cWe have to evacuate people from low-lying areas, and protect them from the coronavirus too,\u201d said a senior official of India\u2019s home ministry who sought anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task.\u201d The cyclone season usually runs from April to December, with severe storms forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread death and damage to crops and property, both in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Authorities at the port of Paradip in Odisha ordered ships to move out to sea to avoid damage as the cyclone formed over the Bay of Bengal. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is set to hold a meeting in New Delhi to plan how to mitigate damage and injuries. \u201cThe extremely severe cyclonic storm \u2018Amphan\u2019...is likely to gain more strength and intensify further into a super cyclonic storm in the next 12 hours,\u201d weather officials said in a statement, forecasting heavy rain in eastern and southern areas. Russia said under 9,000 new coronavirus cases had been recorded for the first time since early May as anti-virus restrictions ease and officials say the situation is stabilising. Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the United States. It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief, Anna Popova, said this weekend that the growth in new cases was slowing and the country has \u201cmoved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for\u201d. Russia began easing nationwide lockdown restrictions last week and announced the national football league would restart in late June. Health officials also announced 91 new deaths, down from Saturday\u2019s figure of 119 that was the highest daily toll yet. Russia\u2019s total fatalities now stand at 2,722, a rate considerably lower than in many other countries hit hard by the pandemic. Critics have cast doubt on Russia\u2019s low official mortality rate, accusing authorities of under-reporting in order to play down the scale of the crisis. Russian health officials say one of the reasons the count is lower is that only deaths directly caused by the virus are being included. The deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, over the weekend denied manipulation of numbers, saying hospitals had a financial interest in identifying infections because they are allocated more money to treat coronavirus patients. Authorities also say that since the virus came later to Russia, there was more time to prepare hospital beds and launch wide-scale testing to slow the spread. China\u2019s foreign ministry has said it is premature to immediately launch an investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 300,000 people globally. Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a daily briefing that the vast majority of countries in the world believe the pandemic is not yet over. The ministry said in a separate statement that president Xi Jinping will give a video speech for the opening ceremony of the World Health Assembly later on Monday. A draft resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus has support from 116 nations at the assembly, almost enough for it to pass. Anatole Bandu, a country representative for HelpAge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has written this moving piece about the people in Kinshasa have no money, no soap, no water \u2013 and when they are struggling to breathe, no ventilators. We\u2019re used to emergencies and people dying in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whether it\u2019s a result of the long-running conflict or Ebola, cholera and malaria. But coronavirus has knocked us for six, because it has affected people we are very close to. I\u2019ve been working in development for decades, but I have to admit I have shed tears these past few weeks. We started getting calls as soon as the lockdown began. Many of the older people we support have chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, and without public transport were unable to get their medicines. They have no money for taxis. So we have been delivering medicines to people\u2019s doors. One couple in Kinshasa\u2019s Gombe commune both suffered from hypertension. They had been trying to access their medicine for a while before they called us. When we delivered it, the husband was very short of breath. We called an emergency response team, who tested him for Covid-19. It took a week for the results to come back and he was taken to hospital, where he died two days later. The hospital had no ventilators and very few health workers. Many had left, too scared to work without PPE. His wife also became very ill. Unsurprisingly, when I last delivered her medicine she was very depressed, frightened and confused. She was struggling to speak and just looked up at the sky, muttering she was offering her life up to God as she had no idea what tomorrow would bring. She died last week in hospital, unable to breathe. There was no ventilator. The Spanish cabinet is due to approve a programme to grant a basic income to the poorest to help them weather the economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, social security minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, has said. In an interview with RNE radio station, Escriv\u00e1 said ministers would likely approve the programme during the weekly cabinet meeting scheduled on 26 May. He said as many as one million families would receive the new benefit, which would cost the government between \u20ac3 - 3.5bn per year. Brazilian journalist Caio Barretto Briso has this report from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, where a recent police raid killed 13 people. Maria Diva do Nascimento was worried as she set off for her job at one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s biggest hospitals wearing a face mask she hoped would keep her alive. It had been two days since she had heard from her son Allyson, a 20-year-old drug trafficker whose job made social isolation impossible. Nascimento knew the risks of Covid-19 well: four days earlier it had killed a friend and fellow security guard at the hospital. More than half of her co-workers had been infected. But when the 42-year-old reached work on Friday, she received news of another, even more immediate threat to her child. Armed police were sweeping into the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, the vast favela where Allyson worked for Brazil\u2019s oldest drug faction, the Red Command. Helicopters soared overhead. \u201cWhere are you???\u201d Allyson\u2019s panicked mother asked him on WhatsApp at 6.39am. \u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d he answered. But that was the last message he sent her. By lunchtime, Nascimento would learn her son was dead \u2013 one of more than 2,000 mostly young Brazilians gunned down by Rio police since the start of last year. \u201cI brought him into this world,\u201d she said on Saturday, crying as she prepared to say farewell. \u201cNo one had the right to take him away.\u201d Police operations and body bags are nothing new to Rio, where state police killed a record 1,810 people last year, nearly five a day. But with the city now in partial shutdown because of Covid-19, and citizens under orders to stay indoors, favela residents are voicing outrage that the police\u2019s terrifying incursions into their communities have not been halted. A draft resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus has support from 116 nations at the World Health Assembly, almost enough for it to pass, a document showed. The resolution on Covid-19 will be put forward on Tuesday if it gains backing from two-thirds of the 194 members of the assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization. China had strongly opposed Australia\u2019s call last month for an international investigation into the pandemic. Names on a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Monday showed support from 116 members was locked in, although Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said negotiations were ongoing and she did not want to pre-empt the outcome. The resolution was \u201can important part of the conversation we started, and I am very grateful to the efforts of those in the European Union and those many drafters who have been part of the negotiations for the past few weeks,\u201d she told reporters. The resolution included a call for \u201can examination of the zoonotic origins of the coronavirus\u201d, she added. Australia - which has reported 99 deaths from the coronavirus - says it wants to prevent a repeat of the pandemic, and is not looking to cast blame. \u201cI hope that China will participate,\u201d Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham, said on Monday, as he welcomed building support for an inquiry. Among the co-sponsors of the resolution are India, Japan, South Korea, the African group of 47 member nations, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Britain and Canada. The resolution calls for \u201cscientific and collaborative field missions\u201d to trace the path of transmission, saying this will reduce the risk of similar events. It also says a review should start at the \u201cearliest appropriate moment\u201d. Some countries still suffering high daily death tolls from Covid-19 have said it is too soon for an investigation. Despite strong efforts, Taiwan did not get invited to this week\u2019s meeting of a key World Health Organization body due to Chinese pressure, its foreign minister has said, adding they had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. Non-WHO member Taiwan had been lobbying to take part in the World Health Assembly, which opens later on Monday. Taiwan has said it wanted to share with the world its successful experience at fighting the coronavirus, having only reported 440 cases and seven deaths thanks to early detection and prevention work. But China, which considers democratically-ruled Taiwan its own with no right to attend international bodies as a sovereign state, strongly objected to Taiwan taking part in the assembly unless it accepted it was part of China, something the Taipei government refused to do. Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told reporters: Despite all our efforts and an unprecedented level of international support, Taiwan has not received an invitation to take part. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses deep regret and strong dissatisfaction that the World Health Organization Secretariat has yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and continues to disregard the right to health of the 23 million people of Taiwan. Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the pandemic, which Taiwan has strongly disputed. The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing. Taiwan attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects. Wu said that Taiwan had agreed the issue of its participation would be put off until later in the year so the shorted assembly can focus on the coronavirus. Understandably, countries want to use the limited time available to concentrate on ways of containing the pandemic. For this reason, like-minded nations and diplomatic allies have suggested that the proposal be taken up later this year when meetings will be conducted normally, to make sure there will be full and open discussion. After careful deliberation, we have accepted the suggestion from our allies and like-minded nations to wait until the resumed session before further promoting our bid. Hungary\u2019s government will submit a proposal to parliament on 26 May to end its special coronavirus emergency powers, hirtv.hu quoted prime minister Viktor Orban\u2019s chief of staff as saying late on Sunday. Gergely Gulyas said parliament would take a few days to pass the bill, which will end the much-criticised emergency powers by early June. No end date was set when parliament gave the government permission to rule by decree in matters related to the coronavirus, leading to international criticism and accusations of an autocratic power-grab. The chief executive of Ryanair has accused the UK government of mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis, as the airline halved its passenger forecast for this year. Michael O\u2019Leary described the UK\u2019s planned introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for travellers arriving from abroad as \u201cidiotic and unimplementable\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis is the same government that has \u2026 mismanaged the crisis for many weeks.\u201d He said the UK was \u201cmaking this stuff up as they go along\u201d, referring to its transport policy. O\u2019Leary added that face masks were essential for people travelling on mass transport. Ryanair said it had one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with cash of \u20ac4.1bn (\u00a33.7bn), after recently raising \u00a3600m under the UK\u2019s Covid corporate financing facility, which was set up by the Treasury and the Bank of England to help large businesses weather the crisis. O\u2019Leary spoke as the airline, Europe\u2019s largest, published a \u20ac1bn profit for the year to 31 March, up from \u20ac885m the previous year. It said the pandemic had cost it \u20ac40m in lost profits, after travel restrictions in Europe forced it to ground almost its entire fleet. The Irish carrier forecast a loss of more than \u20ac200m for the first quarter, followed by a smaller loss in the second quarter. It expects to carry fewer than 80 million passengers this year, almost half its original 154 million target. Here is a quick summary of the coronavirus situation across the globe: Restaurants and churches will reopen in Italy on Monday as part of a fresh wave of lockdown easing in Europe, but rising coronavirus death tolls in Brazil, South Africa and other parts of the world showed the worst is still to come in many countries. The relaxation of curbs in some places comes as governments around the world struggle to repair the vast economic damage unleashed by the pandemic, with Japan the latest to slump into a recession and the Fed warning of a severe US downturn as the global infection count topped 4.7 million. But the World Health Organization has warned that reopening too quickly without a vaccine could trigger a second devastating wave of infections, and the body will host a virtual global health assembly this week to help chart a course out of the crisis. Once the worst-hit country in the world, Italy is now taking its latest step in a cautious, gradual return to normality, allowing businesses and churches to reopen after a two-month lockdown. \u201cI share the joy of those communities who can finally reunite as liturgical assemblies, a sign of hope for all society,\u201d Pope Francis said on Sunday during his live-streamed prayer, with Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica also throwing its door open to visitors. Businesses including restaurants, bars, cafes, hairdressers, and stores will be allowed to re-open on Monday. Gyms, pools, cinemas and theatres are allowed to open on 25 May. Spain is also set to further ease its lockdown measures, while Germany has already taken several steps towards a reopening, including the resumption of its top football league - but with empty stadiums. There was other welcome relief for Europeans on the weekend too, with people enjoying beaches in France, Greece and Italy, and Britons going to parks to bask in the sun. Deaths in Brazil have risen sharply in recent days, and with more than 241,000 infections reached over the weekend, South America\u2019s largest country now has the fourth-highest caseload in the world. But president Jair Bolsonaro has been a staunch opponent of lockdowns, claiming they have unnecessarily hurt the Brazilian economy, but experts and regional leaders have warned that the healthcare infrastructure could collapse. The far-right leader alongside several ministers greeted hundreds of his supporters in the capital Brasilia on Sunday in defiance of social distancing measures, telling the crowd that the virus restrictions were too much. Latin America and the Caribbean have recorded more than half a million infections, with almost half of them from Brazil, and there is growing alarm about the impact of the virus on the least privileged in the region. There was also grim data in Africa, where the number of infections rose rapidly. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, taking the total to 15,515 - the highest on the continent. After more than 50 years fighting for civil rights, the Rev Jesse Jackson is now watching coronavirus ravage African American communities. But he has a warning for the rich and powerful. Our military cannot defeat this germ. Having the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything. Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing. Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart. Japan\u2019s beloved Mount Fuji will be closed during this year\u2019s summer climbing season to prevent the spread of Covid-19, officials have said. Shizuoka prefecture, home to the country\u2019s tallest mountain, announced they were closing three of the four major routes to the mountain\u2019s peak. \u201cThe routes open in summer but this year we will keep them closed from July 10 to September 10,\u201d the only climbing season for Mount Fuji, a Shizuoka prefecture official told AFP. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this measure so as not to spread the coronavirus,\u201d the official said. It will be the first time the trails of the 3,776-metre (12,388 ft) volcanic mountain are closed since at least 1960 when the prefecture began managing the routes, he added. The decision comes after nearby Yamanashi prefecture said it will close the Yoshida trail, the most popular hiking path among the four. The mountain huts along the four routes will remain closed as well. The mountain, a UNESCO world cultural heritage site, welcomed about 236,000 climbers last year, according to the Mount Fuji official website. Thanks Helen, this is Jessica Murray taking charge of the ship (blog) for the next few hours. As always, I\u2019d love to hear your suggestions and experiences, so please do get in touch if you would like to: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ I\u2019ll try to respond to as many as I can, and I\u2019ll certainly read them all. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks as always for following along. My colleague Jessica Murray will be steering the good ship blog for the next few hours. Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Global infections pass 4.7 million. There are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187 people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. Japan falls into recession. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019. In Brazil, the BBC has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room. India extends lockdown by another two weeks. India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Why the UK fell behind European peers on emergency funding Across Europe, government-backed business loan schemes in Germany, France and Switzerland have been quicker to distribute emergency funding during the coronavirus outbreak than those in the UK, where teething problems put the British programme weeks behind mainland rivals. The UK\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which was initially fraught with controversy over demands for personal guarantees, took a month to distribute 18,595 loans worth \u00a33.1bn. But the pace of approvals jumped following the introduction of two additional programmes, including the bounce-back loan scheme that handed \u00a32bn to 69,000 Britain\u2019s smallest businesses within the first 24 hours of its launch on 4 May. Seven weeks in, the UK is finally catching up, having handed almost \u00a315bn to more than 304,000 firms But why did the UK struggle to keep up with its European peers in the first place? Experts say the answer may be linked to borrowing trends, the nature of Britain\u2019s financial system, and the UK\u2019s relationship with government spending. Global report: US unemployment could hit 25%, warns Fed chairman, as Japan enters recession Unemployment in the United States could peak at 25% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the chair of the Federal Reserve, amid warnings the June quarter economic figures will be \u201cvery, very bad\u201d. The bleak prediction came as Japan slid into its first recession in five years, with forecasts that worse was to come. In a sober assessment of the economic impact of coronavirus in the US, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, estimated GDP contraction in the June quarter could be \u201ceasily be in the twenties or thirties\u201d, as fallout from the global outbreak worsened. \u201cSo the data we\u2019ll see for this quarter, which ends in June, will be very, very bad,\u201d he said. Asked about estimates of unemployment reaching 20-25%, Powell said: \u201cI think there\u2019re a range of perspectives. But those numbers sound about right for what the peak may be.\u201d As the bad news broke in the US, Japan marked two quarters of negative GDP growth, entering into a recession for the first time since 2015. The economy shrank in 0.9% to the end of March, off the back of a 1.9% drop at the end of 2019. Some analysts predicted more grim news ahead, with the full impact of the pandemic still to be measured. South Korean football team apologises for using sex dolls to fill stands A professional football team in South Korea has apologised after \u201cmannequins\u201d it used as substitute fans during a match at the weekend turned out to be sex dolls. The K-League club FC Seoul said the dolls, which had been dotted around stands currently off-limits to supporters due to the coronavirus outbreak, had been ordered inadvertently after a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with the supplier. Earlier this month the K-League became the first major football league to hold matches since the start of the pandemic, with the season\u2019s opening game watched by a worldwide audience of fans starved of live football. But FC Seoul\u2019s attempt to bring a touch of realism to Sunday\u2019s match against Gwangju FC backfired after social media users noticed that the mannequins looked more like sex dolls. China facing pressure over Covid-19 and Taiwan at World Health Assembly Beijing is expected to face new levels of pressure at the World Health Assembly this week as dozens of nations push for an independent investigation into the coronavirus outbreak and the United States mounts a campaign over Taiwan\u2019s status. More than 120 countries have backed a call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19 while a US-led coalition has been aggressively lobbying countries to support Taiwan\u2019s bid to attend as an observer. China has blocked Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of China, from attending the meeting since 2016 as relations between Beijing and Taipei worsened following the election of Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party. \u2018Cleaner and greener\u2019: Covid-19 prompts world\u2019s cities to free public space of cars The mayor of Athens has said he will \u201cliberate\u201d public space from cars. His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight. Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects. Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby. World Health Assembly: what is it, and what is the coronavirus inquiry proposal? The World Health Assembly is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, attended by representatives of the United Nation\u2019s 194 member states. The two-day 2020 assembly will be held virtually \u2013 it usually happens in Geneva \u2013 because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis around the world. This year\u2019s assembly, the 73rd WHA, will be dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. This will be a critical assembly: the annual meeting comes at a time when the WHO has attracted unprecedented global attention for its coordination and advisory role during the pandemic. Influential states, most notably the US, have criticised the WHO for being slow to react, and alleged it has been biased towards China. The US has withheld funding from the WHO in response to its perceived Covid-19 failings. Global infections pass 4.7 millionThere are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187 people have died over the course of the pandemic so far. The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities so far and 1,486,757 infections. US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could hit 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. Japan\u2019s economic growth falls into recession in the first quarter. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus.The Cabinet Office reported Monday a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor: hospitals \u201cnear collapse\u201d. In Brazil, the BBCreports that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d: they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said.Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday has seen lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps: UN chief. Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said.The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar.A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday. WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA), which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees. India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Nigeria seizes British plane flouting travel ban. Nigeria has seized a British plane for defying a travel ban imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation minister said Sunday.Flair Aviation, the airline involved, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights, Hadi Sirika said on his Twitter account. Qatar makes masks mandatory on pain of prison. Qatar has begun enforcing the world\u2019s toughest penalties of up to three years\u2019 in prison for failing to wear masks in public, in a country with one of the highest coronavirus infection rates. More than 32,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the tiny Gulf country - 1.2 percent of the 2.75 million population - although just 15 people have died. Only the micro-states of San Marino and the Vaticanhave had higher per-capita infection rates, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Italy\u2019s shops, restaurants and hair salons have been preparing to reopen on Monday, as the government further eases the lockdown. Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least one metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists. Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports from Washington with Dan Sabbagh in London: Saudi Arabia may be forced to forego new weapons contracts and delay already-agreed weapons purchases as a financial crisis grips the kingdom, experts predict. The expected delay of new weapons deals could have long-term political repercussions for the country under the rule of Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler who has waged a bloody war with neighbouring Yemen. Saudi Arabia is facing an unprecedented budget crunch because of the collapse of the oil markets and the global economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced oil demand for the foreseeable future. \u201cI have no doubt, this is the end of an era. The era of the Persian Gulf having all this money is over,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at Brookings in Washington and 30-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, who has served as an adviser on Middle East issues to several US administrations. Burundi to go to polls amid fears authorities playing down Covid-19 Millions of voters in Burundi will go to the polls on Wednesday to elect a new president in the first competitive election since a decade-long civil war began in 1993. Amid concern that authorities are deliberately playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic, seven candidates are seeking to replace the incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza, who is being forced to step down by opponents within the country\u2019s ruling CNDD-FDD party. Rights groups say the government is pressing ahead with the vote irresponsibly, and accuse the CNDD-FDD and its youth wing of crushing dissent and threatening those taking their own measures against coronavirus. Last week Burundi expelled the World Health Organization\u2019s expert team working on coronavirus. Campaigning politicians have held rallies attended by tens of thousands. The nation of 11 million people has reported 27 cases of Covid-19 so far but has only carried out about 520 tests in total. Officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear. Summer weather is enticing much of the world to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns as centres of the outbreak from New York to Italy and Spain gradually lift restrictions that have kept millions indoors for months, Reuters reports. People are streaming back to beaches, parks and streets just as a heat wave hits southern Europe and spring-like temperatures allow Americans to shed winter coats. Greeks flocked to the seaside on Saturday when more than 500 beaches reopened, coinciding with temperatures of 34 Celsius (93 Fahrenheit). Umbrella poles had to be 4 meters (13 ft) apart, with canopies no closer than 1 meter as the country sought to walk the fine line between protecting people from Covid-19 while reviving the tourism sector that many depend on for their livelihoods. White circles were painted on the lawn in Brooklyn\u2019s Domino Park in New York City to help sunbathers and picnickers keep a safe distance. About half the people in the park appeared to be wearing some form of face covering as they congregated in small groups on a warm Saturday afternoon with police officers in masks keeping watch. In Paris\u2019 Bois de Boulogne, health training worker Anne Chardon was carrying disinfectant gel and a mask but said she felt a sense of freedom again for the first time after weeks of confinement. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we were in Sleeping Beauty\u2019s castle, all asleep, all frozen, and suddenly there\u2019s light and space, suddenly we can experience again the little joys of everyday, in the spaces that belong to us, and that we\u2019re rediscovering.\u201d China\u2019s levels of some air pollutants have risen back to above last year\u2019s levels after dropping when the government imposed strict lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic, according to a study published on Monday. The rebound was likely due to industrial activity, the researchers said, adding there were concerns that after months of unusually low pollution levels, a drive to kickstart economic activity was causing emissions to spike. \u201cThere are early warning signs that China\u2019s recovery from the Covid-19 crisis is reversing air quality gains,\u201d the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), which produced the study, said. Average levels of some air pollutants in China dropped in February to significantly below levels for the same period in 2019, as lockdown measures shuttered factories, curbed electricity demand and slashed transport use as swathes of the population stayed home. But average levels of some pollutants have since rebounded, and were higher in the 30 days ended 8 May compared with the same period in 2019, CREA said in its analysis of data from 1,500 air quality monitoring stations in China. This was true of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter, suggesting a rebound in industrial activity drove the trend, CREA said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 2 to 174,355, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday. The tally showed no further deaths due to the virus. The reported death toll remained at 7,914. Meanwhile football team Bayern Munich returned to action Sunday with a 2-0 win at Union Berlin as the restart of German soccer continued in empty stadiums. Players shouts echoed off the rows of concrete terracing around Unions stadium, AP reports. A Canadian aerobatics jet has crashed into a British Columbia neighbourhood during a flyover intended to boost morale during the Covid-19 pandemic, killing one crew member, seriously injuring another and setting a house on fire, AP reports. Video appeared to show the crew of the Snowbirds\u2019 plane ejecting during the crash on Sunday. Debris was scattered across Kamloops, the neighbourhood near the airport 260 miles (418km) north-east of Vancouver. The Snowbirds are Canada\u2019s equivalent of the US Air Force Thunderbirds or the UK\u2019s Red Arrows. In Australia, more than 150 Australian newsrooms have shut since January 2019 as Covid-19 deepens a media crisis. The closure of BuzzFeed News in Australia may have grabbed the headlines last week but the digital startup is just one victim on a growing list of media casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five editorial staff at BuzzFeed have lost their jobs, but across the country hundreds more have been stood down in an already fractured media landscape. It\u2019s unclear how many will ever return to their posts. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s partner, everybody: More from New Zealand now, with the full report on the country passing the population milestone of 5 million people: It was a much-anticipated milestone likely hastened by Covid-19: New Zealand has reached a population of 5 million people, after citizens and residents rushed home when borders began to close due to the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand grew from four to five million in 17 years, the quickest rate of growth in the country\u2019s modern history, according to the government agency Statistics New Zealand. Migration has been the chief driver for the population of the isolated island nation, which increased by half a million people in the past six years alone. On 18 March, the government urged the 80,000 New Zealanders overseas to return home, adding that the window to travel was closing rapidly. People who are not citizens or residents of the country - or their immediate family - are not currently permitted to enter New Zealand under Covid-19 border controls. New Zealand braces for spike in child abuse reports as Covid-19 lockdown eases As hundreds of thousands of children return to classrooms around New Zealand, welfare services are bracing themselves for a spike in reports of abuse and neglect after weeks of \u201cinvisible\u201d lockdown. The country entered lockdown on 25 March and emerged late last week. During lockdown reports of family violence to police dropped, and reports of concern to Oranga Tamariki, the country\u2019s welfare agency for children, fell by around 40%. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of child abuse and neglect in the OECD, and on average one infant is murdered every five weeks. Oranga Tamariki\u2019s chief executive, Gr\u00e1inne Moss, told the Guardian that reports of harm always drop over the school holidays, because the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d that usually identify harm \u2013 education, social and health workers \u2013 aren\u2019t around. But the prolonged nature of lockdown and the added stress of job losses among already strained families was creating \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, Moss said, and rises in family violence overseas are likely to hold true in New Zealand too, though no local research has been conducted yet. \u201cLockdown is a lot longer than the school holidays so we are right to be concerned that there is hidden, invisible harm occurring to children,\u201d Moss said. In the US, the Republican senator Ben Sasse\u2019s attempt at humor during a speech for high school students has drawn strong criticism, the AP reports. Sasse delivered the online speech to students at his former school, Fremont high in Nebraska, on Saturday. Sasse mixed some serious encouragement for students with another shot at China. \u201cNobody knows exactly how we\u2019re going to beat this thing, but you know what, we\u2019re Americans, we\u2019re Nebraskans, we\u2019ve got grit and we\u2019re going to beat this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring the economy back. We are going to beat the virus ... We\u2019re going to have to have a serious reckoning with the thugs in China who let this mess spiral out of control by lying about it,\u201d he said. Sasse also joked about psychologists: \u201cNinety-five per cent of all gainfully employed psychologists \u2013 and I\u2019m serious, there are dozens of them that are gainfully employed - their job is really just to help people forget high school ... If you\u2019re headed to college, do not do not major in psychology. That part\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Mexico on Sunday reported 49,219 cases of the coronavirus, 2,075 more than the previous day, as the country prepares to resume economic activities deemed essential. Deaths from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, increased by 132, to a total of 5,177. Mexico announced last week a plan to gradually resume economic activity that has been halted by the coronavirus, starting on 1 June. On Friday, Mexico\u2019s government said the automotive industry could exit the coronavirus lockdown before 1 June if companies had in place approved safety measures. Deputy Health Minister Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell told a news conference on Sunday that cases had started to stabilize over the past week in Mexico City and its metropolitan area, which has the highest level of infection in the country. Authorities have said that the true number of cases could be up to nine times greater than the reported total because many of those infected likely did not go to the doctor, did not develop symptoms or were not properly diagnosed. Mexico has seen a slightly higher death rate from the coronavirus than the global average so far because of the widespread presence of pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, experts say. The Guardian\u2019s Tom Lutz and Jessica Glenza report: Donald Trump has hit back at Barack Obama\u2019s criticism of his administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, accusing the former US president of being \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d during his time in office. It is rare for a former president to rebuke a successor, but Obama did so during an online speech to graduating university and high school students yesterday, although he did not name Trump in his comments. \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge,\u201d Obama said during an online commencement address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on Saturday. On Sunday, Trump said he had not seen Obama\u2019s comments, but added: \u201cLook, he was an incompetent president, that\u2019s all I can say. Grossly incompetent.\u201d In the US, a Roman Catholic priest in the Detroit area has taken aim at his parishioners in a bid to maintain social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, using a squirt gun to shoot holy water. Photos posted on social media by the St Ambrose Church show the Reverend Timothy Pelc shooting water into a car window as it stopped by the steps of the church. He wore a mask, face shield and rubber gloves as further precautions against spreading the coronavirus. The photos of the priest at the church in Grosse Pointe Park were taken at Easter but have recently gone viral and have inspired memes online. One shows the 70-year-old priest amid the fires of hell directing the squirt gun at devil-like figures. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The Cabinet Office reported Monday a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter. The annual pace gives what the rate would be when continued for a year. For just the quarter, the drop was 0.9%, AP reports. Exports dived 21.8%. Private residential investments slipped nearly 17%, and household consumption edged down 3.1%. Analysts say things are expected to get worse, as the world\u2019s third-largest economy undergoes its biggest challenge since the second world war. Japan is in a technical recession, defined as two quarters straight of contraction, as its economy contracted 1.9% in October-December. It remained flat July-September, and eked out 0.5% growth for April-June, according to the latest numbers. Japan is extremely vulnerable to the economic damage from the ongoing outbreak. It is dependent on trade with both China and theUS, the country where the pandemic began and the country where it has hit hardest. The manufacturers that are pillars of Japan\u2019s economy, such as Toyota Motor Corp, have reported dismal financial results results. Travel, tourism and trade with those countries and others have faded. New Zealand\u2019s population has grown to 5 million people as a result of the lockdown, with citizens returning home from living overseas, AAP reports. New Zealand grew from four to five million in 17 years, the quickest rate of growth in the country\u2019s modern history. On Monday, Stats NZ released its quarterly estimate resident population figures which showed New Zealand notching the major milestone. As of 31 March, the South Pacific nation has 5,002,100 residents. In all likelihood, New Zealand has reached the figure because of the pandemic. \u201cCOVID-19 has caused some unusual and unprecedented travel patterns,\u201d Stats NZ senior demographer Kim Dunstan told AAP. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people that have been in New Zealand prolong their stay which has given some boost to migration. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had more New Zealand citizens returning from living overseas in recent months. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve also had fewer citizens departing New Zealand to live overseas. \u201cThe combined impact has seen an upswing in migration which has helped New Zealand reach that five million milestone.\u201d China reported seven new coronavirus cases for 17 May, up from five a day earlier, the country\u2019s health authority said on Monday. Of the new cases, four were imported from the Inner Mongolia province. The country also reported 18 new asymptomatic cases on 17 May, versus 12 the day before. Apple Inc will this week reopen more than 25 of its branded stores in the United States, a company spokesman said on Sunday, continuing a gradual process that has unlocked doors at nearly a fifth of its worldwide retail outlets, Reuters reports. The iPhone maker in March shut all its stores outside of Greater China in response to the spread of the coronavirus. It started shutting its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. \u201cOur commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,\u201d Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s head of retail, wrote on Sunday in a note on the company\u2019s website. The stores will impose social-distancing rules, limit occupancy and some will offer only curbside or storefront service, she said. Last week, Apple reopened its first five stores in the United States, requiring customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the premises. Apple has 510 stores worldwide and 271 in the United States. The website 9to5Mac reported that the company would reopen 10 of its stores in Italy beginning on Tuesday. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could hit 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. He suggested that a full recovery won\u2019t likely be possible before the arrival of a vaccine. In an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d, Powell played down comparisons to the Depression. While acknowledging that unemployment could peak near the Depression high of 25%, he noted that US banks are far healthier now and that the Fed and other central banks are much more able and willing to intervene to bolster economies than they were in the 1930s. Powell pointed out that the downturn wasn\u2019t a result of deep-seated financial instabilities, like the housing meltdown and the excessive risk-taking among banks that ignited the Great Recession. Rather, it resulted from an external event a pandemic that required a shutdown of the economy. That may mean, he said, that \u201cwe can get back to a healthy economy fairly quickly.\u201d In the meantime, though, American workers are enduring their worst crisis in decades. More than 36 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus first forced businesses to close down and shrink their workforces. The unemployment rate, at 14.7%, is the highest since the Great Depression, and is widely expected to go much higher. In Brazil, the BBC reports that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d: they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday to back his open-the-economy drive even as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country, AP reports. Demonstrators in Brasilia and Sao Paulo defied local stay-at-home orders to join the pro-Bolsonaro rallies at a time when the president is facing increasing pressure over his handling of the pandemic. \u201cWe hope to be free of this question soon, for the good of all of us, Bolsonaro told the crowd in Brasilia. Brazil will come back stronger.\u201d Bolsonaro later invited a group of about 20 paratroopers, who were taking part in the protest, to join him on the stoop of the presidential office. The men, wearing camouflage trousers, black Bolsonaro t-shirts and red berets, swore allegiance to the president and his family, stretching their right arms, before some joined him in a series of push-ups. Supporters have gathered daily at the presidential residence, with larger crowds turning out on weekends. India\u2019s lockdown extension also brings what the Times of India calls \u201cthe most significant easing of the national lockdown yet,\u201d with states being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. States will colour-code zones according to the level of infection, and allow greater or lesser economic activity depending on this. NDTV explains the easing as follows: The practice of work from home should be followed to the extent possible, the Centre said. At workplaces, staggering of work hours should be adopted. There should be provision for thermal scanning, hand wash and sanitizers and common areas and rules of social distancing should be maintained. The government has also not allowed any re-opening of areas which draw a large number of people -- shopping malls and multiplexes, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, bars and auditoriums, assembly halls, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services. Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar. A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday. The Rohingya on Bhashan Char island - a silty strip of land prone to violent and potentially deadly monsoon storms - were rescued in early May after floating adrift in the Bay of Bengal. Dhaka has said they were not initially sent on to the camps in the southeast as authorities were afraid they might have coronavirus. Guterres said the 308 refugees should be moved to the camps after their time in quarantine is completed. A bit of background on Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the WHO: Taiwan - officially the Republic of China - was a founding member of the WHO when the global health body was created in 1948. But it was expelled in 1972 a year after losing the \u201cChina\u201d seat at the United Nations to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Between 2009 and 2016 Beijing allowed Taiwan to attend the WHA as an observer under the name \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d. It lost that status with the election in Taiwan of President Tsai Ing-wen who views the island as a de facto independent nation and does not subscribe to Beijing\u2019s idea that it belongs to a \u201cone China\u201d. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA), which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees, AFP reports. Taiwan is currently excluded from the WHO but in the midst of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing around the novel coronavirus, the administration of US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for the island\u2019s participation at the WHA in spite of opposition from China. Many heads of state, government and ministers are expected to attend the two-day virtual meeting on the pandemic which the WHO hopes will take a physical form later in the year. Asked repeatedly on the subject at a news conference, the WHO said that it only has the role of secretariat of the assembly and that only member states can decide to invite Taiwan or not. In a document relating to the WHA agenda and dated 15 May, the head of the WHO said that the proposal was being \u201csubmitted to the General Committee for its consideration\u201d. Due to the pandemic this ad-hoc committee will not be able to sit on Monday, delaying any ruling. It will have to decide on the issue during the physical meeting that the WHO hopes to organise at the end of the year. Nothing, however, prevents a country calling on Monday for a vote on the presence of Taiwan. The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities of the world\u2019s refugees and internally displaced people, according to a report. Research from the University of Birmingham has revealed that many undocumented migrants were anxious about seeking medical help \u2013 fearful of being reported to immigration authorities and being deported \u2013 and were therefore suffering in silence. The report, Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 on Forced Migrant Survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence, due to be published on Monday, took witness testimonies from more than 90 survivors and organisations in five countries, including the UK. It found that victims were finding themselves locked in with perpetrators, with no access to shelters or advice organisations, and as a result were having to suffer abuse. In case you missed it: India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and some other key regions still battling to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections, reports the Associated Press. The government-run National Disaster Management authority said in a statement on Sunday that fresh guidelines will be issued that keep in view the need to open up economic activity. Indian media reports said that travel by air, rail and metro will remain shut down until the end of May. Schools, hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, cinemas and places of worship will also be closed nationally. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. The numbers of deaths rose by three to 263 from Saturday. Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy has the highest numbers of infections in Africa, followed by Egypt, which has so far recorded 11,719 Covid-19 cases, including 612 deaths. The country has been under lockdown since March 27 and has embarked on an aggressive mass testing strategy with 460,873 tested so far. But some health experts are beginning to see the limits of the country\u2019s lauded mass screening strategy, with results taking up to two weeks to come through. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. We welcome questions, comments, tips and news from your part of the world \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. South Africa has recorded its highest daily increase in cases, with 1,160 new cases confirmed. Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy has the highest numbers of infections in Africa, followed by Egypt, which has so far recorded 11,719 Covid-19 cases, including 612 deaths. The country has been under lockdown since March 27 and has embarked on an aggressive mass testing strategy with 460,873 tested so far. But some health experts are beginning to see the limits of the country\u2019s lauded mass screening strategy, with results taking up to two weeks to come through. Global infections pass 4.7 million. There are 4,702,603 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 314,476 people have died over the course of the pandemic so far. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday has seen lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Nigeria seizes British plane flouting travel ban. Nigeria has seized a British plane for defying a travel ban imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation minister said Sunday.Flair Aviation, the airline involved, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights, Hadi Sirika said on his Twitter account. Qatar makes masks mandatory on pain of prison. Qatar has begun enforcing the world\u2019s toughest penalties of up to three years\u2019 in prison for failing to wear masks in public, in a country with one of the highest coronavirus infection rates. More than 32,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the tiny Gulf country - 1.2 percent of the 2.75 million population - although just 15 people have died. Only the micro-states of San Marino and the Vatican have had higher per-capita infection rates, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Italy\u2019s shops, restaurants and hair salons have been preparing to reopen on Monday, as the government further eases the lockdown. Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least one metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists. Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. Benin is staging local elections, minus key opposition parties, with authorities pushing ahead despite the coronavirus. The West African nation of 11 million this week lifted a series of restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus, which has caused 339 confirmed infections and two deaths in the country. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy, with the country announcing nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday. This takes Brazil\u2019s total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. The city of Wuhan conducted 222,675 nucleic acid tests on 16 May, the local health authority said, nearly doubling from a day earlier. Wuhan kicked off a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers after confirming last weekend its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since its release from lockdown on 8 April. Quebec is considering making masks mandatory, after banning the veil. The Canadian province at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak is is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks, but has not made the measure mandatory. Quebec\u2019s public health director stressed \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d The growth of new coronavirus cases in Russia is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week. The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the United States. Madagascar has reported the first death of a patient suffering from the coronavirus, nearly two months after the virus was first detected in the country. The victim was a 57-year-old man with underlying conditions. Madagascar has reported 304 cases.",
