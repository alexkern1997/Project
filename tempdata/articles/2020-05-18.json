      "bodyText": "September 11, 2001 might be branded as the darkest day in our collective memory, but for Ray Cervai, it was the events of three days later that stood out for him personally. That was the day Ansett Australia grounded all flights, leaving the Melbourne businessman, who officially supplied the airline with merchandise, with more than half a million dollars of Ansett-themed products stored in his shed. \u201cIt felt like someone had shot me in the stomach,\u201d says the semi-retired Cervai. Almost 20 years on, another airline \u2013 Virgin Australia \u2013 entered voluntary administration. The collapse, like Ansett\u2019s, was precipitated by a massive global disruption, this time coronavirus. As the government fended off appeals for a bailout, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, pointed to Virgin Australia\u2019s 90% foreign ownership to declare: \u201cThis is not Ansett. This is not the end of the airline.\u201d As potential buyers mount bids to save Virgin Australia from collapse, the legacy of Ansett has evolved from an aviation powerhouse into a small but thriving community. While the airline may have stopped flying, the Ansett name and logo live on as a basketball club, a museum in regional Victoria, and a now-booming online retail business for Cervai. \u201cWe already had the news of 9/11 come in one morning that week, and then two days later, at four o\u2019clock in the morning, I woke up and heard someone in my house crying,\u201d Cervai says, referring to the news of Ansett\u2019s collapse after administrators determined it could not be rescued. A former employee of Ansett\u2019s display department, Cervai, who thought the company could do a better job with its merchandise, had negotiated with the company to \u201cbranch out\u201d and start his own business in 1988 to supply the airline with promotional material. He says the week of Ansett\u2019s collapse was one of the worst weeks of his life. \u201cI was always more worried my Ansett business would go down rather than the airline itself.\u201d Unsure of what to do with the hoard of Ansett clothing, gifts, toys and other items he had, with no orders to fill, Cervai received a call a day after Ansett\u2019s collapse from someone offering to buy him out for 20 cents per T-shirt and 30 cents per jumper. \u201cI said, are you serious mate? Pardon my French but you can go and get fucked,\u201d he says. Instead, the semi-retired Cervai decided to start up a website to sell the items. While its sales were quiet in its early years, he says Ansett merchandise is now more popular than ever. \u201cNow it\u2019s selling like hotcakes, it\u2019s hard to believe,\u201d says the 73-year-old, who reports a recent sales spike over the past two years has peaked during the coronavirus lockdowns. He also attributes a part of the surge in sales to the indie pop band Client Liaison, which he supplied with Ansett props for a 2017 music video. He says he can now notice a spike in sales on his website after the band has a concert. After Virgin Australia entered administration in April, Client Liaison started a petition to rebrand the airline Ansett Australia. Cervai now stores the remaining \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Ansett products in a large shed at his home in Mickleham, in Melbourne\u2019s north.

They seemed less intimidated and it offered a more immediate, frequent way to communicate with him, and their families.</p> <p>Becroft praised Oranga Tamariki\u2019s work during lockdown, and said the burden of the Covid-19 crisis has not fallen evenly but \u201chas disproportionately impacted those who were doing it tough beforehand\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBubbles aren\u2019t transparent, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on inside families,\u201d Becroft said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a strong association between poverty and family violence and child abuse and neglect. It is therefore likely, knowing what we do in some of the overseas trends, that as stress from lockdown increased, it\u2019s likely that abuse and neglect will also commensurately increase.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be concerned that abuse and neglect have gone up \u2013 even though I desperately hope that is not the case.\u201d</p> <p>During lockdown around 80 children were taken in care by Oranga Tamariki workers.</p> <p>Moss said her team planned carefully for any removals during the pandemic but: \u201cAt the end of the day we will break a bubble to save a child\u2019s life\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "As hundreds of thousands of children return to classrooms around New Zealand, welfare services are bracing themselves for a spike in reports of abuse and neglect after weeks of \u201cinvisible\u201d lockdown. The country entered lockdown on 25 March and emerged late last week. During lockdown reports of family violence to police dropped, and reports of concern to Oranga Tamariki, the country\u2019s welfare agency for children, fell by around 40%. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of child abuse and neglect in the OECD, and on average one infant is murdered every five weeks. Oranga Tamariki\u2019s chief executive, Gr\u00e1inne Moss, told the Guardian that reports of harm always drop over the school holidays, because the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d that usually identify harm \u2013 education, social and health workers \u2013 aren\u2019t around. But the prolonged nature of lockdown and the added stress of job losses among already strained families was creating \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, Moss said, and rises in family violence overseas are likely to hold true in New Zealand too, though no local research has been conducted yet. \u201cLockdown is a lot longer than the school holidays so we are right to be concerned that there is hidden, invisible harm occurring to children,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI have a serious level of worry about kids that we don\u2019t know about and kids that have never been reported to us and were locked down in situations where there is family violence, troubling dynamics in the house, maybe drugs and alcohol, or mental health problems.\u201d Moss said although Oranga Tamariki was \u201calways busy\u201d (last year there were 15,000 substantiated reports of abuse or neglect against children) she is aware that many children will be returning to school in a worse state than when they left, and teachers, school counsellors and health care workers will be conducting individual \u201cwelfare checks\u201d on children. \u201cSadly, in New Zealand every year is quite busy in terms of child abuse and neglect, [but this year] it\u2019s going to be particularly tough,\u201d Moss said. Moss said many of the tools social workers used to stay in touch with vulnerable children during lockdown \u2013 video and phone apps, craft projects and meal preparation kits delivered to homes as a family bonding activity \u2013 will continue after the Covid-19 crisis because they have proved so effective. She praised police and the large supermarket chains for assisting with welfare monitoring activities, including police providing \u201cspot welfare checks and holistic care\u201d at roadblocks around the country. Children\u2019s Commissioner Judge Andrew Becroft said lockdown also offered him the chance to interact with his clients \u2013 those in state care facilities and juvenile detention \u2013 via video chat, a method he intends to continue because he found it suited the children better. They seemed less intimidated and it offered a more immediate, frequent way to communicate with him, and their families. Becroft praised Oranga Tamariki\u2019s work during lockdown, and said the burden of the Covid-19 crisis has not fallen evenly but \u201chas disproportionately impacted those who were doing it tough beforehand\u201d. \u201cBubbles aren\u2019t transparent, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on inside families,\u201d Becroft said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a strong association between poverty and family violence and child abuse and neglect. It is therefore likely, knowing what we do in some of the overseas trends, that as stress from lockdown increased, it\u2019s likely that abuse and neglect will also commensurately increase.\u201d \u201cWe need to be concerned that abuse and neglect have gone up \u2013 even though I desperately hope that is not the case.\u201d During lockdown around 80 children were taken in care by Oranga Tamariki workers. Moss said her team planned carefully for any removals during the pandemic but: \u201cAt the end of the day we will break a bubble to save a child\u2019s life\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The closure of BuzzFeed News in Australia may have grabbed the headlines last week but the digital startup is just one victim on a growing list of media casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five editorial staff at BuzzFeed have lost their jobs, and on Monday a further 30 editorial job losses were announced due to the closure of the online news site 10 Daily. Across the country hundreds more have been stood down in an already fractured media landscape. It\u2019s unclear how many will ever return to their posts. \u2018Gut-wrenching\u2019 closures In the far north of the country the family-owned Cape and Torres News stopped the presses after 60 years in March when distribution became impossible and advertising dried up. In regional Victoria, locally owned mastheads entering their second century were forced to close as the coronavirus started to devour advertising revenue. Sunraysia Daily was supposed to be celebrating its centenary, but owners Elliott Newspaper Group made the \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d decision to suspend all newspaper publishing operations in Mildura, Swan Hill and Kerang, albeit promising they would come back when the economy recovered. The Public Interest Journalism Initiative is documenting the changes to newsrooms across Australia using a a visualisation tool. The Australian Newsroom Mapping Project aims to track the health of Australia\u2019s news industry and has already counted 157 newsrooms that have closed temporarily or for good since January 2019. \u201cThe crisis is unprecedented and for Australia it\u2019s a triple whammy of ongoing long-term affects of digital platforms, the coronavirus effect, which unfortunately may generate some irreversible changes, and the bushfires had some effect,\u201d Public Interest Journalism Initiative chairman Allan Fels told Guardian Australia. \u201cPublic interest journalism is an important part of our community and our political system. It keeps the public informed; it helps the community keep an eye on what governments, courts and others are doing; it\u2019s an antidote to corruption, malpractice and incompetence in management of the public sector and whistleblowing in the private sector.\u201d Advertising hits Some of the carnage predates the coronavirus, namely the bombshell announcement in early March that news agency Australian Associated Press and its 200 journalists and 100 photojournalists, who provide a daily staple of news, was to be shut down by major shareholders Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia. The staff have been suffering months of uncertainty after the company embarked on 11th hour talks with unexpected offers, and the fate of the 85-year-old agency due to shut next month is still unknown. The effects of an advertising industry badly hit by the coronavirus have not spared the biggest media companies. The country\u2019s two regional and community newspaper giants, Australian Community Media and News Corp Australia, have suspended printing dozens of non-daily publications and laid off or stood down hundreds of staff. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire chose to suspend printing 60 of its local newspapers including the Wentworth Courier and the Mosman and the Manly dailies in New South Wales and the Preston Leader and the Stonnington Leader in Melbourne. News Corp did not rule out redundancies at the suspended titles across NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. A report in The Australian on Monday said \u201cmany suspended community titles are likely to continue as digital-only\u201d and revealed that the company is realigning itself as a \u201cdigital publisher of high-quality journalism\u201d, suggesting the printed product at News Corp is winding down. At Murdoch\u2019s metropolitan mastheads \u2013 which include the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun \u2013 there has been forced leave, part-time work and nine-day fortnights. Michael Miller, the company\u2019s executive chairman, told staff \u201cfalling business confidence is impacting the advertising revenues of all media businesses\u201d. Layoffs come as audiences surge In magazines the picture is similarly bleak. Bauer Media has thrown 200 staff into unemployment and shut down seven fashion, lifestyle and celebrity magazines, a move which has been described as having ripped the heart out of the industry. Some of the losses are not public yet. Guardian Australia can reveal Nine is undergoing a fresh round of redundancies at the Sydney Morning Herald, mainly on sections which stopped printing due to the coronavirus. The company declined to comment but sources say there are eight jobs losses, four directly attributable to the coronavirus. The ABC, bracing for budget cuts to be announced after June, has quietly laid off a huge chunk of its casual workforce with one week\u2019s notice, Guardian Australia understands. The casuals work across news and current affairs in TV news and radio programs and some have been working five days a week on six-month contracts. The regional papers that have survived the recent massacre and are still printing have nonetheless suffered serious declines in readership in the past year. Readership of News Corp\u2019s NT News is down 38.5% in the past 12 months to March 2020. Readership of Australian Community Media\u2019s Newcastle Herald and Launceston Examiner are both down more than 14%. The only stable publication in the category over the past year has been the Canberra Times, according to Roy Morgan readership data released this week. All of this media pain has come at a time when readers and viewers have flocked to news, with the top 10 news websites up by 54% on the previous four weeks at the end of March due to coronavirus news. A University of Canberra study found that news consumption had increased during the pandemic, with 70% of respondents saying they were accessing news at least once a day, compared to 56% in 2019. The news industry was under enormous strain coming into 2020 but the coronavirus has accelerated its decline. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance president Paul Murphy says the coronavirus \u201cbrought to a head the underlying crisis in the industry\u201d driven by the decline in the share of advertising for news companies in Australia. \u201cThe government has finally put in place that $50m regional fund recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last year,\u201d Murphy told Guardian Australia. \u201cI think most major media organisations are reporting bigger audiences and people are relying on trusted news sources \u2013 but the revenue just doesn\u2019t follow. \u201cThe two biggest holes are if nothing replaces AAP and finding a way to address the growing local and regional news deserts.\u201d Hope for \u2018tangible results\u2019 The industry is putting a lot of faith in the work on a mandatory code that will force the digital platforms such as Google and Facebook to compensate news media companies for using their content. The ACCC made the recommendation in the digital platforms report in mid-2019. A few weeks after its chairman Rod Sims warned that reform was \u201curgent\u201d because media companies were in great difficulty, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, instructed him to develop a mandatory code of conduct for the digital giants. Murphy says the state of journalism after the coronavirus is \u201cin the hands of the government and the ACCC to a great extent\u201d. \u201cThere has to be a way found to make these digital platforms pay for the content they\u2019re carrying,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re just going to continue seeing decline. I mean obviously there are other policy tools the government can use like tax concessions.\u201d Fels, a former regulator himself, is optimistic. \u201cI believe the mandatory code will lead to tangible results and if it doesn\u2019t the government will apply other pressure to Google and Facebook such as a tax on their revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cBroadly I am impressed with the measures the government has put in place already and the focus has mainly been on regional and suburban media. Of course we think it should be more but it is substantial.\u201d Murphy says no one can be sure in what form the suspended mastheads at ACM and News Corp will return. \u201cYears of redundancies and cost-cutting hollowed out those newspapers.\u201d \u201cIt depends on how the advertising market rebounds,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cPrint comes with considerable cost and if the advertising revenue is not there it may well accelerate the move to only publishing online.\u201d",

You are also allowed to gather in public spaces, like parks, with up to 10 other people. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Victoria </strong>\u2013 Unclear*. Legislation suggests that you would only be allowed in a park for the purpose of exercise, but on 1 April Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton told ABC radio that he thought sitting in a park alone was an acceptable activity as it posed little risk of spreading infection. Guardian Australia has requested clarification from Victoria police and the premier\u2019s office.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>Yes, <strong> </strong>as of Friday 1 May people are allowed to leave the home for recreational activities. This means you are<strong> </strong>allowed to sit in a park even if you aren\u2019t exercising. You can do this alone, with up to 10 guests<strong> </strong> or with all the members of your household.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Tasmania </strong>\u2013 Technically no*, Tasmanian residents are only allowed to leave the house for essential reasons. The essential reasons include exercise, however, sitting in a park for recreational reasons is not allowed.

      "bodyText": "Australia is well into its second month of Covid-19 lockdowns and every state enforcing physical distancing laws slightly differently. Politicians have said these rules are simple, but it is clear the public still has a lot of questions about coronavirus lockdown rules and restrictions. In most states enforcement is left up to police officers\u2019 discretion, therefore it is difficult to provide exact information on what is or isn\u2019t allowed. Here we try to answer some of the most common questions people have about the new laws based on the information, though these answers should not be treated as legal advice. An asterisk indicates Guardian Australia has sought clarification from the state or territory government and will update when it is received. Can I sit in a park alone? New South Wales \u2013 Yes. According to the NSW government\u2019s website, as of 15 May you can go to a park for recreational purposes, such as to have a picnic. You are also allowed to gather in public spaces, like parks, with up to 10 other people. Victoria \u2013 Unclear*. Legislation suggests that you would only be allowed in a park for the purpose of exercise, but on 1 April Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton told ABC radio that he thought sitting in a park alone was an acceptable activity as it posed little risk of spreading infection. Guardian Australia has requested clarification from Victoria police and the premier\u2019s office. Queensland \u2013 Yes, as of Friday 1 May people are allowed to leave the home for recreational activities. This means you are allowed to sit in a park even if you aren\u2019t exercising. You can do this alone, with up to 10 guests or with all the members of your household. Tasmania \u2013 Technically no*, Tasmanian residents are only allowed to leave the house for essential reasons. The essential reasons include exercise, however, sitting in a park for recreational reasons is not allowed. But a spokeswoman for Tasmania police said they are unaware of anyone being charged or summonsed in relation to sitting in parks so far. Australian Capital Territory \u2013 As of 8 May, ACT residents are allowed to gather in groups of up to 10 people indoors and outdoors, and have picnics. Therefore, it is likely to be OK to sit in a park by yourself, or with others, as long as you are observing responsible physical distancing. Western Australia \u2013 Yes, you are allowed to leave the home for recreational reasons, and are now allowed to meet with up to 20 people. However, you are not permitted to travel restricted to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. South Australia and Northern Territory \u2013 Yes. There are currently no fines for leaving the house for non-essential reasons, however unnecessary socialisation is discouraged. In SA gatherings are limited to 10. Can I visit my romantic partner if we don\u2019t live together?

As of Friday 15 May, up to five people are allowed to visit another person\u2019s home in NSW. Victoria \u2013 Yes. Up to five people are allowed to visit another\u2019s person\u2019s home in Victoria. .

ACT \u2013 There are no official limits, however people are encouraged to avoid unnecessary travel, and where possible avoid areas where they are likely to come into close contact with others.

SA \u2013 Yes, as long as there are a maximum of 10 people at the gathering, however unnecessary social interaction is discouraged. NT \u2013 Yes, however unnecessary social interaction is discouraged and physical distancing should be observed. All states currently allow you to leave the home and meet up with one person to do exercise. This means you are allowed to meet a family member in public to exercise with them. There are limits on how far you can travel for exercise, however see above. My kids live part-time with me and my partner. Are they still allowed to travel between homes? Yes. Currently all states allow you to uphold current shared parental agreements. This means you are allowed to drive your children to their other parent or carer\u2019s residence, and they are allowed to visit your residence to pick children up. Am I allowed to leave home if it\u2019s an emergency or required by law? Yes. All states allow you to leave your home if you are legally required to do so. You are allowed to flee violence, and you are allowed to leave if your house becomes uninhabitable. Can I have social guests if I live alone? All Australians have been urged to avoid unnecessary socialisation. NSW \u2013 Up to five adults and the children in their care are now allowed to visit another person\u2019s home. You are still not allowed to travel to regional Australia to visit friends. Victoria \u2013 As of Tuesday 12 May, up to five people can visit your home. But the government still says you should only see friends and family \u201cif you really need to\u201d. There will be no restriction on how far someone can travel for recreational visits. Queensland \u2013 Yes, up to five adults can visit another household, but should still keep a 1.5 metre distance from one another. Guests can be from different households. You will be allowed to travel up to 150km from your home for recreational purposes, but must not enter the outback. Those who live in rural Australia can, however, travel up to 500km within the outback and stay away from their home overnight. Tasmania \u2013 Yes, this falls under \u201csocial support\u201d, however only two visitors are allowed at a time and must be mindful of social distancing and avoiding unnecessary travel. ACT \u2013 Yes, but only 10 people are allowed to gather in a household and should respect physical distancing. WA \u2013 Yes, gatherings must be limited to 20 people, there must be 4 square matters of space per person, and physical distancing should be maintained. SA\u2013 Yes, but gatherings must be limited to 10. NT \u2013 Yes, but physical distancing must be observed. Can I get a coffee with a friend? NSW \u2013 Yes. From 15 May, up to 10 people are allowed to dine-in at a cafe or restaurant, as long as there are at least four sq metres per person. Queensland \u2013 Yes, as of Friday 1 May, people are allowed to leave the house for some recreational activities, including getting a takeaway coffee with one friend or the members of your household. Cafes in regional and rural areas with no cases are allowed to seat up to 20 people, as of Friday 16 May. Victoria and Tasmania \u2013 Yes, but only if it is takeaway and you have met a friend for the purpose of exercising. From midnight on 12 May in Victoria, you can go and have coffee at another person\u2019s home, though the state government says you should only visit other people \u201cif you really need to\u201d. ACT, SA\u2013 Yes, as long as it is takeaway. WA \u2013 Yes, as of Monday 18 May, cafes and restaurants are allowed to seat up to 20 diners as long as they follow the four sq metres per person rule. NT \u2013 Yes, as long as it is takeaway. Cafes and restaurants will be allowed to reopen from Friday 15 May. Can I give someone a lift to work, even if they don\u2019t live with me? NSW \u2013 Yes, you can drive a colleague to work with you, however, it is unclear if you can leave the house to drive someone to their job if you do not also work there. If they cannot drive themselves this is likely covered under \u201ccare\u201d.* You can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household. Victoria and Queensland \u2013 Yes, you can drive a colleague to work with you. Driving someone else to work if they cannot drive themselves likely falls under \u201cproviding care and support\u201d. You can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household. Tasmania \u2013 Yes, but there must be an essential reason for all passengers to be travelling in the vehicle. ACT \u2013 Yes, but you can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household. It is encouraged you create as much distance between you and your passenger as possible, such as having them sit in the back seat. WA \u2013 Yes, but you can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household. You may require a letter from your work if you wish to cross into the four restricted remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. SA And NT \u2013 Yes. Can a tradesperson still come into my house to do work? Yes, however only if it is for essential works. If it can wait, it should. Physical distancing practices should be observed. Can I still learn to drive? NSW \u2013 Yes. NSW Police posted on Facebook in April that they \u201cconsider that it would be a reasonable excuse for a person to leave their house to receive driving lessons (either from a driving instructor or a member of their family), given that it is a learning activity that cannot be done from home \u2026 \u201d They also said that learner drivers could drive with a supervising family member under one of the reasonable excuses for leaving the house, such as going to the supermarket. Queensland \u2013 You can learn to drive if your instructor is in your household. You are allowed to drive around your local neighbourhoods to gain hours, or anywhere if travelling for an essential reason. If they are caught doing otherwise, they face a $1300 fine from police. Victoria \u2013 A teenager was fined for learning to drive in early April, but Victoria police have since withdrawn the fine. Deputy commissioner Shane Patton said in early April that, nonetheless, getting driving practice for the sole reason of accruing hours \u201cis not an essential activity \u2026 [except] when driving to purchase food or supplies, or when travelling to work or education\u201d. Western Australia \u2013 A Department of Transport spokesperson has previously said that \u201clearners and supervisors are encouraged to assess their need to continue to practise driving at this time\u201d, and encouraged drivers to have a supervisor from their household. From Monday 18 May, you are only limited from travelling to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. SA \u2013 No specific advice. But there are no restrictions on travel within South Australia. Tasmania \u2013 Driving lessons are considered a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for leaving home, and lessons with an instructor are exempt from the 1.5 metre social distancing rule, meaning trainers can sit in the front seat. Learner drivers should stick to their local area, though. NT, ACT \u2013 No specific advice. Who decides if I am breaking the new laws? Generally, enforcement will be left up to the discretion of police officers. States have expressed different approaches, for example, the ACT says it will be issuing a warning in the first instance, while Victoria has adopted a more hardline attitude to those break social distancing rules. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said he would personally review all physical-distancing fines issued in the state. \u201cIf I think it\u2019s unreasonable, it will be withdrawn immediately and we\u2019ll make personal contact with the individual,\u201d he said. What are my options for challenging a fine? Not all states have specified this, however, it appears these fines can be appealed using the same process as other fines issued by police. Information on how to lodge an appeal should be available on your state or territory\u2019s government website.

But it urges the global health community to:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the paper argues the response to the pandemic must be global.

When Australia first proposed a global inquiry last month, China said it was \u201cseriously concerned about and firmly opposed to this\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince the outbreak began, China has always acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner and taken a series of resolute, timely and forceful measures,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang then said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/let-taiwan-help-the-who-fight-covid-19\">Let Taiwan help the WHO fight Covid-19 | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia led the charge publicly with calls for an inquiry that has now gathered the support of 62 countries, but it has come at the expense of further strain in Australia-China relations.

      "bodyText": "What is the World Health Assembly? The World Health Assembly is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, attended by representatives of the United Nation\u2019s 194 member states. The two-day 2020 assembly will be held virtually \u2013 it usually happens in Geneva \u2013 because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis around the world. This year\u2019s assembly, the 73rd WHA, will be dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. This will be a critical assembly: the annual meeting comes at a time when the WHO has attracted unprecedented global attention for its coordination and advisory role during the pandemic. Influential states, most notably the US, have criticised the WHO for being slow to react, and alleged it has been biased towards China. The US has withheld funding from the WHO in response to its perceived Covid-19 failings. What is the proposal for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, and which countries are behind it? A key conference paper, already filed ahead of the assembly, and supported by 122 countries, including the members of the European Union and the African Group, the UK, Russia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, calls for a systemic review of the world\u2019s response to Covid-19. Initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with member states, a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation ... to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19. The draft motion does not mention China or Wuhan (the city where the virus was first detected) by name. But it urges the global health community to: ... identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions. And the paper argues the response to the pandemic must be global. The motion: \u2026 calls for the universal, timely and equitable access to and fair distribution of all quality, safe, efficacious and affordable essential health technologies and products including their components and precursors required in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic as a global priority. And China\u2019s position? Calls for an independent international investigation into the origins of Covid-19 have been viewed by Beijing as an attempt to blame it for the disease emerging and breaking out globally. When Australia first proposed a global inquiry last month, China said it was \u201cseriously concerned about and firmly opposed to this\u201d. \u201cSince the outbreak began, China has always acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner and taken a series of resolute, timely and forceful measures,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang then said. Australia led the charge publicly with calls for an inquiry that has now gathered the support of 62 countries, but it has come at the expense of further strain in Australia-China relations. Beijing has proposed massive tariffs on Australian barley and blocked some Australia meat imports, moves condemned by Canberra as attempts at economic coercion. But with growing international support for an inquiry, China\u2019s language has softened considerably. The foreign ministry argued the European Union-drafted motion to be dealt with at the World Health Assembly should be viewed in a different light from Australia\u2019s initial proposal. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press briefing last week. \u201cYou should not view them together from a political angle.\u201d Will Taiwan be a key issue? The presence of Taiwan at the meeting is likely to prove a divisive issue, and there is significant risk that valuable time \u2013 the meeting is strictly limited to two days \u2013 could be lost in the machinations of whether representatives of the Taipei government will be allowed in the meeting. Taiwan\u2019s administration was the first government in the world to deploy preventative measures to guard against the spread of Sars-Cov2 virus, and the island has been held up as global success story: it had only 440 cases and seven deaths, despite being just 180km from the Chinese mainland, where the pandemic began. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room. Besides the input from Taiwan as a country that has successfully combated Covid-19, the US push for its inclusion is part of a broader struggle between Washington and Beijing for influence within the WHO. Member states will vote on Taiwan\u2019s admittance to the assembly. A unanimous affirmation is required, and it appears increasingly like China will block Taiwan\u2019s admittance. Since the election of the pro-independence president, Tsai Ing-wen, in 2016, China has routinely vetoed Taiwan\u2019s inclusion into UN bodies. Taiwan participated in the WHA as an observer from 2009 to 2016, when the Beijing-friendly president, Ma Ying-jeou, was in office, but has not been invited since. What are the other issues up for debate? This will be an intensely political WHA \u2013 a meeting that often passes with little public commentary \u2013 because of the continuing Covid-19 crisis around the world, and the varying capabilities of government responses. The role of the World Health Organisation itself, and its response to the pandemic, will also be under extreme scrutiny, following accusations from the US, Australia and Germany, among others, that it was slow to respond to the initial outbreak and has displayed a bias towards China. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has weathered much of the criticism, in particular from the US president, Donald Trump, who said the organisation was \u201cvery China-centric\u201d and had given the US a \u201cfaulty recommendation\u201d about keeping its borders open. The WHO has been criticised for its response to pandemics before. In 2009, it declared the H1N1 flu outbreak as a pandemic, a decision later criticised by some governments that argued it triggered countries to take expensive measures against a disease that was ultimately milder than forecast. The agency and its then director general, Margaret Chan, also faced sharp criticism for not reacting fast enough to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in December 2013. The 2020 WHA will also address a global vaccine action plan, neglected tropical diseases, and polio eradication. with Reuters",

His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight.</p> <p>Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects.</p> <p>Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby.</p> <p>The Greek capital is embarking on one of the most ambitious rejuvenation schemes, which has been hastened by the pandemic, according to its mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis. He announced plans last week to allocate 50,000 square metres of public space for cyclists and pedestrians.</p> <p>At the heart of the scheme will be a four-mile \u201cgrand walkway\u201d uniting archaeological sites in the historic centre. Pavements will be widened, boulevards pedestrianised, squares enlarged and traffic banned from areas beneath the Acropolis. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9a0fdf660a2f0f455fcb666757e3f9565eb80a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9a0fdf660a2f0f455fcb666757e3f9565eb80a/0_178_5324_3195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cyclist rides down a deserted street in central Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cyclist rides down a deserted street in central Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bakoyannis, who became Athens\u2019 youngest mayor last year, openly admits that the pandemic played a role in accelerating infrastructure works that might have taken years to accomplish.</p> <p>\u201cWe have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are fast-forwarding all our public works,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to liberate public space from cars and give it to people who want to walk and enjoy the city \u2026 Athens will be cleaner, greener and better lit.\u201d</p> <p>In Budapest, 12 miles of temporary bike lanes have been introduced on some of the city\u2019s busiest roads over the past month.</p> <p>The city\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, who was elected last year on a largely green platform, had little trouble introducing the lanes after many people expressed their discomfort at the prospect of depending on the city\u2019s excellent but usually packed public transport system during the pandemic. </p> <p>The mayor\u2019s office said it was monitoring traffic levels and that some of the temporary lanes may remain once life gets back to normal. It is planning a public consultation over where and how to introduce more bike lanes in the future.</p> <p>Around 20 miles of temporary bike lanes have been set up across Paris, much to the disgruntlement of car lobbyists who have protested to city hall that their rights are being squeezed. Main roads such as the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Antoine, a major east-west route, are gradually being sealed off to private vehicles and there are proposals for a further 30 miles of bike lanes in the city.</p> <p>Many Parisians <a href=\"https://coupdepoucevelo.fr/auth/home\">are being offered \u20ac50</a> toward getting old bikes repaired as part of the French capital\u2019s \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) <em>planv\u00e9lo</em> to encourage the use of bicycles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d1b6c53ef2e2b20043c33763f952c1cddfdb2be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1b6c53ef2e2b20043c33763f952c1cddfdb2be/0_123_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those supporting the new push for bike travel point to recent studies, one of which showed the average journey by vehicle in Paris to is 2.5 miles \u2013 a comfortable distance by bike for most \u2013 and another indicating that the lack of exhaust fumes during lockdown has dramatically improved air quality in the city.</p> <p>The city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had made persuading people to abandon private cars in favour of bikes one of the pillars of her political programme even before she was elected mayor in 2014. Despite the car lobby\u2019s hopes that motorised vehicles can reclaim the city once the virus is under control, Hidalgo has said it is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollution.</p> <p>Dublin city council has set aside swathes of Ireland\u2019s capital for pedestrians and cyclists to facilitate physical distancing in a \u201ctemporary mobility plan\u201d that may become permanent. Authorities singled out College Green, which abuts Trinity College, and other parts of the city centre for what promises to be a bold transformation. </p> <p>The idea is to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to navigate the city when shops and other businesses reopen in a 12 to 18-month respite from traffic-choked streets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f49ab5587b7a2ee4080e34f09bde71c2a9ce354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f49ab5587b7a2ee4080e34f09bde71c2a9ce354/0_7_3217_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Dublin\u2019s temporary bike lanes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Dublin\u2019s temporary bike lanes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Authorities in Milan, among the most polluted cities in Europe, have said 22 miles of streets will be transformed over the summer as part of a scheme to reallocate space from cars to cycling and walking. Congestion in Milan, which is usually clogged with traffic, has fallen between 30 and 70% during the lockdown, and air pollution with it.</p> <p>Rome\u2019s council has approved the construction of 93 miles of temporary and permanent cycle routes as a way to be more sustainable while allowing people to adhere to physical distancing rules. As part of the government\u2019s economic decree, people in towns and cities with populations of 50,000 or more will also be able to claim up to \u20ac500 toward the cost of a new bike. The payment also applies to scooters, electric bikes and Segways.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Tour de France victory by the Colombian Egan Bernal precipitated a cycling boom in Bogot\u00e1.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Athens has said he will \u201cliberate\u201d public space from cars. His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight. Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects. Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby. The Greek capital is embarking on one of the most ambitious rejuvenation schemes, which has been hastened by the pandemic, according to its mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis. He announced plans last week to allocate 50,000 square metres of public space for cyclists and pedestrians. At the heart of the scheme will be a four-mile \u201cgrand walkway\u201d uniting archaeological sites in the historic centre. Pavements will be widened, boulevards pedestrianised, squares enlarged and traffic banned from areas beneath the Acropolis. Bakoyannis, who became Athens\u2019 youngest mayor last year, openly admits that the pandemic played a role in accelerating infrastructure works that might have taken years to accomplish. \u201cWe have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are fast-forwarding all our public works,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to liberate public space from cars and give it to people who want to walk and enjoy the city \u2026 Athens will be cleaner, greener and better lit.\u201d In Budapest, 12 miles of temporary bike lanes have been introduced on some of the city\u2019s busiest roads over the past month. The city\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, who was elected last year on a largely green platform, had little trouble introducing the lanes after many people expressed their discomfort at the prospect of depending on the city\u2019s excellent but usually packed public transport system during the pandemic. The mayor\u2019s office said it was monitoring traffic levels and that some of the temporary lanes may remain once life gets back to normal. It is planning a public consultation over where and how to introduce more bike lanes in the future. Around 20 miles of temporary bike lanes have been set up across Paris, much to the disgruntlement of car lobbyists who have protested to city hall that their rights are being squeezed. Main roads such as the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Antoine, a major east-west route, are gradually being sealed off to private vehicles and there are proposals for a further 30 miles of bike lanes in the city. Many Parisians are being offered \u20ac50 toward getting old bikes repaired as part of the French capital\u2019s \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) planv\u00e9lo to encourage the use of bicycles. Those supporting the new push for bike travel point to recent studies, one of which showed the average journey by vehicle in Paris to is 2.5 miles \u2013 a comfortable distance by bike for most \u2013 and another indicating that the lack of exhaust fumes during lockdown has dramatically improved air quality in the city. The city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had made persuading people to abandon private cars in favour of bikes one of the pillars of her political programme even before she was elected mayor in 2014. Despite the car lobby\u2019s hopes that motorised vehicles can reclaim the city once the virus is under control, Hidalgo has said it is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollution. Dublin city council has set aside swathes of Ireland\u2019s capital for pedestrians and cyclists to facilitate physical distancing in a \u201ctemporary mobility plan\u201d that may become permanent. Authorities singled out College Green, which abuts Trinity College, and other parts of the city centre for what promises to be a bold transformation. The idea is to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to navigate the city when shops and other businesses reopen in a 12 to 18-month respite from traffic-choked streets. Authorities in Milan, among the most polluted cities in Europe, have said 22 miles of streets will be transformed over the summer as part of a scheme to reallocate space from cars to cycling and walking. Congestion in Milan, which is usually clogged with traffic, has fallen between 30 and 70% during the lockdown, and air pollution with it. Rome\u2019s council has approved the construction of 93 miles of temporary and permanent cycle routes as a way to be more sustainable while allowing people to adhere to physical distancing rules. As part of the government\u2019s economic decree, people in towns and cities with populations of 50,000 or more will also be able to claim up to \u20ac500 toward the cost of a new bike. The payment also applies to scooters, electric bikes and Segways. Last year\u2019s Tour de France victory by the Colombian Egan Bernal precipitated a cycling boom in Bogot\u00e1. Hundreds of miles of public highways are closed to cars on Sundays, allowing cyclists to take to the roads free of exhaust fumes and the blare of car horns. This enthusiasm has made it easier for the mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, herself a keen cyclist, to introduce more bike lanes as part of plans to reduce public transport use to 35% of capacity in the country\u2019s effort to tackle the pandemic. Fifty miles of new bike paths were announced last week, on top of the 300 already in place. Announcing that 7,000 people were using the bike paths in the working-class south of the city, Bogota\u2019s transport secretary, Nicol\u00e1s Estupi\u00f1an, tweeted: \u201cEvery day more Bogotanos are getting on, and staying on, their bikes!\u201d Similar developments are taking place from Brussels to Sydney, while transport officials in many US cities report an \u201cexplosion in cycling\u201d. From \u201cslow streets\u201d programmes in California to the progressive closure of many streets in New York, some cities have said they plan to make the changes permanent. In Berlin it can take up to a decade to create a new bike lane, but during the coronavirus crisis, 14 miles of pop-up bike lanes, separated from car lanes by traffic beacons, have been introduced in anything from three to 10 days. Most will be here to stay, city officials have said, arguing that increasing numbers of Berliners \u2013 at the last count 43% \u2013 have no car, and that bikes will help lessen the burden on public transport. The ADAC, Germany\u2019s automobile association, has been highly critical of what it has called officials\u2019 \u201cexploitation of an emergency\u201d, which has been taking place in cities across the country. \u201cThe temporary reduction in car traffic, and incidentally bike usage as well, cannot be used to enforce the permanent reallocation of traffic space,\u201d Volker Krane, of the ADAC, told German media.

Rwasa has been able to open offices and hold large rallies around the country in what has been an unexpectedly competitive campaign.</p> <p>Nelleke van de Walle of the International Crisis Group, a research organisation, said: \u201cYou do see certain elements of a real election \u2026 but political space is really limited. There is almost no local or international media left. This is definitely not an election where people can express their opinions freely.\u201d</p> <p>Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were senior commanders in predominantly Hutu militias during a civil war in which about 300,000 people were killed. Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal.</p> <p>Ndayishimiye has promised to \u201cfight poverty and develop the country\u201d, claiming his party had taken 15 years to \u201clay the foundations\u201d for the future, and it was not the time to put \u201camateurs\u201d in power.</p> <p>Voters who spoke to journalists in Burundi last week were too fearful to give their names.

      "bodyText": "Millions of voters in Burundi will go to the polls on Wednesday to elect a new president in the first competitive election since a decade-long civil war began in 1993. Amid concern that authorities are deliberately playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic, seven candidates are seeking to replace the incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza, who is being forced to step down by opponents within the country\u2019s ruling CNDD-FDD party. Rights groups say the government is pressing ahead with the vote irresponsibly, and accuse the CNDD-FDD and its youth wing of crushing dissent and threatening those taking their own measures against coronavirus. Last week Burundi expelled the World Health Organization\u2019s expert team working on coronavirus. Campaigning politicians have held rallies attended by tens of thousands. The nation of 11 million people has reported 27 cases of Covid-19 so far but has only carried out about 520 tests in total. Officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear. Nkurunziza\u2019s spokesperson recently said that though the country may be hit by the pandemic, \u201cBurundi \u2026 has signed a special covenant with God, whether you believe it or not\u201d. Evariste Ndayishimiye, the CNDD-FDD\u2019s candidate, said people should not be afraid because \u201cGod loves Burundi\u201d, adding that if there were people who had tested positive, it was \u201cso that God may manifest his power in Burundi\u201d. Six other candidates are running, including the opposition leader Agathon Rwasa, who is deputy chairman of the national assembly. Rwasa has been able to open offices and hold large rallies around the country in what has been an unexpectedly competitive campaign. Nelleke van de Walle of the International Crisis Group, a research organisation, said: \u201cYou do see certain elements of a real election \u2026 but political space is really limited. There is almost no local or international media left. This is definitely not an election where people can express their opinions freely.\u201d Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were senior commanders in predominantly Hutu militias during a civil war in which about 300,000 people were killed. Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal. Ndayishimiye has promised to \u201cfight poverty and develop the country\u201d, claiming his party had taken 15 years to \u201clay the foundations\u201d for the future, and it was not the time to put \u201camateurs\u201d in power. Voters who spoke to journalists in Burundi last week were too fearful to give their names. A 45-year-old vegetable seller in the capital, Bujumbura, supported the ruling party because it had provided welfare. \u201cThey give us rice and beans and can build houses for the most vulnerable among us like elders or widows,\u201d she said. But a jobless 32-year-old supported the opposition. \u201cAll of us need change, many Burundians need \u2026 one to end this daily violence, these killings, this rampant corruption and economic embezzlement,\u201d he said. Medics and others have braved official threats to raise concerns that the true number of Covid-19 cases is much higher than the official count. A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital. A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients \u201cpresenting all the symptoms of coronavirus\u201d last week. Six staff responsible for taking samples at the National Institute of Public Health, the only place in Burundi that was carrying out tests, have become ill with the virus. \u201cSince then all activity is paralysed, no test can be carried out, it is a catastrophe,\u201d an employee of the institute said. The country\u2019s last election in 2015 led to violence that left at least 1,200 dead, displaced hundreds of thousands and resulted in a sustained crackdown on the opposition and media. Aid was cut off by donors and sanctions imposed. Last year the government shut down the UN human rights office after repeated criticism that members of the CNDD-FDD\u2019s youth wing and the security services were torturing, gang-raping and murdering political opponents. Rights groups say those attacks have increased in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s presidential, legislative and municipal elections. Nkurunziza will remain president until August, and a new constitution has given him sweeping powers to declare a state of emergency if the results are disputed. \u201cA perfect storm is brewing in Burundi, but after years of repression, few are left to bear witness and sound the alarm,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Burundi is one the poorest country in the world, by some measures. \u201cThe economic record of Nkurunziza\u2019s 15 years in power is catastrophic. He has taken Burundi backward on all levels, he has completely isolated the country from its traditional donors and even neighbouring countries. It is a calamity,\u201d said Aime Magera, an exiled spokesman for the main opposition National Freedom Council.",

The cathedral said it had introduced gadgets worn around the neck that beep softly, flash and vibrate if visitors approach too closely to one another. Elsewhere in Europe, death tolls dropped in the UK and Spain, offering a glimmer of hope. Britain recorded 170 deaths, and Spain reported 87. Italy also recorded its lowest daily toll since the lockdown began \u2013 145. South Africa has reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d a statement from the health ministry said. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the 15,515 infections nationally. There have been 264 deaths. The country has been under a lockdown since 27 March, including strict confinement rules and a ban on sales of cigarettes and alcohol. In other coronavirus developments: Global infections stood at 4,713,620, with 315,185 deaths recorded. The US leads both categories, with deaths fast approaching 90,000. The World Health Assembly is due to begin a virtual meeting dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the assembly China reported seven new coronavirus cases for 17 May, up from five a day earlier. The country also reported 18 new asymptomatic cases, up from 12 the day before. Mexico registered 49,219 cases of coronavirus on Sunday, with the country\u2019s death toll rising to 5,177, health authorities said. Mexico has seen a slightly higher death rate from coronavirus than the global average so far due to the widespread presence of pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, experts say.",

      "body": "<p>Since the pandemic was declared all Australian states have gone into various levels of lockdown.</p> \n<p>Now that the country is cautiously optimistic that the curve has been flattened, the big question is how and when we will come out of isolation?</p> \n<p>On Friday 8 May, the federal government announced a three-stage plan to ease coronavirus restrictions across the country, with the goal of reaching stage three by July. Ultimately, though, it is up to each state and territory to decide when and how far they would be relaxing restrictions in the coming months.</p> \n<p>The states and territories have already announced their plans in response.</p> \n<p>While some, like WA, are significantly easing restrictions, others are taking a slower approach.</p> \n<p>So what are the laws as they currently stand?</p> \n<p>These are the laws as of Friday 15 May.<strong> </strong>This article will be updated as new restrictions are implemented or repealed.</p> \n<h2>Queensland</h2> \n<p>Under the current regulations in Queensland, up to five adults from different<strong> </strong>households are allowed to visit another home. These rules come under the first stage of the state government\u2019s three-stage plan to ease restrictions.</p> \n<p>Queenslanders are now<strong> </strong>allowed to shop for non-essential items. Picnics and weekend drives are allowed and national parks have reopened. Residents are now allowed to travel up to 150km from your home for recreational purposes, but cannot enter the \u201cOutback\u201d unless they live there.</p> \n<p>Those who live in Outback Queensland, <a href=\"https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/government-actions/outback-queensland\">defined here</a>, can travel up to 500km within the Outback for recreational reasons, and can stay for multiple nights away from their place of residence given how far they may be travelling.</p> \n<p>As of 3 April, interstate travel is still closed to everyone except residents and essential workers, including freight carriers and emergency workers. Barriers are still erected in the<strong> </strong>Gold Coast suburb of Coolangatta, which straddles both Queensland and NSW. There are some exemptions for those who regularly cross the Queensland-NSW border for work.</p> \n<p>Up to 10 people can gather outside. This means that groups of 10 or less can engage in outdoor non-contact sport, group training and boot camps, and picnics. Queenslanders can also go to the park, playground, skatepark, or national park for recreational purposes.</p> \n<p>Weddings are<strong> </strong>allowed 10 guests, and funerals 20 guests indoors and 30 outdoors.</p> \n<p>Beauty salons can<strong> </strong>open back up, and pubs and cafes in regional or rural areas with no cases are<strong> </strong>able to seat up to 20 people. Open homes will also be allowed.</p> \n<p>The second stage of relaxing restrictions will start on 12 June, and see gatherings of up to 20 people; indoor cinemas, entertainment venues and amusement parks reopening; and greater recreational travel distances allowed.</p> \n<p>Stage three will start on 10 July. While premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said<strong> </strong>details are \u201csubject to further planning and review\u201d, intrastate and interstate travel will be permitted, and a maximum of 100 people allowed to gather in homes, public spaces, and other venues including cinemas, places of worship, and restaurants.</p> \n<p>Queensland police officers are still able to issue on-the-spot fines of $1,334.50 for individuals and $6,672.50 for corporations who breach these laws. The maximum penalties available through the courts are 10 times those amounts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>New South Wales</h2> \n<p> As of Friday 15 May,<strong> </strong>up to five<strong> </strong>adults are allowed to visit another person\u2019s home in NSW. There is no limit the number of guests someone is allowed per day as long as there are no more than five<strong> </strong>at a time.</p> \n<p>There is no limit on how far someone can travel to visit another household under this rule. But you are still not allowed to travel to regional or rural areas for a holiday. </p> \n<p> From Friday, public gatherings of up to 10 people, or members of the same household, are also<strong> </strong>allowed. Outdoor playground and exercise equipment can also now be used, with caution, and outdoor pools are open.</p> \n<p>Berejiklian has encouraged retail stores to reopen, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Cafes, restaurants and pubs can seat 10 diners at any one time, as long as they allow for four square metres per person. They must also ensure there are 1.5 metres between patrons.</p> \n<p>Weddings can now have up to 10 guests, in addition to those conducting the service, a photographer, a videographer and the couple. Up to 20 mourners can attend indoor funerals, and outdoor funerals can have up to 30.</p> \n<p>Religious gatherings and places of worship can also invite up to 10 worshippers inside at a time.</p> \n<p>Movement is also allowed for the purpose of moving into a new home or inspecting a potential new home, providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person or in an emergency, and undertaking legal obligations, accessing government services, or donating blood. Exemptions also exist for priests or members of religious orders, and where someone is escaping potential injury, illness or harm.</p> \n<p>People who are learning to drive can continue to learn to drive and get their hours logged.</p> \n<p>Children who live across two households can continue to switch between houses.</p> \n<p>Police have been out on the streets enforcing these rules.</p> \n<p>It has been left to police officers\u2019 discretion who will receive a fine, however all fines are reviewed personally by the police commissioner, Mick Fuller.</p> \n<h2>Victoria</h2> \n<p>Currently, residents can only leave the house for one of five essential reasons. These are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Shopping for food or other essential goods and services</p></li> \n <li><p>Work and education</p></li> \n <li><p>Care and compassionate reasons</p></li> \n <li><p>Exercise</p></li> \n <li><p>Visiting friends and family</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>A full breakdown of these reasons <a href=\"https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/202003/Stay%20at%20Home%20Directions%20.pdf\">can be found here</a>.</p> \n<p>Since midnight on Tuesday 12 May, Victorians have been allowed to have up to five guests over to their homes.</p> \n<p> Up to 10 people can gather outside for recreational purposes and to<strong> </strong>engage in activities like hiking, jogging and other non-contact sport.</p> \n<p>Weddings are<strong> </strong>allowed up to 10 guests. Meanwhile, up to 20 guests are<strong> </strong>able to attend funerals held indoors, or 30 if held outdoors.</p> \n<p>Camping is still out of the question, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Monday 10 May that \u201c\u2026Airbnb will not take bookings. There won\u2019t be bookings at hotels\u201d. But there is no<strong> </strong>limiton how far one can travel throughout the state.</p> \n<p>Unlike in other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are<strong> </strong>still unable to seat diners under the current rules. </p> \n<p>However, Premier Daniel Andrews announced in May that from 1 June, Victorian cafes, restaurants, and the dining areas of pubs and clubs will be allowed to reopen and host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors.</p> \n<p>Three weeks later, on 22 June, the number of people allowed will increase to 50 patrons, and go up to 100 patrons by mid-July. Premier Andrews said that patrons will still need to abide by physical distancing rules.</p> \n<p>Police officers are responsible for deciding who will receive penalties. </p> \n<p>Penalties include on-the-spot fines of up to $1,652 for individuals and $9,913 for businesses. Larger fines and even the possibility of criminal charges are also available.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Tasmania</h2> \n<p>From Monday 11 May, the Tasmanian government has eased a number of coronavirus restrictions to allow:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>20 people to attend funerals, up from 10</p></li> \n <li><p>One aged care visit per week, from none</p></li> \n <li><p>National parks to reopen for exercise, but only for people who live within 30km</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>People<strong> </strong>only allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons and gatherings limited to two people. Exemptions include:<strong> </strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Shopping for supplies</p></li> \n <li><p>Undertaking personal exercise</p></li> \n <li><p>Attending medical or healthcare appointments </p></li> \n <li><p>Seeking veterinary services</p></li> \n <li><p>Providing social support or care to another person</p></li> \n <li><p>Attending school or study, if unable to be done at home</p></li> \n <li><p>Attending work or volunteering, if unable to be done at home</p></li> \n <li><p>Performing essential maintenance or security inspections of other premises owned or occupied by the person</p></li> \n <li><p>Attending another location if the person has a reasonable excuse in the opinion of the director of public health</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>An example of a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d given by the premier\u2019s office was clearing out a recently deceased relative\u2019s house.</p> \n<p>Households are allowed to have two visitors as long as physical distancing requirements can be met, except where \u201csocial support\u201d is being provided. Tasmania has a broad definition of \u201csocial support. As such, families and couples who live apart can<strong> </strong>visit one another\u2019s homes.</p> \n<p>However, in public, the two-person gathering limit is strictly applied.</p> \n<p>From 18 May, Tasmania will move to stage one, which will mean indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, up to five visitors to a home, and up to 10 people inside restaurants, cafe and other venues.</p> \n<p>The premier confirmed that the state\u2019s strict border controls will remain in place.</p> \n<p>From 25 May, primary school students will return to school, as well as year 11 an 12 students. From 9 June, high school students from year 7 to 10 will also return to school. And from From 15 June, the state will move to stage 2, subject to health advice.</p> \n<p>Stage two will kick off on 15 June.</p> \n<p>Gatherings will increase to 20 people at a time, both indoor at outdoor. This means that up to 20 people will be able to attend religious gatherings and weddings, and up to 50 people will be allowed to attend a funeral.</p> \n<p>Under stage two, people will be able to move around the state, go camping, and stay in overnight boats and holiday shacks. Gyms and bootcamps will open to 20 people, while beauty services including tattoo parlours would also be allowed.</p> \n<p> Australian defence force members, the Tasmanian state emergency service and fire service volunteers have been enlisted to help carry out spot checks.</p> \n<p>Fines could be as much as $16,800 or six months in jail.</p> \n<p>Tasmania also requires that all non-essential travellers entering the state quarantine for a period of 14 days.</p> \n<h2>Western Australia</h2> \n<p>Western Australian has<strong> </strong>already seen perhaps the most significant easing of lockdown laws.</p> \n<p>As of Monday 18 May,<strong> </strong>up to 20<strong> </strong>people are allowed to gather publicly and privately. Residents are allowed to leave their homes for recreational<strong> </strong> activities including picnics, fishing, boating or camping.</p> \n<p> Cafes and restaurants \u2013 including dine-in services at pubs, clubs and casinos - are<strong> </strong>allowed to seat 20 diners, as long as they follow the four sq metres per person rule.</p> \n<p>Non-contact sport, outdoor and indoor fitness classes, and public swimming pools have been allowed to reopen to up to 20 participants at a time. The number of attendees at weddings and funerals has increased to 20 if held indoors, or 30 if outdoors.</p> \n<p>Places of worship and community facilities, like libraries, are<strong> </strong>also allowed up to 20 people inside.</p> \n<p>Open houses and display villages are<strong> </strong> allowed to operate, however public playgrounds, skateparks and outdoor gym equipment are closed. </p> \n<p>Travel to most<strong> </strong>nearby regions is now allowed.

      "bodyText": "Since the pandemic was declared all Australian states have gone into various levels of lockdown. Now that the country is cautiously optimistic that the curve has been flattened, the big question is how and when we will come out of isolation? On Friday 8 May, the federal government announced a three-stage plan to ease coronavirus restrictions across the country, with the goal of reaching stage three by July. Ultimately, though, it is up to each state and territory to decide when and how far they would be relaxing restrictions in the coming months. The states and territories have already announced their plans in response. While some, like WA, are significantly easing restrictions, others are taking a slower approach. So what are the laws as they currently stand? These are the laws as of Friday 15 May. This article will be updated as new restrictions are implemented or repealed. Queensland Under the current regulations in Queensland, up to five adults from different households are allowed to visit another home. These rules come under the first stage of the state government\u2019s three-stage plan to ease restrictions. Queenslanders are now allowed to shop for non-essential items. Picnics and weekend drives are allowed and national parks have reopened. Residents are now allowed to travel up to 150km from your home for recreational purposes, but cannot enter the \u201cOutback\u201d unless they live there. Those who live in Outback Queensland, defined here, can travel up to 500km within the Outback for recreational reasons, and can stay for multiple nights away from their place of residence given how far they may be travelling. As of 3 April, interstate travel is still closed to everyone except residents and essential workers, including freight carriers and emergency workers. Barriers are still erected in the Gold Coast suburb of Coolangatta, which straddles both Queensland and NSW. There are some exemptions for those who regularly cross the Queensland-NSW border for work. Up to 10 people can gather outside. This means that groups of 10 or less can engage in outdoor non-contact sport, group training and boot camps, and picnics. Queenslanders can also go to the park, playground, skatepark, or national park for recreational purposes. Weddings are allowed 10 guests, and funerals 20 guests indoors and 30 outdoors. Beauty salons can open back up, and pubs and cafes in regional or rural areas with no cases are able to seat up to 20 people. Open homes will also be allowed. The second stage of relaxing restrictions will start on 12 June, and see gatherings of up to 20 people; indoor cinemas, entertainment venues and amusement parks reopening; and greater recreational travel distances allowed. Stage three will start on 10 July. While premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said details are \u201csubject to further planning and review\u201d, intrastate and interstate travel will be permitted, and a maximum of 100 people allowed to gather in homes, public spaces, and other venues including cinemas, places of worship, and restaurants. Queensland police officers are still able to issue on-the-spot fines of $1,334.50 for individuals and $6,672.50 for corporations who breach these laws. The maximum penalties available through the courts are 10 times those amounts. New South Wales As of Friday 15 May, up to five adults are allowed to visit another person\u2019s home in NSW. There is no limit the number of guests someone is allowed per day as long as there are no more than five at a time. There is no limit on how far someone can travel to visit another household under this rule. But you are still not allowed to travel to regional or rural areas for a holiday. From Friday, public gatherings of up to 10 people, or members of the same household, are also allowed. Outdoor playground and exercise equipment can also now be used, with caution, and outdoor pools are open. Berejiklian has encouraged retail stores to reopen, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Cafes, restaurants and pubs can seat 10 diners at any one time, as long as they allow for four square metres per person. They must also ensure there are 1.5 metres between patrons. Weddings can now have up to 10 guests, in addition to those conducting the service, a photographer, a videographer and the couple. Up to 20 mourners can attend indoor funerals, and outdoor funerals can have up to 30. Religious gatherings and places of worship can also invite up to 10 worshippers inside at a time. Movement is also allowed for the purpose of moving into a new home or inspecting a potential new home, providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person or in an emergency, and undertaking legal obligations, accessing government services, or donating blood. Exemptions also exist for priests or members of religious orders, and where someone is escaping potential injury, illness or harm. People who are learning to drive can continue to learn to drive and get their hours logged. Children who live across two households can continue to switch between houses. Police have been out on the streets enforcing these rules. It has been left to police officers\u2019 discretion who will receive a fine, however all fines are reviewed personally by the police commissioner, Mick Fuller. Victoria Currently, residents can only leave the house for one of five essential reasons. These are: Shopping for food or other essential goods and services Work and education Care and compassionate reasons Exercise Visiting friends and family A full breakdown of these reasons can be found here. Since midnight on Tuesday 12 May, Victorians have been allowed to have up to five guests over to their homes. Up to 10 people can gather outside for recreational purposes and to engage in activities like hiking, jogging and other non-contact sport. Weddings are allowed up to 10 guests. Meanwhile, up to 20 guests are able to attend funerals held indoors, or 30 if held outdoors. Camping is still out of the question, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Monday 10 May that \u201c\u2026Airbnb will not take bookings. There won\u2019t be bookings at hotels\u201d. But there is no limiton how far one can travel throughout the state. Unlike in other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are still unable to seat diners under the current rules. However, Premier Daniel Andrews announced in May that from 1 June, Victorian cafes, restaurants, and the dining areas of pubs and clubs will be allowed to reopen and host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors. Three weeks later, on 22 June, the number of people allowed will increase to 50 patrons, and go up to 100 patrons by mid-July. Premier Andrews said that patrons will still need to abide by physical distancing rules. Police officers are responsible for deciding who will receive penalties. Penalties include on-the-spot fines of up to $1,652 for individuals and $9,913 for businesses. Larger fines and even the possibility of criminal charges are also available. Tasmania From Monday 11 May, the Tasmanian government has eased a number of coronavirus restrictions to allow: 20 people to attend funerals, up from 10 One aged care visit per week, from none National parks to reopen for exercise, but only for people who live within 30km People only allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons and gatherings limited to two people. Exemptions include: Shopping for supplies Undertaking personal exercise Attending medical or healthcare appointments Seeking veterinary services Providing social support or care to another person Attending school or study, if unable to be done at home Attending work or volunteering, if unable to be done at home Performing essential maintenance or security inspections of other premises owned or occupied by the person Attending another location if the person has a reasonable excuse in the opinion of the director of public health An example of a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d given by the premier\u2019s office was clearing out a recently deceased relative\u2019s house. Households are allowed to have two visitors as long as physical distancing requirements can be met, except where \u201csocial support\u201d is being provided. Tasmania has a broad definition of \u201csocial support. As such, families and couples who live apart can visit one another\u2019s homes. However, in public, the two-person gathering limit is strictly applied. From 18 May, Tasmania will move to stage one, which will mean indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, up to five visitors to a home, and up to 10 people inside restaurants, cafe and other venues. The premier confirmed that the state\u2019s strict border controls will remain in place. From 25 May, primary school students will return to school, as well as year 11 an 12 students. From 9 June, high school students from year 7 to 10 will also return to school. And from From 15 June, the state will move to stage 2, subject to health advice. Stage two will kick off on 15 June. Gatherings will increase to 20 people at a time, both indoor at outdoor. This means that up to 20 people will be able to attend religious gatherings and weddings, and up to 50 people will be allowed to attend a funeral. Under stage two, people will be able to move around the state, go camping, and stay in overnight boats and holiday shacks. Gyms and bootcamps will open to 20 people, while beauty services including tattoo parlours would also be allowed. Australian defence force members, the Tasmanian state emergency service and fire service volunteers have been enlisted to help carry out spot checks. Fines could be as much as $16,800 or six months in jail. Tasmania also requires that all non-essential travellers entering the state quarantine for a period of 14 days. Western Australia Western Australian has already seen perhaps the most significant easing of lockdown laws. As of Monday 18 May, up to 20 people are allowed to gather publicly and privately. Residents are allowed to leave their homes for recreational activities including picnics, fishing, boating or camping. Cafes and restaurants \u2013 including dine-in services at pubs, clubs and casinos - are allowed to seat 20 diners, as long as they follow the four sq metres per person rule. Non-contact sport, outdoor and indoor fitness classes, and public swimming pools have been allowed to reopen to up to 20 participants at a time. The number of attendees at weddings and funerals has increased to 20 if held indoors, or 30 if outdoors. Places of worship and community facilities, like libraries, are also allowed up to 20 people inside. Open houses and display villages are allowed to operate, however public playgrounds, skateparks and outdoor gym equipment are closed. Travel to most nearby regions is now allowed. But travel is still restricted to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. It doesn\u2019t look as though WA will be opening its borders to interstate travellers any time soon, though. As of midnight on 6 April only \u201cexempt travellers\u201d have been allowed in. This includes WA residents. A list of \u201cexempt travellers\u201d can be found here, and includes senior government officials, military personal and a range of essential workers. McGowan said that hard borders \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus\u201d and \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d. Officers can issue on-the-spot fines of $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for businesses who disobey the rules. Australian Capital Territory As of 8 May, gatherings of up to 10 people indoors and outdoors are allowed in the ACT. That includes boot camps, picnics, house inspections and auctions. Indoor funerals will are allowed to have up to 20 attendees, while those taking place outside can have up to 30 attendees. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has advised Canberrans to avoid large crowds, keep 1.5m apart from others, continue to practice good hand hygiene and to \u201cstay home\u201d from work or school of they are sick. He previously urged residents to stay at home, except for certain essential reasons. These are: Shopping for what you need \u2013 food and necessary supplies Medical or healthcare needs, including compassionate requirements Exercise in compliance with the public gathering requirements Work and study if you can\u2019t work or learn remotely ACT police officers would be issuing a warning in the first instance. Guardian Australia understands that police have focused on enforcing the two-person gathering limits, not why people have left their homes. Northern Territory The Northern Territory already commenced its three-stage plan to ease restrictions in the state in early May. The NT currently has a 10-person gathering limit indoors and outdoors. From Friday 8 May these were lifted for outdoor weddings and funerals. An unlimited number of people may attend as long as physical distancing can still be observed. Since 1 May, Territorians have been allowed to use public swimming pools, go fishing with friends and play non-contact sports like golf or tennis and visit waterparks, as long as safe physical distancing can be observed. National parks are also open for camping, swimming and hiking. Since 15 May additional indoor activities have been permitted, as long as they take less than two hours. These include going to the gym, eating at a cafe or restaurant, visiting a museum or undergoing non-facial cosmetic procedures like manicures or tanning. Bars can reopen but alcohol can only be served with a meal. Indoor weddings, funerals and religious activities will also be allowed. From 5 June all businesses will be allowed to reopen as long as they have a Covid-19 plan. The two-hour limit will be lifted allowing night clubs, cinemas, tattoo parlours casinos and pokies to reopen. However physical distancing must still be observed. All sporting activities will be allowed to restart from 5 June and spectators will be allowed to attend. Currently, remote Indigenous communities have protections in place to stop non-essential visitors from entering, and quarantine periods for residents returning from community hubs. The protections will be assessed and potentially lifted on 18 June. Gunner said that opening the NT border would be \u201cdead last\u201d. The Northern Territory currently requires any non-essential travellers to self-quarantine in a hotel for a period of 14 days. As of 3 April, the traveller must pay for the expenses associated with this quarantine period. South Australia South Australia has not formally lifted any physical distancing laws, but the state never imposed the strict lockdowns seen in Victoria, NSW or WA. South Australia opted not to enforce new two-person-gathering laws, but premier Steven Marshall had still urged people to follow these rules. Since Monday 11 May, outdoor dining at restaurants and cafes has recommenced for groups of up to 10 people. The changes, announced on Friday 8 May, fall into stage one of the state\u2019s three-stage easing of restrictions. In addition to those officiating, funerals are now able to have 20 people attend indoor ceremonies, and 30 outdoors. Non-contact sport, house auctions and open inspections have also resumed. The state is also reopening university and Tafe tutorials, public libraries, pools, churches and community halls. South Australia is the only jurisdiction to have eased its ban on caravanning, camping and regional travel in general. The SA government has also already also welcomed students back into classrooms for term two. On-the-spot fines of $1,000 still will only be applied to those who are gathering in groups larger than 10. Marshall has also announced stage two of the state\u2019s plan to ease coronavirus restrictions. From 8 June, South Australia will see the reopening of cinemas and theatres, seated dining, gyms and indoor fitness, galleries and museums, and beauty services. Sporting competition will also start back up, without spectators. Future steps for consideration also include larger gatherings, reopening of nightclubs, pubs and bars, and easing state border restrictions and travel into protected communities. No date was given for when these steps could be implemented, though. Social distancing rules must still be followed, and gatherings must abide by the one person per four square meters rules. All people entering South Australia are required to undertake a 14-day quarantine. This article was amended on 15 April 2020 to correct the statement that Queensland has announced a state of emergency. It is a public health emergency. Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication. Any significant corrections made to this or previous versions of the article will continue to be footnoted in line with Guardian editorial policy.",

The K-League club FC Seoul said the dolls, which had been dotted around stands currently off-limits to supporters due to the coronavirus outbreak, had been ordered inadvertently after a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with the supplier. Earlier this month the K-League became the first major football league to hold matches since the start of the pandemic, with the season\u2019s opening game watched by a worldwide audience of fans starved of live football. But FC Seoul\u2019s attempt to bring a touch of realism to Sunday\u2019s match against Gwangju FC backfired after social media users noticed that the mannequins looked more like sex dolls. Some pointed out that several were holding posters carrying the name of the popular live streamer BJ Chaero \u2013 reportedly the physical inspiration for the dolls\u2019 design \u2013 according to the Koreaboo website. The club said it had been the victim of a mix-up, insisting it had checked with the supplier and received assurances that the dolls were not intended for sexual use. Photographs taken at the largely empty stadium showed about 10 dolls spaced out among seats in front of life-size cardboard cutouts of the team\u2019s players. \u201cWe would like to apologise to the fans,\u201d FC Seoul said in a statement on Instagram. \u201cWe are deeply sorry.\u201d It added: \u201cOur intention was to do something light-hearted in these difficult times.

At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p> <h2><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%</strong></h2> <p>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</p> <h2><strong>Japan\u2019s </strong><strong>falls into recession </strong></h2> <p>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers.</p> <h2><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In Brazil, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52701524\">BBC</a> has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy</strong></h2> <p>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong> recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months.

A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees.

The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</p> <h2><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks</strong></h2> <p>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff#block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff\">Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions</a> are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections.

Nearly two-thirds were worried about passing the virus on to others at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThings are nowhere near what we need,\u201d said Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the RCP. \u201cPeople assume everyone\u2019s feeling OK on the frontline and that morale is good, but the survey shows people are worried about it all. The PPE remains a significant issue. Testing has got better, there are still concerns, particularly around delays in getting the results back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Goddard added: \u201cConcern is very high among BAME doctors and we should not be surprised given the awful situation we\u2019ve had with the deaths of healthcare workers and people in social care from BAME backgrounds. The fact that we\u2019re so reliant on the BAME workforce in the NHS and social care, and the fact that the workforce is so worried about their health, is something we need to wake up to.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart1-zip/giv-3902s2Bdxzz5cInD/\" data-alt=\"BAME graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart1-zip/giv-3902s2Bdxzz5cInD/\">BAME graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The survey findings come after the chair of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\">urged government to investigate</a> why BAME health workers were contracting the virus in disproportionate numbers.

Of more than 1,500 doctors who completed the survey, a fifth had positive tests for the virus and 39% reported a suspected infection.

      "bodyText": "More than three-quarters of black, Asian and minority ethnic doctors are worried about contracting coronavirus in the course of their work, according to a survey that highlights the continuing lack of protection for frontline NHS staff. Doctors said poor access to personal protective equipment, insufficient training on how to fit masks and lengthy waits for virus testing left them in fear of catching the virus and passing it on to those they lived with. The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) found 48% of all doctors who responded to its survey were either concerned or very concerned for their health, a figure that rose to 76% among BAME doctors. Nearly two-thirds were worried about passing the virus on to others at home. \u201cThings are nowhere near what we need,\u201d said Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the RCP. \u201cPeople assume everyone\u2019s feeling OK on the frontline and that morale is good, but the survey shows people are worried about it all. The PPE remains a significant issue. Testing has got better, there are still concerns, particularly around delays in getting the results back.\u201d Goddard added: \u201cConcern is very high among BAME doctors and we should not be surprised given the awful situation we\u2019ve had with the deaths of healthcare workers and people in social care from BAME backgrounds. The fact that we\u2019re so reliant on the BAME workforce in the NHS and social care, and the fact that the workforce is so worried about their health, is something we need to wake up to.\u201d The survey findings come after the chair of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, urged government to investigate why BAME health workers were contracting the virus in disproportionate numbers. Under guidance set out by NHS bosses, hospitals are now looking to move BAME staff off the frontline for their own safety. A third of doctors have been off work with illness during the epidemic, most with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Of more than 1,500 doctors who completed the survey, a fifth had positive tests for the virus and 39% reported a suspected infection. The epidemic has so far hit London the hardest with 42% of respondents saying they had taken time off since the outbreak reached the UK. Despite renewed efforts to increase supplies of PPE, 16.5% of doctors who responded to the survey reported situations in the past two weeks when they could not get the protective equipment recommended by Public Health England. A third said they had not received \u201cfit testing\u201d to ensure their masks were protecting them properly, with 37% adding that they did not feel confident checking their own PPE. With the rapid expansion of testing over the past six weeks, more healthcare workers have been checked for the virus, but 5% of doctors surveyed said they were still unable to get a test themselves and nearly a fifth could not secure tests for people in their households who developed symptoms. Four per cent said they could still not get tests for their patients. Those who did get tested often had to wait days for their results. Only 17% of the doctors heard back within 24 hours, with 38% waiting up to two days, a fifth waiting two to three days and 14% hearing nothing for at least four days. NHS staff are supposed to have a personal assessment of their risk of contracting coronavirus, but only 18% of the doctors who responded to the survey said they had received such an assessment, leading the RCP to say employers must now make them a priority. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019ve got is that lots of groups are working on risk assessment tools. We\u2019ve got to have a consistent approach across the NHS and social care sector so we\u2019re not worried one group is getting a different assessment than others,\u201d said Goddard.",

He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president.</p> <p>But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism.</p> <p>\u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838/25_33_1319_1965/671.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p>A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">report </a><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">last month concluded</a> that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">A lot are untested and uninsured</a>. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late.</p> <p>\u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson <a href=\"https://chicagocrusader.com/why-are-african-americans-dying-disproportionately-to-the-coronavirus/\">asked in a statement published on 7 April</a>, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution. We shouldn\u2019t say America was founded in 1776 \u2013 it started with slavery in 1619; so we\u2019re still invisible to that extent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13/0_0_3435_2305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe still make less, live under stresses and don\u2019t live as long. We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d</p> <p>Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fpolitics%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fblack-activists-officials-see-major-threat-souths-plans-reopen%2f\">group of activists</a>, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d.</p> <p>White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president. But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism. \u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing. Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart. \u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus. A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee report last month concluded that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise. \u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cA lot are untested and uninsured. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late. \u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore. \u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson asked in a statement published on 7 April, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d. He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution. We shouldn\u2019t say America was founded in 1776 \u2013 it started with slavery in 1619; so we\u2019re still invisible to that extent. \u201cWe still make less, live under stresses and don\u2019t live as long.

The first president elected with no previous political or military experience squandered a precious six weeks, instead golfing, holding rallies and prophesying that the virus would disappear \u201clike a miracle\u201d in warm weather rather than following the pandemic emergency plan bequeathed by Obama and building a rigorous nationwide testing programme.

Experts say the answer may be linked to borrowing trends, the nature of Britain\u2019s financial system, and the UK\u2019s relationship with government spending. The schemes at a glance CBILS relies on banks lending out their own cash. However, it comes with a guarantee that the government will cover 80% of losses if a customer defaults and the bank cannot recover the full amount.

A fragmented UK banking system After a boom in UK bank takeovers in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, regulators have tried to boost competition and even encouraged businesses to shift accounts to smaller lenders. Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, says this fragmented system may be partly the reason for the UK scheme\u2019s teething problems. For example, the UK\u2019s CBILS programme was launched with 40 banks on board. \u201cIn countries where the system is quite concentrated \u2013 with one, two or three big banks \u2013 in a sense it\u2019s easier to get these schemes off the ground.

That has raised fears that small businesses that have been encouraged to open accounts with challenger banks in recent years could end up being locked out of the scheme, or waiting weeks until their own lenders are accredited. The UK is more used to monetary than fiscal stimulus The UK\u2019s \u00a3330bn coronavirus business support programme is the largest in the country\u2019s history, but European peers are far more experienced when it comes to distributing state-backed cash and may have been able to get money flowing much quicker as a result. Countries such as France and Germany \u201cderive some benefit from experience\u201d, said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg. \u201cThey have the facilities in place and businesses have the attitude and proclivity to ask the government, in times like these, for help.\u201d The UK has instead relied heavily on monetary policy for economic stimulus, which tends to be faster and does not require tax hikes or an increase in government borrowing. The state-owned British Business Bank, meanwhile, is not used to managing programmes the size of CBILS and bounce-back loans. It has had to increase staffing and is still building new digital programmes to handle demand. CASE STUDIES Electronic filter maker in Durham, UK Anj Hampton, 45, is a director at Rasmi Electronics in Durham. The firm makes electronic filters that ensure radio frequencies from one machine do not disrupt another. The family-run business exports about 85% of its stock to Europe, but also sells to firms that supply the NHS at home. After factories shut down in China this year, Anj was struggling to get parts and fulfil orders and eventually had to send staff home. After three months, she was facing a cash squeeze and was looking for \u00a3200,000 to bridge the gap. She approached NatWest five weeks ago but was wrongly told that exporters were not eligible for CBILS. Anj said she put together evidence from the British Business Bank showing that she was still entitled to access the scheme but has not yet been granted a loan. The BBB\u2019s website has since been changed to clarify that exporters do qualify, but she\u2019s still waiting for funding. Property engineering firm in Paris, France Eric Malenfer, 55 is the CEO of Gexpertise Conseil, which helps design, survey and model buildings in both France and Tunisia. He had to cut his 220 staff down to part-time work after France went into lockdown last month and was looking for \u20ac2.5m in emergency loans to stay afloat. He approached both Credit du Nord and HSBC in France for a total of \u20ac2.5m. The application process took about two weeks, which he said was \u201cparticularly short\u201d, and he received the cash a week later. \u201cThe state reacted very quickly and the banking arrangements were implemented within deadlines that we did not imagine possible,\u201d Malenfer said. Cinema and events space in Frankfurt, Germany Andreas Lucas, 56, is the managing partner of Orfeo\u2019s Erben, a restaurant, bar, cinema and events space in Frankfurt, Germany. The site had to close on 18 March as the pandemic started to spread, and he had to put his staff on part-time furlough. He secured a \u20ac30,000 grant and a separate \u20ac35,000 micro-loan through the Wirtschaftsbank Hessen state development bank to help cover rent, staff benefits, and maintenance during the outbreak. He said it took less than 10 days between starting the application and receiving the cash. Lucas said it was \u201cone of the least bureaucratic\u201d experiences he has had in the past 30 years.",

The amount borrowed was nearly \u00a3100,000 (about half the value of her home at that time) at a rate of interest of 7.54%. Following a stroke, she moved into a nursing home in December 2019 so I am now in the process of selling her house to fund the care home fees. By lockdown in March, I had a buyer in place but activity has been frozen for the last three months. Meanwhile the debt repayable to the equity release firm is apparently increasing at \u00a3230 a week, which would reduce the equity available at the end of the lockdown period by over \u00a33,000. Do we know if the mortgage holiday payments will apply to this situation? IG A Because of the way that lifetime mortgages work, your mother has effectively been taking a mortgage holiday from the day the \u00a3100,000 of equity was released and the mortgage started. With the type of lifetime mortgage that your mother has, interest is charged on the loan each month but \u2013 instead of being paid to the lender \u2013 it is \u201crolled up\u201d which means added to the original loan amount. Each time interest is added to the loan, the total amount on which interest is charged goes up. This is the same as is happening with the misleadingly-named mortgage holiday with a standard mortgage. But instead of interest being added to the loan for its entire term \u2013 as with a lifetime mortgage \u2013 lenders tend to limit the period that interest can be rolled up \u2013 aka mortgage holiday \u2013 to three months. It also explains why when someone comes to the end of a mortgage \u2018holiday\u2019 he or she will find that the amount owed on the mortgage has gone up as has the monthly mortgage payment. So to answer your question, mortgage holiday payments won\u2019t apply to your mother\u2019s situation. If taking a mortgage holiday meant the lender waiving interest payments for the holiday period, it might apply to your mother but, sadly, it doesn\u2019t. On a more positive note, if the amount your mother owes is more than proceeds of the sale, you won\u2019t have to make up the difference because most lenders who adhere to the standards set by the Equity Release Council offer a no-negative-equity guarantee. This means that lenders promise not to make any equity-release customer (or their beneficiaries) pay back more than what the mortgaged property sells for. Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

Jane Halton, who is also a former head of Australia\u2019s health and finance departments, issued the warning at the National Press Club on Monday. Halton told reporters there is a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of developing a Covid-19 vaccine because \u2013 although 94% of vaccine candidates fail \u2013 there are 130 groups working on the problem worldwide. With seven different categories of vaccine on trial and 20 candidates in the \u201cother\u201d category, Halton said the scientific community is doing well to get the \u201cmaximum shots on goal\u201d. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has backed 10 candidates, including one in Australia that could go to human trials as early as July. If a vaccine is identified, production should be \u201cglobally distributed\u201d to guard against \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d, she said. A vaccine is critical to returning to work, global trade and tourism, \u201cso if we have vaccine nationalism, and one country looks after itself first, and at the expense of the rest of the world, everyone is going to continue to suffer\u201d, Halton said. The World Health Organization is working out a list of \u201cpriority recipients\u201d including first-responder health workers, the elderly and immunocompromised. \u201cNow, this is hard, because it\u2019s going to require people to cooperate. \u201cAnd the urge for domestic priority, I think, will be very significant.\u201d After a country has produced a vaccine and served its \u201cvulnerable citizens\u201d it will need to determine \u201cwhat share of that is going to vulnerable people around the world at the same time\u201d, Halton said. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re all in it together. As soon as there is a vaccine, I fear that we \u2026 may not be quite all in this together as we have been.\u201d Halton, a member of the WHO board for three years, said she could \u201cunderstand the concerns of our friends in China\u201d about being blamed for Covid-19 but defended a proposed investigation into the zoonotic origins of the virus as the best way to prevent it from happening in the future. Halton, also a commissioner in Australia\u2019s national Covid-19 Coordination Commission, warned against complacency now Australia has begun to ease restrictions. She said a \u201cit\u2019s all good\u201d attitude would reduce social distancing and could cause a \u201creally bad outcome\u201d for the elderly and immunocompromised. Halton said the Australian states do not work in \u201chermetically sealed spheres\u201d and although she understood states being nervous about taking down internal border controls, she was \u201cnot convinced\u201d current border controls were the best way to manage risk. Halton also foreshadowed a greater role for the commission in planning Australia\u2019s economic recovery after the immediate challenges of ensuring enough personal protective equipment had been met. The commission\u2019s chairman, Nev Power, has publicly backed a fertiliser plant and spruiked natural gas\u2019s role in powering domestic manufacturing since taking the role. \u201cWe will turn our focus to what is actually going to get our economy kickstarted,\u201d Halton said. \u201cWhat we want to be able to see is an increase in productivity in our economy.

      "bodyText": "Beijing is expected to face new levels of pressure at the World Health Assembly this week as dozens of nations push for an independent investigation into the coronavirus outbreak and the United States mounts a campaign over Taiwan\u2019s status. More than 120 countries have backed a draft resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while a US-led coalition has been aggressively lobbying countries to support Taiwan\u2019s bid to attend as an observer. China has blocked Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of China, from attending the meeting since 2016 as relations between Beijing and Taipei worsened following the election of Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party. The WHA \u2013 the governing body of the World Health Organization \u2013 meets over video conference for two days starting on Monday. In the run-up to the conference China has accused member states of politicising the meeting. A report in the official news agency Xinhua on Sunday said \u201cthe US and other countries\u201d were \u201cdetermined to discuss Taiwan-related proposals for only one purpose: to politicise health issues and achieve their own interests at the expense of kidnapping the the World Health Assembly and hurting global cooperation\u201d. An article in the official People\u2019s Daily on Monday said: \u201cAny attempt to use the WHO as a tool for geopolitical games is tantamount to a challenge to humankind\u2019s right to health.\u201d An editorial in the Global Times said: \u201cA politicised appeal won\u2019t be supported at the assembly \u2026 The US has messed up its Covid-19 fight but intends to shift the responsibility onto China. Such a plan is bound to backfire.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister said it did not get invited to this week\u2019s meeting, adding that it had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. The Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan last December, has placed China under more scrutiny as critics call for an investigation into how the virus was able to spread across the world. It has now infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. The resolution on Covid-19 will be put forward on Tuesday if it gains backing from two-thirds of the 194 members of the assembly. Beijing, which has repeatedly said that researchers have not yet determined the source of the virus and raised the possibility that it may have originated elsewhere, has described such calls as an effort by countries to deflect from their own failures. Chinese authorities appear to be putting more controls on research into the origins of the virus as well as blocking international observers from fully participating in efforts. \u201cChina\u2019s reluctance to allow the international community to investigate and its enthusiasm in creating all sorts of conspiracy theories pointing to non-China origins of the virus only make the world more eager to know the answer,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University, with a focus on China.

We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.</p> <h2>The rules</h2> <p>We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.</p> <p>This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s<strong> </strong>the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.</p> <p>As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p><em>Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor</em></p> <h2><strong>100</strong></h2> <h2>Bill Haley and His Comets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eJOJhwgluE\">Rock Around the Clock</a> (1955)</h2> <p>You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/15/observer-archive-rock-around-the-clock-16-september-1956\">Rock Around the Clock</a> patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e3d2d025c017f4ca07dac5371a7783905e20286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3d2d025c017f4ca07dac5371a7783905e20286/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand singer Lorde, AKA Ella Yelich-O\u2019Connor, in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Generational bellwether \u2026 New Zealand singer Lorde, AKA Ella Yelich-O\u2019Connor, in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Will/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>99</strong></h2> <h2>Lorde \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFasFq4GJYM\">Royals</a> (2013)</h2> <p>By disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/lorde-just-freak-royals-pure-heroine\">Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one</a>: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre\u2019s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>98</strong></h2> <h2>Lieutenant Pigeon \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O465enGz03w\">Mouldy Old Dough</a> (1972)</h2> <p>Recorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>97</strong></h2> <h2>Dave and Ansell Collins \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w94BfHCeTBI\">Double Barrel</a> (1971)</h2> <p>If you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken \u2013 sampled if you like \u2013 from Ramsey Lewis; a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: \u201cI am the magnificent W-O-O-O!\u201d It still sounds fantastic. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>96</strong></h2> <h2>Roy Orbison \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jm3Tq_q4yU\">It\u2019s Over</a> (1964)</h2> <p>The pinnacle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/why-roy-orbison-is-one-of-the-rock-n-roll-greats\">Roy Orbison\u2019s career as rock\u2019s great tragedian</a>: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce22cd59da60a6a920f6a65d2735f67bfdafb0a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce22cd59da60a6a920f6a65d2735f67bfdafb0a2/0_0_2984_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duo Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn of the Buggles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Postmodern gold \u2026 Duo Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn of the Buggles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>95</strong></h2> <h2>The Buggles \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs\">Video Killed the Radio Star</a> (1979)</h2> <p>It won\u2019t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/30/the-buggles-how-we-made-video-killed-the-radio-star\">Trevor Horn and co</a> turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>94</strong></h2> <h2>Dua Lipa \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU\">New Rules</a> (2017)</h2> <p>After a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/03/dua-lipa-you-have-to-be-made-of-steel-to-not-let-words-get-to-you\">a global star</a>. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don\u2019t answer your ex\u2019s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She\u2019s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>93</strong></h2> <h2>Del Shannon \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMufLXrFIg8\">Runaway</a> (1961)</h2> <p>Behind the simple, perky rock\u2019n\u2019roll facade \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate fairground anthem\u201d, as writer Bob Stanley put it \u2013 there\u2019s something disturbing about Del Shannon\u2019s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4d95be22e1f5ffa47f8103e2859a9f9dc974cad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4d95be22e1f5ffa47f8103e2859a9f9dc974cad/0_24_3743_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Sinatra with Lee Hazlewood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nancy Sinatra with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/28/lee-hazlewood-guru-cowboy-psychedelia\">Lee Hazlewood</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GAB Archives/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>92</strong></h2> <h2>Nancy Sinatra \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbyAZQ45uww\">These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019</a> (1966)</h2> <p>Had These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently divorced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>91</strong></h2> <h2>Whigfield \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DNQRtmIMxk\">Saturday Night</a> (1994)</h2> <p>Saturday Night just pipped Gina G\u2019s Ooh Aah \u2026 Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it\u2019s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People\u2019s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It\u2019s got an immediately iconic tag (\u201cdee dee da da da!\u201d), plus it was the victor in one of pop\u2019s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne\u2019s Fog on the Tyne was having.<strong> LS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d2e5186e4bff8801756ff13e74398ac59dcb95a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2e5186e4bff8801756ff13e74398ac59dcb95a/0_29_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber performing in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He\u2019s had his moments, but sometimes he release a triumph \u2026 Justin Bieber performing in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>90</strong></h2> <h2>Justin Bieber \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_0jXPuIr0\">What Do You Mean?</a> (2015)</h2> <p>There will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he\u2019s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/how-dreamy-escapism-tropical-house-took-dance-music-by-storm\">then-popular tropical house sound</a> and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>89</strong></h2> <h2>Sugababes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSAGsiVSoeE\">Freak Like Me</a> (2002)</h2> <p>Producer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes\u2019 debut UK No 1 \u2013 the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army \u2013 but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing \u201cI\u2019m grown now\u201d transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It\u2019s got a classic belting \u201cmay-ee!\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cme\u201d in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn\u2019t have Sound of the Underground \u2013 or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>88</strong></h2> <h2>Craig David \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5lmb5-tnM0\">7 Days</a> (2000)</h2> <p>Like the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f24e1ac2c8e8ec8180b0c8d19360744bdb415e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f24e1ac2c8e8ec8180b0c8d19360744bdb415e/0_228_5444_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adamski, left, with Seal in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adamski, left, with Seal in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Muller/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>87</strong></h2> <h2>Adamski \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtENRzTV__8\">Killer (feat Seal)</a> (1990)</h2> <p>Every part of Adamski\u2019s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>86</strong></h2> <h2>The Tornados \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9B_a0ct-DM\">Telstar</a> (1962)</h2> <p>The product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock28\">producer Joe Meek</a>\u2019s twin obsessions \u2013 space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself \u2013 Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them.

The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who\u2019s tried chancing his arm again: \u201cI\u2019m not that chained up little person still in love with you.\u201d <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>83</strong></h2> <h2>Cher \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZXRV4MezEw\">Believe</a> (1998)</h2> <p>I Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher\u2019s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song\u2019s wild success \u2013 11m copies sold worldwide \u2013 is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it\u2019s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09ed661dc263e310a301d769c01a85ee995bb3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ed661dc263e310a301d769c01a85ee995bb3b4/0_151_5347_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart-stopping chart-topper \u2026 Robyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>82</strong></h2> <h2>Robyn \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ojHWQrm4UM\">With Every Heartbeat (feat Kleerup)</a> (2007)</h2> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t look back,\u201d Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush\u2019s DNA outlines the tragedy). \u201cAnd \u2013 it \u2013 hurts \u2013 with \u2013 ev \u2013 er \u2013 y \u2013 heart \u2013 <em>beat</em>,\u201d Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>81</strong></h2> <h2>Elton John \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QSA7pSvh-o\">Are You Ready for Love?</a> (2003)</h2> <p>For someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn\u2019t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career.

It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song; it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/11/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-20-carly-rae-jepsen-call-me-maybe\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Elle Hunt</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a376ff0c9369d2010ca1ae842cdc00e96c4f721d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a376ff0c9369d2010ca1ae842cdc00e96c4f721d/0_200_4000_2810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X performs at the Grammys in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unstoppable \u2026 Lil Nas X performs at the Grammys in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Shearer/Getty Images for the Recording Academy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>19</strong></h2> <h2>Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) (2019)</h2> <p>Old Town Road was unstoppable, with no apparent end to its appeal. Children rioted in their love for it. Its vast stable of remixes made it a genre-splicing Rosetta stone. But as much as the song is an urtext in how to go viral (until the rules change again), Old Town\u2019s Road\u2019s magic lies in its affirming faith that a sunnier future is just around the next bend, designer Stetson optional. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/12/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-19-lil-nas-x-old-town-road\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Owen Myers</strong></p> <h2><strong>18</strong></h2> <h2>Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads \u2013 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (1979)</h2> <p>Dury told chatshow host Michael Parkinson that he wanted his success to dispel society\u2019s discomfort with and patronising attitudes to disability and provide hope to those for whom things hadn\u2019t turned out so well. Today, his best-known tune still sounds fresh and wonderfully off-kilter, a beacon of pop\u2019s ability to embrace oddity and celebrate the other. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/13/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-18-ian-dury-and-the-blockheads-hit-me-with-your-rhythm-stick\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Dave Simpson</strong></p> <h2><strong>17</strong></h2> <h2>Kylie Minogue \u2013 Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head (2001)</h2> <p>This was always a Kylie classic in the making.

Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those famous \u201cla, la, las\u201d take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/14/the-greatest-uk-no-1s-ever-no-17-kylie-minogue-cant-get-you-out-of-my-head\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Michael Cragg</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6c9e5cd56cdd2f1f7eab366fd053f599fd5cd3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6c9e5cd56cdd2f1f7eab366fd053f599fd5cd3c/0_100_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonce Knowles in Edinburgh in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reigning diva \u2026 Beyonce Knowles in Edinburgh in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>16</strong></h2> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Crazy in Love (2003)</h2> <p>The announcement of her arrival via those unforgettable blaring horns, sampled from the Chi-Lites\u2019 1970 hit Are You My Woman?

We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952. The rules We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics. This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once. As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1. Enjoy! Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor 100 Bill Haley and His Comets \u2013 Rock Around the Clock (1955) You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. AP 99 Lorde \u2013 Royals (2013) By disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre\u2019s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LS 98 Lieutenant Pigeon \u2013 Mouldy Old Dough (1972) Recorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. AP 97 Dave and Ansell Collins \u2013 Double Barrel (1971) If you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken \u2013 sampled if you like \u2013 from Ramsey Lewis; a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: \u201cI am the magnificent W-O-O-O!\u201d It still sounds fantastic. AP 96 Roy Orbison \u2013 It\u2019s Over (1964) The pinnacle of Roy Orbison\u2019s career as rock\u2019s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. AP 95 The Buggles \u2013 Video Killed the Radio Star (1979) It won\u2019t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBT 94 Dua Lipa \u2013 New Rules (2017) After a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don\u2019t answer your ex\u2019s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She\u2019s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBT 93 Del Shannon \u2013 Runaway (1961) Behind the simple, perky rock\u2019n\u2019roll facade \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate fairground anthem\u201d, as writer Bob Stanley put it \u2013 there\u2019s something disturbing about Del Shannon\u2019s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. AP 92 Nancy Sinatra \u2013 These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 (1966) Had These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently divorced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. AP 91 Whigfield \u2013 Saturday Night (1994) Saturday Night just pipped Gina G\u2019s Ooh Aah \u2026 Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it\u2019s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People\u2019s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It\u2019s got an immediately iconic tag (\u201cdee dee da da da!\u201d), plus it was the victor in one of pop\u2019s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne\u2019s Fog on the Tyne was having. LS 90 Justin Bieber \u2013 What Do You Mean? (2015) There will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he\u2019s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBT 89 Sugababes \u2013 Freak Like Me (2002) Producer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes\u2019 debut UK No 1 \u2013 the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army \u2013 but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing \u201cI\u2019m grown now\u201d transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It\u2019s got a classic belting \u201cmay-ee!\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cme\u201d in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn\u2019t have Sound of the Underground \u2013 or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LS 88 Craig David \u2013 7 Days (2000) Like the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBT 87 Adamski \u2013 Killer (feat Seal) (1990) Every part of Adamski\u2019s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBT 86 The Tornados \u2013 Telstar (1962) The product of producer Joe Meek\u2019s twin obsessions \u2013 space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself \u2013 Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It\u2019s like nothing else, before or since. AP 85 Estelle \u2013 American Boy (feat Kanye West) (2008) This will get you thinking, \u201cI miss the old Kanye\u201d \u2013 the rapper\u2019s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet \u201crubbish\u201d is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: \u201cLike the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking / Don\u2019t like his baggy jeans but I might like what\u2019s underneath them.\u201d The bump of will.i.am\u2019s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBT 84 Gloria Gaynor \u2013 I Will Survive (1979) Decades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who\u2019s tried chancing his arm again: \u201cI\u2019m not that chained up little person still in love with you.\u201d AP 83 Cher \u2013 Believe (1998) I Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher\u2019s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song\u2019s wild success \u2013 11m copies sold worldwide \u2013 is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it\u2019s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT 82 Robyn \u2013 With Every Heartbeat (feat Kleerup) (2007) \u201cBut I don\u2019t look back,\u201d Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush\u2019s DNA outlines the tragedy). \u201cAnd \u2013 it \u2013 hurts \u2013 with \u2013 ev \u2013 er \u2013 y \u2013 heart \u2013 beat,\u201d Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LS 81 Elton John \u2013 Are You Ready for Love? (2003) For someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn\u2019t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It\u2019s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LS 80 Dave \u2013 Funky Friday (feat Fredo) (2018) This wasn\u2019t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven\u2019t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap\u2019s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBT 79 Jackie Trent \u2013 Where Are You Now (My Love) (1965) The pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach\u2019s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent \u2013 this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBT 78 Thunderclap Newman \u2013 Something in the Air (1969) It\u2019s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that\u2019s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that \u201cthe revolution\u2019s here\u201d, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it\u2019s really moving. AP 77 Enya \u2013 Orinoco Flow (1988) Perhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly \u2013 but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya\u2019s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LS 76 Baby D \u2013 Let Me Be Your Fantasy (1994) The lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy \u2013 \u201cLotions of love flow through your hands / See visions, colours every day\u201d \u2013 and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBT 75 Procol Harum \u2013 A Whiter Shade of Pale (1967) Channelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies \u2013 \u201cAlthough my eyes were open / They might have just as well\u2019ve been closed\u201d \u2013 and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: \u201cI was feeling kinda seasick / But the crowd called out for more.\u201d A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBT 74 Will Young \u2013 Leave Right Now (2003) You can imagine an older relative calling this \u201ca proper song\u201d \u2013 unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White\u2019s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight\u2019s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBT 73 Chicago \u2013 If You Leave Me Now (1976) The softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn\u2019t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he\u2019s trying not to wake someone up. It\u2019s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. AP 72 Rage Against the Machine \u2013 Killing in the Name (2009) The heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history \u2013 with one of the best riffs, too \u2013 only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its \u201cFuck you, I won\u2019t do what you tell me\u201d climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBT 71 Spice Girls \u2013 Wannabe (1996) Almost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the \u201czig-a-zig-ah\u201d, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard\u2019s \u201ca-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!\u201d almost four decades prior) that it\u2019s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2013 seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes \u2013 and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LS 70 Rui Da Silva \u2013 Touch Me (feat Cassandra) (2001) Dance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra\u2019s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn\u2019t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBT 69 Snap! \u2013 Rhythm Is a Dancer (1992) Dance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy \u2013 Haddaway\u2019s What Is Love and Corona\u2019s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples \u2013 and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday. BBT 68 Dexys Midnight Runners \u2013 Come on Eileen (1982) Pop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they\u2019ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LS 67 Black Box \u2013 Ride on Time (1989) Matching disco diva Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People\u2019s Heather Small \u2013 working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample \u2013 blows the house down, and her \u201clet me tell you, what you do to me\u201d is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBT 66 Eminem \u2013 Stan (feat Dido) (2000) It\u2019s testament to time\u2019s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn\u2019t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It\u2019s the peak of Eminem\u2019s storytelling skill and \u2013 in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan \u2013 profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan\u2019s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it. LS 65 Kraftwerk \u2013 The Model (1982) A depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model\u2019s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn\u2019t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBT 64 Nena \u2013 99 Red Balloons (1984) Too often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go\u2019s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.) LS 63 Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel \u2013 Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) (1975) A fabulously bitchy kiss-off to the three members of Cockney Rebel who left the band after their 1974 album The Psychomodo, the genius of Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) is to couch its screw-you message in the sunniest, most charming, irresistibly hook-laden music imaginable. AP 62 Elvis Presley \u2013 Jailhouse Rock (1958) Jailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. AP 61 Arctic Monkeys \u2013 I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor (2005) Most mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys\u2019 debut single proper is something to look back on with pride \u2013 not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic \u201cvictory\u201d for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner\u2019s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: \u201cJust bangin\u2019 tunes and DJ sets and / Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.\u201d LS 60 Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next (2018) After all that Ariana Grande had been through \u2013 the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement \u2013 she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop\u2019s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande\u2019s freedom. LS 59 The Walker Brothers \u2013 Make It Easy on Yourself (1965) \u201cBreaking up is so very hard to do\u201d \u2013 this Burt Bacharach-penned ballad opens with a wry bit of understatement from Scott Walker, and he deals with things very magnanimously from here on out: a stiff upper lip in song. The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy is arranger Ivor Raymonde just showing off, really. BBT 58 Rihanna \u2013 Umbrella (feat Jay-Z) (2007) Originally written for Britney Spears, although it\u2019s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that\u2019s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop\u2019s great come-ons. It\u2019s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons. LS 57 10cc \u2013 I\u2019m Not in Love (1975) Eric Stewart wrote I\u2019m Not in Love after his wife, Gloria, complained that he didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d often enough \u2013 not out of petulance, but to express his depth of feeling for her beyond the cliche. After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LS 56 Aaliyah \u2013 More Than a Woman (2002) A posthumous chart-topper after her death in a plane crash when she was 22, More Than a Woman is one of the trio of masterpiece singles she made with Timbaland, along with We Need a Resolution and Try Again. Into the producer\u2019s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBT 55 Daft Punk \u2013 Get Lucky (feat Pharrell Williams) (2013) Ah, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy\u2019s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all. Take it off the alcopop-splashed CDJs and back into headphones and you can newly appreciate its mastery, with the liveness of Nile Rodgers\u2019 guitar and Pharrell\u2019s conversational charm. BBT 54 tATu \u2013 All the Things She Said (2003) On one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo\u2019s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager\u2019s head. An industrial cri de c\u0153ur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LS 53 Take That \u2013 Back for Good (1995) The boy band \u2013 well, Gary Barlow \u2013 had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There\u2019s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though \u2013 \u201cWhenever I\u2019m wrong / Just tell me the song and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d \u2013 so you don\u2019t really fancy his chances. BBT 52 Soft Cell \u2013 Tainted Love (1981) You might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell\u2019s version of Gloria Jones\u2019s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There\u2019s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBT 51 S-Express \u2013 Theme from S-Express (1988) To watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass\u2019s earlier acid house hits, S-Express\u2019s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound\u2019s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London\u2019s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage. LS 50 Steve \u201cSilk\u201d Hurley \u2013 Jack Your Body (1987) It\u2019s hard to imagine now how strange and alien Jack Your Body sounded in 1987. Other early house hits had at least come with a song or a hook attached, but this had neither: it may be the most minimal No 1 of all time. It isn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination the best Chicago had to offer in 1987: as a signal of a vast shift in the way pop music sounded, it\u2019s unbeatable. AP 49 Chemical Brothers \u2013 Setting Sun (feat Noel Gallagher) (1996) A half-cover of the Beatles\u2019 Tomorrow Never Knows but with that band\u2019s LSD juiced up with some kind of experimental steroid, Setting Sun still sounds extreme. Lighting up that breakbeat and demonically heaving harmonium riffs are rockets and catherine wheels of wild sound, with Noel Gallagher sounding as if he\u2019s being dragged out of sanity. BBT 48 So Solid Crew \u2013 21 Seconds (2001) A new high-water mark of commercial success for British rap was set by this incandescently brilliant wave of London MCs, each given 21 seconds of time on the mic. The energy stays permanently high, but is filtered through such distinct characters: Harvey\u2019s rave MC, Romeo\u2019s lascivious loverman, Kaish\u2019s jabbing boxer, Face\u2019s bug-eyed vampire and more. BBT 47 Suzi Quatro \u2013 Can the Can (1973) The first attempt to make Suzi Quatro a star, with the light pop of Rolling Stone, fell flat: second time around, with writers/producers Chinn and Chapman in control, everything clicked. From its opening wall of drums to Quatro\u2019s scream of \u201cscratch out her eyes\u201d to its lyrically baffling but indelible chorus, Can the Can is glam-pop perfection. AP 46 Queen \u2013 Bohemian Rhapsody (1975) Everyone with even a glancing interest in pop knows Bohemian Rhapsody, which means its sheer audacity is easy to overlook. It\u2019s a completely inexplicable, extraordinary single, a joke that got out of hand according to producer Roy Thomas Baker, a preposterous exercise in high camp with demented lyrics, that somehow still exerts a huge emotional pull. AP 45 Simon and Garfunkel \u2013 Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970) The charts in 1970 were rich with hymn-like songs solemnly marking the passing of the 60s \u2013 not least the Beatles\u2019 Let It Be \u2013 but Bridge Over Troubled Water was the blockbuster take: five minutes of booming, Phil Spector-inspired white gospel with a choirboy vocal and a simple, universal message beneath the sturm und drang. AP 44 Rick Astley \u2013 Never Gonna Give You Up (1987) More fool the person who thought up Rickrolling, believing chance exposure to Never Gonna Give You Up to be some kind of punishment: the Stock Aitken Waterman tea boy\u2019s star-making moment couldn\u2019t be less cool or more glorious, his good-boy Redcoat brogue the cheese to SAW\u2019s soulful, acid pickle. And, hey, if it was good enough for Larry Levan \u2026 LS 43 Tubeway Army \u2013 Are \u201cFriends\u201d Electric? (1979) The 80s began in British pop when the stately, epic Are \u201cFriends\u201d Electric? arrived on Top of the Pops in June 1979: two synth players, Gary Numan looking puzzled, as if he didn\u2019t understand how a song with no chorus had become a hit. He was six months early, but Numan was always ahead of his time: oft-mocked, his alienated-suburbanite-in-a-world-of-technology schtick now seems remarkably prescient. AP 42 Lady Gaga \u2013 Bad Romance (2009) Gaga\u2019s third UK No 1 outshines earlier hits Just Dance and Poker Face as the apex of her tectonic, Teutonic first-phase battering rams. While it\u2019s heavily indebted to Depeche Mode and Madonna, Gaga\u2019s weapons-grade persona turns a homage into a conquest, tagging everything in her wake with a lusty \u201cGaga, ooh la la.\u201d LS 41 East 17 \u2013 Stay Another Day (1994) One of the greatest Christmas No 1s of all time is a triumph of emotional candour. It resembles a breakup song with its talk of final kisses, but was written by Tony Mortimer after his brother killed himself. The pain of those sudden calls of \u201cstay now\u201d is so acute, voicing the suddenness of loss. BBT 40 The Four Tops \u2013 Reach Out (I\u2019ll Be There) (1966) Soaring above Reach Out\u2019s dramatic arrangement \u2013 which smashed through the boundaries of Motown\u2019s signature style, inspired by the Rolling Stones\u2019 Paint It Black, not that you\u2019d know \u2013 lead vocalist Levi Stubbs sounds as if he\u2019s close to tears, delivering the lyrics as if they\u2019re a matter of life or death. It remains an astonishingly intense way to spend three minutes. AP 39 The Jam \u2013 Going Underground (1980) A song in which disgust at Thatcher\u2019s Britain seems to meld with Paul Weller\u2019s increasing unease over the mod revival he\u2019d single-handedly started, Going Underground was also the perfect demonstration of what its author had learned studying taut, potent mid-60s pop: grab the listener from the start, don\u2019t let your grip slacken or a second go to waste. AP 38 Blondie \u2013 Heart of Glass (1979) There are plenty of arguments for Heart of Glass not really qualifying as the only UK No 1 punk single. While Blondie came from the genre\u2019s first wave in New York, their 1979 hit mainlined European electronic pioneers Kraftwerk and Heart of Glass in its brilliant, cycling riff, while Debbie Harry\u2019s rhapsodic vocals owed more to Donna Summer (whose I Feel Love the group had been covering), with a twist of downtown irony. It pissed off the punk purists back home \u2013 which is, incidentally, pretty much the most punk thing you could do by 1979. LS 37 Slade \u2013 Merry Xmas Everybody (1973) The production on Merry Xmas Everybody is fuzzy as tinsel (the result of recording in an echoey corridor), potent as plum pudding doused in brandy and appropriately poignant, straddling that late-December divide between nostalgia and optimism. Which is what, it\u2019s easy to imagine, gave it the edge over Wizzard\u2019s dementedly cheery I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday, the loser in what\u2019s now considered the original festive chart battle, though it cemented glam as the official sound of Christmas. LS 36 David Bowie \u2013 Let\u2019s Dance (1983) That opening crescendo, giving way to the Nile Rodgers-penned guitar funk riff, is one of the most breathtakingly exciting moments in Bowie\u2019s catalogue, and the croaky croon of \u201cput on your red shoes and dance the blues\u201d a few seconds later is one of the coolest. Let\u2019s Dance remains an irresistible command. BBT 35 The Pretenders \u2013 Brass in Pocket (1980) \u201cWe all just thought she was a groupie,\u201d noted the Damned\u2019s Rat Scabies of Chrissie Hynde when the Pretenders made it big, the kind of dismissive remark you suspect fuelled Brass in Pocket\u2019s surfeit of attitude: \u201cI\u2019m special.\u201d Brilliantly, it sets its narcissistic swagger to music that\u2019s languid and sensual rather than aggressive: perfect pop ensues. AP 34 Rod Stewart \u2013 Da Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? (1978) Bear in mind Rod was asking this question when his hair\u2019s volume had been turned way beyond 11, and when he was giving an audible crotch-thrust at the opening of each chorus line. And yet, even though this song is utterly ridiculous, it is also utterly brilliant \u2013 the way the synth melody steps up before pirouetting down is eternally replayable, and Rod\u2019s charisma is, sorry, a bit sexy. BBT 33 Tom Jones \u2013 It\u2019s Not Unusual (1965) On his breakthrough single, Tom Jones exhibits the kind of determined perkiness that can only accompany truly desperate heartbreak. That double negative gives his confusion away as he tries to come to terms with seeing his girl out with another guy, but it\u2019s no use: \u201cI wanna die.\u201d In a Top 100 full of savagely unhappy yet upbeat songs, this is the most emotionally dissonant of all. BBT 32 Britney Spears \u2013 \u2026 Baby One More Time (1999) \u2026 Baby One More Time wasn\u2019t the first hit from Denniz Pop and Max Martin\u2019s Cheiron Studios \u2013 Backstreet Boys and Robyn predated Britney. But the Louisiana 16-year-old was to Cheiron what Kylie was to Stock Aitken Waterman: the first act with the personality to overwhelm the blueprint (Euro melodies, metal\u2019s impact and club-pop\u2019s sparkle) and make it her own. Rockists accuse Britney Spears of being an empty vessel, but it\u2019s her vocal DNA that shapes every single word of this song into a pop landmark. LS 31 Althea and Donna \u2013 Uptown Top Ranking (1977) \u201cNah pop nah style,\u201d sang Althea and Donna, and they had a point. What\u2019s striking about the greatest reggae No 1 of all is how unvarnished its repurposing of an old Alton Ellis it is, the lack of concession to white ears as Althea and Donna riff on the lyrics of Trinity\u2019s Three Piece Suit with blank-eyed teenage insouciance. AP 30 Madonna \u2013 Vogue (1990) Of Madonna\u2019s 13 No 1s, Vogue is her most poised, agile and sexually intoxicating. It is a portal into a world of glamour \u2013 the litany of classic Hollywood in the middle eight, but also the world of peacocking ballroom culture it was borne from \u2013 where you find Madonna herself presiding over the decadence with her commands and observations. Get up on the dancefloor, indeed. BBT 29 Whitney Houston \u2013 I Wanna Dance With Somebody (1987) A masterpiece of synthetic production: the gorgeously wrong approximations of horns, bass guitar and piano have their own delirious beauty. But, of course, it\u2019s Whitney who seals it. That final chorus line, \u201cwith somebody who loves me\u201d, is so emphatic in knowing she deserves happiness, creating a paradoxically euphoric song about being lonely. BBT 28 The Kinks \u2013 You Really Got Me (1964) The arrival of You Really Got Me amid the still relatively mild No 1s of the time must have been startling \u2013 it even makes the Beatles sound like squares. One of the all time great riffs, made from only two notes, powers the garage-band energy as the group\u2019s lust builds to a ferocious head. BBT 27 George Michael \u2013 Careless Whisper (1984) Just imagine this being the third song you\u2019d ever written as a band, turning a litany of silly teenage crushes into one of the all-time great ballads (and home to the most arresting sax solo since Gerry Rafferty\u2019s Baker Street). It wasn\u2019t Wham!\u2019s third single \u2013 George Michael astutely parcelled it out later, asserting his soulful, songwriterly bona fides after a raft of more cartoonish hits, and paving the way for a different shade of solo career. LS 26 The Rolling Stones \u2013 (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction (1965) Sneering attitude and glowering negativity \u2013 provoked by everything from radio DJs to TV advertising to a lady declining to have sex with Mick Jagger because she\u2019s on her period \u2013 aligned to the most famous guitar riff in history. Satisfaction is pissed off, provocative, dirty, thrilling; everything great about the mid-60s Rolling Stones condensed into 3 minutes and 45 seconds. AP 25 Bee Gees \u2013 Night Fever (1978) Fortysomething years on, the opprobrium occasioned by the late-70s Bee Gees seems utterly baffling: the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack sounds like a masterclass in pop songwriting, as evidenced by Night Fever\u2019s perfect evocation of pre-club anticipation: \u201cOn the waves of the air / There is dancing out there \u2026 We can steal it.\u201d AP 24 Freda Payne \u2013 Band of Gold (1970) Written by Motown brains trust Holland-Dozier-Holland, Band of Gold sees Payne sitting in a lonely bedroom, her wedding night gone disastrously unconsummated after some kind of freak-out by the groom. Although the exact details are tactfully veiled by Payne, it\u2019s an unforgettably specific scenario, its horror hammered into your mind with that unyielding snare rhythm and told via a wondrous vocal line. BBT 23 The KLF \u2013 3am Eternal (1991) Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond had already written a book on how to have a No 1 record, The Manual, after their novelty chart-topper Doctorin\u2019 the Tardis. As the KLF, they brought every one of their tricks to bear on this titanic piece of rave: hip-house rapping, gospel choirs, chants about an ancient race of people and a huge synthetic guitar riff. What on earth was it on about? The mystery was the final key to its success. BBT 22 George McCrae \u2013 Rock Your Baby (1974) Ostensibly the first disco No 1 and the product of songwriters Harry Casey and Richard Finch observing what worked on the dancefloors of Miami\u2019s clubs, in truth, Rock Your Baby carved out a shimmering, supple musical space entirely of its own: organ-led, Hi Records-esque Memphis soul, complete with imploring falsetto vocal, over the hissy ticking of a primitive drum machine. AP 21 T Rex \u2013 Get It On (1971) Any of T Rex\u2019s magisterial run of No 1 singles could be in this list, but Get It On just shades it, by dint of being the most imperious sounding of the lot: the earthy R&amp;B of Chuck Berry recast into a defiantly modern shape, sexually charged in a way no teen pop had previously been. AP 20 Carly Rae Jepsen \u2013 Call Me Maybe (2012) On first listen, the song seemed deceptively featherweight. The strings sound like ringtones; the guitar parts as though they were lifted from a PlayStation 2 game. But even the most synthetic production can\u2019t detract from songwriting this ironclad. It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song; it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater. Read our full review here. Elle Hunt 19 Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) (2019) Old Town Road was unstoppable, with no apparent end to its appeal. Children rioted in their love for it. Its vast stable of remixes made it a genre-splicing Rosetta stone. But as much as the song is an urtext in how to go viral (until the rules change again), Old Town\u2019s Road\u2019s magic lies in its affirming faith that a sunnier future is just around the next bend, designer Stetson optional. Read our full review here. Owen Myers 18 Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads \u2013 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (1979) Dury told chatshow host Michael Parkinson that he wanted his success to dispel society\u2019s discomfort with and patronising attitudes to disability and provide hope to those for whom things hadn\u2019t turned out so well. Today, his best-known tune still sounds fresh and wonderfully off-kilter, a beacon of pop\u2019s ability to embrace oddity and celebrate the other. Read our full review here. Dave Simpson 17 Kylie Minogue \u2013 Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head (2001) This was always a Kylie classic in the making. Blessed with the perfect pop voice, she delivers each line with just enough blank space for the listener\u2019s own interpretations. Is it about a crush? A recent heartbreak? Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those famous \u201cla, la, las\u201d take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted. Read our full review here. Michael Cragg 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Crazy in Love (2003) The announcement of her arrival via those unforgettable blaring horns, sampled from the Chi-Lites\u2019 1970 hit Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So), erred on regal fanfare, inspiring endless struts across makeshift dancefloors-turned-catwalks to this day. Beyonc\u00e9 was auditioning for the part of pop\u2019s new reigning diva, a role she knew she had already secured. Read our full review here. Yomi Adegoke 15 Jerry Lee Lewis \u2013 Great Balls of Fire (1957) Jerry Lee still sounds more lascivious than almost anyone. The sensations simply spill out of him \u2013 not only his voice but also his piano playing, too, his right hand sliding down the keys in exhalations of delight. It was the devil\u2019s music, but Great Balls of Fire still sounds like an act of God. Read our full review here.

Built entirely around the deceptively simple refrain of \u201cAw man, I\u2019m all outta cash!\u201d, the show went all out with a bit of ratcheting insanity, leaving the audience as out of breath as Mooney\u2019s poor, pathetic struggling actor.</p> <h2><strong>Gumby</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"gumby\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uNKL9MMbjNg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The funniest segment from the season\u2019s funniest episode came with the glorious return of Murphy\u2019s cigar-chomping green curmudgeon, Gumby (dammit!), who crashes a Weekend Update segment in order to berate the hosts (he dismisses Colin Jost as \u201cheadshot\u201d and Michael Che as \u201cyou black bastard\u201d) and demand respect.

      "body": "<p>Few people understand the terrible cost of the coronavirus like Lee Snover, a Republican party chair in one of the key swing counties that could determine whether Donald Trump is reelected as president in November.</p> <p>Snover, who helped deliver an upset victory for Trump in 2016 in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, lost her father to the virus this spring. Her husband fell critically ill, too, spending 17 days in an intensive care unit before recovering. Her mother, a cancer survivor, was also in intensive care for eight days before emerging.</p> <p>\u201cIt spread through my entire family,\u201d Snover said.</p> <p>Trump stands accused of driving up the coronavirus death toll by downplaying the public health threat and urging the country to \u201creopen\u201d too quickly. But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d</p> <p>At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base.</p> <h2>The state that decides Trump\u2019s win</h2> <p>As part of his nascent return to the campaign trail during the pandemic, Trump made a trip to Snover\u2019s backyard, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, last week. He visited a medical equipment distributor and blasted Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for not easing virus mitigation measures sooner.</p> <p>\u201cNext year is going to be through the roof,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they have \u2013 they want to keep them closed. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7162af3d041d73955ac2ee8f764eb92ecfb5a80c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7162af3d041d73955ac2ee8f764eb92ecfb5a80c/0_0_5003_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters gather to welcome Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters gather to welcome Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Smith/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was only Trump\u2019s second outing since the pandemic hit, and the venue was carefully chosen. Northampton, which borders Allentown and is the subject of an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-promise\">Guardian series</a>, was one of only three counties statewide to vote twice for Barack Obama before falling for Trump in 2016; handing him the massive electoral prize of Pennsylvania \u2013 and the presidency.</p> <p>If Trump can win here again, political analysts say, he has a good chance of holding the White House.</p> <p>Christopher Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, said that the pandemic does not appear to have changed the race for Trump much in the Lehigh Valley.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this enormous thing happening, I don\u2019t see clear indicators that the race itself has changed here, in the sense that there\u2019s been only some modest movement in polls\u201d in recent months, Borick said. \u201cWhile the world has changed since the onset of the pandemic, the political calculus hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re lucky to get a president like him\u2019</h2> <p>Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 79, who has cut hair in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for more than 50 years, was also struck by tragedy this spring, when one of his best friends died from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHe and his wife caught a cold,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cHe was perfectly healthy, this was six weeks ago. She caught a cold, he caught a cold, so he said to his wife, \u2018I just can\u2019t breathe right\u2019. So they go to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>His friend fought for a week. \u201cWhen you talk about two people from Minnesota that died from it, they\u2019re just statistics,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re close to you, then you realize how real this thing is.\u201d</p> <p>Like a lot of older Democrats in a town that was once home to the legendary \u2013 and heavily unionized \u2013 Bethlehem Steel, D\u2019Ambrosio voted for both parties over the years before coming out as an early and enthusiastic Trump supporter. That support has not changed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019re so lucky that at this time in our life, we were able to get a president like him, at the right time,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protestor wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He dismissed criticism that Trump had made the country complacent by advising that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he did was damage control,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cPeople were starting to panic, buying everything, emptying the stores. He got it to calm down.\u201d</p> <p>Pennsylvania has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, mostly in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Last week Wolf announced an additional $16m in funding for food banks, where people have <a href=\"https://www.wtae.com/article/pennsylvanias-food-banks-getting-dollar16-million-in-funding/32196590\">queued up before dawn</a>, after the state shed about 2m jobs from mid-March onwards.</p> <p>Bruce Haines, a former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem, a crown jewel of the local tourism industry, said business had plunged.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like you turned off a lightbulb,\u201d Haines said on the phone from Florida. \u201cThe cancellation calls the week of 9 March were incredible. And it hit us blindly, because we were coming off our best year ever in 2019.\u201d</p> <p>Haines praised Trump\u2019s move to reopen the economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s right on target, and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd anybody who\u2019s a businessman knows that Trump\u2019s the right guy there, to bring us out of this downturn. Because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201d</p> <h2>A downward trend</h2> <p>Peg Ferraro, a Republican official popular with Democrats who for years was the only woman on the county council, retired last year and also spoke on the phone from Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, where you\u2019ve never been through it really before,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cI think he was absolutely correct in leaving it up to the governors \u2013 they know their states better than making blanket statements for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania last Thursday represented a headache for Wolf, who is in an escalating war with Republican officials over reopening the state county by county. True to a national pattern, Republicans from more rural districts in the state are less likely to see the pandemic as dangerous than Democrats, Borick said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a/0_0_4931_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump could still lose in the Lehigh Valley. Public approval of his handling of the coronavirus crisis has plunged nationally from about 50% in late March to just over 40% now, with about 55% disapproving, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/public_approval_of_president_trumps_handling_of_the_coronavirus-7088.html\">according to polling averages</a>. While there is plenty of time before the election to reverse that slide, polling in Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/pennsylvania/\"> shows a similar trend</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016 in Northampton county was narrow, spurred by record turnout.

      "bodyText": "Few people understand the terrible cost of the coronavirus like Lee Snover, a Republican party chair in one of the key swing counties that could determine whether Donald Trump is reelected as president in November. Snover, who helped deliver an upset victory for Trump in 2016 in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, lost her father to the virus this spring. Her husband fell critically ill, too, spending 17 days in an intensive care unit before recovering. Her mother, a cancer survivor, was also in intensive care for eight days before emerging. \u201cIt spread through my entire family,\u201d Snover said. Trump stands accused of driving up the coronavirus death toll by downplaying the public health threat and urging the country to \u201creopen\u201d too quickly. But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family. \u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base. The state that decides Trump\u2019s win As part of his nascent return to the campaign trail during the pandemic, Trump made a trip to Snover\u2019s backyard, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, last week. He visited a medical equipment distributor and blasted Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for not easing virus mitigation measures sooner. \u201cNext year is going to be through the roof,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they have \u2013 they want to keep them closed. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d It was only Trump\u2019s second outing since the pandemic hit, and the venue was carefully chosen. Northampton, which borders Allentown and is the subject of an ongoing Guardian series, was one of only three counties statewide to vote twice for Barack Obama before falling for Trump in 2016; handing him the massive electoral prize of Pennsylvania \u2013 and the presidency. If Trump can win here again, political analysts say, he has a good chance of holding the White House. Christopher Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, said that the pandemic does not appear to have changed the race for Trump much in the Lehigh Valley. \u201cDespite this enormous thing happening, I don\u2019t see clear indicators that the race itself has changed here, in the sense that there\u2019s been only some modest movement in polls\u201d in recent months, Borick said. \u201cWhile the world has changed since the onset of the pandemic, the political calculus hasn\u2019t.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re lucky to get a president like him\u2019 Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 79, who has cut hair in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for more than 50 years, was also struck by tragedy this spring, when one of his best friends died from the virus. \u201cHe and his wife caught a cold,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cHe was perfectly healthy, this was six weeks ago. She caught a cold, he caught a cold, so he said to his wife, \u2018I just can\u2019t breathe right\u2019. So they go to the hospital.\u201d His friend fought for a week. \u201cWhen you talk about two people from Minnesota that died from it, they\u2019re just statistics,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re close to you, then you realize how real this thing is.\u201d Like a lot of older Democrats in a town that was once home to the legendary \u2013 and heavily unionized \u2013 Bethlehem Steel, D\u2019Ambrosio voted for both parties over the years before coming out as an early and enthusiastic Trump supporter. That support has not changed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019re so lucky that at this time in our life, we were able to get a president like him, at the right time,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. He dismissed criticism that Trump had made the country complacent by advising that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d. \u201cWhat he did was damage control,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cPeople were starting to panic, buying everything, emptying the stores. He got it to calm down.\u201d Pennsylvania has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, mostly in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Last week Wolf announced an additional $16m in funding for food banks, where people have queued up before dawn, after the state shed about 2m jobs from mid-March onwards. Bruce Haines, a former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem, a crown jewel of the local tourism industry, said business had plunged. \u201cIt was like you turned off a lightbulb,\u201d Haines said on the phone from Florida. \u201cThe cancellation calls the week of 9 March were incredible. And it hit us blindly, because we were coming off our best year ever in 2019.\u201d Haines praised Trump\u2019s move to reopen the economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s right on target, and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd anybody who\u2019s a businessman knows that Trump\u2019s the right guy there, to bring us out of this downturn. Because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201d A downward trend Peg Ferraro, a Republican official popular with Democrats who for years was the only woman on the county council, retired last year and also spoke on the phone from Florida. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, where you\u2019ve never been through it really before,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cI think he was absolutely correct in leaving it up to the governors \u2013 they know their states better than making blanket statements for everybody.\u201d Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania last Thursday represented a headache for Wolf, who is in an escalating war with Republican officials over reopening the state county by county. True to a national pattern, Republicans from more rural districts in the state are less likely to see the pandemic as dangerous than Democrats, Borick said. Trump could still lose in the Lehigh Valley. Public approval of his handling of the coronavirus crisis has plunged nationally from about 50% in late March to just over 40% now, with about 55% disapproving, according to polling averages. While there is plenty of time before the election to reverse that slide, polling in Pennsylvania shows a similar trend. Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016 in Northampton county was narrow, spurred by record turnout. And his opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton, was disliked by voters in a way that Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, who grew up in Pennsylvania, does not appear to be. The unique logistics of the fall election could also go a long way in deciding the victor here, Borick said. Just last year, Pennsylvania for the first time approved absentee voting for everyone, potentially throwing the advantage in November to the party that shows better organization at standing up vote-by-mail and at getting people to the polls amid a potential second pandemic wave. And for all the president\u2019s support in the region, there is a resistance to Trump that is as galvanized as his base. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t run a one-car funeral,\u201d said Frank Behum, a former unionized steelworker and vocal Trump critic. \u201cEven my Republican friends, they\u2019re telling me they\u2019re not voting for that clown again. But you don\u2019t know \u2013 remember in the 1980s, people said they\u2019re not voting for Reagan either. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d",

With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs.</p> <p>Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can\u2019t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat.</p> <p>But Jones\u2019s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cOver the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I\u2019d say Democratic prospects in some of these individual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party\u2019s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina \u2026 would have been much harder,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political Report</a>.</p> <p>Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana. The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, launched his Senate campaign in March.

      "bodyText": "Just three months ago, centrist Democrats were panicking. After strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders appeared poised to sail away with the nomination for president. Some in the party feared the self-identified democratic socialist would wreak havoc down the ballot. \u201cIf Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,\u201d the Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, said on a February conference call. \u201cWe would not get the Senate back.\u201d The world looks different now \u2013 and so does the Senate map. With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs. Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can\u2019t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat. But Jones\u2019s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina. \u201cOver the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I\u2019d say Democratic prospects in some of these individual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cThe overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.\u201d Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party\u2019s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia. \u201cA lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina \u2026 would have been much harder,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the Cook Political Report. Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana. The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, launched his Senate campaign in March. A recent poll showed him leading the Republican incumbent, Steve Daines, by seven points, even though Trump carried Montana by 20 in 2016. \u201cI think the Democrats have done a better job of putting more races in play than the Republicans have,\u201d Kondik said, \u201calthough Republicans are just defending many more seats.\u201d Democratic candidates have seen better fundraising numbers, which party strategists say is a reflection of grassroots energy. For example, in Maine, in the first quarter of this year, Sara Gideon raised nearly three times as much money as the Republican senator Susan Collins. Incumbent Republicans face the same challenge as the president: the financial devastation caused by the pandemic has robbed them of their best talking point \u2013 the strength of the US economy. As the unemployment rate climbs and many Americans lose health coverage, Democratic strategists are quick to point out that the administration has stayed in a lawsuit from Republican state attorneys general which seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. \u201cSenate Republicans, right now, today, support a lawsuit that could toss out critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Benjamin Ray, senior director of campaign communications for the Democratic group Emily\u2019s List. \u201cIt might sound unconscionable to kick people that have gotten sick in a global pandemic off of their health insurance, but it\u2019s what incumbent Republicans want.\u201d Democratic strategists insist Republicans are also suffering as a result of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis and his party\u2019s refusal to criticize him for it. Last month, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, circulated a 57-page memo which instructed candidates: \u201cDon\u2019t defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban \u2013 attack China.\u201d After the Trump campaign lashed out, the committee was forced to backtrack, saying there was \u201cno daylight between the NRSC and President Trump\u201d. The NRSC did not offer a comment to the Guardian. Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said: \u201cRepublican senators have completely tied themselves to the president, and now they\u2019re on the hook and own the failed coronavirus response.\u201d With a majority of Americans expressing disapproval of Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, Democrats say Senate Republicans will suffer the consequences in November. \u201cIt is very clear what the Republican agenda is,\u201d Kalla said. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters are going to forget it.\u201d",

Human rights groups have condemned this cynical attempt by the kingdom to \u201csportswash\u201d its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/24/eu-nations-lead-condemnation-of-saudi-human-rights-record\">human rights abuses</a>. But there\u2019s still nothing to suggest the \u00a3300m takeover will be blocked. </p> <p>Over the past few years, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, commonly known as MBS, has spent a fortune positioning himself to the world as a moderniser. In 2017 he asked for global support in transforming the kingdom into an open society that would empower its citizens and \u2013 crucially \u2013 attract foreign investment. He has ostensibly introduced some liberal reforms, rescinding the ban on female drivers and restricting the powers of the religious police. He has also spent hundreds of millions building a global public relations machine selling his agenda to the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that Newcastle United\u2019s fans do not wish their club to be run by the architect of such brutal repression</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But detention, torture and murder have been the backdrop to this. Among the regime\u2019s abuses have been those committed during the war in Yemen \u2013 which have led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/uk-us-and-france-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes-un-report\">UN</a> to make credible allegations of war crimes. <br><br>And my fiance, the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, became a victim of the regime in October 2018. He was butchered by agents of the Saudi government in its consulate in Istanbul while I waited outside. The government tried to cover up the killing and failed. The CIA and UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-evidence-un-report\">concluded</a> that the crown prince ordered Jamal\u2019s murder.</p> <p>The gruesome killing and its aftermath greatly tarnished Bin Salman\u2019s reputation and created a massive embarrassment for the Saudi government. For a few months many world leaders avoided the crown prince and some businesses refused to do business with Saudi Arabia. However, he is now working to salvage his reputation. A network of firms, many based in London, are working round the clock to deflect attention away from human rights abuses committed by the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has hosted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/they-want-the-money-the-real-reason-boxing-is-going-to-saudi-arabia\">boxing</a> matches and a golf event, and its long-term deal with wrestling organisation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/02/sportswashing-saudi-arabia-sports-mohammed-bin-salman\">WWE</a> remains intact. These events are simply window dressing, intended to restore faith in Bin Salman\u2019s rule, not expand actual freedoms to Saudis.<br><br>Far from being an enlightened ruler, Bin Salman has shown himself to be a destabilising force in the region. During the coronavirus crisis, while other states have been scrambling to protect their citizens, he has been consolidating power. In March, he arrested <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/saudi-arabia-detains-hundreds-government-officials-200316073516389.html\">298 government employees</a>, including three senior members of the royal family, under the guise of fighting corruption. Last month, the sovereign wealth fund he chairs bought a $500m (\u00a3410m) stake in the US entertainment company Live Nation. And he has worked since the crisis began to take back lost market share through an oil price war. <br><br>The failure of the world\u2019s governments to hold Bin Salman to account in recent years has already emboldened him. Now his investment group is poised to take ownership of one of the English Premier League\u2019s most widely supported clubs. Yet the league will violate its own charter if it allows the move to go ahead: this <a href=\"https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/document/2020/05/11/9de08b33-1f94-4ac7-9868-8bb157807062/2019-20-PL-Handbook-070520.pdf\">charter</a> prohibits someone to become a club\u2019s director if \u201che has engaged in conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence \u2026 if such conduct had taken place in the United Kingdom, whether or not such conduct resulted in a conviction\u201d. I have no doubt that Newcastle United\u2019s fans do not wish their club to be run by the architect of such brutal repression. His is a regime where journalists are tortured, dissidents disappear and reformers are sentenced to death. <br><br>Amnesty International has warned that the Premier League could become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/21/amnesty-international-say-premier-league-risks-being-a-patsy-on-newcastle-united-takeover-football\">patsy</a> of those who want to use the \u201cglamour and prestige of Premier League football to cover up actions that are deeply immoral\u201d. Human Rights Watch has accused Saudi Arabia of using football \u201cas a PR tool to distract from its abysmal human rights record\u201d. Still, the Premier League has refused to block Bin Salman\u2019s desperate attempt to protect his image. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/13/jamal-khashoggis-fiancee-urges-newcastle-fans-to-oppose-takeover\">Jamal Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e urges Newcastle fans to oppose takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadly, the UK culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government is unlikely to step in. But it is time for the governments of the west and all responsible national bodies to hold Bin Salman accountable. Their inaction in recent years has given him the belief that he can do whatever he likes without risking repercussions.</p> <p>Here is a chance for the Premier League to make it plain that criminals and tyrants are not welcome in the most respected football competition in the world. And if it does not take this opportunity, its own reputation will be stained for good. Rest assured that those about to take over Newcastle have blood on their hands.</p> <p>\u2022 Hatice Cengiz was the fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi</p>",

He has ostensibly introduced some liberal reforms, rescinding the ban on female drivers and restricting the powers of the religious police. He has also spent hundreds of millions building a global public relations machine selling his agenda to the world. But detention, torture and murder have been the backdrop to this. Among the regime\u2019s abuses have been those committed during the war in Yemen \u2013 which have led the UN to make credible allegations of war crimes. And my fiance, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, became a victim of the regime in October 2018. He was butchered by agents of the Saudi government in its consulate in Istanbul while I waited outside. The government tried to cover up the killing and failed. The CIA and UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings have concluded that the crown prince ordered Jamal\u2019s murder. The gruesome killing and its aftermath greatly tarnished Bin Salman\u2019s reputation and created a massive embarrassment for the Saudi government. For a few months many world leaders avoided the crown prince and some businesses refused to do business with Saudi Arabia. However, he is now working to salvage his reputation. A network of firms, many based in London, are working round the clock to deflect attention away from human rights abuses committed by the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has hosted boxing matches and a golf event, and its long-term deal with wrestling organisation WWE remains intact. These events are simply window dressing, intended to restore faith in Bin Salman\u2019s rule, not expand actual freedoms to Saudis. Far from being an enlightened ruler, Bin Salman has shown himself to be a destabilising force in the region. During the coronavirus crisis, while other states have been scrambling to protect their citizens, he has been consolidating power. In March, he arrested 298 government employees, including three senior members of the royal family, under the guise of fighting corruption. Last month, the sovereign wealth fund he chairs bought a $500m (\u00a3410m) stake in the US entertainment company Live Nation. And he has worked since the crisis began to take back lost market share through an oil price war. The failure of the world\u2019s governments to hold Bin Salman to account in recent years has already emboldened him. Now his investment group is poised to take ownership of one of the English Premier League\u2019s most widely supported clubs. Yet the league will violate its own charter if it allows the move to go ahead: this charter prohibits someone to become a club\u2019s director if \u201che has engaged in conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence \u2026 if such conduct had taken place in the United Kingdom, whether or not such conduct resulted in a conviction\u201d. I have no doubt that Newcastle United\u2019s fans do not wish their club to be run by the architect of such brutal repression. His is a regime where journalists are tortured, dissidents disappear and reformers are sentenced to death. Amnesty International has warned that the Premier League could become a patsy of those who want to use the \u201cglamour and prestige of Premier League football to cover up actions that are deeply immoral\u201d. Human Rights Watch has accused Saudi Arabia of using football \u201cas a PR tool to distract from its abysmal human rights record\u201d. Still, the Premier League has refused to block Bin Salman\u2019s desperate attempt to protect his image. Sadly, the UK culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government is unlikely to step in. But it is time for the governments of the west and all responsible national bodies to hold Bin Salman accountable. Their inaction in recent years has given him the belief that he can do whatever he likes without risking repercussions. Here is a chance for the Premier League to make it plain that criminals and tyrants are not welcome in the most respected football competition in the world. And if it does not take this opportunity, its own reputation will be stained for good. Rest assured that those about to take over Newcastle have blood on their hands. \u2022 Hatice Cengiz was the fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi",

Soap producers are already in discussion about when to resume and what protective measures will have to be taken.</p> <p>In Australia, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/asia/neighbours-australian-soap-opera-resumes-production-1234585708/\">Neighbours is already back in production</a>, with the cast filming in accordance with social distancing guidelines. The UK is bound to follow suit soon, with protective measures likely to include filming characters six feet apart and temporarily writing out elderly cast members. As ITV boss <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/older-actors-written-out-coronation-street-emmerdale-coronavirus-a4428811.html%3famp\">Kevin Lygo</a> put it: \u201cI don\u2019t want Ken Barlow getting sick on my watch.\u201d</p> <p>So what will our favourite soaps look like in the age of coronavirus?</p> <h2>Eastenders</h2> <p>The early days of lockdown are particularly dark in Walford. Ian Beale is arrested after refusing to lose takings by shutting the chippy and caff. Danny Dyer\u2019s Mick Carter has a breakdown after failing to come up with Cockney rhyming slang for \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. Sharon dies in a tragic home bleaching accident after struggling without a hairdresser for six weeks.</p> <p>But The Vic reopening cheers the Square \u2013 at least to the usual level of misery. A socially distanced pub brawl quickly ensues, with Phil Mitchell lobbing whisky glasses at the regulars as barmaid Tracey looks on in silence. He keeps a two-metre distance at all times so avoids jail, yet again.</p> <h2>Emmerdale</h2> <p>This is an ideal time for the soap to revert to its Emmerdale Farm origins. Nothing says social distancing like agriculture. Cast members can stretch themselves out over the Yorkshire Dales, whilst viewers de-stress with a more gentle pace. Forget <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2019/04/08/emmerdale-spoilers-teacher-maya-sacked-after-abuse-of-jacob-is-exposed-9130028/amp/\">sex offenders </a>and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1232612/emmerdale-graham-foster-killer-pierce-harris-itv-video/amp\">murder</a>,<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1232612/emmerdale-graham-foster-killer-pierce-harris-itv-video/amp\"> </a>the nation\u2019s mental health demands cows and greenery.

With Home Farm workers stuck on furlough and unable to pay rent, the village will finally see a class uprising. It is a bloody revolution, with Kim Tate drowned in a bathtub of champagne. The Dingles become the new Lords of the manor.</p> <h2>Neighbours</h2> <p>Australia has recorded <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/world/1278337/Australia-coronavirus-herd-immunity-Scott-Morrison-UK-US-covid-19/amp\">fewer than 100 coronavirus deaths</a>, so British government ministers may wish to tune in to Ramsay Street for tips ahead of the next Sage meeting.</p> <p>There they will see: Toadie emerges from lockdown with a new mullet; Dr. Karl Kennedy moonlights from saving lives by putting on gigs at Lassiters, social distancing mean there\u2019s a dozen people in the audience \u2013 Karl\u2019s highest turnout yet. Affairs are tricky when you\u2019re metres apart so hotel tycoon Paul Robinson sticks with his current wife. Everyone continues to look incredibly attractive.</p> <h2>Doctors</h2> <p>No soap is better placed than Doctors to handle a pandemic. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to bring in topical coronavirus storylines, from patients suffering with symptoms to staff working without PPE.</p> <p>Why not take it further, though, with the cast of Doctors brought in to work as real life medics. As trained actor-GPs, they are perfectly placed to diagnose an ingrowing toenail or hay fever, freeing up real frontline workers to take on the serious business of coronavirus. Holby City donated <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-52250706\">working ventilators to the Nightingale hospital</a>, the line between reality and medical soap is already blurring.</p> <h2>Hollyoaks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcdd4016658b3d8199c974e90a82bcb4b13d1e48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcdd4016658b3d8199c974e90a82bcb4b13d1e48/161_268_3219_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hollyoaks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The original Hollyoaks crew never had to deal with a global pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With some experts pushing for <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/07/allow-young-people-lockdown-early-get-country-moving-claim-business/amp/\">young people to be released from lockdown</a> first, Hollyoaks \u2013 the nation\u2019s youth soap \u2013 could become a daily public health broadcast. Tony Hutchinson, who in his early forties is the village elder of the cast, will become a case study in shielding. His upcoming <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/hollyoaks-fans-predict-devastating-tony-21980025.amp\">brain tumour storyline</a> will demonstrate a hard pressed NHS struggling under a decade of austerity as his neighbours \u2013 all under the age of 25 \u2013 return to college and employment.</p> <p>In a satirical commentary on intergenerational inequality, Hollyoaks enters a recession and the young population contemplate their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">\u201cdole queue future\u201d</a>. Everyone can still afford makeup though, and continues to look incredibly attractive.</p> <h2>Coronation Street</h2> <p>Coronation bosses have said coronavirus will be lightly included in storylines when it returns, in order to enable the soap to keep <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/entertainment-arts-52548379\">\u201creflecting modern Britain\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Thank God. The nation needs to see Gail Platt in isolation, ideally drunk and inviting people into her freshly scrubbed annex. A month into lockdown with husband Steve, Tracey Barlow will be debating whether she can get <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2016/05/25/coronation-street-spoilers-callum-logans-body-has-been-found-heres-what-happens-next-5904382/\">away with murder</a> for the second time. Meanwhile, Sally Metcalfe (nee Webster) takes on the role of street informant, reporting neighbours for exercising more than once a day or not clapping for the NHS hard enough.</p> <p>Whatever happens, I just need double episodes back. Because if the truth doesn\u2019t come out about <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2020/05/06/coronation-street-spoilers-sally-discovers-geoffs-abuse-yasmeen-12664430/amp/\">Geoff\u2019s domestic abuse of Yasmeen</a> soon, I will get a placard, pick my favourite conspiracy theory, and join my nearest \u201cend the lockdown\u201d protest.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With episodes of EastEnders and Coronation Street set to run out by June news that the government has said that filming can soon start up again couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Soap producers are already in discussion about when to resume and what protective measures will have to be taken. In Australia, Neighbours is already back in production, with the cast filming in accordance with social distancing guidelines. The UK is bound to follow suit soon, with protective measures likely to include filming characters six feet apart and temporarily writing out elderly cast members. As ITV boss Kevin Lygo put it: \u201cI don\u2019t want Ken Barlow getting sick on my watch.\u201d So what will our favourite soaps look like in the age of coronavirus? Eastenders The early days of lockdown are particularly dark in Walford. Ian Beale is arrested after refusing to lose takings by shutting the chippy and caff. Danny Dyer\u2019s Mick Carter has a breakdown after failing to come up with Cockney rhyming slang for \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. Sharon dies in a tragic home bleaching accident after struggling without a hairdresser for six weeks. But The Vic reopening cheers the Square \u2013 at least to the usual level of misery. A socially distanced pub brawl quickly ensues, with Phil Mitchell lobbing whisky glasses at the regulars as barmaid Tracey looks on in silence. He keeps a two-metre distance at all times so avoids jail, yet again. Emmerdale This is an ideal time for the soap to revert to its Emmerdale Farm origins. Nothing says social distancing like agriculture. Cast members can stretch themselves out over the Yorkshire Dales, whilst viewers de-stress with a more gentle pace. Forget sex offenders and murder, the nation\u2019s mental health demands cows and greenery. Key storylines will include \u201cbonniest sheep\u201d and \u201cYorkshire\u2019s biggest marrow\u201d. When ratings inevitably dip, producers move to sex things up. With Home Farm workers stuck on furlough and unable to pay rent, the village will finally see a class uprising. It is a bloody revolution, with Kim Tate drowned in a bathtub of champagne. The Dingles become the new Lords of the manor. Neighbours Australia has recorded fewer than 100 coronavirus deaths, so British government ministers may wish to tune in to Ramsay Street for tips ahead of the next Sage meeting. There they will see: Toadie emerges from lockdown with a new mullet; Dr. Karl Kennedy moonlights from saving lives by putting on gigs at Lassiters, social distancing mean there\u2019s a dozen people in the audience \u2013 Karl\u2019s highest turnout yet. Affairs are tricky when you\u2019re metres apart so hotel tycoon Paul Robinson sticks with his current wife. Everyone continues to look incredibly attractive. Doctors No soap is better placed than Doctors to handle a pandemic. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to bring in topical coronavirus storylines, from patients suffering with symptoms to staff working without PPE. Why not take it further, though, with the cast of Doctors brought in to work as real life medics. As trained actor-GPs, they are perfectly placed to diagnose an ingrowing toenail or hay fever, freeing up real frontline workers to take on the serious business of coronavirus. Holby City donated working ventilators to the Nightingale hospital, the line between reality and medical soap is already blurring. Hollyoaks With some experts pushing for young people to be released from lockdown first, Hollyoaks \u2013 the nation\u2019s youth soap \u2013 could become a daily public health broadcast. Tony Hutchinson, who in his early forties is the village elder of the cast, will become a case study in shielding. His upcoming brain tumour storyline will demonstrate a hard pressed NHS struggling under a decade of austerity as his neighbours \u2013 all under the age of 25 \u2013 return to college and employment. In a satirical commentary on intergenerational inequality, Hollyoaks enters a recession and the young population contemplate their \u201cdole queue future\u201d. Everyone can still afford makeup though, and continues to look incredibly attractive. Coronation Street Coronation bosses have said coronavirus will be lightly included in storylines when it returns, in order to enable the soap to keep \u201creflecting modern Britain\u201d. Thank God. The nation needs to see Gail Platt in isolation, ideally drunk and inviting people into her freshly scrubbed annex. A month into lockdown with husband Steve, Tracey Barlow will be debating whether she can get away with murder for the second time. Meanwhile, Sally Metcalfe (nee Webster) takes on the role of street informant, reporting neighbours for exercising more than once a day or not clapping for the NHS hard enough. Whatever happens, I just need double episodes back. Because if the truth doesn\u2019t come out about Geoff\u2019s domestic abuse of Yasmeen soon, I will get a placard, pick my favourite conspiracy theory, and join my nearest \u201cend the lockdown\u201d protest.",

      "body": "<p>Major League Baseball is still looking for ways to get its season underway, nearly two months after the campaign should have started. South Korea and Taiwan have already resumed baseball without fans during the Covid-19 pandemic, and MLB reportedly envisions <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29183345/mlb-safety-proposal-includes-10000-tests-per-week-social-distancing?platform=amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true\">an 82-game season beginning in early July</a>. But for that to happen, the owners and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) need to reach a labor agreement encompassing everything from salary distribution to testing guidelines to suitable playing facilities.</p> <p>This week, MLB owners approved a plan that would pay players a percentage of their 2020 salaries based on a 50-50 split between players and owners of MLB\u2019s revenue from the regular season and postseason. That is a non-starter for the players union, which refuses to agree to any deal that they feel represents a salary cap.</p> <p>So what exactly are the disagreements between the owners and players? And will those differences imperil any chance at the 2020 season?</p> <p><strong>Why are the players upset?</strong></p> <p>The players feel like they are being asked to inherit all the risk while making most of the financial sacrifices. While baseball players can socially distance in a way that their counterparts in basketball and football cannot while competing, they will inevitably be close enough to one another to risk spreading the coronavirus. Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whatwouldDOOdo/status/1259920490992410626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">voiced some of those concerns</a> on Twitter last week while Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Blake Snell claimed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29174318/rays-ace-blake-snell-says-refuses-play-reduced-salary\">he didn\u2019t want to accept a reduced salary</a> with so many unknowns regarding the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/blake-snell-mlb-season-coronavirus-tampa-bay-rays\">'Bro, I'm risking my life': Rays' Snell says playing for reduced pay not worth it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MLB, unlike the NBA, NHL and NFL, doesn\u2019t have a salary cap and doesn\u2019t split revenue between players and organizations.

This week, however, the owners proposed a 50-50 revenue split \u2013 which would mean even less money for the players \u2013 because of the major losses they\u2019re taking without attendance.

No, because it is a necessary move to fight COVID-19 in a scientific way and conducive to prevention measures and development of vaccines and medicines. </strong>Washington\u2019s smear that a Wuhan lab was the virus origin has been universally opposed by scientists, but the US is still irrationally calling for an investigation. It is obviously an unfair and unscientific appeal that China will never accept.</p> \n   <p><strong>Some people in Europe and Australia echoed the US proposal for an independent investigation, against which China is certainly vigilant. Do some people in Canberra and other places follow Washington politically and conceal their political intention toward China?</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>A politicized appeal won\u2019t be supported at the assembly</strong>. Five Eyes doesn\u2019t represent the entire world and the US cannot control other countries at will. The US has messed up its COVID-19 fight but intends to shift the responsibility onto China. Such a plan is bound to backfire.</p> \n   <p>We hereby call on all countries of the world, including Western countries, not to be held hostage by Washington\u2019s plot, to uphold the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2018s mission of serving the world\u2019s public health needs and jointly opposing any politicization of the organization. </p> \n   <p>A scientific investigation should be carried out. But first of all, it should be led by WHO rather than any country or regional organization. Second, the investigation needs to be scientific and fair. Not only China-related factors, but also those related to the US and other countries need to be included. Earlier confirmed cases than the previously known first infected case have continuously been found in the US. Among those diagnosed as having flu last winter, how many were coronavirus infections? All these clues shouldn\u2019t be missed.</p> \n   <p>Investigating the origin of the virus is only one part of the coronavirus fight. The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA?

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we are going to leave the live blog for this evening. If you need to catch up on the biggest news of the day you can read the summary here. Or in a shorter way: Australia reported its 99th confirmed death of a coronavirus patient NSW students will return to classrooms full-time from 25 May Australia has the backing of 122 nations for a global investigation into the Covid-19 outbreak Twelve McDonald\u2019s outlets in Melbourne\u2019s north and west have been shut due to a delivery driver testing positive for coronavirus New strict transport rules in NSW will mean a maximum of 12 people on a bus at one time, 32 in a train carriage, and 45 on a ferry Labor leader Anthony Albanese has backed reducing jobseeker below its current level but higher than the former newstart payment. Our international live blog will take you through the night for all the latest global coronavirus news. The Victorian department of health has confirmed the previous statement from the Villa Maria nursing home on a second test that the resident who initially had inconclusive test results for coronavirus has now tested negative. Students in New South Wales will be in classrooms full-time from Monday 25 May. I\u2019ve confirmed reporting by Nine and the ABC this evening. Most students in the state are currently at one day in classrooms per week. Premier Gladys Berejiklian is set to announce the change tomorrow. The ABC is reporting that students in NSW will return to classrooms full-time from Monday. They say premier Gladys Berejiklian will announce the change tomorrow. On the NSW-Queensland border closure until September, Kelly says the national cabinet has never provided advice on domestic borders, just the national border. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed it has been necessary to shut them down.\u201d He says it is a decision for the state government. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said the border between the two states will likely remain closed until September. He says national cabinet has discussed how reopening borders would fit into the three-step plan, and notes that yesterday there were more cases in Queensland than NSW. But he repeats it is ultimately a decision for the Queensland government. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is on ABC\u2019s RN Drive. He\u2019s asked about the decision to scale back the number of briefings to three times a week. He says they\u2019re still available to answer questions, but there\u2019s just less going on. At some of the last few briefings, he says just one journalist has turned up. Aboriginal health organisations say the Queensland government is holding back a $3.3m national rollout of rapid Covid-19 testing in remote Aboriginal communities, putting concerns for health worker safety ahead of conducting what they say is a \u201cgold standard\u201d test endorsed by the World Health Organization and already being used in other states and territories. I\u2019m Josh Taylor, I\u2019ll be taking you through the live blog for the rest of the evening. Thanks to my colleague Calla Wahlquist for her efforts this afternoon. Villa Maria Catholic Homes has released a statement saying that a resident of their Bundoora home did not return a positive test result to Covid-19. The test was inconclusive, but all inconclusive tests are being treated as positive by the Victorian health department. VMCH said a subsequent test was negative, but the home\u2019s still locked down. Here\u2019s the full statement: Over the weekend a resident at VMCH Bundoora Aged Care Residence was admitted to hospital with a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius. As this is a symptom of COVID-19, the resident was tested, with the initial test results being inconclusive (neither negative nor positive). The Department of Health is currently treating all inconclusive results as positive. As a result, the entire residence is now in lockdown until the Public Health Unit advises us this can end. The resident has subsequently returned home, as they are no longer displaying any symptoms. Further testing has produced a negative result, however the Department of Health are taking precautionary measures and have requested two more negative test results, to be undertaken 48 hours apart. Family members have been informed and all residents and staff are being closely monitored. All residents who have had close contact with the person are now in isolation within our residence. Staff who have had close contact with the person are in self-isolation at home. All other staff are being tested for COVID-19. Should any signs of ill health appear, we will seek medical attention immediately. On that note I will hand over to my colleague Josh Taylor who will take you through the evening. Imagine the sadness of swinging by to pick up a sausage and egg McMuffin, and seeing this sign. About 1,000 people work across the 12 McDonald\u2019s stores that were closed for deep cleaning. Of those, several hundred have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days because they were on shift when the delivery driver attended the restaurant, or worked shifts after the driver\u2019s visit. South Australia has also recorded no new cases of Covid-19. Again. The last person with the last active case of Covid-19 in SA was declared recovered on Friday. The state hasn\u2019t recorded a new case since 7 May, and before that it had 14 days with no new cases. Is it any wonder states like SA and WA don\u2019t want to play with states like Victoria and NSW? Western Australia recorded no new cases of Covid-19 overnight and currently has just three active cases. Let\u2019s go back to that Victorian update now. Victoria has recorded eight new Covid-19 cases overnight. There was a bit of double-counting so the total has only increased by six, to 1,567 of which 161 are confirmed to be cases of community transmission. One of the new cases was the residents of the Villa Maria aged care facility in Bundoora, mentioned earlier. Another one was the delivery driver whose positive test led to the closure of 12 McDonald\u2019s restaurants throughout Melbourne today. The driver was a contact of a case from the McDonald\u2019s Fawkner cluster, which now stands at 12 cases. Another case was a close contact of a person in the Sunshine Hospital outbreak, bringing the number of cases in that outbreak to three. Three more cases were returned travellers in mandatory quarantine, and two are under investigation. There were no new cases linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak, which stands at 99. The most telling line out of Kelly\u2019s press conference came right at the end \u2014 instead of daily briefings, the office of the national chief medical officer will now only be doing a press briefing on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. They have been doing daily briefings since early March. What if a vaccine for Covid-19 is developed and some people refuse to get it? Kelly says he is \u201cnot in favour of compulsory vaccination\u201d in cases of conscientious objection, but that he was sure there would be a \u201cvery strong uptake\u201d of a Covid-19 vaccine if one becomes available. Given how much we\u2019ve seen and the devastation that this virus has caused around the world, that people will be queuing up for vaccination rather than the opposite. Isn\u2019t there a risk that could create a pocket of anti-vaxxers in which the virus could spread? Kelly: There\u2019s always a pocket of people that are against vaccinations. What I\u2019ve found, though, in these sort of circumstances, where there has been death and severe illness, people are much more attuned to getting the vaccine than previously. We\u2019ve noticed, for example, almost double the number of flu vaccines have been delivered and injected already in this year compared with last year. And I think that\u2019s part of this sort of general sense that vaccination is a good thing. He was also asked about the risk to Australia of not being able to access a Covid-19 vaccine, if a successful vaccine is developed elsewhere first. One of the nine vaccine candidates is being developed in Australia. Kelly says Australia needs to guard against vaccine nationalism, because the virus does not know borders. We may not win the race, but we\u2019re part of the race, and we will be looking to develop a vaccine herein Australia. If it isn\u2019t the first vaccine that\u2019s available, we\u2019ll be looking to join that effort to vaccinate people \u2014 it\u2019s really important that we do that in a way that is global, because infections don\u2019t know borders. Let\u2019s go back to the deputy national chief medical officer, Paul Kelly. He was asked about the motion of inquiry which will go before the World Health Assembly tonight. (You can read an explainer on that here.) The motion of inquiry does not explicitly mention China. Kelly said that does not weaken the process. I think the most important thing \u2014 rather than apportioning blame to one particular country or another country \u2014 is that we get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened. And part of that is about the origin, where this virus came from \u2013 as we understand it, to be a zoonotic disease, spread from an animal or animals into humans \u2013 I think that\u2019s an important component of it. But there is much that\u2019s happened with this pandemic since the beginning and I think, looking at the entire way that it has spread so rapidly around the world and what\u2019s happened in different countries in the ways that different countries have approached that problem will be part of that investigation. And I hope that that resolution will be successful. One of the six new cases of Covid-19 reported overnight in Victoria is a resident at a Melbourne aged care home, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton has said. Sutton said there has been a single case detected at the Villa Maria Aged Care facility in Bundoora, in Melbourne\u2019s north. The resident is being well cared for and has been isolated in their room since developing mild symptoms. Staff have been using full PPE to care for the resident since they developed symptoms. Comprehensive contact tracing is under way and testing of all staff and residents will take place over the coming days. Residents and families are all being informed, and the department is working closely with the facility to ensure appropriate public health actions have been taken, including isolation, quarantine and cleaning. Kelly is asked to weigh in on the decision of some states \u2013 every state except Victoria, New South Wales, and the ACT, basically \u2013 to keep their domestic borders closed despite a flattening of the curve and easing of other restrictions. Kelly notes that the national cabinet, and national health advisors, never recommended internal state borders be closed. That\u2019s been a decision by various states, and it will be their decision as to whether to open them. But if you look at when those decisions were made \u2013 some weeks ago \u2013 we had a rapidly increasing number of cases each day right around Australia, but particularly in the south-eastern corner of the nation. When you look at what\u2019s happening now with just very few cases, only just over 100 cases in the last week, and only 11 in the last 24 hours \u2014 I think that things have changed a lot. But that\u2019ll be a decision for those states that have closed borders. Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia, the NT and Queensland introduced border restrictions in late March, at the peak of Australia\u2019s daily incidence rate and after all had imported a bunch of cases from the Ruby Princess\u2019s bungled arrival in Sydney. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, is addressing the media in Canberra now. Here are the latest numbers: There are 7,060 reported cases of Covid-19 in Australia Ninety-nine people have died Fewer than 700 of those recorded cases are still active \u2014 most people have recovered Forty-five people remain in hospital, 12 in intensive care and seven on ventilators. More than 1m Covid-19 tests have been conducted, and fewer than 1% of those tests are positive Kelly says the virus curve in Australia \u201ccertainly is very flat at the moment and remaining so, but we\u2019re watching very carefully because of the changes in restrictions that have occurred in the last week or so around Australia\u201d. He says he expects to see \u201csmall outbreaks going forward\u201d as restrictions are released. Network Ten\u2019s online news site, 10 Daily, will close at the end of the week, leaving 20 editorial staff out of work. It comes four days after BuzzFeed jettisoned its Australian news team, making five editorial staff redundant. More than 150 Australian newsrooms have closed since January last year. Like most online news outlets, 10 Daily had been smashing its performance targets since the coronavirus pandemic began. The pandemic has also hit ad revenue, but ViacomCBS Australia and New Zealand\u2019s chief content officer, Beverly McGarvey, said told staff the closure was not solely due to that. The recent impact of Covid-19 on the media industry has reinforced the need to continue to align our business with our evolving customer needs and global business model, but I want to stress that the changes are part of our broader strategy, not a reaction to recent events. Read Matilda Boseley\u2019s full story here: Thanks to Amy Remeikis for holding our hand through the day so far. While we wait for deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly, let\u2019s look to Western Australia, where the government has established a formal conciliation service to help tenants negotiate with their landlords about coronavirus-related tenancy disputes. You\u2019ll recall that the national cabinet resolved on 29 March that there should be a 6-month moratorium on evictions due to non-payment of rent, but the actual enforcement of that resolution has been left up to the states. Consumer Protection WA today announced the establishment of the Residential Tenancies Mandatory Conciliation Service, which aims to help \u201call sides to reach a fair and achievable solution through informal discussion\u201d. The mandatory conciliation service is tied to legislation that enforces the six-month moratorium on evictions and rent increases. Here\u2019s general manager, Trish Blake. It\u2019s a relaxed environment and gives people the power to choose the outcome in a non-adversarial setting. If you are involved in a dispute being conciliated by the service, you must take part in the process. This means you have to at least talk to the conciliator and be involved in a discussion with your landlord or tenant. The conciliator will be flexible to ensure you have every reasonable opportunity to participate and have your issues heard. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly will be delivering today\u2019s national update. Calla Wahlquist will take you through that. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more Covid and political news. We should have a better idea of what is happening with the barley tariffs by then, as well as the EU resolution. Thank you again for joining us. And please, take care of you. Footy is (almost) back. Training for the greatest game began today #GoPies The Korea Times has an article on the contagiousness (or otherwise) of people who have been re-infected with Covid-19, based on South Korea\u2019s information: Patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus after recovering from their first bout of the disease do not infect other people, health authorities said Monday. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said it will not apply 14-day self-quarantine rules to such patients after concluding that the virus detected from relapse cases does not make other people sick. \u2018There have been no secondary infections from people who were in close contact with such patients,\u2019 Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health ministry official, told reporters. \u2018Also, the results from culture tests back up the conclusion.\u2019 So far, officials have confirmed 447 relapse cases, about 4.5% of all infection cases. While we are discussing the proposed Covid-19 inquiry, this report from The Daily Beast is quite interesting. Let\u2019s remember that Australia is a middle power. It doesn\u2019t have the diplomatic grunt to pull this sort of thing off in the world stage. It can help, and nudge, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a country with 25m people. Asked to what extent the EU did the legwork on the resolution, as opposed to Australia, Marise Payne acknowledges the work the bloc did in getting the motion off the ground. This is the EU\u2019s motion. Not Australia\u2019s. It\u2019s an important distinction, despite some of the rah-rah headlines. Payne: We have been very clear about the opportunity to support the EU resolution going to the WHA, it is a very detailed piece of work and our support has been, all focused on making sure we achieve the most productive outcome, which is the comprehensive, impartial independent review. To have been able to work with the EU and many others in support of this resolution has been a important series of steps to bring us today. I don\u2019t want to preempt speculate about the outcome, those discussions will be under way later this evening, Australian time. Importantly, the encouragement and input of so many parties, is, I think a real signal of the importance of the call for an independent international review and the outcome we have all wanted to see. I think it\u2019s a win for the international community, and Australia as a strong and active part of the international community, we would see it that way. Is Australia now in a trade war with China? Marise Payne still says no. I think the trade minister has been clear about that, yesterday and again today. We deal with issues on their merits as they arise, and that is what we have been doing in relation to barley and other issues, in particular, and that is what we have consistently done. One thing Australia is very sure of in terms of the steps we are taking is the importance of being consistent, of being clear, and of ensuring that we are working through each issue as it comes to us. On her \u201cpoacher and gamekeeper comments\u201d from just a month ago, Marise Payne says the EU motion includes the words \u201cimpartial and independent\u201d. I think in what is a comprehensive resolution, you will see the review is specifically referred to as impartial, independent and comprehensive. They are three factors which we particularly have sought. The prime minister and I have also discussed a number of mechanisms within the WHO, including their independent oversight advisory body, which has the capacity to do some of this work, but that is to be determined after the resolution is dealt with by the World Health Assembly, and, of course, we\u2019ve also been very clear in relation to the time of an inquiry of this nature that there are countries around the world, including some of those who have been prepared to cosponsor or sign up to this resolution who are still dealing with some of the most difficult aspects of the response. They are at the peak level of the crisis, and some are yet to experience that level. So we are very aware of that in terms of the timing as well. The Australian foreign minister, who very, very, very rarely holds press conferences, particularly solo, has stepped out in Penrith to speak about the EU World Health Assembly motion. We are very encouraged by the growing levels of support for this comprehensive world health assembly motion that will be discussed later this week. This is a process that is under way and continuing, so I am very careful to be observant of that, but the number of countries that have indicated their support, in fact are cosponsoring the resolution, drafted by the European Union, is very encouraging and we hope to a positive outcome later this week. Mark McGowan says Gladys Berejiklian is \u201cpersistent\u201d but WA will not be opening its borders \u201cuntil we deem it is the right time for the health of Western Australians\u201d. The WA says keeping the borders with the east means more restrictions can be relaxed within WA. The City of Melbourne will give international students $200 vouchers to shop for food at Queen Victoria Markets as part of a $200,000 program to support the students, who are not eligible for any government welfare, and support the struggling markets. As Luke Henriques-Gomes reported, international students have been relying on food banks and restaurants giving away free food to survive. The markets are open but have seen a drop in trade. Students can apply online for the vouchers and collect them from Melbourne town hall from Tuesday, 26 May. The program was announced ahead of the city\u2019s 2020-2021 budget. Councillor Philip Le Liu said Melbourne\u2019s international student community needed support. Thousands of international students live in our municipality \u2013 many of whom have lost their jobs and have little access to government support. Our food voucher program is a simple but effective way we can help make this time less stressful. We must protect our education institutions and create a platform for recovery so that international students feel welcomed and supported in Melbourne.\u201d Higher education, particularly courses geared to international students, is a big industry in Melbourne. Almost two thirds of jobs in the City of Melbourne itself are linked to the \u201cknowledge sector\u201d, the council said. It looks like China may back the EU World Health Assembly motion, if the hawkish Global Times (state media) editorial is anything to go by - but only if certain conditions are met. The paper has published this: Will China oppose scientific research into the virus\u2019 origin? No, because it is a necessary move to fight COVID-19 in a scientific way and conducive to prevention measures and development of vaccines and medicines. Washington\u2019s smear that a Wuhan lab was the virus origin has been universally opposed by scientists, but the US is still irrationally calling for an investigation. It is obviously an unfair and unscientific appeal that China will never accept. Some people in Europe and Australia echoed the US proposal for an independent investigation, against which China is certainly vigilant. Do some people in Canberra and other places follow Washington politically and conceal their political intention toward China? A politicized appeal won\u2019t be supported at the assembly. Five Eyes doesn\u2019t represent the entire world and the US cannot control other countries at will. The US has messed up its COVID-19 fight but intends to shift the responsibility onto China. Such a plan is bound to backfire. We hereby call on all countries of the world, including Western countries, not to be held hostage by Washington\u2019s plot, to uphold the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2018s mission of serving the world\u2019s public health needs and jointly opposing any politicization of the organization. A scientific investigation should be carried out. But first of all, it should be led by WHO rather than any country or regional organization. Second, the investigation needs to be scientific and fair. Not only China-related factors, but also those related to the US and other countries need to be included. Earlier confirmed cases than the previously known first infected case have continuously been found in the US. Among those diagnosed as having flu last winter, how many were coronavirus infections? All these clues shouldn\u2019t be missed. Investigating the origin of the virus is only one part of the coronavirus fight. The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA? It is the US that should feel it failed the international community. The proposal that will eventually be adopted by the assembly will not be one that only meets US requests. No matter where the virus originated, the challenge is for all people around the world. The international community should be vigilant and reject the US attempt to politicize the investigation and create new disputes. Only a small number of WHO members will cheer for the island of Taiwan, putting on nothing but a farce. Asked if she believes Australia\u2019s internal borders should re-open (something Gladys Berejiklian really wants, particularly with Queensland), Jane Halton says: I can\u2019t speak for the commission, because obviously that\u2019s not my job. My job is to provide advice to business and to government. And this is obviously a difficult issue at the moment. And people are taking a fairly conservative approach to issues around borders. One of the things that I think we do need to understand is that our economy doesn\u2019t work in hermetically sealed spheres. And within the bounds of what is sensible, from a medical and other perspective, enabling businesses to move products around, enabling workers - to the extent that they can safely - to return to work, including if that means travelling across borders, I think is a sensible thing to do. Now, I understand people are very nervous about the speed at which we open up. And I do think that we all have to remind ourselves, and I think we\u2019ve all seen behaviour like this over the last few days. I think a lot of people go \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s all good now\u2019 \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen an absence of social distancing out in public. And I would remind people - it\u2019s not all good now. And you\u2019ve still got a grandma, or you\u2019ve got a friend who is immune-compromised, who, if you manage to pick up that virus and give it to somebody else, that could have a really bad outcome. So I\u2019m personally not convinced that our internal borders are the right way to manage our risks. I understand why people are nervous, but I would encourage people to think about how we maintain control, perhaps while enabling business to operate. The Virgin Australia bidding process is ticking along, as AAP reports, although the Queensland Investment Corporation bid appears to have lost its (unofficial) preferred partner - Canadian investment group Brookfield, which is not on this list. Four private equity firms are the leading candidates to buy Virgin Australia, the biggest regional casualty of the coronavirus crisis in the global aviation industry. Melbourne-based BGH Capital and American private equity firms Bain Capital, Indigo Partners and Cyrus Capital Partners made the shortlist from bids submitted last week, a source told Reuters. The administrators Deloitte have not named the parties but said on Monday they had shortlisted \u201ca small number of well-funded parties with strong aviation credentials\u201d who were invited to the next stage of the sale process. Phoenix-based Indigo Partners owns US airline Frontier Airlines and Chilean carrier JetSmart, while New York and London-based Cyrus Capital Partners was recently involved in collapsed British regional airline Flybe. BGH, a private equity firm founded in 2017, also on Monday entered into exclusive talks to acquire theme park and cinema owner Village Roadshow. Tentative offers were due on Friday and Deloitte Restructuring Services partner Vaughan Strawbridge said they had received more interest than anticipated. Chris Bowen says Labor has wanted to see \u201cmore Marise Payne in the debate and less George Christensen\u201d when it comes to Australia\u2019s response to China. But he says the \u201cprogress\u201d is welcome. If you want to know how the barley tariff situation is going, this speaks volumes: The ACT remains (known) active Covid case free Paul Karp is covering Jane Halton, the chair of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, speech at the press club: It was worth a shot, but as AAP reports, a federal court judge has dismissed a bid to have Qantas workers paid sick leave during the pandemic: Some 20,000 Qantas workers stood down in mid-March have been able to legally access some entitlements including annual leave but have been prevented from accessing sick, carers and compassionate leave. The company\u2019s position on Monday was backed by Justice Geoffrey Flick. He agreed with Qantas that the stand-down power served two important purposes; offering businesses financial relief and protecting workers from termination. Allowing staff to access sick leave while lawfully stood down because there was no work would \u201cgo against the very object and purpose of conferring those entitlements - namely an entitlement to be relieved from the work which the employee was otherwise required to perform\u201d, Flick said. Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine said the ruling was \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d. \u201cThis is about justice and the fact that workers who are battling serious illnesses should be allowed to draw down the significant sick leave they have accrued through years of hard work at Qantas.\u201d Qantas said in a statement: \u201cThe court has confirmed that employees who are stood down are not eligible to receive paid sick leave because there is no work to be absent from.\u201d Jane Halton, the chair of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, is speaking at the National Press Club. Halton says that although most vaccine candidates (94%) fail, and most of those at the first or second stage, nevertheless there is a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of developing one for Covid-19 because there are 130 groups around the world working on the problem. Halton warns that if a vaccine is developed, here will be a \u201csignificant\u201d call within the country and company that develops and produces it for \u201cdomestic priority\u201d - to vaccinate locals first. But she says if countries engage in \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d then \u201ceveryone will continue to suffer\u201d. The best way to restart global exports and tourism is to ensure widespread access worldwide. Instead, CEPI is working on protocols to prioritise first responders (such as doctors, nurses, paramedics) and vulnerable populations. I fear it will not be quite as ordered and together as we have been. Marise Payne will be holding a (rare) press conference at 2.30pm to discuss the EU motion for the World Health Organization investigation into the original Covid-19 response. If you want to know how far this has come, this was Payne on 19 April on Insiders, saying Australia did not want the WHO to conduct the investigation: David Speers: Could it be the World Health Organization, or do you agree they\u2019re too beholden to China? Marise Payne: Well, I don\u2019t think that it is so much about whether they are or are not beholden to China. And we share some of the concerns that the United States have identified in relation to the World Health Organization. That is certainly correct. I think it is about an independent mechanism, and I\u2019m not sure that you can have the health organisation, which has been responsible for disseminating much of the international communications material, and doing much of the early engagement and investigative work, also as the review mechanism. That strikes me as somewhat poacher and gamekeeper. David Speers: So it can\u2019t be the World Health Organization, in other words, to do this review? Marise Payne: Well, no, as I\u2019ve said, that strikes me as a bit poacher and gamekeeper. The EU motion, now co-sponsored by more than 100 countries, specifically mentions the WHO conducting the investigation. Scott Morrison has just confirmed he will give an address at the national press club next Tuesday. The ABS also reported more people were slipping on the social distance requirements, compared with March. Fewer people were taking the following precautions in late April to early May: Keeping distance from people (94% compared with 98% in March). Purchasing additional household supplies (21% compared with 47% in March). Purchasing additional medical supplies (8% compared with 29% in March). The proportion of Australians who said they were wearing a face mask remained about the same \u2013 17% in March and 15% in late-April to early-May. Almost half the nation, 46%, is working from home, while 89% of workers who aren\u2019t working from home report it is because they can\u2019t due to the nature of their job. The ABS has tallied up what has been stressing us out in the last month \u2013 and unsurprisingly, loneliness tops the list. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, Michelle Marquardt, said women were more impacted then men, with 28% of women reporting feeling lonely, compared with 16% of men: Around one in five people (19%) also reported that they were experiencing difficulties maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which was more of a problem for those aged 18 to 64 years (22%) than those aged 65 years and over (9%). The survey also highlighted changes to people\u2019s lifestyles during the period early-April to early-May, including: 22 % who said they are eating more snack foods such as chips, lollies and biscuits. 14% who said they are consuming more alcohol, and 10 per cent who said they are consuming less. 58% who reported spending more time in front of their television, computer, phone or other device. 29% who reported less frequent consumption of takeaway or delivered meals, while 38% spent more time cooking or baking.

For the record, the prime minister has been very firm on removing the jobseeker Covid supplement. That is due to expire (along with the jobkeeper wage subsidy) in late September. Here was Scott Morrison late last week, on why he doesn\u2019t want the rate to stay: It is also important that when you have what are effectively unemployment benefits through jobseeker at the levels that they are, that when you do that, that can provide in normal circumstances a disincentive with payments at that level for people to go and seek work. And that\u2019s why these arrangements with the Covid supplement are temporary arrangements. The reason the Covid supplement was put in place was because we knew that those who would otherwise be on jobseeker who might in better times be able to go and find employment, that during this period that would be very difficult. So we understood that. But as the economy reopens and as opportunities open up again, then, of course we would want to see people taking up those opportunities when they present. And so we will do that, I think, in a fair way and recognising that still, still there are few opportunities that are out there at present. Anthony Albanese says he doesn\u2019t believe that the jobseeker allowance should be kept at its current level \u2013 $1,100 a fortnight. That is still well under minimum wage. But Albanese says Labor won\u2019t be advocating for the whole Covid supplement ($550 a fortnight) to remain in place \u2013 but at the same time, he doesn\u2019t want it to return to the old $40 a day Newstart rate. What I said is, $40 a day isn\u2019t enough for people to live on. The government acknowledged that, when they increased jobseeker, that was basically the words that they used \u2018well we need to give people [enough] to live on. This doesn\u2019t change after the event. Now I don\u2019t think it should be kept at the level where it is, where jobseeker is higher than the aged pension. That\u2019s not a reasonable proposition. But it is the case I think that jobseekers shouldn\u2019t go back down to $40 a day. And on jobkeeper, all I\u2019m saying there is we\u2019ll need some sort of a transition \u2013 the idea that you have more than six million people being subsidised with $1,500 a fortnight on 18 May and on 19 May it just ends for all six million people that will produce a shock to the economy, and there needs to be a much more sensible, pragmatic transition out of the process. The Labor leader says he thinks Australia has learnt that on-shore manufacturing needs to be supported, after the initial panic over the lack of personal protective equipment. He also thinks that we might see less travel for meetings, now that everyone is used to teleconferencing. The problem is you can\u2019t always just snap back, there needs to be a transition and what I\u2019m saying is, we can transition into how can we improve things, how can we make our economy stronger, more resilient. How can we support more permanency in jobs, one of the issues that has been apparent during this crisis as well is those people who are in casual jobs, they have done it tougher and were the first place people to be laid off. They\u2019re the people [for who this will be much harder] and I think we need to recognise that as well. And I think we can do that and emerge stronger. It has been an opportunity where people have had a chance to think about things and the world has slowed down a little bit, for all of us. And I\u2019ve certainly been thinking about what sort of society, we want to have, how we can shape that, and how we can improve it. Anthony Albanese is speaking to John Laws on Sydney radio 2SM, and so far the interview has focussed on whether Albanese is pronounced Albanese or Albanese. I\u2019ll let your mind fill in the blanks. And by the way \u2013 he says it\u2019s Albanese. Speaking to the Seven Network this morning, Simon Birmingham said he hoped China would come on board the inquiry at the World Health Assembly: I hope that China will participate. I hope China will come on board at the World Health Assembly, joining many, many other nations in supporting the obvious need for an inquiry into Covid-19, its origins, its handling right across the world. Because we\u2019ve had a circumstance where hundreds of thousands of people have died, millions people have lost their jobs, billions of people had their lives disrupted, and the least the world can expect is an enquiry that allows us to learn the lessons so that we can try to avoid a repeat of this in the future. A key change in the motion can be found here, as Daniel Hurst has pointed out to me. The 15 April draft included this request the WHO director general: OP5.18 Plan for an evaluation, to be conducted in consultation with Member States at the earliest appropriate moment, on lessons learnt from the international health response to Covid-19, addressing the long-term consequences on health, , in order to assess, in line with the statement made by G20 leaders, gaps in pandemic preparedness with a view to establishing a global initiative on pandemic preparedness and response capitalising on existing structures and programmes to align priorities in global preparedness Which has been changed to this: OP9.10 Initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with Member States, 1. A stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation, including using existing mechanisms, 2. As appropriate, to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19, including, (i) the effectiveness of the mechanisms at WHO\u2019s disposal; (ii) the functioning of the IHR and the status of implementation of the relevant recommendations of the previous IHR Review Committees; (iii) WHO\u2019s contribution to United Nations-wide efforts; and (iv) the actions of WHO and their timelines pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic, and make recommendations to improve global pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response capacity, including through strengthening, as appropriate, WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme. Expect this resolution to be changed before the final vote \u2013 that sound you hear is hundreds of diplomatic cables flying back and forth as we speak, but here is the EU motion which will go to the World Health Assembly Australia is a co-sponsor, along with 61 other countries, but it is important to note that this is different to what Australia first suggested. The EU motion does not mention China, or even Wuhan. Russia is on board, but the United States, at this stage, is not. In an unforeseen consequence of the Covid lockdown, New Zealand has seen its fastest growth rate in modern history, growing from four million to five million in 17 years. Why? Everyone came home. As AAP reports: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has regularly thanked her \u201cteam of five million\u201d for helping New Zealand weather the Covid-19 wave, and as of today she has confirmation of that headcount. On Monday, Stats NZ released its quarterly estimate resident population figures which showed New Zealand notching the major milestone. As of 31 March, the South Pacific nation has 5,002,100 residents. In all likelihood, New Zealand has reached the figure because of the pandemic. \u201cCovid-19 has caused some unusual and unprecedented travel patterns,\u201d Stats NZ senior demographer Kim Dunstan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people that have been in New Zealand prolong their stay which has given some boost to migration. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had more New Zealand citizens returning from living overseas in recent months. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve also had fewer citizens departing New Zealand to live overseas. \u201cThe combined impact has seen an upswing in migration which has helped New Zealand reach that five million milestone.\u201d Presented without comment. There has been a lot of interest in this, from those who like to watch politics north of the border. Jackie Trad, who stepped down from the ministry and the deputy premiership earlier this month, after she was referred to the state\u2019s corruption watchdog over her alleged role in appointing a school principal, will be running in the next election, for South Brisbane. It is probably a good time to point out that the EU motion, which is the one we have been talking about today, is different to what Australia was originally calling for. The World Health Assembly is expected to endorse the motion. Not Covid related, but still very, very, very important \u2013 Luke Henriques-Gomes has an update on the robodebt situation. Paul Karp has spoken to ANU on where the business world is at, as restrictions begin to be lifted: Four-in-five self-employed Australians have reported their profits have taken a hit as a result of the Covid-19 contraction, with almost one third worried their businesses will not be viable in two months without improved conditions. The ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods study, released on Monday, provides fresh impetus for those arguing to reopen the Australian economy and will play into political debate about whether to extend the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme beyond September. Based on a survey of a representative sample of 3,155 Australians in mid-April, the report found self-employed workers have suffered a higher reduction in hours worked and income than employees. The longitudinal survey found 5.1% of self-employed workers said that the coronavirus had eliminated their profits completely, 21.6% said it had been reduced to its lowest point ever and 21.9% said it has reduced their profits \u2018substantially\u2019. You\u2019ll find more on where the independent inquiry Australia has been calling for on the Covid response, here Joel Fitzgibbon spoke to Sydney radio 2SM this morning. As the shadow agriculture minister, he had a bit to say about the current trade barney with China: China is more than one-third of our exports and you\u2019re going to be pretty hard-pressed to find new export markets that fill that void. So we have to get this relationship right and it\u2019s incumbent upon the government to do so. No one\u2019s arguing that there shouldn\u2019t be a Covid inquiry and by the way this relationship has been deteriorating for the last three years, not just since Covid emerged \u2026 [inaudible] rebuild the relationship and ensure we normalise our trading relationship. China will be an important market for us for decades to come, it will become increasingly a high-value market as the middle-classes continue to emerge and to capitalise on that and to draw benefit from that we do not in any way have to forgo our sovereignty or our national interest. Queensland\u2019s health minister and deputy premier, Steven Miles, says there have been two new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in Queensland overnight. There are now 13 (known) cases of coronavirus in Queensland. Four people are in hospital and one person is in the ICU. Miles is in Rockhampton, after an aged care nurse tested positive for Covid-19. There has been an investigation launched as the nurse was displaying symptoms when they went to work and returned to work after being tested for Covid, before the positive diagnosis came back. It\u2019s a government-run facility. The centre has been put into lockdown and all residents and staff have been tested as part of a rapid response, but all residents have been moved out of the facility while tests and monitoring continues. Still, China is due to make a decision on whether or not it imposes a tariff (up to 80%) on Australian barley exports in the next 24 hours. David Littleproud says if it moves forward with the threat, Australia will be off to the World Trade Organisation lickety-split: [Trade] minister [Simon] Birmingham has been quite clear on this that we reserve our rights and he has a strong record that when we believe that our case hasn\u2019t been understood properly, that we take it to the independent umpire. We\u2019ve done that with trading partners like Canada with wine, and India with sugar. So we will look at the judgement by China tomorrow. This has been something that\u2019s been in transition for 18 months; it\u2019s come to this junction. We\u2019ll work calmly and methodically through it. The Department of Agriculture personnel in China, in Beijing are telling me that it\u2019s been very constructive with Chinese officials on the ground. It\u2019s very calm, very methodical working through the questions they have and giving them the answers they\u2019re looking for. Now, whether that gets lost in the translation, we\u2019ll find out tomorrow. But we\u2019ll be very strong that we\u2019ll stand up to any trading partner where we believe they haven\u2019t understood our argument and we\u2019ll take it an umpire for them to determine. The call to investigate the initial response to Covid, as well as how the world reacted, does not mention China or Wuhan. Sixty-two nations lined up behind Australia to call for an independent investigation. David Littleproud told the ABC it wasn\u2019t about pointing fingers: This was always about investigation rather than conflict. And quite calmly and methodically, we\u2019ve asked why and how this has happened. How can we do better? What can we learn from this? That\u2019s the responsible thing to do when 300,000 souls have lost their lives around the world. We\u2019ve done that asking other nations to work with us, and I think we\u2019ll get better answers and even the Department of Agriculture, has put out there and I led this to the G20, looking at wildlife wet markets. Six pandemics since 1980 have originated from wildlife wet markets. It is important to understand whether they can be mitigated and if they can\u2019t, how do we transition these countries away from the wildlife element of a wet market. That\u2019s the responsible thing to do, that\u2019s a good global citizen and that\u2019s what Australia has led. Dave Sharma says just because the Chinese trade minister isn\u2019t picking up the phone to Simon Birmingham doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t discussions happening. The former ambassador says the embassies would still be talking to each other and there would be communications going back and forth. Which is an important point. The Greens are launching their economic recovery plan today. AAP has an update on the stock market situation: Shares are tipped to be slightly higher in early trade on the Australian market as part of what one expert said is the ASX\u2019s skittish recovery from coronavirus lows. The SPI 200 futures contract was higher by 32 points or 0.59%, to 5,436 at 8.00 AEST on Monday, indicating a small gain in early trade. This follows a thin positive lead from Wall Street where the three major US indexes closed higher on Friday despite weaker than expected US economic data, amid optimism that easing coronavirus restrictions would boost activity this month. CommSec chief economist Craig James says Australian equities have likely bottomed out and are undergoing a skittish recovery \u2013 as long as the nation continues to keep coronavirus cases low. He noted the ASX200 had risen over six of the past seven weeks NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has reported a man in his 60s, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, had died. Dr Chant said the man had underlying health conditions. The man is the 48th to die in NSW and the 99th death across Australia. Chief executive of Anglicare, Grant Millard says the situation at Newmarch House is now \u201cvery solid\u201d, and isn\u2019t concerned with a royal commission investigating the outbreak at the house. In the five weeks since the first case of Covid-19 at the home was diagnosed, 18 residents have died and 71 people have been infected. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any infection since 28 April. I think things are very much under control now. It was a vastly different situation two weeks ago. It was extremely challenging, everyone was stretched,\u201d he told ABC radio this morning. Millard was asked if all Covid-19 positive patients should have been transported to hospital at the beginning of the outbreak: It needs to be assessed on an individual basis. It really depends on the person\u2019s state of health ... These people are actually in their own homes, that\u2019s where they\u2019re comfortable. It\u2019s not as clear cut as saying, \u2018get someone at the hospital\u2019. But I think, given the challenges with staffing, and, at the same time we heard that there was no elective surgeries and hospital, and there was staff around, it does beg the question about whether they should have just gone off the hospital? I understand the public health outbreak at the time there were real concerns about what might have another Ruby Princess and I get that, but you just need to make this decision a case by case basis. Millard admitted there had been a break down in communication with families: I readily acknowledge that communication was a problem. We were scrambling to staff just to provide basic care, and we just didn\u2019t do a good enough job with communicating with families. Millard said he wasn\u2019t concerned about inquires by the royal commission into aged care and said he wasn\u2019t aware of any claims of compensation from families of those residents who died after contracting Covid-19. Transport apps in NSW will now tell you whether or not there is seat capacity on public transport at peak times as the state moves to keep public transport open, but maintaining social distancing. Gladys Berejiklian says there has been just one new case of Covid-19 diagnosed in New South Wales in the last 24 hours. They know where it came from \u2013 overseas. The person remains in quarantine. Daniel Andrews has announced a $2.7bn construction stimulus package for the state, in a bid to get the economy moving after the Covid restrictions: This is a package that is designed to make sure that tradies and all of us, because as those wages are earnt and the contracts are won, the money is invested and spent. They move around the Victorian economy, and that money flowing throughout the Victorian economy benefits all of us. Hundreds and hundreds of projects delivering thousands and thousands of jobs. That\u2019s exactly what we need right at this time, and I want to be clear with you that these projects, many of which are new, some of which were in the planning, but have been brought forward. Because we\u2019ve got to get the projects away quickly. These projects, some of them, the public housing maintenance for instance, will begin next week. The rest of them will be under way over the next three to six months. And we\u2019ll be pushing as hard as we possibly can to get those projects done closer to the three months than the six months. It\u2019s very, very important that we underpin demand. That we give to tradies and so many others across the economy, that sense of absolute certainty and confidence that this work is here and it\u2019s here right now. There\u2019s never been a better time for us to invest. Never been a more important time for us to invest in these jobs. This, of course, comes after our very significant business survival package, which included the best part of $2bn in grants to businesses hardest hit by the shutdowns. Payroll tax refunds to businesses right across the state, and of course, the Working for Victoria fund, which is all about trying to make sure that those who have lost their job can work for all of us doing deep cleaning, doing all sorts of other functions. Students are preparing to return to on-site learning in South Australia (which reported it was officially known Covid case free) and the ACT (which has also reported it was known Covid case free) today. Queensland students will all be back on-site from next Monday. New South Wales has also moved to a return and Victoria has laid out its plan. Federal Queensland Liberal MP Andrew Laming continues to cover himself in glory, photoshopping the Queensland premier, whose Polish grandfather was interned by the Nazis, and whose grandmother suffered abuse at their hands, as a Nazi in a social media post, protesting the Queensland restrictions. Annastacia Palaszczuk says she is not going to get into it with him: I\u2019m not going to comment. I\u2019m focused on dealing with a pandemic. If people have too much time on their hands and want to get involved in that sort of behaviour, I think that it speaks more about themselves than anyone else. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says there have been six more cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in his state in the last 24 hours. \u201cWe still have to acknowledge this is with us still, this is not over,\u201d he says. There had been hopes that Queensland would reopen its borders in June, but in case you missed it, Annastacia Palaszczuk just poured cold water over that. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, the Queensland premier says the decision will be reviewed at the end of this month, but borders may remain closed for another three to four months. Q: You\u2019ve said that you\u2019d review the border decision at the end of every month. Is it possible at the end of May, which is only a couple of weeks away, there may be a change? A: Look, I have to get the advice of the chief health officer. I would say that things would look more positive towards September. Having said that, I don\u2019t want to rule anything out. I will give you that advice at the end of May as quickly as possible. Q: So that\u2019s several months, we\u2019re talking about September, that\u2019s three or four months away before the border could reopen? A: Well, it\u2019s about the community transmission based on the expert advice. It\u2019s not my decision. It\u2019s based on the expert health advice. Q: Now, what about the prospect of a domestic travel bubble? Queenslanders being allowed to go to the NT? WA and South Australia? Would you be open to that? A: I could see that happening before New South Wales and Victoria. But that\u2019s a matter for the premiers there as well. They\u2019ll probably say the same thing. We\u2019ve got a little bit of community transmission. Not much, but they may say - no, we don\u2019t want Queensland at the moment. But look, at the end of the day, I really hope that we see an Australia where people can travel freely once again through all of our borders because that\u2019s the way that we work best together. But we\u2019re just in this unusual circumstance at the moment that no one wants to be in. So we have to take the health advice. But it\u2019s great to see some of the restrictions easing and people travelling around. Simon Birmingham may not be able to get a call back from his Chinese counterpart over trade tensions, but Australia\u2019s call for an independent investigation into the Covid reaction has gained traction overnight, with 62 countries, including Russia, signing on to have the immediate response evaluated. Queensland is set to review its border closures at the end of May, but Annastacia Palaszczuk says that September is looking more likely, given community transmission rates in Victoria and New South Wales. I have to get the advice of the chief health officer. I would say that things would look more positive towards September. Having said that, I don\u2019t want to rule anything out,\u201d she told the ABC. Speaking of that, McDonald\u2019s has closed 12 outlets across Victoria and staff have been told to be tested after a delivery driver tested positive for coronavirus. All 12 outlets will be shut and deep cleaned after being visited by the driver, who was asymptomatic and unaware he had Covid-19 at the time. With the health response having beefed up, restrictions are relaxing across the nation, leaving politicians time to concentrate, once again, on politics. The latest Newspoll has Scott Morrison\u2019s personal popularity remaining high, while the Coalition sits ahead of Labor 51 to 49. But there is a rough road ahead. The economy is, to put it mildly, not great. Federally, attention is being turned to the free childcare offer, jobkeeper and jobseeker, and how much longer to keep them going. There are reviews coming up for all three, and we\u2019ll bring you all the information as we get it. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day today, as well as the entire Guardian brains trust. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Germany will plunge much deeper into recession this quarter as its Covid-19 lockdown continue to bite, the Bundesbank has warned. In its latest monthly report, Germany\u2019s central bank predicts a severe drop in GDP in the April-June quarter, even though some lockdown measures are easing. It says: \u201cGerman economic output declined massively in the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken to curb it,\u201d As the containment measures continued in April and there should still be substantial restrictions despite easing, experts expect economic output to be significantly lower in the second quarter. The Bundesbank also points out that a wide swathe of Germany\u2019s economy has been hurt. Many consumer-related service sectors are affected, which severely restrict or even have to shut down their business activities. This included the hospitality industry, large parts of the stationary retail trade, travel service providers, other leisure and culture-related services and passenger transport. The manufacturing sector is also affected by the restrictions in Germany. Declining demand from abroad and disruptions in the global supply and value chains also caused downward pressure here. We learned on Friday that German\u2019s economy shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, its biggest drop since 2009. UK property firm Intu has been forced to ask for a \u2018standstill agreement\u2019 from its lenders, after being badly hurt by the coronavirus crisis. Intu told shareholders this morning that it will probably breach the commitments, or covenants, on its loans. It is now seeking relief from financial covenant testing, debt amortisation and facility maturity payments, possibly until 31 December 2021. The company, which owns Lakeside in Essex and the Trafford Centre in Manchester, has suffered a slump in rental payments as many tenants shut down during the lockdown. It was already suffering from problems on the high street - even before Covid-19 struck. Intu explains: Significant market uncertainty remains regarding the impact of Covid-19 on the operations of intu\u2019s centres which, with the exception of essential stores, remain semi-closed until at least 1 June 2020. Additionally, at this time, the speed of recovery once the UK comes out of lockdown remains unclear. The resulting impact on rental collections and valuations at the end of June is likely to result in breaches of covenants or material liquidity requirements if any such breaches are to be cured in accordance with the financing documents at that time. Ryanair chief Michael O\u2019Leary has also hit out at the UK government for mishandling the crisis, saying its plan to make overseas visitors quarantine themselves is \u201cidiotic and unimplementable\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: Budget airline Ryanair has stern words for rivals who have taken financial support from governments to keep afloat through the lockdown. In its latest financial results, Ryanair predicts a price war from operators who have taken billions of euros in help. It warns: When Group airlines return to scheduled flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be distorted by unprecedented quantums of State Aid (in breach of EU rules) under which over \u20ac30bn has been gifted to the Lufthansa Group, Air France-KLM, Alitalia, SAS and Norwegian among others. We therefore expect that traffic on reduced flight schedules will be subject to significant price discounting, and below cost selling, from these flag carriers with huge State Aid war chests. Shocking stuff. But keep reading the statement, and you see that Ryanair has tapped the UK\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), under which the government helps companies to keep borrowing: Ryanair\u2019s balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a current cash balance of \u20ac4.1bn (Ryanair recently raised \u00a3600m under the UK\u2019s CCFF) and 330 unencumbered B737s (77% of owned fleet). What a difference a month makes. Four weeks ago, there was panic in the energy markets as the US oil price plunged below zero. With demand slumping, traders feared that a supply glut would overwhelm the system. As the contract for oil delivery in May ticked towards maturity, US producers found they actually had to pay people to take the crude away. At the time, some commentators predicted that June\u2019s oil contract would also hit zero. But recent supply cuts seem to have helped, as have recent moves to ease lockdowns. So a barrel of US oil for delivery next month is now worth $31, up from $15 at the end of last month. Wall Street is expected to open higher today, helped by Jerome Powell\u2019s latest commitment to take further action to protect America\u2019s economy through the slump. Several European countries have lifted their ban on short-selling shares, in another sign that the panic created by Covid-19 has eased. France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria and Greece are all scrapping restrictions that prevented traders from selling shares they didn\u2019t own (hoping to buy them back cheaper). These bans were introduced in March, in an attempt to stem the alarming plunge in across stock markets. French markets watchdog AMF says the markets are calmer now, although relatively edgy: \u201cMarkets have partly reduced their losses, trading volumes and volatility have returned to levels that are still high compared to mid-February, however this reflects market participants\u2019 uncertainties in the current context The gold price has hit its highest level since 2012, amid predictions that the coronavirus outbreak will drive inflation up. Gold bullion is up 1.2% this morning at $1,760 per ounce for the first time since October 2012. It\u2019s now jumped by over 15% since the market crash in March, driven by concerns that the huge stimulus measures from governments and central banks will be inflationary. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Gold has emerged as a clear winner from the economic turmoil created by the pandemic. There has been more energy about gold bulls today and prices have driven up to above $1760, the highest since Oct 2012. The peak in that month of $1795 is the next target for bulls. Some economists argue that the pandemic will actually be deflationary - as demand will crumble as unemployment rises and firms go bust. But goldbugs point to the massive expansion in the money supply, arguing that precious metals are the best protection against an inflationary glut. The Covid-19 crisis will drag India into an unprecedented recession, Goldman Sachs has warned. Goldman\u2019s economists reckon India\u2019s GDP will shrink at an annualised rate of 45% in the current quarter. It had previously predicted a 20% tumble, but has revised its forecasts after India extended its tough lockdown until the end of May. Growth is expected to rebound sharply in Q3 (by an annualised rate of 20%), but India\u2019s economy is still expected to shrink by 5% during the year. European markets are a tranquil sea of green this morning, with the main indices up around 2%. That\u2019s a solid recovery from last week\u2019s dips, which sent stocks to a three-week low. Investors seem to be more hopeful about the global economic prospects, as governments try to lift lockdown restrictions. But, the long-term damage of the crisis is unknown, as Barclays economist Christian Keller put it to clients (via Reuters): \u201cThe economies of Europe and the U.S. likely bottomed out in April and are slowly starting to come back to life. \u201cHowever, incoming data from most economies highlight the depth of the contraction, raising risks of longer-term scarring that might undermine the recovery.\u201d The European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist has warned that the eurozone economy might not recover from the Covid-19 slump until 2022. Philip Lane told Spanish newspaper El Pais that the coronavirus is having a \u2018terrible\u2019 impact, and sounded notably cautious about the future, saying: In March the pandemic and the measures to contain it had already led to a substantial contraction of activity. This situation got worse again in April, where we saw a deep fall in activity everywhere. Now the picture is changing: some countries are beginning to loosen their lockdowns. How this will develop in the future depends a lot on how quickly the restrictions on economic activity can be eased, but also on how we adapt to living with the virus. The speed at which the economy bounces back will then hinge on whether consumers are more reluctant to consume and businesses hold back on investment. From today\u2019s perspective, it looks in any case unlikely that economic activity will return to its pre-crisis level before 2021, if not later. This crisis is truly unprecedented, which makes it harder to predict the precise shape the recovery will take. What we know for sure is that the steepest fall will be in the first half of the year, and these terrible economic conditions should recover little by little, week by week, month by month. A wave of optimism has lifted Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 by 128 points, or 2.2%, in early trading in London. Nearly every member of the blue-chip index is up, led by mining companies. Fresnillo (+8%), Glencore (+5%) and Anglo American (+5%) are all sharply higher, following Jerome Powell\u2019s pledge to unleash more firepower if needed. Travel companies are also being lifted, with British Airways parent company IAG (5%) and cruise operator Carnival (+5%). Oil companies are also higher, lifted by rising crude prices -- another sign that the markets are less pessimistic as some lockdown measures are lifted. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says the success of these moves will be crucial: It does feel like we\u2019re in the middle of a phoney war at the moment with all of us waiting to see how efficiently the various economies are able to re-open given all the social distancing that will be required Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The economic cost of the coronavirus continues to mount. Overnight, Japan has followed Germany, France and Italy into recession as its Covid-19 lockdown hit economic growth. Japan\u2019s GDP shrank by 0.9% in January-March, the second quarterly contraction in a row. Tom Learmouth, Japan economist for Capital Economics, says: \u201cThe sharp fall in output in the first quarter suggests the spread of the virus had already dealt a significant blow to economic activity in March.\u201d Economists predict a much sharper contraction this quarter, helping to drag the world economy into its worst slump in decades. America\u2019s top central banker, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has voiced his own concerns. He predicted that the US economy could shrink by 20% or 30% during the pandemic, with the recovery taking until late 2021. But crucially for investors - Powell also told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the Fed was certainly \u201cnot out of ammunition by a long shot\u201d - and could expand its lending programmes if needed. Here\u2019s the key part of the interview, with CBS\u2019s Scott Pelley: PELLEY: Has the Fed done all it can do? POWELL: Well, there\u2019s a lot more we can do. We\u2019ve done what we can as we go. But I will say that we\u2019re not out of ammunition by a long shot. No, there\u2019s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have. So there\u2019s a lot more we can do to support the economy, and we\u2019re committed to doing everything we can as long as we need to. PELLEY: What would the Fed\u2019s next steps be, potentially? POWELL: Well, to begin, the one thing we can certainly do is we can enlarge our existing lending programs. We can start new lending programs if need be. We can do that. There are things we can do in monetary policy. There are a number of dimensions where we can move to make policy even more accommodative. Through forward guidance, we can change our asset purchase strategy. There are just a lot of things that we can do. That\u2019s just the excuse investors need to look through the current economic gloom. Stocks have jumped in Asia-Pacific markets overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.5% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX gaining 1%. European markets are also heading for a strong morning - with the FTSE 100 jumping 2% at the start of trading. Traders are also watching Italy closely, where shops, restaurants and hair salons are reopening. The Italian government says it\u2019s taking a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d to put the country back on its feet. It\u2019s a key test of whether consumers will return to the shops...and whether a second wave of Covid-19 infections can be avoided.

However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says employers have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people if it is less safe for them to go to work than their non-disabled colleagues. This comes after researchers warned 8 million people with underlining health conditions should be exempted from plans to get the country back to work, amid fears that they would catch the virus.

recorded for the first time since early May as anti-virus restrictions ease and officials say the situation is stabilising. </p> <p>Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> <p>It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. </p> <p>Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief, <strong>Anna Popova</strong>, said this weekend that the growth in new cases was slowing and the country has \u201cmoved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for\u201d. </p> <p>Russia began easing nationwide lockdown restrictions last week and announced the national football league would restart in late June. </p> <p>Health officials also announced 91 new deaths, down from Saturday\u2019s figure of 119 that was the highest daily toll yet. </p> <p>Russia\u2019s total fatalities now stand at 2,722, a rate considerably lower than in many other countries hit hard by the pandemic. </p> <p>Critics have cast doubt on Russia\u2019s low official mortality rate, accusing authorities of under-reporting in order to play down the scale of the crisis. </p> <p>Russian health officials say one of the reasons the count is lower is that only deaths directly caused by the virus are being included. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, <strong>Tatiana Golikova</strong>, over the weekend denied manipulation of numbers, saying hospitals had a financial interest in identifying infections because they are allocated more money to treat coronavirus patients. </p> <p>Authorities also say that since the virus came later to Russia, there was more time to prepare hospital beds and launch wide-scale testing to slow the spread. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T09:24:03.346Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div

something the Taipei government refused to do. </p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, <strong>Joseph Wu</strong>, told reporters: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite all our efforts and an unprecedented level of international support, Taiwan has not received an invitation to take part. </p> <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses deep regret and strong dissatisfaction that the World Health Organization Secretariat has yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and continues to disregard the right to health of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the pandemic, which Taiwan has strongly disputed. </p> <p>The <strong>United States</strong> has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing. </p> <p> Taiwan attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan president, <strong>Tsai Ing-wen</strong>, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects. </p> <p>Wu said that Taiwan had agreed the issue of its participation would be put off until later in the year so the shorted assembly can focus on the coronavirus.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain<strong> </strong>recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months.

The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities so far and 1,486,757 infections. </li> <li><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. </strong>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could hit 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</li> <li><strong>Japan\u2019s economic growth falls into recession in the first quarter. </strong>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus.The Cabinet Office reported Monday a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter.</li> <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, <em>AFP reports</em>. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers.</li> <li><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor: hospitals \u201cnear collapse\u201d. </strong>In Brazil, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52701524\">BBC</a>reports that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d: they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said.Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths.</li> <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday has seen lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong>has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</li> <li><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps: UN chief. </strong>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said.The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar.A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday.</li> <li><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA), which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees. </li> <li><strong>India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks</strong> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff#block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff\">Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions</a> still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections.

Jamie Grierson, our home affairs correspondent, reports. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, in his address to the nation on 10 May announcing the gradual easing of lockdown measures, served notice that quarantine would be imposed on air passengers arriving in the country. But the plans, which are still being drawn up and are expected to be announced within days, are set to extend to all arrivals into the UK with a number of exemptions, reportedly including hauliers and Covid-19 research scientists. Ministers have suggested travellers will be asked to quarantine for 14 days when they enter the UK, either in accommodation of their choice or provided by the government if there are no other options. An implementation date has not yet been announced. Here is Jamie\u2019s piece in full: Anti-lockdown protests in the US may have had the effect of spreading Covid-19 to far-away areas, cellphone location data provided to the Guardian suggests. There are fears the protests will play a role in spreading coronavirus to parts of the country that have, to date, experienced relatively few infections. Jason Wilson reports: Hello everyone \u2013 as Jessica says, I\u2019ll be taking you through the next few hours of global coronavirus news and updates. As always, your tips, feedback and observations are warmly welcomed. You can email me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or send a direct Twitter message @NickAmes82. That\u2019s all from me today, I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Nick Ames who\u2019ll be running the blog for the next few hours. Thanks for your emails, and of course thanks for following the blog. Southern European countries ease lockdowns. Italy is reopening bars, cafes, restaurants and hairdressers - with social distancing measures in place - for the first time since its lockdown began. Meanwhile in Spain, almost three quarters of the country progressed to the second phase of its lockdown de-escalation, allowing millions of people to meet up in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe and restaurant terraces. Global infections pass 4.7 million. There are 4,727,625 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,482 people have died over the course of the pandemic. The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,564 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,742 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Japan falls into recession. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. It reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. New virus cases in Russia under 9,000 for first time since 1 May. 8,926 new infections were recorded in the last 24 hours, as anti-virus restrictions ease and officials say the situation is stabilising. Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019. The BBC has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d. They could run out of space in two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday and joined some in a series of push-ups . Taiwan blocked from WHO meeting following Chinese pressure. Taiwan had been lobbying to take part in the World Health Assembly, which opens later on Monday, but did not get invited due to Chinese pressure, its foreign minister said, adding they had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. Thailand\u2019s economy contracts for first time since 2014. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered borders and devastated the tourism-reliant country, caused the economy to shrink for the first time in six years. Ryanair chief accuses UK of mismanaging coronavirus crisis. Michael O\u2019Leary described the UK\u2019s planned introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for travellers arriving from abroad as \u201cidiotic and unimplementable\u201d. Coronavirus brought Belgium its deadliest April since the second world war, according to a study, as the country begins slowly to lift lockdown measures. A total of 14,790 people died in Belgium last month as Covid-19 swept the country \u2013 substantially higher than the normal April total of deaths below 9,000, researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) found. Not since the Nazi occupation of the 1940s has Belgium had such a high mortality rate in April, the month when high winter death rates usually drop off with the onset of spring, the researchers found. \u201cMortality in Belgium is exceptionally high, reaching unprecedented levels, especially in the period from 1 to 12 April,\u201d the university said in a statement. There were 639 deaths on 10 April, \u201cmore than double the number that would have been expected for that day\u201d. It said: April 2020 was the deadliest April since the Second World War, both in absolute numbers and per capita. There were 15.7 deaths per 1,000 population last month, Prof Patrick Deboosere of the Interface Demography research group that produced the study told AFP. This compares with 16.3 deaths per 1,000 population in April 1941. Belgium has been hit hard by the pandemic, suffering one of the world\u2019s highest per capita death tolls, though the virus appears to be easing and lockdown restrictions are starting to be lifted. The government has also been praised by the World Health Organization for keeping more accurate tolls than some of its neighbours, and the per capita rate may be higher because of this. Support for president Donald Trump in Pennsylvania has not wavered despite his coronavirus missteps, and could be key to him winning reelection, Guardian US national affairs correspondent, Tom McCarthy, reports. Few people understand the terrible cost of the coronavirus like Lee Snover, a Republican party chair in one of the key swing counties that could determine whether Donald Trump is reelected as president in November. Snover, who helped deliver an upset victory for Trump in 2016 in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, lost her father to the virus this spring. Her husband fell critically ill, too, spending 17 days in an intensive care unit before recovering. Her mother, a cancer survivor, was also in intensive care for eight days before emerging. \u201cIt spread through my entire family,\u201d Snover said. Trump stands accused of driving up the coronavirus death toll by downplaying the public health threat and urging the country to \u201creopen\u201d too quickly. But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family. \u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base. Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican has reopened to visitors after being closed for over two months under Italy\u2019s lockdown orders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. A handful of visitors queued up, observing social distancing rules, and were watched by police officers wearing face masks before having their temperatures taken to enter the church, which has been closed since 10 March. Italy was the first country to go into a full lockdown over two months ago, bringing the economy to its knees. The official death toll from the virus in the country now stands at around 32,000. The government started lifting restrictions on 4 May, and on Sunday joggers, walkers and cyclists were plentiful on the streets of Rome\u2019s historic centre. Restaurants, bars, cafes, shops and hairdressers, among other businesses, were all expected to reopen on Monday, with public masses also resuming. In the face of much opposition, including from Pope Francis, churches in Rome were shuttered at the beginning of the coronavirus emergency in early March. Most, however, opened shortly thereafter, with entry reserved for prayer only. \u201cI share the joy of those communities who can finally reunite as liturgical assemblies, a sign of hope for all society,\u201d Francis said on Sunday during his live-streamed prayer. Health ministers from around the world are expected to call for an independent evaluation of the World Health Organization\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic during a WHO meeting on Monday. Though they have opposing views of the WHO\u2019s performance, China and the United States are likely to join the consensus for an independent evaluation during a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, diplomats said. The call will be made in a resolution being presented by the European Union at the annual two-day meeting. The text also calls for timely and equitable access to safe and efficacious diagnostics, medicines and vaccines against the disease which has killed more than 300,000 people worldwide. A fragile consensus emerged after more than a week of intense negotiations on the EU text, which could still change, the diplomats said. A European diplomat told Reuters: It looks like the resolution will be adopted. Politically speaking, there is agreement for now on an evaluation of the whole system and an investigation into the origin (of the virus), but not immediately. It is important we were able to agree to the resolution, everybody. The EU resolution is supported by a host of countries including Australia - a vocal critic of WHO and of China - as well as Britain, Canada, India, Japan and Russia. Names on a draft resolution seen by Reuters showed support from 116 of the 194 countries in the WHO. The text calls on the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to initiate an \u201cimpartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d of the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19, including the effectiveness of existing mechanisms \u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\u201d. It backs continued work, including through scientific \u201cfield missions\u201d, to identify the zoonotic or animal source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier to reach humans. Almost three quarters of Spain progressed to the second phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation on Monday, allowing millions of people to meet up in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe and restaurant terraces. The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area remain in the preliminary phase of what the government has called \u201cthe transition towards the new normality\u201d. The health ministry said that despite \u201chuge progress\u201d in and around the capital, the region would not yet be able to join the 70% of the country in the next phase. People in Barcelona and parts of the Castilla y L\u00e9on region will also remain in phase-0 for the time being. However, as elsewhere in Spain, people in phase-0 areas can now shop in small stores without appointments, and places of worship have reopened at 30% capacity. Spain recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months on Sunday as the latest figures from the health ministry showed that 87 people had died from Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, down from 102 the day before. The country has confirmed 231,350 cases of the virus using PCR tests, and reported 27,650 deaths. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that his Socialist-led coalition would be seeking a final, month-long extension of the state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. The last lockdown extension was hard-won and was bitterly opposed by the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox party. Both parties have argued that the state of emergency is no longer necessary. It\u2019s week two of the end of lockdown and on Monday it was the turn of the two lower secondary school years to return to classes in France but only in \u201cgreen\u201d areas on the Covid-19 map, meaning departments where the virus has stopped circulating widely and hospital intensive care units are not under pressure. Classes in years 6\u00e8me (ages 11-12) and 5\u00e8me (12-13) opened on Monday with around 150,000 pupils expected back at one desk in two in 4,000 secondary schools. All staff and students must wear masks and schools are enforcing strict health measures, including distancing. The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has revealed that 70 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed since 40,000 primary and nursery schools reopened last week. Blanquer said the schools concerned had closed but insisted that not going to school was more of a risk than the virus. \u201cMany doctors say it is less dangerous to go to school than to stay at home. Our children mustn\u2019t be the victims of collateral damage of our health measures,\u201d Blanquer told RTL radio. The consequences could be psychological or nutritional and lead to students - particularly the estimated 500,000 youngsters in families with financial and social difficulties - dropping out of the system, he said. \u201cThis phenomenon is my main worry. We have to get society used to going back to school. It\u2019s not a secondary issue, it\u2019s fundamental,\u201d Blanquer said. A decision when to open the other secondary school years and lyc\u00e9es will be taken by the end of this month, with a possible return programmed for the beginning of June. Around 25 Covid-19 clusters have been reported since France ended its strict eight-week lockdown a week ago - Monday 11 May - but the French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said it will be another two weeks before the authorities know if it has resulted in a second wave of coronavirus cases. France has reported 28,108 deaths attributed to Covid-19 since March. There was an unexpected jump in the number of deaths in care and nursing homes in the last figures published on Sunday, but this was reported to be a recalculation of figures. Otherwise, the number of new cases and patients in hospital and intensive care with the virus is falling. France\u2019s coronavirus figures for 17 May: Confirmed cases: 142,411 (+120) In hospital: 19,361 (+152 gross, -71 net) In intensive care: 2,087 (+24 gross, -45 net) Hospital deaths: 17,466 (+54) Care home deaths: 10,642 (+429) Total deaths: 28,108 (+483) Sent home: 61,213 (+147) The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 7,000 in Afghanistan, following a continued surge of transmissions in Kabul and Herat, while war rages on across the country. Over the past 24 hours, 408 new cases were confirmed and three patients died of Covid-19, taking the total number of infections to 7,072 and the death toll to 173. There have so far been 801 recoveries. The heath ministry has pledged to increase the number of daily tests - 23,497 people have so far been tested in Afghanistan. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, said last week the country is waiting to receive more testing kits from the World Health Organization to increase daily testing capacity to around 2,500 in the first phase, 5,000 in the second and finally to 10,000 tests a day. Majroh warned over the weekend that \u201cif people continue not to heed, we will witness a big catastrophe among families\u201d. He said the ministry has a three-phase plan to ease the lockdown and \u201caccording to our plan, the lockdown should be in place for one year so we can get back to normal life\u201d. The capital, Kabul, is the country\u2019s worst affected area in both the number of deaths and transmissions, with 2,066 confirmed cases and 25 deaths reported in the city of around six million. The first case of Covid-19 in Afghanistan was reported in Herat as thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Herat has so far recorded 1,248 confirmed cases and 24 deaths. Of three new deaths, two were reported in the eastern province of Khost, where its deputy health director was wounded when a bomb hit his vehicle on Saturday. War is raging on with full intensity across the country. At least seven people were killed and 40 wounded when an explosion rocked central Ghanzi province on Monday morning. Javid Faisal, spokesman for the office of national security council, said the war had killed hundreds over the last week. \u201cAt least 249 Taliban were killed and 138 wounded by Afghan National Security Forces in the past week. Meanwhile, the Taliban harmed close to 300 civilians. This catastrophic war is a human tragedy that kills Afghans only, and without distinction,\u201d Faisal said. The Philippines has reported seven new coronavirus deaths and 205 additional infections. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total deaths from the outbreak had increased to 831, while confirmed cases have risen to 12,718. But 94 more patients recovered, bringing total recoveries to 2,729. Meanwhile, Malaysian health authorities reported 47 new coronavirus cases, bringing the cumulative total to 6,941 cases. The health ministry also reported no new deaths, keeping total fatalities at 113. Ireland today takes a cautious step to easing its two-month lockdown by allowing some businesses to reopen and up to four people from different households to meet as long as they respect social distancing. Gardening centres, hardware stores, bicycle repair shops and outdoor construction are among the handful of sectors cranking back to life on Monday. It is the first phase of a five-stage plan to lift restrictions spread out over three-week intervals, with the fifth and final phase starting on 10 August. \u201cWe all need to approach the coming days with care and caution, and to show some collective cop-on,\u201d said Simon Harris, the health minister, using an Irish term for common sense. \u201cWe want the shops to stay open, so there\u2019s no need to rush down to your local DIY centre or garden shop today.\u201d On Sunday the country reported 64 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest daily figure since mid March. Testing and contact tracing has expanded and speeded up, bolstering confidence in the ability to monitor and contain outbreaks. However officials worry about a resurgence, with some speculating that the construction sector could become a hotbed similar to nursing homes and meat processing plants. In Northern Ireland, authorities allowed gardening and recycling centres to reopen, a cautious approach that mirrors its southern neighbour. The head of the European Union\u2019s medicines agency, Guido Rasi, has said initial authorisation for remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment could be granted in coming days \u201cIt might be that a conditional market authorisation can be issued in the coming days,\u201d Rasi told a hearing in the EU parliament in Brussels. The European Medicines Agency has already recommended the compassionate use of US pharmaceutical company Gilead\u2019s remdesivir, which allows a drug to be administered to patients even before it has been fully authorised Thailand\u2019s economy shrank for the first time in six years because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered borders and devastated the tourism-reliant country. Forty million tourists were expected to arrive in Thailand this year, drawn to its sandy beaches, nightlife and street food culture. But the outbreak has sharply bruised the country\u2019s cash cow, with tourist vendors reporting as early as mid-January a drop in visitors after China \u2013 Thailand\u2019s largest source of tourists \u2013 went into lockdown. Data released on Monday by its economic planning agency showed a nearly 40% drop in tourist arrivals in the first three months of 2020, compared with the same period last year. The decrease has translated to the economy shrinking 1.8% year-on-year in January-March. Thailand has not seen a contraction since 2014 when it was brought to a standstill by political riots that clogged the streets of Bangkok and led to a coup two months later in May. The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) also forecast the economy to shrink by 5-6% in 2020 - the sharpest drop since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. The International Monetary Fund sets a grimmer outlook, predicting a 6.7% contraction for 2020 - which could make Thailand the worst performer among its peers in Southeast Asia. The country entered a state of emergency in late March and has banned all international flights until the end of June. It has more than 3,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and more than 50 deaths. Yemen, already pushed to the brink of famine by a five-year war, could see a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d food security situation due to the coronavirus pandemic, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has said. The conflict between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has caused what the United Nations describes as the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. Some 80% of Yemen\u2019s population are reliant on aid and millions face hunger. Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, the FAO\u2019s assistant director-general, told Reuters: The health system was already under heavy stress and will now be overwhelmed if Covid-19 continues to spread and, in addition, it will affect the movement of people and the movement of goods. That situation could be really catastrophic if all the elements of worst case scenarios come to be, but let\u2019s hope not, and the UN are working on avoiding that. Yemen, alongside Syria and Sudan, is one of the most vulnerable states in the Middle East in terms of food security. Lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus are likely to impact humanitarian supply chains keeping a large part of the population fed, the UN agency said in a report on Monday. The internationally recognised government has reported 128 Covid-19 infections with 20 deaths in areas under its control. The Houthis, who control most large urban centres, have announced four cases with one death, both in Sanaa. The World Health Organization said last Monday the virus was circulating undetected in Yemen, increasing the likelihood of a devastating outbreak among a malnourished population that would overwhelm a shattered health system with limited testing capacity. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, will hold a video conference later on Monday with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, a statement from Macron\u2019s office said. The statement added that the two leaders will present a new Franco-German initiative at the end of the meeting, around 3pm GMT. It gave no details on what the new initiative might entail, but a source close to Macron told Reuters it would touch on public health, economic recovery, green and digital transition, and industrial sovereignty. France and Germany have struggled to present a united front in the coronavirus crisis, with France leading a push by mostly southern European countries to convince fiscally conservative countries like Germany to issue joint European debt to help them weather the economic impact. The two countries, long the engines of EU integration, have also fared differently in dealing with the pandemic, with the number of deaths in France three times higher than in Germany, according to official figures. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by coverage of the pandemic, try our list of non-coronavirus articles that our readers spent the most time with over the weekend. India began evacuating thousands of villagers and halted port operations ahead of a cyclone expected to hit its east coast this week, piling pressure on emergency services grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. The cyclone, expected to make landfall on Wednesday, comes as India eases the world\u2019s longest lockdown, imposed in April against the virus, which has infected more than 96,169 people and killed 3,029. The states of Odisha and West Bengal sent disaster management teams to move families from homes of mud and thatch to places of shelter from the severe cyclonic storm, Amphan, which is expected to gain strength in the next 12 hours. \u201cWe have to evacuate people from low-lying areas, and protect them from the coronavirus too,\u201d said a senior official of India\u2019s home ministry who sought anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task.\u201d The cyclone season usually runs from April to December, with severe storms forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread death and damage to crops and property, both in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Authorities at the port of Paradip in Odisha ordered ships to move out to sea to avoid damage as the cyclone formed over the Bay of Bengal. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is set to hold a meeting in New Delhi to plan how to mitigate damage and injuries. \u201cThe extremely severe cyclonic storm \u2018Amphan\u2019...is likely to gain more strength and intensify further into a super cyclonic storm in the next 12 hours,\u201d weather officials said in a statement, forecasting heavy rain in eastern and southern areas. Russia said under 9,000 new coronavirus cases had been recorded for the first time since early May as anti-virus restrictions ease and officials say the situation is stabilising. Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the United States. It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief, Anna Popova, said this weekend that the growth in new cases was slowing and the country has \u201cmoved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for\u201d. Russia began easing nationwide lockdown restrictions last week and announced the national football league would restart in late June. Health officials also announced 91 new deaths, down from Saturday\u2019s figure of 119 that was the highest daily toll yet. Russia\u2019s total fatalities now stand at 2,722, a rate considerably lower than in many other countries hit hard by the pandemic. Critics have cast doubt on Russia\u2019s low official mortality rate, accusing authorities of under-reporting in order to play down the scale of the crisis. Russian health officials say one of the reasons the count is lower is that only deaths directly caused by the virus are being included. The deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, over the weekend denied manipulation of numbers, saying hospitals had a financial interest in identifying infections because they are allocated more money to treat coronavirus patients. Authorities also say that since the virus came later to Russia, there was more time to prepare hospital beds and launch wide-scale testing to slow the spread. China\u2019s foreign ministry has said it is premature to immediately launch an investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 300,000 people globally. Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a daily briefing that the vast majority of countries in the world believe the pandemic is not yet over. The ministry said in a separate statement that president Xi Jinping will give a video speech for the opening ceremony of the World Health Assembly later on Monday. A draft resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus has support from 116 nations at the assembly, almost enough for it to pass. Anatole Bandu, a country representative for HelpAge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has written this moving piece about the people in Kinshasa have no money, no soap, no water \u2013 and when they are struggling to breathe, no ventilators. We\u2019re used to emergencies and people dying in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whether it\u2019s a result of the long-running conflict or Ebola, cholera and malaria. But coronavirus has knocked us for six, because it has affected people we are very close to. I\u2019ve been working in development for decades, but I have to admit I have shed tears these past few weeks. We started getting calls as soon as the lockdown began. Many of the older people we support have chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, and without public transport were unable to get their medicines. They have no money for taxis. So we have been delivering medicines to people\u2019s doors. One couple in Kinshasa\u2019s Gombe commune both suffered from hypertension. They had been trying to access their medicine for a while before they called us. When we delivered it, the husband was very short of breath. We called an emergency response team, who tested him for Covid-19. It took a week for the results to come back and he was taken to hospital, where he died two days later. The hospital had no ventilators and very few health workers. Many had left, too scared to work without PPE. His wife also became very ill. Unsurprisingly, when I last delivered her medicine she was very depressed, frightened and confused. She was struggling to speak and just looked up at the sky, muttering she was offering her life up to God as she had no idea what tomorrow would bring. She died last week in hospital, unable to breathe. There was no ventilator. The Spanish cabinet is due to approve a programme to grant a basic income to the poorest to help them weather the economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, social security minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, has said. In an interview with RNE radio station, Escriv\u00e1 said ministers would likely approve the programme during the weekly cabinet meeting scheduled on 26 May. He said as many as one million families would receive the new benefit, which would cost the government between \u20ac3 - 3.5bn per year. Brazilian journalist Caio Barretto Briso has this report from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, where a recent police raid killed 13 people. Maria Diva do Nascimento was worried as she set off for her job at one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s biggest hospitals wearing a face mask she hoped would keep her alive. It had been two days since she had heard from her son Allyson, a 20-year-old drug trafficker whose job made social isolation impossible. Nascimento knew the risks of Covid-19 well: four days earlier it had killed a friend and fellow security guard at the hospital. More than half of her co-workers had been infected. But when the 42-year-old reached work on Friday, she received news of another, even more immediate threat to her child. Armed police were sweeping into the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, the vast favela where Allyson worked for Brazil\u2019s oldest drug faction, the Red Command. Helicopters soared overhead. \u201cWhere are you???\u201d Allyson\u2019s panicked mother asked him on WhatsApp at 6.39am. \u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d he answered. But that was the last message he sent her. By lunchtime, Nascimento would learn her son was dead \u2013 one of more than 2,000 mostly young Brazilians gunned down by Rio police since the start of last year. \u201cI brought him into this world,\u201d she said on Saturday, crying as she prepared to say farewell. \u201cNo one had the right to take him away.\u201d Police operations and body bags are nothing new to Rio, where state police killed a record 1,810 people last year, nearly five a day. But with the city now in partial shutdown because of Covid-19, and citizens under orders to stay indoors, favela residents are voicing outrage that the police\u2019s terrifying incursions into their communities have not been halted. A draft resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus has support from 116 nations at the World Health Assembly, almost enough for it to pass, a document showed. The resolution on Covid-19 will be put forward on Tuesday if it gains backing from two-thirds of the 194 members of the assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization. China had strongly opposed Australia\u2019s call last month for an international investigation into the pandemic. Names on a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Monday showed support from 116 members was locked in, although Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said negotiations were ongoing and she did not want to pre-empt the outcome. The resolution was \u201can important part of the conversation we started, and I am very grateful to the efforts of those in the European Union and those many drafters who have been part of the negotiations for the past few weeks,\u201d she told reporters. The resolution included a call for \u201can examination of the zoonotic origins of the coronavirus\u201d, she added. Australia - which has reported 99 deaths from the coronavirus - says it wants to prevent a repeat of the pandemic, and is not looking to cast blame. \u201cI hope that China will participate,\u201d Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham, said on Monday, as he welcomed building support for an inquiry. Among the co-sponsors of the resolution are India, Japan, South Korea, the African group of 47 member nations, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Britain and Canada. The resolution calls for \u201cscientific and collaborative field missions\u201d to trace the path of transmission, saying this will reduce the risk of similar events. It also says a review should start at the \u201cearliest appropriate moment\u201d. Some countries still suffering high daily death tolls from Covid-19 have said it is too soon for an investigation. Despite strong efforts, Taiwan did not get invited to this week\u2019s meeting of a key World Health Organization body due to Chinese pressure, its foreign minister has said, adding they had agreed to put the issue off until later this year. Non-WHO member Taiwan had been lobbying to take part in the World Health Assembly, which opens later on Monday. Taiwan has said it wanted to share with the world its successful experience at fighting the coronavirus, having only reported 440 cases and seven deaths thanks to early detection and prevention work. But China, which considers democratically-ruled Taiwan its own with no right to attend international bodies as a sovereign state, strongly objected to Taiwan taking part in the assembly unless it accepted it was part of China, something the Taipei government refused to do. Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told reporters: Despite all our efforts and an unprecedented level of international support, Taiwan has not received an invitation to take part. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses deep regret and strong dissatisfaction that the World Health Organization Secretariat has yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and continues to disregard the right to health of the 23 million people of Taiwan. Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the pandemic, which Taiwan has strongly disputed. The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing. Taiwan attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects. Wu said that Taiwan had agreed the issue of its participation would be put off until later in the year so the shorted assembly can focus on the coronavirus. Understandably, countries want to use the limited time available to concentrate on ways of containing the pandemic. For this reason, like-minded nations and diplomatic allies have suggested that the proposal be taken up later this year when meetings will be conducted normally, to make sure there will be full and open discussion. After careful deliberation, we have accepted the suggestion from our allies and like-minded nations to wait until the resumed session before further promoting our bid. Hungary\u2019s government will submit a proposal to parliament on 26 May to end its special coronavirus emergency powers, hirtv.hu quoted prime minister Viktor Orban\u2019s chief of staff as saying late on Sunday. Gergely Gulyas said parliament would take a few days to pass the bill, which will end the much-criticised emergency powers by early June. No end date was set when parliament gave the government permission to rule by decree in matters related to the coronavirus, leading to international criticism and accusations of an autocratic power-grab. The chief executive of Ryanair has accused the UK government of mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis, as the airline halved its passenger forecast for this year. Michael O\u2019Leary described the UK\u2019s planned introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for travellers arriving from abroad as \u201cidiotic and unimplementable\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis is the same government that has \u2026 mismanaged the crisis for many weeks.\u201d He said the UK was \u201cmaking this stuff up as they go along\u201d, referring to its transport policy. O\u2019Leary added that face masks were essential for people travelling on mass transport. Ryanair said it had one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with cash of \u20ac4.1bn (\u00a33.7bn), after recently raising \u00a3600m under the UK\u2019s Covid corporate financing facility, which was set up by the Treasury and the Bank of England to help large businesses weather the crisis. O\u2019Leary spoke as the airline, Europe\u2019s largest, published a \u20ac1bn profit for the year to 31 March, up from \u20ac885m the previous year. It said the pandemic had cost it \u20ac40m in lost profits, after travel restrictions in Europe forced it to ground almost its entire fleet. The Irish carrier forecast a loss of more than \u20ac200m for the first quarter, followed by a smaller loss in the second quarter. It expects to carry fewer than 80 million passengers this year, almost half its original 154 million target. Here is a quick summary of the coronavirus situation across the globe: Restaurants and churches will reopen in Italy on Monday as part of a fresh wave of lockdown easing in Europe, but rising coronavirus death tolls in Brazil, South Africa and other parts of the world showed the worst is still to come in many countries. The relaxation of curbs in some places comes as governments around the world struggle to repair the vast economic damage unleashed by the pandemic, with Japan the latest to slump into a recession and the Fed warning of a severe US downturn as the global infection count topped 4.7 million. But the World Health Organization has warned that reopening too quickly without a vaccine could trigger a second devastating wave of infections, and the body will host a virtual global health assembly this week to help chart a course out of the crisis. Once the worst-hit country in the world, Italy is now taking its latest step in a cautious, gradual return to normality, allowing businesses and churches to reopen after a two-month lockdown. \u201cI share the joy of those communities who can finally reunite as liturgical assemblies, a sign of hope for all society,\u201d Pope Francis said on Sunday during his live-streamed prayer, with Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica also throwing its door open to visitors. Businesses including restaurants, bars, cafes, hairdressers, and stores will be allowed to re-open on Monday. Gyms, pools, cinemas and theatres are allowed to open on 25 May. Spain is also set to further ease its lockdown measures, while Germany has already taken several steps towards a reopening, including the resumption of its top football league - but with empty stadiums. There was other welcome relief for Europeans on the weekend too, with people enjoying beaches in France, Greece and Italy, and Britons going to parks to bask in the sun. Deaths in Brazil have risen sharply in recent days, and with more than 241,000 infections reached over the weekend, South America\u2019s largest country now has the fourth-highest caseload in the world. But president Jair Bolsonaro has been a staunch opponent of lockdowns, claiming they have unnecessarily hurt the Brazilian economy, but experts and regional leaders have warned that the healthcare infrastructure could collapse. The far-right leader alongside several ministers greeted hundreds of his supporters in the capital Brasilia on Sunday in defiance of social distancing measures, telling the crowd that the virus restrictions were too much. Latin America and the Caribbean have recorded more than half a million infections, with almost half of them from Brazil, and there is growing alarm about the impact of the virus on the least privileged in the region. There was also grim data in Africa, where the number of infections rose rapidly. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, taking the total to 15,515 - the highest on the continent. After more than 50 years fighting for civil rights, the Rev Jesse Jackson is now watching coronavirus ravage African American communities. But he has a warning for the rich and powerful. Our military cannot defeat this germ. Having the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything. Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing. Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart. Japan\u2019s beloved Mount Fuji will be closed during this year\u2019s summer climbing season to prevent the spread of Covid-19, officials have said. Shizuoka prefecture, home to the country\u2019s tallest mountain, announced they were closing three of the four major routes to the mountain\u2019s peak. \u201cThe routes open in summer but this year we will keep them closed from July 10 to September 10,\u201d the only climbing season for Mount Fuji, a Shizuoka prefecture official told AFP. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this measure so as not to spread the coronavirus,\u201d the official said. It will be the first time the trails of the 3,776-metre (12,388 ft) volcanic mountain are closed since at least 1960 when the prefecture began managing the routes, he added. The decision comes after nearby Yamanashi prefecture said it will close the Yoshida trail, the most popular hiking path among the four. The mountain huts along the four routes will remain closed as well. The mountain, a UNESCO world cultural heritage site, welcomed about 236,000 climbers last year, according to the Mount Fuji official website. Thanks Helen, this is Jessica Murray taking charge of the ship (blog) for the next few hours. As always, I\u2019d love to hear your suggestions and experiences, so please do get in touch if you would like to: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ I\u2019ll try to respond to as many as I can, and I\u2019ll certainly read them all. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks as always for following along. My colleague Jessica Murray will be steering the good ship blog for the next few hours. Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Global infections pass 4.7 million. There are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187 people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. Japan falls into recession. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019. In Brazil, the BBC has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room. India extends lockdown by another two weeks. India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Why the UK fell behind European peers on emergency funding Across Europe, government-backed business loan schemes in Germany, France and Switzerland have been quicker to distribute emergency funding during the coronavirus outbreak than those in the UK, where teething problems put the British programme weeks behind mainland rivals. The UK\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which was initially fraught with controversy over demands for personal guarantees, took a month to distribute 18,595 loans worth \u00a33.1bn. But the pace of approvals jumped following the introduction of two additional programmes, including the bounce-back loan scheme that handed \u00a32bn to 69,000 Britain\u2019s smallest businesses within the first 24 hours of its launch on 4 May. Seven weeks in, the UK is finally catching up, having handed almost \u00a315bn to more than 304,000 firms But why did the UK struggle to keep up with its European peers in the first place? Experts say the answer may be linked to borrowing trends, the nature of Britain\u2019s financial system, and the UK\u2019s relationship with government spending. Global report: US unemployment could hit 25%, warns Fed chairman, as Japan enters recession Unemployment in the United States could peak at 25% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the chair of the Federal Reserve, amid warnings the June quarter economic figures will be \u201cvery, very bad\u201d. The bleak prediction came as Japan slid into its first recession in five years, with forecasts that worse was to come. In a sober assessment of the economic impact of coronavirus in the US, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, estimated GDP contraction in the June quarter could be \u201ceasily be in the twenties or thirties\u201d, as fallout from the global outbreak worsened. \u201cSo the data we\u2019ll see for this quarter, which ends in June, will be very, very bad,\u201d he said. Asked about estimates of unemployment reaching 20-25%, Powell said: \u201cI think there\u2019re a range of perspectives. But those numbers sound about right for what the peak may be.\u201d As the bad news broke in the US, Japan marked two quarters of negative GDP growth, entering into a recession for the first time since 2015. The economy shrank in 0.9% to the end of March, off the back of a 1.9% drop at the end of 2019. Some analysts predicted more grim news ahead, with the full impact of the pandemic still to be measured. South Korean football team apologises for using sex dolls to fill stands A professional football team in South Korea has apologised after \u201cmannequins\u201d it used as substitute fans during a match at the weekend turned out to be sex dolls. The K-League club FC Seoul said the dolls, which had been dotted around stands currently off-limits to supporters due to the coronavirus outbreak, had been ordered inadvertently after a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with the supplier. Earlier this month the K-League became the first major football league to hold matches since the start of the pandemic, with the season\u2019s opening game watched by a worldwide audience of fans starved of live football. But FC Seoul\u2019s attempt to bring a touch of realism to Sunday\u2019s match against Gwangju FC backfired after social media users noticed that the mannequins looked more like sex dolls. China facing pressure over Covid-19 and Taiwan at World Health Assembly Beijing is expected to face new levels of pressure at the World Health Assembly this week as dozens of nations push for an independent investigation into the coronavirus outbreak and the United States mounts a campaign over Taiwan\u2019s status. More than 120 countries have backed a call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19 while a US-led coalition has been aggressively lobbying countries to support Taiwan\u2019s bid to attend as an observer. China has blocked Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of China, from attending the meeting since 2016 as relations between Beijing and Taipei worsened following the election of Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party. \u2018Cleaner and greener\u2019: Covid-19 prompts world\u2019s cities to free public space of cars The mayor of Athens has said he will \u201cliberate\u201d public space from cars. His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight. Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects. Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby. World Health Assembly: what is it, and what is the coronavirus inquiry proposal? The World Health Assembly is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, attended by representatives of the United Nation\u2019s 194 member states. The two-day 2020 assembly will be held virtually \u2013 it usually happens in Geneva \u2013 because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis around the world. This year\u2019s assembly, the 73rd WHA, will be dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. This will be a critical assembly: the annual meeting comes at a time when the WHO has attracted unprecedented global attention for its coordination and advisory role during the pandemic. Influential states, most notably the US, have criticised the WHO for being slow to react, and alleged it has been biased towards China. The US has withheld funding from the WHO in response to its perceived Covid-19 failings. Global infections pass 4.7 millionThere are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187 people have died over the course of the pandemic so far. The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities so far and 1,486,757 infections. US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could hit 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. Japan\u2019s economic growth falls into recession in the first quarter. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus.The Cabinet Office reported Monday a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor: hospitals \u201cnear collapse\u201d. In Brazil, the BBCreports that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d: they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said.Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday has seen lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps: UN chief. Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said.The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar.A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday. WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA), which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees. India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Nigeria seizes British plane flouting travel ban. Nigeria has seized a British plane for defying a travel ban imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation minister said Sunday.Flair Aviation, the airline involved, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights, Hadi Sirika said on his Twitter account. Qatar makes masks mandatory on pain of prison. Qatar has begun enforcing the world\u2019s toughest penalties of up to three years\u2019 in prison for failing to wear masks in public, in a country with one of the highest coronavirus infection rates. More than 32,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the tiny Gulf country - 1.2 percent of the 2.75 million population - although just 15 people have died. Only the micro-states of San Marino and the Vaticanhave had higher per-capita infection rates, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Italy\u2019s shops, restaurants and hair salons have been preparing to reopen on Monday, as the government further eases the lockdown. Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least one metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists. Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports from Washington with Dan Sabbagh in London: Saudi Arabia may be forced to forego new weapons contracts and delay already-agreed weapons purchases as a financial crisis grips the kingdom, experts predict. The expected delay of new weapons deals could have long-term political repercussions for the country under the rule of Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler who has waged a bloody war with neighbouring Yemen. Saudi Arabia is facing an unprecedented budget crunch because of the collapse of the oil markets and the global economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced oil demand for the foreseeable future. \u201cI have no doubt, this is the end of an era. The era of the Persian Gulf having all this money is over,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at Brookings in Washington and 30-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, who has served as an adviser on Middle East issues to several US administrations. Burundi to go to polls amid fears authorities playing down Covid-19 Millions of voters in Burundi will go to the polls on Wednesday to elect a new president in the first competitive election since a decade-long civil war began in 1993. Amid concern that authorities are deliberately playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic, seven candidates are seeking to replace the incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza, who is being forced to step down by opponents within the country\u2019s ruling CNDD-FDD party. Rights groups say the government is pressing ahead with the vote irresponsibly, and accuse the CNDD-FDD and its youth wing of crushing dissent and threatening those taking their own measures against coronavirus. Last week Burundi expelled the World Health Organization\u2019s expert team working on coronavirus. Campaigning politicians have held rallies attended by tens of thousands. The nation of 11 million people has reported 27 cases of Covid-19 so far but has only carried out about 520 tests in total. Officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear. Summer weather is enticing much of the world to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns as centres of the outbreak from New York to Italy and Spain gradually lift restrictions that have kept millions indoors for months, Reuters reports. People are streaming back to beaches, parks and streets just as a heat wave hits southern Europe and spring-like temperatures allow Americans to shed winter coats. Greeks flocked to the seaside on Saturday when more than 500 beaches reopened, coinciding with temperatures of 34 Celsius (93 Fahrenheit). Umbrella poles had to be 4 meters (13 ft) apart, with canopies no closer than 1 meter as the country sought to walk the fine line between protecting people from Covid-19 while reviving the tourism sector that many depend on for their livelihoods. White circles were painted on the lawn in Brooklyn\u2019s Domino Park in New York City to help sunbathers and picnickers keep a safe distance. About half the people in the park appeared to be wearing some form of face covering as they congregated in small groups on a warm Saturday afternoon with police officers in masks keeping watch. In Paris\u2019 Bois de Boulogne, health training worker Anne Chardon was carrying disinfectant gel and a mask but said she felt a sense of freedom again for the first time after weeks of confinement. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we were in Sleeping Beauty\u2019s castle, all asleep, all frozen, and suddenly there\u2019s light and space, suddenly we can experience again the little joys of everyday, in the spaces that belong to us, and that we\u2019re rediscovering.\u201d China\u2019s levels of some air pollutants have risen back to above last year\u2019s levels after dropping when the government imposed strict lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic, according to a study published on Monday. The rebound was likely due to industrial activity, the researchers said, adding there were concerns that after months of unusually low pollution levels, a drive to kickstart economic activity was causing emissions to spike. \u201cThere are early warning signs that China\u2019s recovery from the Covid-19 crisis is reversing air quality gains,\u201d the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), which produced the study, said. Average levels of some air pollutants in China dropped in February to significantly below levels for the same period in 2019, as lockdown measures shuttered factories, curbed electricity demand and slashed transport use as swathes of the population stayed home. But average levels of some pollutants have since rebounded, and were higher in the 30 days ended 8 May compared with the same period in 2019, CREA said in its analysis of data from 1,500 air quality monitoring stations in China. This was true of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter, suggesting a rebound in industrial activity drove the trend, CREA said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 2 to 174,355, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday. The tally showed no further deaths due to the virus. The reported death toll remained at 7,914. Meanwhile football team Bayern Munich returned to action Sunday with a 2-0 win at Union Berlin as the restart of German soccer continued in empty stadiums. Players shouts echoed off the rows of concrete terracing around Unions stadium, AP reports. A Canadian aerobatics jet has crashed into a British Columbia neighbourhood during a flyover intended to boost morale during the Covid-19 pandemic, killing one crew member, seriously injuring another and setting a house on fire, AP reports. Video appeared to show the crew of the Snowbirds\u2019 plane ejecting during the crash on Sunday. Debris was scattered across Kamloops, the neighbourhood near the airport 260 miles (418km) north-east of Vancouver. The Snowbirds are Canada\u2019s equivalent of the US Air Force Thunderbirds or the UK\u2019s Red Arrows. In Australia, more than 150 Australian newsrooms have shut since January 2019 as Covid-19 deepens a media crisis. The closure of BuzzFeed News in Australia may have grabbed the headlines last week but the digital startup is just one victim on a growing list of media casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five editorial staff at BuzzFeed have lost their jobs, but across the country hundreds more have been stood down in an already fractured media landscape. It\u2019s unclear how many will ever return to their posts. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s partner, everybody: More from New Zealand now, with the full report on the country passing the population milestone of 5 million people: It was a much-anticipated milestone likely hastened by Covid-19: New Zealand has reached a population of 5 million people, after citizens and residents rushed home when borders began to close due to the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand grew from four to five million in 17 years, the quickest rate of growth in the country\u2019s modern history, according to the government agency Statistics New Zealand. Migration has been the chief driver for the population of the isolated island nation, which increased by half a million people in the past six years alone. On 18 March, the government urged the 80,000 New Zealanders overseas to return home, adding that the window to travel was closing rapidly. People who are not citizens or residents of the country - or their immediate family - are not currently permitted to enter New Zealand under Covid-19 border controls. New Zealand braces for spike in child abuse reports as Covid-19 lockdown eases As hundreds of thousands of children return to classrooms around New Zealand, welfare services are bracing themselves for a spike in reports of abuse and neglect after weeks of \u201cinvisible\u201d lockdown. The country entered lockdown on 25 March and emerged late last week. During lockdown reports of family violence to police dropped, and reports of concern to Oranga Tamariki, the country\u2019s welfare agency for children, fell by around 40%. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of child abuse and neglect in the OECD, and on average one infant is murdered every five weeks. Oranga Tamariki\u2019s chief executive, Gr\u00e1inne Moss, told the Guardian that reports of harm always drop over the school holidays, because the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d that usually identify harm \u2013 education, social and health workers \u2013 aren\u2019t around. But the prolonged nature of lockdown and the added stress of job losses among already strained families was creating \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, Moss said, and rises in family violence overseas are likely to hold true in New Zealand too, though no local research has been conducted yet. \u201cLockdown is a lot longer than the school holidays so we are right to be concerned that there is hidden, invisible harm occurring to children,\u201d Moss said. In the US, the Republican senator Ben Sasse\u2019s attempt at humor during a speech for high school students has drawn strong criticism, the AP reports. Sasse delivered the online speech to students at his former school, Fremont high in Nebraska, on Saturday. Sasse mixed some serious encouragement for students with another shot at China. \u201cNobody knows exactly how we\u2019re going to beat this thing, but you know what, we\u2019re Americans, we\u2019re Nebraskans, we\u2019ve got grit and we\u2019re going to beat this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring the economy back. We are going to beat the virus ... We\u2019re going to have to have a serious reckoning with the thugs in China who let this mess spiral out of control by lying about it,\u201d he said. Sasse also joked about psychologists: \u201cNinety-five per cent of all gainfully employed psychologists \u2013 and I\u2019m serious, there are dozens of them that are gainfully employed - their job is really just to help people forget high school ... If you\u2019re headed to college, do not do not major in psychology. That part\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Mexico on Sunday reported 49,219 cases of the coronavirus, 2,075 more than the previous day, as the country prepares to resume economic activities deemed essential. Deaths from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, increased by 132, to a total of 5,177. Mexico announced last week a plan to gradually resume economic activity that has been halted by the coronavirus, starting on 1 June. On Friday, Mexico\u2019s government said the automotive industry could exit the coronavirus lockdown before 1 June if companies had in place approved safety measures. Deputy Health Minister Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell told a news conference on Sunday that cases had started to stabilize over the past week in Mexico City and its metropolitan area, which has the highest level of infection in the country. Authorities have said that the true number of cases could be up to nine times greater than the reported total because many of those infected likely did not go to the doctor, did not develop symptoms or were not properly diagnosed. Mexico has seen a slightly higher death rate from the coronavirus than the global average so far because of the widespread presence of pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, experts say. The Guardian\u2019s Tom Lutz and Jessica Glenza report: Donald Trump has hit back at Barack Obama\u2019s criticism of his administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, accusing the former US president of being \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d during his time in office. It is rare for a former president to rebuke a successor, but Obama did so during an online speech to graduating university and high school students yesterday, although he did not name Trump in his comments. \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge,\u201d Obama said during an online commencement address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on Saturday. On Sunday, Trump said he had not seen Obama\u2019s comments, but added: \u201cLook, he was an incompetent president, that\u2019s all I can say. Grossly incompetent.\u201d In the US, a Roman Catholic priest in the Detroit area has taken aim at his parishioners in a bid to maintain social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, using a squirt gun to shoot holy water. Photos posted on social media by the St Ambrose Church show the Reverend Timothy Pelc shooting water into a car window as it stopped by the steps of the church. He wore a mask, face shield and rubber gloves as further precautions against spreading the coronavirus. The photos of the priest at the church in Grosse Pointe Park were taken at Easter but have recently gone viral and have inspired memes online. One shows the 70-year-old priest amid the fires of hell directing the squirt gun at devil-like figures. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The Cabinet Office reported Monday a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter. The annual pace gives what the rate would be when continued for a year. For just the quarter, the drop was 0.9%, AP reports. Exports dived 21.8%. Private residential investments slipped nearly 17%, and household consumption edged down 3.1%. Analysts say things are expected to get worse, as the world\u2019s third-largest economy undergoes its biggest challenge since the second world war. Japan is in a technical recession, defined as two quarters straight of contraction, as its economy contracted 1.9% in October-December. It remained flat July-September, and eked out 0.5% growth for April-June, according to the latest numbers. Japan is extremely vulnerable to the economic damage from the ongoing outbreak. It is dependent on trade with both China and theUS, the country where the pandemic began and the country where it has hit hardest. The manufacturers that are pillars of Japan\u2019s economy, such as Toyota Motor Corp, have reported dismal financial results results. Travel, tourism and trade with those countries and others have faded. New Zealand\u2019s population has grown to 5 million people as a result of the lockdown, with citizens returning home from living overseas, AAP reports. New Zealand grew from four to five million in 17 years, the quickest rate of growth in the country\u2019s modern history. On Monday, Stats NZ released its quarterly estimate resident population figures which showed New Zealand notching the major milestone. As of 31 March, the South Pacific nation has 5,002,100 residents. In all likelihood, New Zealand has reached the figure because of the pandemic. \u201cCOVID-19 has caused some unusual and unprecedented travel patterns,\u201d Stats NZ senior demographer Kim Dunstan told AAP. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people that have been in New Zealand prolong their stay which has given some boost to migration. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had more New Zealand citizens returning from living overseas in recent months. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve also had fewer citizens departing New Zealand to live overseas. \u201cThe combined impact has seen an upswing in migration which has helped New Zealand reach that five million milestone.\u201d China reported seven new coronavirus cases for 17 May, up from five a day earlier, the country\u2019s health authority said on Monday. Of the new cases, four were imported from the Inner Mongolia province. The country also reported 18 new asymptomatic cases on 17 May, versus 12 the day before. Apple Inc will this week reopen more than 25 of its branded stores in the United States, a company spokesman said on Sunday, continuing a gradual process that has unlocked doors at nearly a fifth of its worldwide retail outlets, Reuters reports. The iPhone maker in March shut all its stores outside of Greater China in response to the spread of the coronavirus. It started shutting its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. \u201cOur commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,\u201d Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s head of retail, wrote on Sunday in a note on the company\u2019s website. The stores will impose social-distancing rules, limit occupancy and some will offer only curbside or storefront service, she said. Last week, Apple reopened its first five stores in the United States, requiring customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the premises. Apple has 510 stores worldwide and 271 in the United States. The website 9to5Mac reported that the company would reopen 10 of its stores in Italy beginning on Tuesday. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could hit 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave. He suggested that a full recovery won\u2019t likely be possible before the arrival of a vaccine. In an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d, Powell played down comparisons to the Depression. While acknowledging that unemployment could peak near the Depression high of 25%, he noted that US banks are far healthier now and that the Fed and other central banks are much more able and willing to intervene to bolster economies than they were in the 1930s. Powell pointed out that the downturn wasn\u2019t a result of deep-seated financial instabilities, like the housing meltdown and the excessive risk-taking among banks that ignited the Great Recession. Rather, it resulted from an external event a pandemic that required a shutdown of the economy. That may mean, he said, that \u201cwe can get back to a healthy economy fairly quickly.\u201d In the meantime, though, American workers are enduring their worst crisis in decades. More than 36 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus first forced businesses to close down and shrink their workforces. The unemployment rate, at 14.7%, is the highest since the Great Depression, and is widely expected to go much higher. In Brazil, the BBC reports that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d: they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday to back his open-the-economy drive even as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country, AP reports. Demonstrators in Brasilia and Sao Paulo defied local stay-at-home orders to join the pro-Bolsonaro rallies at a time when the president is facing increasing pressure over his handling of the pandemic. \u201cWe hope to be free of this question soon, for the good of all of us, Bolsonaro told the crowd in Brasilia. Brazil will come back stronger.\u201d Bolsonaro later invited a group of about 20 paratroopers, who were taking part in the protest, to join him on the stoop of the presidential office. The men, wearing camouflage trousers, black Bolsonaro t-shirts and red berets, swore allegiance to the president and his family, stretching their right arms, before some joined him in a series of push-ups. Supporters have gathered daily at the presidential residence, with larger crowds turning out on weekends. India\u2019s lockdown extension also brings what the Times of India calls \u201cthe most significant easing of the national lockdown yet,\u201d with states being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. States will colour-code zones according to the level of infection, and allow greater or lesser economic activity depending on this. NDTV explains the easing as follows: The practice of work from home should be followed to the extent possible, the Centre said. At workplaces, staggering of work hours should be adopted. There should be provision for thermal scanning, hand wash and sanitizers and common areas and rules of social distancing should be maintained. The government has also not allowed any re-opening of areas which draw a large number of people -- shopping malls and multiplexes, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, bars and auditoriums, assembly halls, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services. Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar. A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday. The Rohingya on Bhashan Char island - a silty strip of land prone to violent and potentially deadly monsoon storms - were rescued in early May after floating adrift in the Bay of Bengal. Dhaka has said they were not initially sent on to the camps in the southeast as authorities were afraid they might have coronavirus. Guterres said the 308 refugees should be moved to the camps after their time in quarantine is completed. A bit of background on Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the WHO: Taiwan - officially the Republic of China - was a founding member of the WHO when the global health body was created in 1948. But it was expelled in 1972 a year after losing the \u201cChina\u201d seat at the United Nations to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Between 2009 and 2016 Beijing allowed Taiwan to attend the WHA as an observer under the name \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d. It lost that status with the election in Taiwan of President Tsai Ing-wen who views the island as a de facto independent nation and does not subscribe to Beijing\u2019s idea that it belongs to a \u201cone China\u201d. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA), which opens virtually on Monday, before one of its committees, AFP reports. Taiwan is currently excluded from the WHO but in the midst of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing around the novel coronavirus, the administration of US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for the island\u2019s participation at the WHA in spite of opposition from China. Many heads of state, government and ministers are expected to attend the two-day virtual meeting on the pandemic which the WHO hopes will take a physical form later in the year. Asked repeatedly on the subject at a news conference, the WHO said that it only has the role of secretariat of the assembly and that only member states can decide to invite Taiwan or not. In a document relating to the WHA agenda and dated 15 May, the head of the WHO said that the proposal was being \u201csubmitted to the General Committee for its consideration\u201d. Due to the pandemic this ad-hoc committee will not be able to sit on Monday, delaying any ruling. It will have to decide on the issue during the physical meeting that the WHO hopes to organise at the end of the year. Nothing, however, prevents a country calling on Monday for a vote on the presence of Taiwan. The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities of the world\u2019s refugees and internally displaced people, according to a report. Research from the University of Birmingham has revealed that many undocumented migrants were anxious about seeking medical help \u2013 fearful of being reported to immigration authorities and being deported \u2013 and were therefore suffering in silence. The report, Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 on Forced Migrant Survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence, due to be published on Monday, took witness testimonies from more than 90 survivors and organisations in five countries, including the UK. It found that victims were finding themselves locked in with perpetrators, with no access to shelters or advice organisations, and as a result were having to suffer abuse. In case you missed it: India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and some other key regions still battling to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections, reports the Associated Press. The government-run National Disaster Management authority said in a statement on Sunday that fresh guidelines will be issued that keep in view the need to open up economic activity. Indian media reports said that travel by air, rail and metro will remain shut down until the end of May. Schools, hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, cinemas and places of worship will also be closed nationally. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. The numbers of deaths rose by three to 263 from Saturday. Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy has the highest numbers of infections in Africa, followed by Egypt, which has so far recorded 11,719 Covid-19 cases, including 612 deaths. The country has been under lockdown since March 27 and has embarked on an aggressive mass testing strategy with 460,873 tested so far. But some health experts are beginning to see the limits of the country\u2019s lauded mass screening strategy, with results taking up to two weeks to come through. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. We welcome questions, comments, tips and news from your part of the world \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. South Africa has recorded its highest daily increase in cases, with 1,160 new cases confirmed. Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy has the highest numbers of infections in Africa, followed by Egypt, which has so far recorded 11,719 Covid-19 cases, including 612 deaths. The country has been under lockdown since March 27 and has embarked on an aggressive mass testing strategy with 460,873 tested so far. But some health experts are beginning to see the limits of the country\u2019s lauded mass screening strategy, with results taking up to two weeks to come through. Global infections pass 4.7 million. There are 4,702,603 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 314,476 people have died over the course of the pandemic so far. South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday has seen lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Nigeria seizes British plane flouting travel ban. Nigeria has seized a British plane for defying a travel ban imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation minister said Sunday.Flair Aviation, the airline involved, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights, Hadi Sirika said on his Twitter account. Qatar makes masks mandatory on pain of prison. Qatar has begun enforcing the world\u2019s toughest penalties of up to three years\u2019 in prison for failing to wear masks in public, in a country with one of the highest coronavirus infection rates. More than 32,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the tiny Gulf country - 1.2 percent of the 2.75 million population - although just 15 people have died. Only the micro-states of San Marino and the Vatican have had higher per-capita infection rates, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Italy\u2019s shops, restaurants and hair salons have been preparing to reopen on Monday, as the government further eases the lockdown. Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least one metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists. Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. Benin is staging local elections, minus key opposition parties, with authorities pushing ahead despite the coronavirus. The West African nation of 11 million this week lifted a series of restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus, which has caused 339 confirmed infections and two deaths in the country. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy, with the country announcing nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday. This takes Brazil\u2019s total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. The city of Wuhan conducted 222,675 nucleic acid tests on 16 May, the local health authority said, nearly doubling from a day earlier. Wuhan kicked off a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers after confirming last weekend its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since its release from lockdown on 8 April. Quebec is considering making masks mandatory, after banning the veil. The Canadian province at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak is is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks, but has not made the measure mandatory. Quebec\u2019s public health director stressed \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d The growth of new coronavirus cases in Russia is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week. The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the United States. Madagascar has reported the first death of a patient suffering from the coronavirus, nearly two months after the virus was first detected in the country. The victim was a 57-year-old man with underlying conditions. Madagascar has reported 304 cases.",

It was just a preliminary report and more research was needed, she said. </p> <p>She stressed that the situation in Australia was very different from the situation in the UK.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is very important to note that Australia\u2019s epidemic has been different to many other parts of the world. We closed our borders down very quickly, and that was particularly effective for us. In total in Australia we\u2019ve only had a little over 6,000 cases and our curve has really gone down to just a handful of cases per day now. It has been in that context that we\u2019ve been able to keep schools open by and large.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if her study should be used to persuade teachers in the UK that it was safe to go back to work, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s important to take our study in the context in which it was done. I think it\u2019s really a complex decision, once you are talking about returning to the workplace, returning to school, opening up transportation.

      "bodyText": "Here is the statement from all four chief medical officers in the United Kingdom saying that anosmia (loss of smell) is now being treated as a coronavirus symptom. (See 11.08am.) That means people who lose their sense of smell should self-isolate, even if they do not have other symptoms. The statement says: From today, all individuals should self-isolate if they develop a new continuous cough or fever or anosmia. Anosmia is the loss or a change in your normal sense of smell. It can also affect your sense of taste as the two are closely linked. We have been closely monitoring the emerging data and evidence on Covid-19 and after thorough consideration, we are now confident enough to recommend this new measure. The individual\u2019s household should also self-isolate for 14 days as per the current guidelines and the individual should stay at home for 7 days, or longer if they still have symptoms other than cough or loss of sense of smell or taste. The statement is from the four chief medical officers in the United Kingdom: Prof Chris Whitty (England); Dr Gregor Smith (Scotland); Dr Frank Atherton (Wales); and Dr Michael McBride (Northern Ireland). A \u201cmental health minute\u201d recorded by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has been broadcast on all UK radio stations to mark the start of Mental Health Awareness Week. The message, which was aired at 10.59am and encouraged listeners to \u201creach out to someone\u201d, also featured England football captain Harry Kane, singer Dua Lipa, actor David Tennant and boxer Anthony Joshua. Prince William told listeners: \u201cWe\u2019re all connected and sometimes just talking about how you\u2019re feeling can make a big difference. So right now, let\u2019s join together across the UK and reach out to someone.\u201d Tennant said: \u201cRight now, we need each other more than ever and in the weeks and months ahead of us, we will all have an important role to play in being there for one another.\u201d The broadcast, produced by Radiocentre and Heads Together, marked the first time that all commercial, community and national and local BBC stations jointly aired the same message. I\u2019m Amy Walker. I\u2019ll be joining my colleague Andrew Sparrow to help steer you through today\u2019s UK coronavirus updates. People who experience a loss of smell or taste are being advised to get tested for Covid-19, in a change of guidance from the UK government that experts say is well overdue, Sarah Boseley reports. Her full story is here. Hugh Pym, the BBC\u2019s health editor, did not find much evidence of crowding at Liverpool Street station in London this morning. Prof Tim Spector, the head of the department of genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has restated his claim that the NHS is under-estimating the real number of people infected with coronavirus. His claim is based on the data thrown up by the Covid symptom app launched by Kings. Speaking on the Today programme, Spector claimed there were 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with coronavirus who are not being told to self-isolate. He blamed Public Health England (PHE) and the wider tracking strategy, saying an insistence that only temperature and cough were the major symptoms was missing thousands of cases. Spector said 1.5 million people were logging onto the King\u2019s app and tracking a wide range of symptoms and changes. He went on: It tells us that we\u2019ve got at least 100,000 cases at the moment of people who are infected. And this is from our data, although the NHS would underestimate that because they\u2019re not counting all the symptoms ... At the moment, people are being told to go back to work if they\u2019re a care worker, and they\u2019ve got something like loss of smell or taste or severe muscle pains or fatigue - things that we know and we\u2019ve shown are related to being swabbed positive. This country is missing the ball in underestimated cases but also putting people at risk, and continuing the epidemic. So we really do need to tell Public Health England to get in line with the rest of the world, and make people more aware. There\u2019s no point telling people to be alert if they don\u2019t know the symptoms. Northern Ireland is taking its first steps in the process of easing the lockdown today. Garden centres and recycling facilities are opening. Angling is also allowed again. Marriage ceremonies involving someone with a terminal illness are also permitted. The Northern Ireland executive is also expected to announce further relaxation measures this afternoon, with the region set to formally move to phase one of its five-step exit plan (pdf). As PA Media reports, Ken Mills was first in line for Palmerston Recycling Centre in Belfast ahead of its reopening at 9am this morning. \u201cI\u2019ve had a two-hour wait, but I don\u2019t mind because I am getting rid of a lot of stuff that has been cluttering the garage,\u201d he said. This morning the Daily Telegraph has splashed on a story (paywall) saying that a study from Australia suggests that the risk of coronavirus spreading in schools is extremely low. Here\u2019s an extract. Coronavirus does not spread widely in schools, according to a major study which is being considered by government advisers ... The study examined by the government advisers was conducted by Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance. It was cited by the country\u2019s officials when they announced that children should return to the classroom and found schools had a \u201cvery limited\u201d role in transmission of the virus. The scientists found that across 15 schools in New South Wales, 10 secondary and five primary, 18 people \u2013 nine teachers and nine students \u2013 had confirmed coronavirus. Of the 735 students and 128 staff who were in close contact with the virus carriers, only one secondary school pupil caught it from another student and one primary school pupil caught it from a teacher. You can see this in the graphic below. The Telegraph has splashed the story, obviously, because it is relevant to the dispute between the government and teaching unions about whether it would be safe for pupils in England to start returning to school from next month. (See 9.38am.) But on the Today programme this morning Prof Kristine Macartney, director of Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation, Research and Surveillance, argued that this study should not be seen as the final word on the matter. It was just a preliminary report and more research was needed, she said. She stressed that the situation in Australia was very different from the situation in the UK. It is very important to note that Australia\u2019s epidemic has been different to many other parts of the world. We closed our borders down very quickly, and that was particularly effective for us. In total in Australia we\u2019ve only had a little over 6,000 cases and our curve has really gone down to just a handful of cases per day now. It has been in that context that we\u2019ve been able to keep schools open by and large. Asked if her study should be used to persuade teachers in the UK that it was safe to go back to work, she replied: I think it\u2019s important to take our study in the context in which it was done. I think it\u2019s really a complex decision, once you are talking about returning to the workplace, returning to school, opening up transportation. All of these things need to be really carefully considered ... And so no one single piece of information, certainly from another country, can provide the answer to the UK or anywhere else. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT union, which represents head teachers, told the Today programme this morning that teachers wanted more clarification on whether schools were centres of transmission. He said: Specifically around the transmission from children to adults, we\u2019ve been told over the weekend - it\u2019s been asserted by the government publicly over the weekend - that there isn\u2019t the level of risk that we fear. However, we haven\u2019t yet seen the scientific underpin of that. There\u2019s been some commentary and I want to invite the government today to write to me so that I can talk to the 31,000 school leaders that we represent, particularly in the primary sector, and say this is why the government has made that assessment. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was doing the morning interview round on behalf of the government this morning. Here is a summary of what he\u2019s been saying. Dowden said he did not expect Premier League football to resume until \u201cprobably mid-June at the earliest\u201d. He said the Premier League would need to find a way for it to go ahead safely behind closed doors before the government gave approval. He said he was looking at increasing the number of free-to-air matches as this could be helpful in terms of discouraging people from leaving their homes to watch football games. He explained: There is a rule at the moment that at 3pm you can\u2019t show matches on TV because people were watching it in the football stadiums. Clearly that is not going to be the case at the moment, so some of those slots may be available for free-to-air, so we are looking to see whether we could do that as part of the wider broadcasting package. He defended the proposals in the immigration bill, which is getting its second reading this afternoon. \u201cThis means that finally we determine exactly who comes into this country and we can attract the brightest and the best from around the world - not just from confining it to within Europe,\u201d he said. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here is the agenda showing what\u2019s coming up. 9.30am: The Commons education committee takes evidence from the National Union of Students, the University Alliance, the University and College Union and the Office for Students about coronavirus. 12pm: Downing Street is due to hold its daily lobby briefing. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily government briefings. 2.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 3pm: Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, makes a statement in the Commons about coronavirus. Around 4.30pm: MPs begin debating the second reading of the immigration bill. 5pm: Hancock is expected to take the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. Here\u2019s some reaction to the government\u2019s announcement yesterday that if the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University proves successful in human trials then up to 30 million doses for the UK could be available by September. Prof Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said he thought a vaccine was not likely to be widely available until next year. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think we have a very high chance of seeing a number of vaccines that work because we know a lot about this target and I think there\u2019s good scientific rationale to say it\u2019s not such a hard target as others. My gut feeling is that we will start to see a number of candidates coming through with good evidence early towards next year - possibly something this year - but they won\u2019t be readily available for wide scale use into the beginning of next year as the kind of most optimistic estimation. This may come as a disappointment to readers of this morning\u2019s Daily Mail splash, which is suggesting a vaccine could be available for widespread use more quickly. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says Labour cannot support the government\u2019s immigration bill, labelling it a \u201cthreat\u201d to the health and social care sector. The legislation, which will undergo its second reading in the House of Commons today, brings to fruition the promise of an \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d first outlined by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove when they were fronting the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum. But Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think that it is totally unfair on the one hand to be saying thank you to those foreign-born workers we have in our NHS and then charging them for actually using it. The home secretary has actually waived it for those health care staff who have had their visas extended from October. She then promised to review it for other staff in the NHS. She apparently now isn\u2019t reviewing it. I think that\u2019s the wrong thing to do, and I think it really does speak to whether we value what people have been doing to help us through this crisis or not. He said the government\u2019s proposals were \u201cnot fair\u201d and \u201cnot in the national interest\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s because they are deeming people who are low skilled to be unwelcome in this country.\u201d As passenger numbers coming into the capital are expected to rise today with extra trains put on, two travellers were this morning on their way out of London at King\u2019s Cross. PC Jason Kelly, who was on his way to north Hertfordshire after a night shift, told PA Media: Up until a week ago, in the early morning there were only two people on the train. When they changed the lockdown last week that went up to about 30 or 40 people. He wasn\u2019t confident passengers would be able to stick to social distancing measures once numbers rise further, adding: For some people it\u2019s just like a normal day, people have got fed up with it (coronavirus), they\u2019ve had enough. Meanwhile, another police officer on his way home to Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire from King\u2019s Cross said through a lot of the lockdown he had been the only passenger on his train. \u201cIt\u2019s been marvellous, but now everything is going back to normal,\u201d he said. He said he did not feel unsafe while travelling but did not think other commuters would try to keep 2 metres apart. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even [stick to physical distancing] in the shops,\u201d he told PA Media. \u201cThat said, everyone has been very good on the Tube - everyone wears a mask and tries to sit far apart.\u201d Good morning, folks. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here kicking off the UK live blog today. Extra trains are expected to take thousands more people back to work under Downing Street\u2019s plan to accelerate economic activity as lockdown restrictions designed to halt the spread of Covid-19 are eased. But King\u2019s Cross station, one of the capital\u2019s busiest transport hubs, was almost deserted this morning \u2013 despite more trains running as part of the effort. Regular announcements urged people to stick to physical distancing measures, while the concourse was dotted with stickers reading: \u201cProtect your NHS, stay 2m apart\u201d, while regular announcements urged people to stick to social distancing measures. It comes as a new survey suggests that more than a third of people say they could rethink the way they travel after the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said he is hoping Premier League football behind closed doors will be able to start by mid-June. \u201cI had some very constructive discussions on Thursday with the FA, the EFL and the Premier League. We\u2019re working hard with them to try and get it [football] back, I\u2019m aiming for, for mid-June but the number one test is public safety,\u201d he told Sky News this morning. It comes after Germany\u2019s Bundesliga restarted last weekend. The Guardian reported last week that a planned resumption of play on 12 June was looking less likely \u2013 and kick-off a week later is now a possibility after safety concerns were raised. Yesterday, the government announced that if the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University proves successful in human trials then up to 30 million doses for the UK could be available by September. In other news, MPs on parliament\u2019s education select committee will discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on schools and children\u2019s services at 9.30am today.",
