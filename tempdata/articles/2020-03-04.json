      "bodyText": "As Washington state faces a rapidly evolving coronavirus outbreak, which has already claimed nine lives there, residents on Tuesday reported a frustrating array of misinformation and obstacles as they were seeking to get tested. One potential sufferer in the state, Jeannette Jameson, 61, a criminal defense lawyer, told the Guardian that she had been sick for about a month when her doctor suggested she go to an emergency room to be tested for the virus. On Monday, Jameson went to Providence hospital in Everett, Washington, and after waiting for over two hours near dozens of other sick people, she was escorted to a chair in the hallway, separated from other patients with respiratory symptoms by carpeted wall partitions. Jameson said she never saw a doctor, and after testing negative for flu and being given a chest X-ray, she was discharged with papers that said she had \u201csome non-specific respiratory virus\u201d, along with prescriptions for ibuprofen and acetaminophen. When she asked why she wasn\u2019t given a test for coronavirus, she said that a nurse practitioner told her she could only get tested if she was admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms. \u201cThe words that they were using were so misleading, basically, as though: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have it, you know, you\u2019re fine,\u2019 and saying even if you had it it\u2019s mild for most people,\u201d said Jameson, who lives in Bothell, Washington. She added: \u201cBut not caring that I might go and infect someone who then it wouldn\u2019t be mild for.\u201d After the flu test results came back and Jameson asked about the coronavirus test, she said the registered nurse practitioner told her: \u201cYou should be glad you don\u2019t have influenza because that\u2019s worse than coronavirus.\u201d The death rate for coronavirus is much higher than for the flu. A frustrated Jameson later said she told the nurse: \u201cThis is like a third-world country.\u201d The nurse responded: \u201cNow you\u2019re just being dramatic.\u201d So Jameson still does not know if she has coronavirus. In a statement to the Guardian, Providence hospital said: \u201cIn Snohomish county, with the limited availability of test kits at this time, one of the criteria for testing has been that the patient is ill enough to warrant hospital inpatient care. Due to an influx of patients in the emergency department, wait times are longer than normal for people who do not have severe symptoms.\u201d Washington state, in the Pacific north-west, had 27 confirmed cases of coronavirus by Tuesday afternoon. Confirmed cases across the US have exceeded 117. Most coronavirus infections cause mild symptoms, but for some at a higher risk, including older people and those with chronic illness, it can cause more severe symptoms. Officials think the virus spreads mainly through coughs or sneezes. The confusion associated with the testing is probably because tests have expanded recently, explained Janet Baseman, the associate dean for the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health. Initially, testing was limited to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lab and reserved for those who had symptoms and had a travel history to China or contact with a known case, she explained. In the last several days, however, Washington state has been able to test patients using a local laboratory, while local healthcare providers have been given more say over who should get tested. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard time and a frustrating time for people or providers who want to have their patients tested,\u201d said Baseman. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to get a lot easier.\u201d The state\u2019s public health laboratory can now test approximately 200 specimens a day and is able to keep up with all requests, Dr Kathy Lofy, the state health officer at the Washington state department of health, said during a press conference Monday.

He said:</p> <p>\u2022 450 people have been tested in Wales. Most of the testing has taken place in the community. Only one person confirmed to have coronavirus. That person is being treated in London. Active surveillance is taking place, which includes testing people with respiratory illnesses in intensive care units.</p> <p>\u2022 On timing, Atherton said the expectation was for an upsurge of cases in April, a peak in May or June, a tapering off in July/August. Not known if coronavirus will vanish or reappear as a seasonal virus.</p> <p>\u2022 Up to 80% of the population could be affected. Of those, 80% will be mild cases. Typically for each person infected, doctors need to speak to 10-20 people they may have been in contact with \u2013 in general those that come within 1-3 metres of an infected person.</p> <p>\u2022 The NHS 111 line can now be used throughout Wales for concerns about coronavirus (the line does not generally cover all areas in Wales).</p> <p>\u2022 Currently in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase. Next will be the \u201cdelay\u201d phase to try to slow the spread of coronavirus while the NHS is under pressure. Atherton described this as a \u201cwindow of opportunity for calm preparation\u201d. May need to halt some non-urgent operations, outpatient services.</p> <p>\u2022 School closures, bans on mass gatherings may follow.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Atherton\u2019s \u201cbest guess\u201d is that no vaccine will be developed this year. Next year, maybe.</p> <p>\u2022 There might be areas resource implications in some communities where there are disproportionate numbers of elderly or chronically ill people.

Johnson appeared alongside <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. To a large extent the PM allowed the two officials to answer the more technical questions, and, perhaps not surprisingly, they appeared to have a better grasp of the detail.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the briefing.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson sought to reassure the public that the government is prepared for a widespread coronvirus outbreak that could have far-reaching consequences for Britain.</strong> He said the government was publishing its coronavirus action plan and that it had four strands:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that more people would contract the illness, and he stressed that the government was now preparing \u201cfor all eventualities\u201d. But he said little directly about what emergency measures might be introduced, and he avoiding discussing the possible fatality rate - even though his two advisers made it clear that potentially the number of people at risk is very high. Johnson said that most people would not be affected. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> </blockquote> <p>He insisted that the country was going to get through the coronavirus, \u201cand get through it in good shape\u201d. And he stressed the importance of people washing their hands.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance said that under a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d 1% of people getting coronavirus might die.</strong> Near the start of the press conference Whitty said that coronavirus had a 1% death rate based on the Chinese experience. And he said that there was a \u201csignificant ramp up\u201d in the death rate for those over 80. Whitty commended this graphic from<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-does-the-coronavirus-death-rate-compare-with-flu-and-how-long-will-the-outbreak-last-tlpnwxg89\"> today\u2019s Times (paywall) </a>showing coronavirus death rates.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a60acf67d94161df009ced28d9734cd441b7941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a60acf67d94161df009ced28d9734cd441b7941/0_0_736_456/500.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus mortality rates.\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus mortality rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Times</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Whitty also said that the 1% Chinese mortality rate figure might be overstating the true rate because of the number of people getting the virus but not displaying symptoms. And he implied that the survival rate might be higher in the UK because of its health system being better than China\u2019s. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The exact percentages will depend on a lot of factors - including the health care system you have in place, so I would not expect... the numbers we are seeing in China automatically to read over to the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>The two advisers did not predict what proportion of the population might contract coronavirus on the event of containment failing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that, although the government was planning to legislate to give it powers in relation to schools, borders and quarantine, these powers would be \u201cexceptional and short-term\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance said that, in the event of coronavirus spreading, ministers would be asked to choose from an option of far-reaching proposals that could be taken to limit the spread of the disease.</strong> They did not go into great detail about what measures might be included, although they conceded that some of them could be highly disruptive. They said modelling would be used to decide what was best. But they also said it would be a mistake to introduce these restrictions too soon, because they said that could led to people ignoring the rules at the point where they were needed most.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vallance said a decision to give up trying to contain the virus, and to move to the focus on mitigation, could be taken by a group of countries at the same time.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of widespread school closures being ordered</strong>. Whitty said that the evidence from China suggested children were less likely to be affected by coronavirus than adults. Vallance said there might be a case for closing schools to stop the disease spreading, and to \u201cpull down the peak\u201d. But he said closing schools would impact on the NHS, because staff with school-age children would have to stay at home.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said the government was trying to delay infection reaching its peak until the late spring and the summer, when the NHS would be in a better position to cope. </strong>He said that, to achieve this, the government might need to do three things: 1) introduce \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures (he did not elaborate); 2) isolate older people; and 3) reconfigure public services.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty signalled that the UK could be affected by coronavirus for another six months.</strong> He said he expected it to take two to three months to reach its peak from its outbreak, and for the virus to then take another two to three months to decline.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of people having to cancel holidays.</strong> They said that, at the moment, they were not advising people to cancel their plans, other than in specific countries covered by health advice. And they said that, once the virus had spread widely, they would be no point in avoiding foreign countries anyway. But Whitty said people might want to consider the risk of travelling to countries with a weaker health service than the UK\u2019s with coronavirus at its peak.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty came close to ruling out any attempt being tried to isolate cities, following the Chinese model</strong>. He said this would only make sense in a situation where the virus was starting in one place, with a high transmission rate, and where it was not present elsewhere. (That is not the situation in the UK.) At the weekend Matt Hancock, the health secretary, refused to rule out cities being isolated to prevent the spead of the disease.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said the government was considering \u201call reasonable options\u201d that could help self-employed workers who need to give up work because they are self-isolating.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said specific measures were likely to be proposed for care homes.</strong> He did not give details of what these might be.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he thought the NHS was \u201cwell capable of handling the most tremendous pressures\u201d, such as the ones it was likely to face, although he refused to go into detail of extent to which normal health services might be disrupted</strong>. But he did say, if the virus spread widely, people might have to be \u201cself-restraining\u201d and avoid services like the GP and 111 where possible.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that, when deciding how to balance the need to protect the public against the need to reduce disruption, he would be guided by scientific advice.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson did not rule out the army being used to help out the police or other public services at the peak of the outbreak.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he had not given up shaking people\u2019s hands.</strong> On a visit to a hospital last week where he thinks coronavirus patients were being treated, he shook hands with everybody, he said. \u201cOur judgment is washing your hands is the crucial thing,\u201d he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vallance said that there was no need for people to panic buy. </strong>Asked if the government was worried about this, he said the government expected people to take logical decisions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said the crisis was likely to lead to \u201cextraordinary outbreaks of altruism\u201d rather than widespread outbreaks of antisocial behaviour.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc/0_379_6517_3910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left to right: Chris Whitty, chief medical officer; Boris Johnson, prime minister; and Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left to right: Chris Whitty, chief medical officer; Boris Johnson, prime minister; and Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T13:08:03.859Z\">at 1.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5e4ac68f0811db2fb02b8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T12:25:48.644Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has been a spate of worrying developments in <strong>Iran</strong>, where the virus has killed at least 77 people and infected 2,336.</p> <p>The Islamic Republic\u2019s supreme leader has ordered the armed forces to assist health officials in combating the outbreak.

He says that he continues to shake hands and did so when he was at a hospital \u201cthe other night\u201d where there were coronavirus patients.</p> <p>Kate Proctor asks whether it was no longer a \u201clikely\u201d course of action that cities could be locked down. She also asks for stats on the rates of death among the elderly.</p> <p>Whitty says that in general \u2013 and while he doesn\u2019t want to take anything off the table \u2013 the locking down of cities happens and is more effective when the infection is coming from one particular place.</p> <p>He says that what is clear is that there is a significant ramping up of people dying from the infection when they are over 80.

It has been described by public health officials as taking the same measures you would if you had a heavy cold \u2013 although perhaps a better comparison would be the flu.</p> <p>The key thing is not to go near other people to avoid spreading the virus, which is transmitted via droplets from coughs and sneezes. It is thought you need to be relatively close to inhale those droplets \u2013 maybe within a metre or so. But the droplets can also land on surfaces and transfer to people\u2019s hands \u2013 hence the advice to wash them frequently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-what-is-self-isolation-quarantine\">Coronavirus quarantine and self-isolation: your questions answered</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T10:13:07.970Z\">at 10.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5e26138f08e1332474e386\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T09:40:55.050Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The French carmaker PSA has managed for ensure that its European facilities have enough supplies to keep running for now during the coronavirus outbreak, according to its chief executive officer, Carlos Tavares.</p> <p>Speaking at a conference call with journalists, Tavares also said that the carmaker could resume activity in the Chinese province of Hubei on 11 March, according to the latest information from Chinese authorities.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T10:13:25.122Z\">at 10.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5e22ab8f086a28115b698c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T09:28:46.117Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> India, the world\u2019s main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs made from them, including paracetamol, as concern mounted the coronavirus outbreak could turn into a pandemic.</p> <p>Indian pharma companies get almost 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for their medicines from China, Reuters reports.</p> <p>Already, the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted businesses dependent on Chinese supplies and industry professionals say Indian generic drugmakers are likely to face supply shortages from China if the epidemic drags on.</p> <p>\u201cExport of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby \u2018restricted\u2019 with immediate effect and till further orders,\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5e1f218f086a28115b6948\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T09:23:13.345Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Police are investigating an attack in central London on a Singaporean student who says he had to go to hospital after being targeted by a group of people who shouted about the coronavirus being beating him up.</p> <p>Jonathan Mok, who shared pictures of his battered face and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jaidanmok/posts/10158209158373713\">wrote about his ordeal in a Facebook post</a>, which has been shared thousands of times, that one of them tried to kick him in the head before saying: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want your coronavirus in my country.\u201d</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police have given a statement to the Guardian saying they are investigating a racially aggravated assault in Oxford Street in central London on a near Tottenham Court Road station at around 9.3opm last Monday.</p> <p>The force, which said that the 23-year-old victim was punched and sustained facial injuries, are now looking at CCTV to try to identify the suspects.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21297e676a67a1ccd9338eeafc04008dbf267cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21297e676a67a1ccd9338eeafc04008dbf267cbc/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Mok, a Singaporean student who was attacked in London in what police are treating as a racially aggravated assault.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog, which we\u2019re closing now. Don\u2019t worry though, we\u2019ve started a new one helmed by my colleague Helen Sullivan so you can keep up with all the developments. You can find it here: The drop in the Australian share market despite the US Fed rate cut raises questions over the ability of central banks to halt the fall in share prices, according to Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney. The moves in Australia follow late falls on Wall Street as the main indices failed to rally on the emergency Fed stimulus. The market reaction to the Fed\u2019s decisive action is worrying for investors. Major US indices dropped 2.5% to 3%. There is now a question over the ability of monetary policy to halt plummeting asset prices. The dangers of negative wealth effects from stock market falls adds to concern about the global outlook. The seeming ineffectiveness of further monetary easing will almost certainly lead to further calls on governments to push the fiscal stimulus button. Bonds rallied again, pushing yields to fresh all-time lows. Gold found a firmer footing to rally by 3% as the US dollar slipped. In an illustration of the unusual conditions cryptocurrencies were among the least volatile markets. But he adds that futures trading points to a rise in Tokyo when it opens in half an hour. Australia\u2019s sharemarket has dropped 1.4% after the opening bell; reversing a rally on Tuesday that followed more than a week of losses. The benchmark ASX200 index is now down more than 10% over the past week and a half. The Aussie market\u2019s fall follows a plunge overnight on US markets, which responded to an emergency rate cut by the Federal Bank by shedding about 3%. Banks, miners and consumer stocks have all been hit in an across-the-board selloff that reverses gains made by the market on Tuesday. In early trade, Australia\u2019s biggest bank the Commonwealth Bank fell more than 1.5% and rival ANZ was down almost 2%. Mining giant BHP was down 1.2%, soft drink company Coca-Cola Amatil fell 1.1% and share registry provider Computershare tumbled 4.6%. The ASX200 was up as much as 1.8% on Tuesday morning, but began to fall away in afternoon trade after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut official interest rates to a new record low of 0.5%. Chile has now reportedly confirmed its first case of coronavirus; a patient who the health ministry says is being treated at a hospital in the city of Talca, 250km south of the capital Santiago. Google I/O \u2013 the tech firm\u2019s annual developer event \u2013 has been cancelled over coronavirus fears, its parent company Alphabet Inc has said. Over the coming weeks, we will explore other ways to evolve Google I/O to best connect with and continue to build our developer community. The Italian government is about to release a series of recommendations to try to halt the coronavirus outbreak. The tips are contained in a document issued by the the country\u2019s scientific committee that will be released within the next few hours. They include: Social distancing: remaining away from crowded environments and maintaining a distance of two meters from other people; especially within enclosed spaces. Greetings: avoiding kisses and hugs when greeting people. Elderly population: people older than 75 years with underlying health conditions are advised to remain at home and avoid social events. Moreover, the Juventus and Milan\u2019s upcoming Italian Cup semi-final second leg match has been postponed. The match was meant to be held on Wednesday night and would have followed the 1-1 first-leg draw in Milan\u2019s San Siro. The committee has called for all sporting events to be held behind closed doors. The death toll from Covid-19 in Italy has risen to 79 and confirmed cases to 2.263, the emergency commissioner and civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli has said. According to the Reuters news agency, Dr Tony Holohan, Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, has told reporters: Today we are confirming that Ireland has diagnosed one new case of COVID-19. The case arises in a female in the east of the country and is associated with travel from northern Italy. Ireland has confirmed its second case, with the nation\u2019s department of health saying it\u2019s associated with travel from Italy. An emergency funding bill to fight coronavirus could be completed and ready for the signature of the US president Donald Trump by Friday evening, according to Senator Patrick Leahy; the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee. After a meeting with the vice president Mike Pence and health officials, Chuck Schumer \u2013 the Democratic leader in the Senate \u2013 said officials could not say how soon or where people can be tested for coronavirus. Washington state\u2019s department of health reports that the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases now stands at 27, including the deaths of nine people. That is up from 18 cases and six deaths on Monday. Algeria has confirmed three new cases, bringing the total number of people who have tested positive for the virus to eight, the nation\u2019s health ministry has said, adding that those cases include seven Algerians from the same family and an Italian man. The man died nearly three weeks ago and tests now show he was killed by the virus, the regional health chief Ana Barcelo has told a press conference. The first coronavirus death in Spain has been confirmed, the Reuters news agency reports, citing a Valencian health official. That\u2019s all from me. I will now be handing over to my colleague who will keep you informed on the latest news. Thanks A seventh person with coronavirus has died in the Seattle area of the US, but the infection wasn\u2019t identified until after their death. The New York Times has reported that the individual was brought to Seattle\u2019s Harborview Medical Center on 24 February and died two days later, before a crisis in the state began unfolding over the weekend. Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said on Tuesday that samples had tested positive for the virus. \u201cIn coordination with Public Health, we have determined that some staff may have been exposed while working in an intensive care unit where the patient had been treated,\u201d Gregg said. In the last few hours there have been some new developments, which are summed up below. A British woman in the coronavirus-hit Tenerife hotel has tested positive for Covid-19, officials have confirmed. The woman arrived at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace on 23 February, and was not part of the initial group of 10 Italians where the first case was identified. Unite is warning that factories could shut down or cut working hours because of shortages of parts from China if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, called for an urgent meeting with Alok Sharma, the business secretary, over the threat to livelihoods if work dries up in the manufacturing sector. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday in an attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Analysts and investors are questioning whether the move will be enough in the long term if the virus continues to spread. The death toll from coronavirus in Italy has risen by 27 over the past 24 hours to 79, the Civil Protection Agency said. The total number of cases in the country reached 2,502, up from 2,036 on Monday. The agency said that of those infected, 160 people had fully recovered. Lebanon\u2019s health minister said hospitals were ready to deal with any further spread of the novel coronavirus in the country, where 13 cases have been recorded with no deaths. Hamad Hassan said the cases had all either returned from an affected country or were transmitted through \u201cclose contact\u201d with a family member or neighbour - not \u201clocal transmission\u201d. All 13 people suffering from the Covid-19 illness are being treated at Beirut\u2019s Rafic Hariri state hospital, where 140 beds have been designated to isolate and monitor suspected cases, he added. The Vatican said on Tuesday that Pope Francis was still suffering from a cold and not exhibiting other symptoms, after a report said he had tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Italy\u2019s Messaggero newspaper reported that the 83-year-old pontiff, who has been cancelling events since last Wednesday, had been tested for the virus as a precaution. Without directly confirming the report, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that the cold was \u201crunning its course without symptoms attributable to other pathologies\u201d. Here is a brief summary of the latest news and updates. US central bank jumps in The Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday in an attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Analysts and investors are questioning whether the move will be enough in the long term if the virus continues to spread. The spread The number of cases globally now exceeds 90,911 across 77 countries and territories, with at least 3,123 deaths reported. Just 125 new cases were reported in China on Tuesday. There were more than 600 in South Korea, 542 in Iran and 523 in Italy. In Iran, where the death toll has risen to 77, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged people to wash their hands and described the outbreaks as \u201cnot something extraordinary\u201d. Containment still top priority The WHO\u2019s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the risk of the epidemic spreading was now very high at a global level, but there was evidence that surveillance was working in South Korea and containment was possible. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory. We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures,\u201d he said. \u201cContainment of Covid-19 is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries.\u201d Retired nurses could provide support in the case of a major coronavirus outbreak if the right safety measures are in place, nurses have said. However, they said the health and care system was \u201cchallenged by the current high level of nursing vacancies\u201d. Susan Masters, the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s director of nursing policy and practice, said: This is a challenging time for staff in health and care services \u2013 we welcome the fact that the government\u2019s new plan is UK-wide, and builds on previous experience of the 2009 swine flu pandemic. As the plan acknowledges, some nursing staff will inevitably be affected by the virus. With the right safety measures and regulation, retired nurses could provide important support for staff currently working in the NHS and social care services. But senior nurses already spend a great deal of time supervising and mentoring more junior colleagues and nursing students, so the issue will be whether they have the capacity to extend this to returning retired staff. Any legislation being considered will need to be carefully scrutinised to ensure that safety for patients and healthcare staff is the priority. There are already well-rehearsed plans in the UK in place to deal with infectious diseases like coronavirus, but the health and care system is challenged by the current high level of nursing vacancies. The public can support nurses by checking on any vulnerable neighbours or relatives, particularly those living on their own, to ensure they have enough to eat and drink and don\u2019t run out of medication. Hello, I will be handing the live blog over to a colleague in the next half an hour. Please do send over any information or news tips to me before I go. I am grateful for all the links you\u2019ve been sharing. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Private company ISS has promised full pay for all health workers self-isolating due to coronavirus, and a health union is calling for the government to offer similar reassurances. ISS has been handed taxpayer funded contracts to the tune of \u00a3307m since 2015 for services including cleaning and catering in schools and hospitals. GMB, the union for NHS staff, said it had pressured NHS outsourcing companies \u2013 and the government \u2013 to ensure all workers are given full pay from day one if forced to self-isolate. Lola McEvoy, a GMB organiser, said: Full pay from day one for NHS contract workers is an urgent priority for public safety given the escalating coronavirus crisis. This announcement that ISS will give full pay to everyone required to self-isolate is the direct result of GMB members\u2019 bravery in campaigning at Homerton hospital and across the UK. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an effort to shield the world\u2019s largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, suggested the threat to the economy would not soon abate. \u201cThe virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity, both here and abroad, for some time,\u201d Powell said in a news conference shortly after the central bank said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. The move did little to deliver immediate comfort to financial markets roiled by fears of the virus\u2019s impact on economic growth. Losses on Wall Street deepened. Powell said the central bank\u2019s action would provide \u201ca meaningful boost to the economy\u201d by loosening financial conditions and shoring up business and household confidence. Vinitaly, the world\u2019s largest fair for winemakers and sellers, will postpone its trade show due to the coronavirus outbreak in Italy. The trade show was supposed to be held in Verona in April. Last year Vinitaly hosted 4,600 exhibitors and almost 125,000 visitors from 145 countries A French TV channel apologised on Tuesday for airing a mock advert for \u201ccorona pizza\u201d that featured a chef coughing up green phlegm on to Italy\u2019s national dish. Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, criticised the joke, which appeared on the satirical Groland programme on Canal+. It showed a chef coughing green mucus on to a red tomato base and white mozzarella. The colours together made up the Italian flag. \u201cHere\u2019s the new Italian pizza, which is going to spread around the world,\u201d the fake advert said. Globally, more than 3,100 people have died of the coronavirus and over 90,000 have been infected. Italy is the worst-hit country in Europe, with 79 deaths and more than 2,500 people infected. The Swiss army said all soldiers would be confined to base after a case of the new coronavirus was discovered in their ranks. A man tested positive for Covid-19 Monday as he was preparing to carry out a required military refresher course, the Swiss armed forces said in a statement. The death toll from Covid-19 in Italy has risen to 79 and confirmed cases to 2.263, the emergency commissioner and civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said on Tuesday. A newborn boy from the northern region of Lombardy has tested positive for the coronavirus and is currently hospitalised in Bergamo. According to the Higher Health Institute (ISS), he is not in a serious condition. \u201cHe came out positive to the swab, he is not intubated, he was already in a phase of post-natal assistance,\u201d an official told Ansa. The number of people who recovered from the virus rose to 160 people, 11 more than Monday. The majority of cases \u2013 1,520 \u2013 are in the northern Lombardy region, where 10 towns have been under lockdown for more than a week. The virus has spread to more than half of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, including Tuscany, Puglia, Sicily and recently Sardinia. Authorities say the majority of people who tested positive in other regions were travelling from Lombardy or had been in the north for a few weeks before the outbreak. Of those infected, 1,034 are in hospital \u2013 229 in intensive care \u2013 and 1,229 are recovering at home. Amazon is struggling to control sellers who are ramping up the price of products due to fear around the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday hand sanitiser and respiratory masks were in some cases being sold at a more than 2,000% mark-up. Amazon said it had removed \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of listings and was monitoring postings. The Financial Times reported that a pack of 20 masks made by 3M was being sold by an unauthorised reseller at $387 (\u00a3301.95), compared with a normal retail price of around $14.99 (\u00a311.70). \u201cThere is no place for price-gouging on Amazon,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our longstanding policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers.\u201d It added: \u201cWe continue to actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies.\u201d The first coronavirus case has been confirmed in Argentina, it has been reported. The minister of health, Gin\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda, is expected to give more details of the case at a press conference later. The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that understanding of how the new coronavirus spreads was rapidly increasing, but warned that the protective gear needed to fight the disease was \u201crapidly depleting\u201d. The UN health agency voiced concern that the masks and other protective equipment used by health workers was running out amid panic buying and manipulation of markets. \u201cWe are concerned that countries\u2019 abilities to respond are being compromised by the severe and increasing disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment ... caused by rising demand, hoarding and misuse,\u201d the head of the World Health Organization , Tedros Adhanom, said. Hello everyone. I am updating you on all the latest information on the coronavirus outbreak. Please get in touch if you want to share any news tips with me. I appreciate all the information you\u2019ve sent so far, it\u2019s really useful! Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Italy is considering setting up a new quarantine red zone near the northern city of Bergamo given the high number of coronavirus cases in the area, the head of the national health institute said on Tuesday. The Italian government set up two red zones on 22 February \u2013 one centred on 10 towns in the region of Lombardy, south-east of Milan, and another, smaller one in the neighbouring region of Veneto. Since then, a growing number of cases have emerged near Bergamo, north-east of Milan. \u201cWe are considering the possibility of adopting a measure like this one,\u201d health chief Silvio Brusaferro said after being asked if a new red zone might be created. Unite is warning that factories could shut down or cut working hours because of shortages of parts from China if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, called for an urgent meeting with Alok Sharma, the business secretary, over the threat to livelihoods if work dries up in the manufacturing sector. \u201cWe are of the view that if the situation in China was not to improve over the coming three to four weeks, UK automotive plants will be entering periods of short time working and or enforced production shutdown,\u201d he said. He called for the adoption of a UK scheme similar to Germany\u2019s short time working support scheme (Kurzarbeit). Turner said: \u201cThe scheme, in place since 1910, has been adopted by many European countries, and has served to protect manufacturing industries from the pressures of short time working by providing for wage protection during agreed periods of down time.\u201d Unite \u2013 like the TUC, Unison and GMB \u2013 is also calling for full sick pay for all workers from day one if they have to take time off with suspected coronavirus. Currently, up to 2 million gig economy workers do not necessarily receive sick pay and may be forced to make a choice between losing pay and carrying on in work with symptoms. Car plants could be forced to halt production in a matter of weeks because of the threat of a shortage of essential components from virus-hit China, a trade union has warned. Unite said it wants an urgent meeting with the business secretary, Alok Sharma, to discuss the prospect of short-time working in the event of production shutdowns. In a letter to Sharma, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: We are of the view that if the situation in China does not improve over the coming three to four weeks, UK automotive plants will be entering periods of short-time working and/or enforced production shutdown. Routine hospital appointments and surgeries may be postponed if Covid-19 infects large numbers of people, health officials in Northern Ireland said. An NHS statement said: The health and social care system is also planning for the possibility of reduced staffing in hospitals and the community as a result of coronavirus in order to mitigate against these risks. Depending on the pressures in the system in the months ahead, trusts (which provide health services) may have to consider postponing routine elective appointments and surgeries to focus on the immediate demands associated with coronavirus. The aim is to \u201cflatten\u201d the main community transmission peak and delay it until summer when services are less stretched. Medical staff are in a phase of containment, Northern Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said. Major publishers Penguin Random House, Hachette Livre, Pan Macmillan and Curtis Brown parent company Original Talent have pulled out of London Book Fair, one of the largest publishing events in the world, despite the event remaining on schedule to go ahead next week, the Bookseller reports. Pan Macmillan announced it was pulling out following concerns about the coronavirus. Its managing director, Antony Forbes Watson, said: \u201cThe duty of care that we have to everyone who works for us and the news that so many of our customers and partners will no longer be attending the book fair have combined to lead us to this conclusion.\u201d The developments come after Simon &amp; Schuster\u2019s US team and the Macmillan Trade US team also pulled out of the fair last week over \u201chealth and safety fears\u201d. The death toll from coronavirus in Italy has risen by 27 over the past 24 hours to 79, the Civil Protection Agency said. The total number of cases in the country reached 2,502, up from 2,036 on Monday. The agency said that of those infected, 160 people had fully recovered. The contagion came to light 12 days ago and is focused mainly on a handful of hotspots in the north of Italy. However, cases have now been confirmed in all but one of the country\u2019s 20 regions. About 3.4% of confirmed cases of Covid-19 have died, far above seasonal flu\u2019s fatality rate of under 1%, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. But Tedros Adhanom said the novel coronavirus could be contained. Speaking at a Geneva news conference, he said: \u201cTo summarise, Covid-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained.\u201d Tedros said that he had spoken with Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, about the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to open in July. \u201cI think deciding now would be too early, it would be good to monitor the situation,\u201d he said. A British guest is the latest person to be diagnosed with coronavirus at a Tenerife hotel. The H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel has been under lockdown due to an outbreak of the virus. The Briton, who tested positive for the virus on Monday evening, had not been isolated in their room as they had not presented any symptoms, the authorities said. \u201cThe epidemiology team is studying the contacts this person had,\u201d a spokeswoman for the local health services said. Guests without symptoms have been allowed to circulate around the hotel, making use of facilities like pools and shared dining areas, as long as they wear a mask, wash their hands frequently and submit to regular temperature checks. Other cases diagnosed over the past week at the hotel had been among a group of 10 Italian holidaymakers. In total, around 150 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in Spain. Authorities are monitoring two clusters in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, a suburban city close to Madrid with a population of around 130,000, and one in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Around 100 health workers in the Basque country have been isolated in their homes after coming into contact with people infected with the virus, local health authorities said. A total of 32 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Norway, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said at a press briefing. Those attending heard about seven additional infections to the most recent update published on its website. Pharmacy chains are limiting the sale of hand sanitiser amid concerns products could be sold for inflated prices online. A spokeswoman for Boots, the UK\u2019s largest chemist chain, said it had seen an increase in the sale of hand sanitisers, but it still had stock available in its warehouses for online sale and in stores. She also confirmed that there is currently a limit of two hand sanitisers per customer to ensure as many people as possible have access to the products. The PA news agency understands that Boots is concerned some of its products could be re-sold online. The company has seen protective products of the kind it sells, for example face masks, appear on websites such as Amazon at prices far greater than those retailed by Boots. A spokesman for LloydsPharmacy, which runs over 1,500 UK pharmacies, said it too was limiting the sale of hand gel products to two per person both online and in store. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, has recommended that sporting events with a high expected attendance from zones designated as high-risk for coronavirus, such as northern Italy, should be held behind closed doors. Such events include the return leg of the Champions League fixture between Valencia and Italy\u2019s Atalanta scheduled for 10 March and a Europa League match between Getafe and Inter Milan on 19 March. The spread of coronavirus appears to have led many to stockpile toilet paper, with social media images showing low supplies around the world. Shoppers have begun to buy up items in bulk due to the spread of the virus, despite authorities insisting it would not be necessary to do so. Sharon Reilly photographed a shop in Massachusetts, United States, noting that toilet paper stocks were running low while \u201call the bleach was gone too\u201d. She told the PA Media: \u201cIt did not make me feel like I needed to stockpile. It made me sad that people are clearly scared.\u201d Franziska Heintel shared photos of empty supermarket shelves in Berlin. She told PA Media: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an accurate representation and I don\u2019t want to make people panic even more. There\u2019s probably plenty of stores here that didn\u2019t sell out of stuff yet. Many more similar scenes were spotted in various parts of Australia, where \u201ctoilet paper\u201d began trending. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, will appear before MPs on Thursday to give evidence on how well prepared the UK is for a possible coronavirus global pandemic. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and chair of the health and social care committee, said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a daily global increase in fatalities and spread of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that the government acts urgently to ensure that the NHS is well prepared to deal with a major outbreak here in the UK. \u201cLives will be saved in future by the planning that\u2019s happening now. The health and social care committee is losing no time in calling in the chief medical officer to scrutinise emergency plans that would halt and contain the spread of the virus.\u201d Two companies have been banned from using \u201cscaremongering\u201d adverts for face masks which made false claims about their ability to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The adverts, which appeared on Amazon and on the Scottish Sun website, were in breach of the Advertising Standards Authority\u2019s (ASA) code, a ruling found. The authority stated that the adverts were \u201cmisleading, irresponsible and likely to cause fear without justifiable reason\u201d. The rulings were made against the adverts by Easy Shopping 4 Home Ltd, which appeared on the Amazon website, and adverts by Novads OU for its Oxybreath Pro mask, which appeared on the Scottish Sun website via the Taboola network as well as on cnn.com and other sites. A British woman in the coronavirus-hit Tenerife hotel has tested positive for Covid-19, officials have confirmed. The woman arrived at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace on 23 February, it has been reported. She was not part of the initial group of 10 Italians where the first case was identified. Sky News said the woman is believed to be asymptomatic and in good health, and has now been isolated in hospital. Authorities are trying to track down anyone who may have been in close contact with her. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not commented. A total of seven people have now been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Tenerife. Hello everyone. I am updating you on all the latest information on the coronavirus outbreak until 7pm GMT. Please get in touch if you want to share any news tips with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Hospitals are being told to ramp up their plans for treating coronavirus patients. In a letter to the chief executives of NHS trusts and other leaders, NHS strategic incident director Prof Keith Willett and incident director Stephen Groves set out a series of measures for more widespread cases in the UK. The letter says that to date Covid-19 has been managed as a high-consequence infectious disease through specialist centres. But \u201cit is now appropriate to begin to manage some patients within wider infectious disease units and, in due course if the number of cases continues to grow, we will need to use all acute units\u201d, the document adds. It says acute hospitals must look at the support offered to people with respiratory illness and \u201cconsider the impact that a possible surge in medical patients might have on services and stocks\u201d. The document says they must \u201cclearly identify how your organisation will implement the sequence of segregation of clinical areas (in emergency departments (ED), wards, critical care) and diagnostic and intervention suites to support the continued response in the event of a significant escalation in Covid-19 cases\u201d. The letter says trusts must establish a Covid-19 incident management team, led by an accountable emergency officer (AEO). The letter warns against stockpiling, saying: \u201cMedicines, medical devices and clinical consumables should not be stockpiled by organisations or patients as this may put a strain on the supply chain and exacerbate any potential shortages. The document also reminds trusts that any staff members who need to self-isolate receive full pay. Managers should also \u201crefresh business continuity plans for the maintenance of essential services\u201d. Ambulance trusts are also reminded to look at the \u201csafe transfer\u201d of coronavirus patients to hospitals. Vaughan Gething, the Welsh health minister, called on people who are infected or self-isolate to be treated with dignity. He said: \u201cUnfortunately some people in Wales, just as in the rest of the UK, have been subject to prejudice and racist comments. This global public health emergency does not distinguish between races and faiths Our people should not use this global public emergency as an excuse to do so.\u201d Gething said that if the peak was in May or June emergency legislation \u2013 for example to ban gatherings \u2013 would have to be passed before the Easter recess. He also revealed that a Welsh version of the UK government\u2019s Cobra meeting would be stood up \u2013 which he dubbed Cobra Cymru. Meanwhile, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said GPs may have to stop carrying out \u201croutine\u201d duties such as diabetes monitoring. Dr Will Welfare of Public Health England North West has provided an update on cases in Greater Manchester. Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with three cases of Covid-19 confirmed in Greater Manchester. Two of the cases are residents of Bury. As a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury. The third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today. The Bolton resident became infected whilst in Italy. Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public. Louise Richardson, the University of Oxford\u2019s vice-chancellor, has this afternoon sent an email to staff updating them on the university\u2019s response to the Covid-19 outbreak, noting: \u201cIt seems inevitable that we will have cases here in Oxford before too long.\u201d Richardson said she has been chairing weekly meetings on contingency planning with senior colleagues and colleges, including identifying potential testing and isolation facilities. Richardson added: As we know, the outbreak of the virus initiated in China. Many of our Chinese and other Asian students and staff have felt isolated or even suspect, especially when wearing face masks. This is a time for us to come together as a community and to support not shun one another. We are a truly global institution and delight in bringing together diverse cultural norms, and we are, above all, a community of scholars and students coming together to learn, to research and to improve the world around us. Our stellar academics, meanwhile, are doing what they do best, pushing at the frontiers of knowledge. They are attempting to create a vaccine, they are investigating therapeutic responses, and they are modelling the spread of the disease. To learn more about this work, please consult the coronavirus research microsite. I would like to express my deep appreciation to all those colleagues across the collegiate university who have been working tirelessly to ensure that we are as prepared as we can be for the consequences of an outbreak here in Oxford. This virus will pass, and when it does, I hope that we will be able to look back with pride on both the humanity and the efficacy of our response.\u201d The first coronavirus case has been confirmed in Ukraine. The country\u2019s health ministry confirmed the case in the western city of Chernivtsi on Tuesday. The deputy health minister, Viktor Lyashko, told reporters in Kyiv that a man exhibiting symptoms of the virus was admitted to hospital on Saturday, three days after returning from holiday in Italy. Lyashko said the man, whose condition was confirmed late on Monday, was in a stable condition and his wife was quarantined in their home. After the Foreign and Commonwealth office told Britons quarantined in a hotel in Tenerife that they would be allowed to book their own flights home, another guest has said the message conflicts with the information being given by hotel staff. The guest, who did not wish to be named, has been in the hotel for 11 days with her husband, and has booked to fly home on 10 March but would like to switch to an earlier flight. \u201cFrom what we have been told by the hotel we will not be able to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one will give us correct information. \u201cThere are guests here that are more than happy to stay until the 10th but we are not. We want to be home and self-quarantine at our own home. We actually believe this is not a safe environment to be in,\u201d she said. Other guests had been allowed to leave the hotel to catch a flight home this morning, but had to return a few hours later because their test results did not arrive back in time. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has given greater detail about the 12 new cases announced earlier today. Eight patients had recently travelled from Italy, one from Germany, one from Singapore, one from Japan and one from Iran. The patients are from London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester, Humberside and Kent. All are being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 48 (one previously reported positive case was retested and found to be negative) and with each of the previously reported single cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases has reached 51. The International Olympic Committee has insisted it expects Tokyo 2020 to go ahead as planned despite fears the Games might have to be delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The IOC announced on Tuesday that it remained committed to staging the event as scheduled between 24 July and 9 August after Japan\u2019s Olympic minister, Seiko Hashimoto, suggested it could be postponed until later in the year. Read more here. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said authorities will requisition all existing stocks, and future production of, face masks in the coming months to help combat the outbreak. \u201cWe will distribute them to health professionals and to French people infected with the coronavirus,\u201d Macron said on Twitter. Hand sanitisers and face masks have been selling out in French pharmacies in recent days. And some retailers have raised prices, prompting the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, to ask France\u2019s consumer and anti-fraud watchdog to open an investigation and warn that he could \u201cregulate prices of masks and gels by decree\u201d if necessary. On Tuesday, France announced its fourth death from the virus, a 92-year-old man in the Morbihan department in Brittany, one of three hotspots. The country confirmed it had 204 cases of Covid-19. About 120 schools are closed and gatherings of more than 5,000 people in enclosed spaces have been cancelled. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has said the government is not currently recommending the cancellation of St Patrick\u2019s Day events because of coronavirus, but that the situation could change before the annual 17 March festivities. Varadkar also announced he is to lead a special cabinet sub-committee to coordinate the state\u2019s response to Covid-19. \u201cAs of today, we only have one case of Covid-19 in the state, it was imported and it has been contained, so we are not advising anyone to cancel any gatherings at this stage,\u201d he told a post-cabinet news conference. \u201cBut bear in mind the St Patrick\u2019s Day festival and events are two weeks away and a lot can happen between now and then but, as of now, we\u2019re not advising to cancel major events or major gatherings such as that.\u201d The England rugby player, Mako Vunipola, is self-isolating and has ruled himself out of Saturday\u2019s Six Nations fixture against Wales. At the weekend, the Saracens prop flew back from Tonga - which he was visiting for family reasons - via Hong Kong. An England spokesperson said: \u201cHe is not sick but it is a precaution.\u201d The US Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates in an emergency measure to protect the US economy from the financial impact of the coronavirus. In an unscheduled move, the Fed cut its benchmark rate to between 1% and 1.25%, down from 1.5% to 1.75%. The Fed said: The fundamentals of the US economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks, and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the federal open market committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point, to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. The move has sent shares rallying. Northern Ireland has around 100 critical care beds ready for Covid-19, health officials said. The country\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said non-urgent services may have to be put on hold during a peak of infection which could last months. Around 99% of people affected would make a full recovery, while 95% would suffer mild to moderate symptoms which would not require hospital treatment, the senior civil servant said. \u201cThose numbers will change as we get data more relevant to European healthcare systems, maybe more aligned with ours,\u201d he said. Hello everyone. I am taking over the live blog from my colleague now and will be updating you on all the latest information on the coronavirus outbreak until 7pm. Please get in touch if you want to share any news tips with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has said it is limiting the number of Opec and non-Opec delegates attending its policy meeting on 5-6 March to a bare minimum, in light of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis precautionary measure has become necessary due to the public health risk that would come from convening such a vast number of people in one place,\u201d Opec said. Iran has announced plans to mobilise 300,000 soldiers and volunteers against the deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus outside China, as state television quoted an MP saying 23 members of parliament were infected. On Tuesday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country\u2019s supreme leader, ordered the country\u2019s armed forces to help health officials combat the outbreak. \u201cWhatever helps public health and prevents the spread of the disease is good and what helps to spread it is sin,\u201d Khamenei said, as the deputy health minister, Alireza Raeisi, reported more infections and a death toll of 77. The Queen was seen wearing gloves while shaking hands and handing out medals at an investiture at Buckingham Palace today as the government set out new plans to contain coronavirus. The monarch, who celebrates her 94th birthday next month, would be among those considered most vulnerable to the virus due to her age. While she often wears gloves on public occasions, royal observers have noted she does not usually don them for investitures. As the number of people diagnosed in the UK rose to 51, the issue will have undoubtedly been discussed among her senior aides. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. But one source said that the Queen and palace staff would follow government advice. \u2022 More than 3,100 worldwide have died from the new coronavirus while more than 90,000 have been infected in 73 countries and territories. Mainland China, excluding the semi-autonomous territories of Hong Kong and Macau, has 80,026 cases, including 2,943 deaths. Elsewhere in the world, 10,134 cases and 166 deaths have been recorded. Amid a sharp recorded decline in new cases in Hubei, the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak, and the provincial capital Wuhan, the country remained on alert as authorities reported an increase in cases coming from abroad. \u2022 Police and fire services might respond only to major incidents if their staff fall victim to Covid-19, the British government has said in a key planning document outlining how ministers are preparing for an escalating outbreak of the virus. The government action plan envisages that the army could be called in to help if civilian authorities were struggling to cope, and up to a fifth of the national workforce could be absent from work when the illness reaches its peak. Schools could close and elderly people most at risk could be advised not to attend large social gatherings, casting doubt on commemorations such as those for the 75th anniversary of VE day. \u2022 Iran says 77 people have died and 2,336 have been infected by the coronavirus. The country has had the highest number of deaths from Covid-19 outside China, where the virus originated. Chinese authorities have asked overseas-based citizens to reconsider or minimise their travel plans as the virus spreads around the world and prompts a rise of cases arriving in the country. \u2022 The world\u2019s top finance ministers and central bankers have pledged to do what they can to protect the global economy from the coronavirus. That could include extra government spending or changes to monetary policy, such as interest rate cuts or more asset purchase programmes. Ryanair expects a 10% fall in bookings in April and May because of concerns about coronavirus, having a \u201cmeaningful impact\u201d on quarterly earnings. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said the situation would stabilise by early summer. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re expecting a 10% decline in bookings through the months of April and maybe May. We could be down about 2 million passengers over that period,\u201d O\u2019Leary told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an annual industry conference. A New York City school has said it would be closed on Tuesday after a suspected case of coronavirus was detected in its community. The SAR academy and SAR high school is an orthodox Jewish school in the Bronx borough of Riverdale. It said in a statement the closure was a precautionary measure and that it was in touch with the New York City Department of Health and following its guidelines. \u201cAt this time it is important to remain calm,\u201d the statement said, urging people to follow a series of precautionary measures. Around 100 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the US and there have been six deaths, all in Washington state. New York has reported one confirmed case, in Manhattan. Kuwait\u2019s civil aviation authority is asking passengers from 10 countries, including India, Turkey and Egypt, to produce certificates issued by the Kuwaiti embassy in their country saying they are coronavirus-free. Passengers who do not provide the certificates will not be allowed into Kuwait, the aviation authority said on Twitter. Healthcare experts, academics and others have been criticising the UK government\u2019s action plan on coronavirus from the perspective of how it makes little or no mention of the differential impact of the outbreak or its secondary effects on women. Dr Rebecca Steinfeld, a campaigner who works at the charity Maternity Action, has tweeted this thread: She poses questions including what the impact might be on already overstretched maternity services if huge numbers of the healthcare system\u2019s workforce are drafted into combat coronavirus. Britain\u2019s new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has posted a picture showing him washing his hands with some Carex soap in shot. Now many people on Twitter are comparing the introduction of Carex in his tweet, with another photograph he posted at the end of February where he was making some tea, standing next to a Yorkshire Tea box. Yorkshire Tea spent the next few days swatting away a swarm of angry boycott-threatening tea drinkers by insisting it was only a simple tea. People have predicted it could be a busy day for Carex too: Here\u2019s an interesting post from the data analyst Andy Cotgreave, who asks if data visualisation conventions should be changed in the light of the coronavirus outbreak. He was responding to this tweet A school in north-west England has become the latest to close after it was confirmed that the parent of a pupil had tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement posted on the website of Hilbre high school in Wirral, it said the closure was taking place as a precaution. The principal, Mark Bellamy, said a group of students went on a ski trip to northern Italy in February but the confirmed case was not connected to the trip at this time. He added: \u201cLast week, I chose to keep the school open following advice from the government and Public Health England. Today, as I believe, this confirmed case directly impacts on my students and staff. It is for this reason I am closing the school.\u201d Dozens of British guests on lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife have received \u201cconflicting messages\u201d about how to return home, Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office has admitted. In an email sent to Britons at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel, and seen by the Guardian, the FCO acknowledged last night that \u201cthe situation within the hotel continues to be difficult\u201d and assured guests that they were working closely with the Spanish authorities. The hotel was put in lockdown last Tuesday after four Italian guests tested positive for coronavirus, and a fifth from the same group was also found to have been infected with the virus on Saturday. The email assured guests that the FCO had been in regular contact with Spanish authorities and that attempts were being made to coordinate tests with flights home. The guests have previously been told they will have to leave Spain 24 hours after a negative result. Guests are being allowed to book their own flights home, but should notify the Foreign Office at least 40 hours before departure so it can liaise with the Spanish authorities to ensure tests are coordinated. At checkout, guests will be asked to sign a declaration form to say they are free of coronavirus symptoms, and will be given a certificate confirming their negative result. They will have to present both before boarding. On arrival in the UK, guests will be required to self-isolate for the remainder of the isolation period, until 9 March. Unlike the British citizens in the hotel, Dutch and Finnish guests have been told by their government that they must wait out the full isolation period and stay until 10 March. The first group of Britons left the hotel on Sunday, though it is unclear who was able to leave and why. Italy\u2019s large elderly population poses a challenge in slowing the number of coronavirus deaths in the worst-affected country in Europe, a health specialist has said. The virus has killed 52 people in Italy, all aged between 63 and 95 and with underlying serious illnesses. The Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo and Angela Giuffrida report that the death toll, provided by officials on Monday night, marked an increase of 18 in 24 hours. Twenty-three per cent of the Italian population is over 65, making it the oldest in the world after Japan. Prof Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Sacco hospital in Milan, said: \u201cItaly is a country of old people. The elderly with previous pathologies are notoriously numerous here. I think this could explain why we are seeing more serious cases of coronavirus here, which I repeat, in the vast majority of cases start mildly and cause few problems, especially in young people and certainly in children.\u201d Britain\u2019s health secretary has suggested one of the current rules on sick pay \u2013 that self-certification can only last for seven days, and that people need a sick note from a GP if they need to be off sick longer \u2013 could be revised in the light of coronavirus. Matt Hancock is continuing to address MPs in parliament, which is being liveblogged by my colleague, Andrew Sparrow. Here is a government note about the current rules relating to sick leave. Local councils in Britain have said that coping with the virus will place extra demands on their resources, which they are discussing with the government. The Local Government Association (LGA) said: \u201cDirectors of public health, working in councils, have specialist knowledge of the management of threats, such as viruses. They continue to work round the clock to deal with this rapidly evolving situation by using tried and tested infection control procedures to contain and delay the spread of the virus.\u201d G7 finance ministers and central bank governors have said they will use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against risks from the coronavirus outbreak, which has fuelled global recession fears. In a joint statement issued after a conference call, they said Group of Seven finance ministers were ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, while central banks would continue to work to support price stability and economic growth. A letter posted on social media by an emergency doctor has gone viral in Germany, where he said he felt medical staff had been \u201cleft in the lurch\u201d by authorities. Falk Stirkat, an emergency doctor on call from Erlangen, said: \u201cWe are in no way whatsoever prepared for the current situation. \u201cWe\u2019re being sent to the people who have had contact with someone with Corona in order to get samples from them. But we\u2019re not being provided with any sort of proper protective clothing. I have been told to just go to the patients without any protection. \u201cOne colleague was forced to use a pair of diving goggles she brought from home to protect her and others from the spread of the virus.\u201d In further signs that authorities are overwhelmed by the situation, people have been reporting huge difficulties in finding who to turn to if they suspect they or their children might have the virus. One woman told the tabloid Bild she spent four and a half hours on the phone trying to find someone to help her, but was \u201csent from pillar to post\u201d before being told to stay at home. The Italian business lobby group Confindustria has said the coronavirus outbreak will strongly impact on economic growth in the first half of 2020, sending the country into a deepening recession. In a statement, Confindustria said gross domestic product would fall in the first quarter, with a \u201cstronger contraction\u201d between April and June because of the epidemic that has killed more than 50 people in Italy and heavily disrupted economic activity. Italian GDP had already declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year before the coronavirus outbreak struck. While British police are not anticipating a worst-case scenario, they are preparing for it, according to the umbrella body for police chiefs. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said in a statement that measures could include greater use of reserve (\u201cspecial\u201d) police officers. The NPCC\u2019s lead for civil contingencies, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton, said: \u201cIf required, we have tried and tested plans that ensure continuity of policing during times of capacity issues or increased demand. These plans can include moving officers around the country, changing shift patterns and the use of the special constabulary.\u201d The number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the UK stood at 51 as off 9am local time, Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, has told parliament. The threat of coronavirus to the UK was \u201cincreasingly serious\u201d, he said, but the government and the health service were \u201cwell prepared\u201d. In a Commons statement, he said: \u201cThe situation facing the country is increasingly serious. Globally and at home the number of cases continues to rise. \u201cAs of 9am today there were 51 confirmed cases in the UK and it\u2019s becoming more likely that we will see widespread transmission here in this country.\u201d Germany has 188 registered cases of coronavirus, with the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in the west of the country the most affected, having 101 cases, and the growing number of infections showing a clear eastwards spread. Several kindergartens and schools have shut, workplaces and even artists\u2019 studios have been closed, and increasing numbers of office staff have been told to work at home. There is particular media focus on a cruise ship with 1,200 Germans onboard, moored in the Norwegian port city of Haugesund. Two of the passengers who had contact with a person who had the virus are suspected of having it. Passengers are awaiting diagnosis results from Norwegian authorities who are then expected to announce whether the passengers should stay on the ship or be taken into quarantine elsewhere. Most of the cases in Germany so far appear to involve people who had been in Iran and Italy. Germany\u2019s health minister, Jens Spahn, has urged doctors to \u201ccarry out too many tests rather than too few\u201d. Increasingly doctors are complaining they have insufficient equipment to carry out the tests, with masks and full body suits in very short supply. In a letter posted on social media that has gone viral, Falk Stirkat, an emergency doctor on call from Erlangen, said he felt medical staff had been \u201cleft in the lurch\u201d by the authorities. \u201cWe are in no way whatsoever prepared for the current situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being sent to the people who have had contact with someone with Corona in order to get samples from them. But we\u2019re not being provided with any sort of proper protective clothing. I have been told to just go to the patients without any protection. One colleague was forced to use a pair of diving goggles she brought from home to protect her and others from the spread of the virus.\u201d Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government\u2019s minister for health and social services, said that if Wales suffered a more serious outbreak than other UK countries it may ask for extra funds from Westminster. He said: \u201cIf we do have a more significant outbreak than other parts of the UK then we want to make that clear in terms of our conversations with the Treasury.\u201d There are not the same powers in Wales to detain people suspected of having the virus \u2013 as there are in England. Such power has to be sought from a magistrate, but Gething said Welsh government lawyers were working on the issue and if it was deemed necessary the law could be changed. He said that for the moment the message was for people to go about their normal business. The chief medical officer for Wales, Frank Atherton, has given a briefing in Cardiff. He said: \u2022 450 people have been tested in Wales. Most of the testing has taken place in the community. Only one person confirmed to have coronavirus. That person is being treated in London. Active surveillance is taking place, which includes testing people with respiratory illnesses in intensive care units. \u2022 On timing, Atherton said the expectation was for an upsurge of cases in April, a peak in May or June, a tapering off in July/August. Not known if coronavirus will vanish or reappear as a seasonal virus. \u2022 Up to 80% of the population could be affected. Of those, 80% will be mild cases. Typically for each person infected, doctors need to speak to 10-20 people they may have been in contact with \u2013 in general those that come within 1-3 metres of an infected person. \u2022 The NHS 111 line can now be used throughout Wales for concerns about coronavirus (the line does not generally cover all areas in Wales). \u2022 Currently in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase. Next will be the \u201cdelay\u201d phase to try to slow the spread of coronavirus while the NHS is under pressure. Atherton described this as a \u201cwindow of opportunity for calm preparation\u201d. May need to halt some non-urgent operations, outpatient services. \u2022 School closures, bans on mass gatherings may follow. \u2022 Atherton\u2019s \u201cbest guess\u201d is that no vaccine will be developed this year. Next year, maybe. \u2022 There might be areas resource implications in some communities where there are disproportionate numbers of elderly or chronically ill people. There may be a need to \u201ctailor\u201d Wales\u2019s response to the outbreak. Scottish health boards and government ministers will be able to ask a sheriff to restrict the movements of patients with coronavirus who refuse to self-isolate or remain in hospital, the Scottish government has confirmed. The new UK-wide coronavirus action plan, published this morning on behalf of the UK and three devolved governments, said Scottish health boards, which run all NHS services at regional level in Scotland, have: \u201cpowers to place restrictions on the activities of individuals who are known to have the disease, or have been exposed to the disease, and to prohibit them from entering or remaining in any place. Boards may also apply for court orders for quarantine and medical examination.\u201d These powers are unprecedented and would only be used in extreme circumstances, but a Scottish government spokesman confirmed that ministers could also take on emergency powers. He said: \u201cThe Public Health (Scotland) act 2008 allows health boards to apply to a sheriff for an order requiring a person\u2019s isolation at home or for them to be quarantined where they pose a significant risk to public health. \u201cScottish ministers can also make regulations under the act requiring a person posing a health risk to be medically examined, quarantined or detained.\u201d A second papal international conference, which was to have included Pope Francis, has been postponed due to the coronavirus, the Vatican has said, according to Reuters. The meeting of world, cultural and religious leaders to sign a \u201cglobal compact on education\u201d has been rescheduled from 10-17 May to 11-18 October. Organisers said it was because many of the participants might not be able to travel to Italy. Participants from more than 100 countries were expected. Here are the main points from the Boris Johnson press conference held this morning to announce the UK government\u2019s coronavirus action plan. Johnson appeared alongside Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. To a large extent the PM allowed the two officials to answer the more technical questions, and, perhaps not surprisingly, they appeared to have a better grasp of the detail. Here are the main points from the briefing. Johnson sought to reassure the public that the government is prepared for a widespread coronvirus outbreak that could have far-reaching consequences for Britain. He said the government was publishing its coronavirus action plan and that it had four strands: The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate. Johnson said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that more people would contract the illness, and he stressed that the government was now preparing \u201cfor all eventualities\u201d. But he said little directly about what emergency measures might be introduced, and he avoiding discussing the possible fatality rate - even though his two advisers made it clear that potentially the number of people at risk is very high. Johnson said that most people would not be affected. He said: Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen. He insisted that the country was going to get through the coronavirus, \u201cand get through it in good shape\u201d. And he stressed the importance of people washing their hands. Whitty and Vallance said that under a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d 1% of people getting coronavirus might die. Near the start of the press conference Whitty said that coronavirus had a 1% death rate based on the Chinese experience. And he said that there was a \u201csignificant ramp up\u201d in the death rate for those over 80. Whitty commended this graphic from today\u2019s Times (paywall) showing coronavirus death rates. But Whitty also said that the 1% Chinese mortality rate figure might be overstating the true rate because of the number of people getting the virus but not displaying symptoms. And he implied that the survival rate might be higher in the UK because of its health system being better than China\u2019s. He said: The exact percentages will depend on a lot of factors - including the health care system you have in place, so I would not expect... the numbers we are seeing in China automatically to read over to the UK. The two advisers did not predict what proportion of the population might contract coronavirus on the event of containment failing. Johnson said that, although the government was planning to legislate to give it powers in relation to schools, borders and quarantine, these powers would be \u201cexceptional and short-term\u201d. Whitty and Vallance said that, in the event of coronavirus spreading, ministers would be asked to choose from an option of far-reaching proposals that could be taken to limit the spread of the disease. They did not go into great detail about what measures might be included, although they conceded that some of them could be highly disruptive. They said modelling would be used to decide what was best. But they also said it would be a mistake to introduce these restrictions too soon, because they said that could led to people ignoring the rules at the point where they were needed most. Vallance said a decision to give up trying to contain the virus, and to move to the focus on mitigation, could be taken by a group of countries at the same time. Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of widespread school closures being ordered. Whitty said that the evidence from China suggested children were less likely to be affected by coronavirus than adults. Vallance said there might be a case for closing schools to stop the disease spreading, and to \u201cpull down the peak\u201d. But he said closing schools would impact on the NHS, because staff with school-age children would have to stay at home. Whitty said the government was trying to delay infection reaching its peak until the late spring and the summer, when the NHS would be in a better position to cope. He said that, to achieve this, the government might need to do three things: 1) introduce \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures (he did not elaborate); 2) isolate older people; and 3) reconfigure public services. Whitty signalled that the UK could be affected by coronavirus for another six months. He said he expected it to take two to three months to reach its peak from its outbreak, and for the virus to then take another two to three months to decline. Whitty and Vallance played down the prospect of people having to cancel holidays. They said that, at the moment, they were not advising people to cancel their plans, other than in specific countries covered by health advice. And they said that, once the virus had spread widely, they would be no point in avoiding foreign countries anyway. But Whitty said people might want to consider the risk of travelling to countries with a weaker health service than the UK\u2019s with coronavirus at its peak. Whitty came close to ruling out any attempt being tried to isolate cities, following the Chinese model. He said this would only make sense in a situation where the virus was starting in one place, with a high transmission rate, and where it was not present elsewhere. (That is not the situation in the UK.) At the weekend Matt Hancock, the health secretary, refused to rule out cities being isolated to prevent the spead of the disease. Johnson said the government was considering \u201call reasonable options\u201d that could help self-employed workers who need to give up work because they are self-isolating. Whitty said specific measures were likely to be proposed for care homes. He did not give details of what these might be. Johnson said he thought the NHS was \u201cwell capable of handling the most tremendous pressures\u201d, such as the ones it was likely to face, although he refused to go into detail of extent to which normal health services might be disrupted. But he did say, if the virus spread widely, people might have to be \u201cself-restraining\u201d and avoid services like the GP and 111 where possible. Johnson said that, when deciding how to balance the need to protect the public against the need to reduce disruption, he would be guided by scientific advice. Johnson did not rule out the army being used to help out the police or other public services at the peak of the outbreak. Johnson said he had not given up shaking people\u2019s hands. On a visit to a hospital last week where he thinks coronavirus patients were being treated, he shook hands with everybody, he said. \u201cOur judgment is washing your hands is the crucial thing,\u201d he said. Vallance said that there was no need for people to panic buy. Asked if the government was worried about this, he said the government expected people to take logical decisions. Whitty said the crisis was likely to lead to \u201cextraordinary outbreaks of altruism\u201d rather than widespread outbreaks of antisocial behaviour. There has been a spate of worrying developments in Iran, where the virus has killed at least 77 people and infected 2,336. The Islamic Republic\u2019s supreme leader has ordered the armed forces to assist health officials in combating the outbreak. As many as 300,000 soldiers and volunteers could potentially be mobilised, though it remains unclear what actions they would be taking to confront the virus. Semiofficial news agencies in Iran are reporting that the head of the country\u2019s emergency medical services is now ill with Covid-19, and state television quoted a lawmaker as saying 23 members of parliament now had the virus. State media also broadcast images of the 80-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei planting a tree wearing disposable gloves ahead of Iran\u2019s upcoming arbor day, illustrating that concern about the virus as now reached the top of the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy. There are now more than 2,530 cases of coronavirus across the Middle East, with most of those outside Iran in the region linked back to the Islamic Republic. The Leipzig book fair has been cancelled in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus in Germany, Reuters is reporting. A spokeswoman for the fair declined to comment. She said the fair would issue a statement in due course. There is no current evidence that pets can be infected with the new coronavirus or be carriers of the virus, according to the animal charity Blue Cross for Pets. That\u2019s not entirely clear until further tests are carried out, but the charity adds in a post on its website: \u201cThere is currently a dog in Hong Kong who has tested weakly positive for coronavirus.\u201d \u201cThough it isn\u2019t yet confirmed whether this is environmental contamination through the dog\u2019s nose and mouth or whether they have really been infected, which means the situation is still evolving.\u201d Fending off rumours that he has cancelled a raft of diary engagements because he has caught the coronavirus, France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron will visit an \u201coperational crisis centre\u201d at the health ministry on Tuesday evening. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said Macron wanted to express his \u201cgratitude and support\u201d to the teams coordinating the country\u2019s response to the health emergency. \u201cNo, Emmanuel Macron has not caught the coronavirus \u2026 and no, the president is not in quarantine,\u201d the president\u2019s team reportedly told Le Parisien newspaper. France\u2019s health authorities have released a map of the spread of the coronavirus around the country. Among the 191 confirmed cases, there have been several clusters, including one in a group of small villages in the Morbihan in Brittany where all schools and colleges have been closed and local gatherings cancelled and banned. The worst affected region is the Oise department north of Paris, which has reported 64 confirmed cases. The average age of those infected is 51 with ages ranging from one year to 92 years. On Tuesday morning, the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, announced France was setting aside a further \u20ac260m for French hospitals to deal with the coronavirus crisis. He told BFMTV the authorities were \u201canticipating the possibility of an epidemic\u201d on French territory. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet an epidemic, but we are facing the threat of an epidemic and it\u2019s getting closer,\u201d he added. The UN has postponed its annual meeting on gender equality, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of events across New York next week, over concerns about transmission of the coronavirus, the Guardian\u2019s Liz Ford writes. Member states have cancelled all side events organised during the two-week Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which was to begin on Monday. Thousands of people were expected to attend CSW, the largest global meeting on gender equality, where member states and civil society groups meet to advance progress on women\u2019s rights. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, considered the most progressive international blueprint for advancing women\u2019s rights. Over the weekend, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had asked member states to consider scaling down, shortening or postponing CSW in light of the coronavirus outbreak. More than 550 feminist organisations worldwide wrote to UN Women calling for the meeting to be postponed rather than cut back as that would have excluded civil society. On Monday, a decision was made to postpone the meeting, and all side events involving UN agencies, country missions and NGOs were cancelled. \u201cThe outbreak of the coronavirus forced a difficult choice for the Commission on the Status of Women,\u201d said the president of the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, Fran\u00e7oise Girard. All routine surgery will need to stop as part of preparations to continue to allow intensive care units to function during a widespread outbreak of coronavirus, a doctor working in a British intensive care unit has warned. Preparations need to be accelerated and coordinated and Britain needs to be honest and transparent about the potential impact of a Wuhan-type epidemic in the UK, Dr Tim Cook said in a piece for the Guardian. Hospitals are acting to expand intensive care outside its existing footprint and double or even treble ICU capacity, most likely by taking over operating theatres, he added. \u201cThis expansion will involve engaging anaesthetists and others to provide ICU medical care and nurses from elsewhere in the hospital to work as ICU staff. To facilitate this, much or all routine surgery will need to stop.\u201d The government is working on the basis that it will take between two and three months after the first sustained human to human transmission for the outbreak to peak. That potentially key point on timeframes was spelled out by Britain\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. After that, it would take another two to three months for it to taper off. The press conference has now ended. We\u2019ll be posting an summary from my colleague Andrew Sparrow shortly. Johnson appeared to pass on a question about reports that his government had chosen not to retain access to the European Union\u2019s pandemic warning system. The UK\u2019s department of health wanted to retain membership of the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) as part of the EU-UK future relationship deal \u2013 but Johndon\u2019s office said no, the Daily Telegraph had reported. There is a question about whether people should cancel their plans to go abroad for holidays. Whitty says that it\u2019s about whether people are travelling to high-risk areas. But there will potentially come a point at which infection is so widespread that it makes no differences as to where people travel. Johnson is asked if he will continue to shake hands with visiting dignitaries. He says that he continues to shake hands and did so when he was at a hospital \u201cthe other night\u201d where there were coronavirus patients. Kate Proctor asks whether it was no longer a \u201clikely\u201d course of action that cities could be locked down. She also asks for stats on the rates of death among the elderly. Whitty says that in general \u2013 and while he doesn\u2019t want to take anything off the table \u2013 the locking down of cities happens and is more effective when the infection is coming from one particular place. He says that what is clear is that there is a significant ramping up of people dying from the infection when they are over 80. A lot also depends on the healthcare system that is in place and he would not expect all of the statistical outcomes in China to be replicated in the UK. Johnson and the officials are asked what practical advice can people get on keeping cupboards and fridges stocked without triggering panic buying. Vallance says there is no reason for people to be engaged in that behaviour but there is a government sub-group examining the issue of food provision. There will clearly need to be measures put in place to provide food to those self-isolating. There is a question about what assurances can be given to older people and those who are frightened at the moment if they are in \u201cat risk\u201d groups. Whitty responds by saying that even for the highest risk group the majority of people will survive. He adds that if you look at the Chinese data it was clear that great majority of older people survived. There\u2019s a question about how similar the outbreak is to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which is mentioned in the UK government planning document released today. Vallance replies by saying that it is \u201cvery different\u201d to the 1918 outbreak, which affected a lot of children and young people. By comparison, this virus has more of an impact on older groups and the vulnerable. Johnson says Britain is facing a \u201cnational challenge\u201d and he is very confident that the British public can see the balance regarding the risk. \u201cI am very confident that Britain will get through it in good shape,\u201d he adds. Another question: what about parents concerned about school closures? Johnson says: \u201cWe don\u2019t think schools should be closing in principle \u2013 they should stay open \u2013 but they should follow the advice of Public Health England.\u201d Vallance says there is modelling on the impact of school closures. There is no point in looking at it in isolation, he says. Where closures fit into other measures \u2013 given that children are at lower risk \u2013 might actually be quite limited. Very specific advice will be given on care homes, adds Whitty, but one of the things the authorities are eager to do is avoid doing this too early. Johnson is asked: \u201cWhat words of assurance for Brits sitting at home that they can get through this crisis?\u201d He repeats the advice on washing hands and says: \u201cThis is overwhelmingly a disease that is moderate and people will recover from it speedily.\u201d Valance says there are things to do now which have been clear and the authorities will give other advice at an appropriate time. \u201cIf you do things at the wrong time you end up with an awful lot of disruption because people can\u2019t see the point of doing them at that time,\u201d he says. There will come a time when the official reaction to the virus will move beyond a phase of \u201ccontaining\u201d it, adds Whitty. This will come when so many people are affected in Britain and around the world so as to make it sensible to end that phase of planning. \u201cThere will come a point \u2026 when containing ceases to make sense. We haven\u2019t reached that point but we could reach that point,\u201d he added. Johnson is asked about whether he is prepared to deploy the army and police. The police are there, he replies, but the army is of course always ready to back them. \u201cThat is under the reasonable worst-case scenario,\u201d he adds. Overall, probably around 1% of the people who get the virus may end up dying as a result, the press conference is told by Britain\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Who are in that group? \u201cIt goes up a bit among people who are older and a bit more vulnerable,\u201d says Whitty. There are gaps in knowledge about the number of people who have had the infection with no symptoms, he adds. One thing the authorities are not sure about is the number of people who can get infected. In reality, the proportion of the population who will get infected is likely to be lower, and probably much lower, than 80%. \u201cIf you look at Wuhan it\u2019s clearly not 80% that is infected, so we can learn from that and we build on it,\u201d says Vallance. \u201cWhat we are doing is building on the reasonable worst-case scenario.\u201d There is a question to Johnson and the health service civil servants flanking him about whether the virus will get bigger than efforts to contain it. The answer is that it\u2019s too early to say, replies Johnson. There are measures that could be taken to flatten the peak, the press conference is told by Britain\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, but it\u2019s important to take the right steps at the right time. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, is outlining the UK\u2019s plans for coronavirus. There are four strands: contain, delay, research and mitigate. He says it will be a mild disease for most people but he \u201cunderstands\u201d the concern and admits it is highly likely there will be a spread of the disease. \u201cOur country remains extremely well-prepared as it has been since the outbreak in Wuhan several months ago,\u201d says the prime minster, who reiterates the message that people should wash their hands for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. Dublin\u2019s Silicon Docks area seemed as jammed as usual on Tuesday morning despite thousands of Google workers staying at home as a precaution against coronavirus. Commuters who had hoped for a respite from the rush-hour crush found it was business as usual on Dart trains and at the Grand Canal dock station, which teemed with workers for Facebook and other tech companies. Some Facebook employees grumbled in a WhatsApp group that they too wanted to work from home. Google told most of its 8,000 staff in Dublin to work from home after an employee on Monday showed flu-like symptoms. \u201cWe continue to take precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, and as part of that effort we have asked our Dublin teams to work from home tomorrow,\u201d said a spokesperson. The affected worker is considered an unlikely case of coronavirus but Google\u2019s Irish division wants to test its ability to function with staff working remotely. Ireland has just one confirmed case of the virus but health officials have warned they expect cases to proliferate. The National Public Health Emergency Team is expected later on Tuesday to announce new measures to combat infection, including possible curbs on public gatherings. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is to chair a special cabinet committee to oversee the threat and government response. Police and fire services will only respond to the most serious call-outs if their staff fall ill through coronavirus, the British government has warned, in a key planning document setting out how ministers would deal with an escalating outbreak. The 28-page action plan envisages that up to a fifth of the national workforce could be absent from work, schools could close and elderly people would be advised not to attend social gatherings. The measures would be rolled out only if the virus moved beyond the currently designated \u201ccontain phase\u201d. The plan also states there could be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly among vulnerable and elderly groups, and that local authorities will need help to deal with that challenge, presumably in relation to morgue capacity. It also proposes that businesses facing short-term cashflow because of low demand from customers could ask the HMRC how to avoid falling behind with tax. And it says that if NHS staff numbers are affected, some non-urgent care may be delayed and retired healthcare professionals brought back on duty. Tokyo\u2019s Olympic 2020 contract allows it to postpone the Games until the end of the year, Japan\u2019s Olympics minister has said, amid concern the coronavirus could disrupt the event. \u201cThe contract calls for the Games to be held within 2020. That could be interpreted as allowing a postponement,\u201d Seiko Hashimoto said in a session of Japan\u2019s parliament. However, Japan\u2019s government and host city Tokyo were still committed to hosting the Games, due to begin on July 24, she added. And under the hosting agreement, the right to cancel the Games belongs to the IOC. Chinese citizens are to be evacuated from Iran, reports Chinese media. We\u2019re waiting for Britain\u2019s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to emerge from 10 Downing Street to outline details of Britain\u2019s plans to contain the new coronavirus. As we reported earlier, British supermarkets have drawn up \u201cfeed the nation\u201d contingency plans that would help the country cope with any panic-buying brought on by a sudden escalation of the outbreak. Under the plans, supermarkets would work with suppliers to scale back the variety of foods and groceries available, and instead focus on maintaining supplies of staple products. Details of the strategy in place to ensure uninterrupted food supplies came as Johnson was set to unveil \u201cbattle plans\u201d today for tackling a potential outbreak, expected to include steps to limit the spread within crowds and to older, more vulnerable people. The outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told British MPs at an ongoing committee hearing that he does not expect the coronavirus economic shock to be as bad as 2008. A lack of training and communication have led to fears of medical facilities in the US becoming overwhelmed with an influx of cases. All hospitals have a pandemic preparedness plan that they should brief all their employees on as the illness becomes more serious in the US, reports Lauren Aratani. But some nurses in the medical field say that training and information has not come in a timely manner. A survey of 1,000 California nurses from National Nurses United, the largest nurses\u2019 union in the country, found that 47% of nurses were unsure if their hospital had a plan in place to isolate patients with possible novel coronavirus infection. Almost half were unsure if their hospitals have enough personal protective equipment, such as masks, to protect staff in the case of a rapid surge of cases. Health authorities in Gibraltar have confirmed that a person in the British overseas territory has been identified as having the new coronavirus and is self-isolating. The patient and their partner recently returned from northern Italy via Malaga airport, according to a report by GBC News. Mark Carney told the House of Commons Treasury committee the Bank of England\u2019s role in the coronavirus outbreak was \u201cto help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary\u201d. He said the Bank would \u201ctake all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system consistent with its statutory responsibilities\u201d. The outgoing Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has been giving evidence before British MPs, who have been keen to hear how monetary policy might be used to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak. My colleague Andy Sparrow has been monitoring his appearance and reports that the full text of his opening statement to the House of Commons Treasury committee about coronavirus is available. Here is an extract. The Bank of England\u2019s role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary. The Bank will take all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system, consistent with its statutory responsibilities. We are monitoring the situation closely across all our functions and ensuring all necessary contingency plans are in place. There are reports that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran and who is suspected to have the coronavirus, could be released from prison in Iran temporarily. That\u2019s according to a British Labour MP, Tulip Siddiq, who tweeted: \u201cNews from Iranian ambassador that my constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe may be released on furlough today or tomorrow from prison in Iran. If this is true, Nazanin would welcome leaving Evin jail, but we\u2019ve been here before. \u201cIf this furlough happens, the British government have an obligation to make it permanent, and not let her be used as a bargaining chip in the weeks to come. I remain concerned that Nazanin has told her family that she has still not been tested for coronavirus.\u201d In a statement issued this week, the Free Nazanin Campaign said although there were reports of at least one coronavirus-related inmate death inside Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, staff had refused to test her. In a statement issued via the campaign, Zaghari-Ratcliffe said: \u201cI am not good. I feel very bad in fact. It is a strange cold. Not like usual. I know the kinds of cold I normally have, how my body reacts. \u201cThis is different. I am just as bad as I was. I often get better after three days. But with this there is no improvement. I haven\u2019t got one bit better.\u201d Other questions that are often asked concern \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d \u2013 what are they and how are they transmitting coronavirus? As explained by the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, not everybody is equal when it comes to the transmission of infectious diseases. In fact, it has been established for at least two decades that there is something called the 20/80 rule \u2013 that a small core group of about one in five people transmit infections to far more people than the majority do. Read on. Got questions about the much repeated \u201cself-isolation\u201d strategy for coping with the virus? Some of the most frequently asked questions have been answered in a Guardian piece here with input from our health editor, Sarah Boseley. At a very basic level, those who are self-isolating are expected to stay at home, and certainly not go to work or college. It has been described by public health officials as taking the same measures you would if you had a heavy cold \u2013 although perhaps a better comparison would be the flu. The key thing is not to go near other people to avoid spreading the virus, which is transmitted via droplets from coughs and sneezes. It is thought you need to be relatively close to inhale those droplets \u2013 maybe within a metre or so. But the droplets can also land on surfaces and transfer to people\u2019s hands \u2013 hence the advice to wash them frequently. The French carmaker PSA has managed for ensure that its European facilities have enough supplies to keep running for now during the coronavirus outbreak, according to its chief executive officer, Carlos Tavares. Speaking at a conference call with journalists, Tavares also said that the carmaker could resume activity in the Chinese province of Hubei on 11 March, according to the latest information from Chinese authorities. India, the world\u2019s main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs made from them, including paracetamol, as concern mounted the coronavirus outbreak could turn into a pandemic. Indian pharma companies get almost 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for their medicines from China, Reuters reports. Already, the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted businesses dependent on Chinese supplies and industry professionals say Indian generic drugmakers are likely to face supply shortages from China if the epidemic drags on. \u201cExport of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby \u2018restricted\u2019 with immediate effect and till further orders,\u201d Police are investigating an attack in central London on a Singaporean student who says he had to go to hospital after being targeted by a group of people who shouted about the coronavirus being beating him up. Jonathan Mok, who shared pictures of his battered face and wrote about his ordeal in a Facebook post, which has been shared thousands of times, that one of them tried to kick him in the head before saying: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want your coronavirus in my country.\u201d The Metropolitan Police have given a statement to the Guardian saying they are investigating a racially aggravated assault in Oxford Street in central London on a near Tottenham Court Road station at around 9.3opm last Monday. The force, which said that the 23-year-old victim was punched and sustained facial injuries, are now looking at CCTV to try to identify the suspects. Mok wrote on Facebook that he had already experienced several racist statements directed to him in the past weeks, some involving references to the coronavirus, but felt that racially-motivated assaults always seemed like they would never happen to someone else. Writing about the incident, he said that he had walked past a group of men when he heard one make a reference to the virus, and stopped to look at them. All of a sudden, the first punch was swung at my face and took me by surprise. When I was still shocked by the first hit, the guy delivered the second sucker punch. By then, a few passers-by had stopped and one of them tried to reason with them that 4 on 1 was not fair. The attacker\u2019s friend tried to swing a kick at me as I was explaining to the passer-by that I hadn\u2019t done anything at all. I tried to react in self-defence but couldn\u2019t do anything substantial because I was still recovering from a broken finger in my master hand. The guy who tried to kick me then said, \u2018I don\u2019t want your coronavirus in my country\u2019, before swinging another sucker punch at me, which resulted in my face exploding with blood (from my nose), where the blood was splattered all across the pavement. Mok, who has studied in London for the past two years, added that he hated being in the spotlight and never liked writing posts on Facebook or any social media platform but that the incident highlighted an important issue that needed to be brought into the spotlight. He was told in hospital that he had suffered a few fractures in my face and might need to undergo reconstructive surgery to fix some of the bones. It looks like the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) knows how to try to get on the right side of Donald Trump. Here\u2019s a tweet today from the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, commending the US president on Twitter for a US aid donation to the response to coronavirus in vulnerable countries. Considering Trump\u2019s well-publicised hostility to US aid spending, one might wonder if he was aware of the support. He does now.. The good news is that coronavirus is being contained \u201cto an extent\u201d in London, the city\u2019s mayor has said. Sadiq Khan said Britain was a \u201cvery different country to China\u201d when he was asked on BBC if police and troops could be stationed at underground stations. The most important thing people could do was to wash their hands, he reiterated. Public data on the number of patients tested in the US for coronavirus was removed from the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a congressman, who has written to ask questions about it. Mark Pocan, a Democratic party congressman, writes that until 1 March, the CDC reported publicly on its website on the number of travel-related Covid-19 cases, the total number of people tested and the number of deaths. \u201cInexplicably, today, the CDC\u2019s public webpage dedicated to Covid-19 data no longer displays how many persons have been tested for, or who have died, from Covid-19. I would like to know why,\u201d he writes. Matt Hancock adds that in \u201cthe reasonable worse case scenario there are actions that I may have to take, which I didn\u2019t come into politics to take, but which may be necessary to save lives\u201d. The government is certainly not recommending stockpiling, he says, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to try to come through this together and everyone has a duty to do something \u2013 hand-washing being the most obvious example. Hancock is asked if he accepts that there is effectively a trade-off between disrupting or even destroying the social and economic situation on the one hand, and keeping people safe on the other. \u201cTo a degree,\u201d he replies. \u201cThe thinking is that we will be guided by the science and we will minimise social and economic disruption, subject to keeping people safe.\u201d It\u2019s taken the coronavirus to lead to the ending of a boycott by British government ministers of BBC Radio 4\u2019s flagship Today programme, a policy brought in when a new administration came into power with a somewhat difficult relationship with Britain\u2019s national broadcaster. The health minister, Matt Hancock, was on the programme this morning, where he repeted some of the talking points he\u2019s been passing on to other news outlets this morning. Closing schools at the moment would be ineffective on clinical grounds but the situation may change, he added. Hancock was also challenged on what the government is doing to help care homes, where residents who are in the higher risk groups are said to be extremely concerned. Part of the proposals of the emergency legislation being brought forward by the government will result in retired doctors and others, as well as volunteers, being able to come through to help out if there is a shortage of staff. A number of staff at Google\u2019s office in Dublin have been told to work from home after a co-worker reported flu-like symptoms, according to a report in the Irish Times It reports that the person concerned is not a confirmed case of the Covid-19 coronavirus, but a source told the newspaper that people who may be close contacts of the individual have been told to work at home until there is greater clarity on whether they are at risk. The company has more than 8,000 employees in Dublin, The British government has been accused of failing to grasp the threat of so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d workers spreading coronavirus, after a minister advised those with no sick pay who have to self-isolate to claim benefits instead. The government is under huge pressure from trade unions and Labour to promise statutory sick pay to all workers when it unveils its coronavirus action plan, due to be published today. But Justin Tomlinson, a work and pensions minister, said the current advice for workers with no sick pay who suspect they have the disease was to claim universal credit \u2013 which can take up to five weeks to come through. The alternative would be employment and support allowance, which requires claimants to have two to three years of national insurance contributions. Europe\u2019s response to the virus in terms of how the economic impact can be mitigated is to be discussed by governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) on 12 March, AFP reports. Echoing other central banks including the Bank of Japan and Bank of England, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said in a statement on Monday the bank was \u201cready to take appropriate and targeted measures as necessary\u201d to deal with the virus outbreak\u2019s economic impact. It\u2019s far too early to be able to tell if the government will moving to cancel mass gatherings such as the London Marathon next month, Britain\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock, has said, but it may have to take steps it doesn\u2019t want to take to keep people safe. \u201cRight now, that is what people should be doing and otherwise going about their normal daily life because we want to minimise the level of disruption, subject to doing the things we need to do to keep people safe,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. He added that it was a \u201creality of this disease\u201d that there were actions the \u201cgovernment does not normally take and that we don\u2019t want to take, that may be necessary to keep people safe\u201d. Hancock said he understood why people may not want to shake hands, but added: \u201cThe scientific advice is that the impact of shaking hands is negligible and what really matters is that you wash your hands more often.\u201d Major concerts and events in the United Arab Emirates, an air transit centre as well as a tourism and business hub, have been cancelled or postponed as the coronavirus spreads in the Gulf. There have been at least 1,641 cases of the virus in the Gulf region, mostly in Iran where 66 people have died, Reuters reports. Cases have also been reported in other Middle East nations. The 5-6 March Ultra electronic music festival at Abu Dhabi\u2019s 25,000-capacity Du arena and the 21 March K-pop Music Bank concert at Dubai\u2019s 17,000-capacity Coca-Cola Arena have been cancelled. Organisers of Ultra, where electronic group Major Lazer and DJ Afrojack were to perform, cited travel restrictions imposed by some countries and airlines in the wake of the rapidly spreading virus. As governments roll out plans, coronavirus is also changing social interaction, especially in the western world. The Guardian\u2019s Caroline Davies has been looking at how handshakes, cheek-kisses, hugs \u2013 the everyday greetings ingrained in our culture \u2013 are not as welcome as they used to be. In the meantime, good hand hygiene is the key message. \u201cScience says shaking hands is disgusting,\u201d Nicky Milner, the director of medical education at Anglia Ruskin University, told the Guardian. She pointed to research showing on average we carry 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species on our hands. On average, we will shake hands 15,000 times in our lifetime, she said. Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been on the airwaves this morning and said that for \u201cmost people who catch this virus, it\u2019s relatively mild, and a bad cough\u201d. He said the number of home ventilation kits are being expanded and that \u201cthe NHS, I am sure, will rise to the challenge\u201d of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. On whether the NHS would be able to cope if the virus reaches pandemic level, he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cA lot of people, not least because it is mild, will be best off at home than in hospital so we are expanding the number of home ventilation kits that are available so that can be done. \u201cThe NHS, of course, has a full plan for this and prepares for this even when there isn\u2019t an outbreak. \u201cInevitably in the case of this becoming widespread of course there will be much more pressure on the NHS, but the NHS is prepared for this sort of challenge.\u201d Good morning from London where the British government is preparing to publish details this morning of its action plan to slow down the spread of corona virus, which is expected to include measures to potentially cancel events and bring health service staff out of retirement. A cabinet meeting will be followed later in the morning by a press conference by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, who will unveil \u201cbattle plans\u201d today for tackling a potential outbreak, expected to include steps to limit the spread within crowds and to older, more vulnerable people. The number of people in the UK who have tested positive for the virus stands at 39. The plan is expected to include a \u201cwar room\u201d to bring together communications experts and scientists from across government and the NHS to roll out a public information campaign. British supermarkets have meanwhile drawn up \u201cfeed the nation\u201d contingency plans that would help the country cope with any panic-buying brought on by a sudden escalation of the coronavirus outbreak Under the plans - which you can read about in the Guardian\u2019s report here - supermarkets would work with suppliers to scale back the variety of foods and groceries available, and instead focus on maintaining supplies of staple products. This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog, which will bring you coverage of those developments today in Britain as well as covering the ongoing situation around the world. You can reach me at ben.quinn@theguardian.com or tweet me at @BenQuinn75 It\u2019s been another busy day of news developments on the coronavirus outbreak. Below are the main points so far: South Korea has declared \u201cwar\u201d on the virus after reporting 600 new infections on Tuesday, taking the country\u2019s total infections to just under 5,000. WHO experts arrived in Iran as the semi-official news agency, Fars, said the country was \u201caccelerating measures\u201d in the fight against the virus. China reported 125 new cases on Tuesday, its slowest daily increase in six weeks (eight times as many cases were recorded outside of China as inside in the last 24 hours). Twitter told its employees to work from home. Italy, Europe\u2019s worst-hit country, recorded a spike in deaths to 52 from 18 as the number of confirmed cases reached 1,835. Health officials in the US, where 91 cases have been confirmed, said six people in the Seattle area of Washington state have died of Covid-19. Hong Kong announced charter flights to get its citizens out of Wuhan. Washington has 18 confirmed cases, the most of any state in the US, eight of which have been linked to a nursing home in Seattle. Trump signalled he is considering additional travel restrictions into America to try to contain the spread of coronavirus Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday that two chartered flights would bring 533 Hong Kong residents, including pregnant women and cancer patients, back from Wuhan. The Australian prime minister warned against panic buying, as the central bank cut interest rates to a historically low 0.5% in an attempt to protect the economy. Cruise ship passengers at R\u00e9union Island were threatened by violent protests. UK supermarkets draw up plans to \u2018feed the nation\u2019. You can also read our Coronavirus latest: at a glance Pope Francis, who canceled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy because he is suffering from a cold, has tested negative for coronavirus, the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported on Tuesday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said he had no immediate comment on the report. The 83-year-old Roman Catholic leader, who had part of one lung removed because of an illness decades ago, also cancelled most audiences last week. In China, Shanghai will require everyone entering the city from countries with \u201crelatively serious virus conditions\u201d to submit to 14 days of quarantine, an official said on Tuesday. The rule will apply to all people regardless of nationality, said Xu Wei, an official with the city government\u2019s news office, speaking to reporters at a briefing. The southeast province of Guangdong, neighbouring Hong Kong, announced similar rules earlier on Tuesday. Canada has asked travellers arriving from Iran \u2013 one of the countries hardest hit by the new coronavirus epidemic \u2013 to self-isolate at home for 14 days, even if they are not exhibiting any symptoms. Health authorities asked Canadians to avoid any non-essential travel to Iran and the northern region of Italy, which have both emerged as major hotspots for the infection. Many cases in Canada had been linked to the Iran outbreak, Canadian chief medical officer Theresa Tam told reporters. Canada had 27 confirmed cases. Japan has reported its first case of coronavirus in Oita prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu after a woman in her thirties tested positive for the pathogen, Kyodo news reported. Australia and New Zealand are funding the WHO\u2019s Pacific regional coronavirus response plan and are responding to requests from assistance for Pacific nations. There are no confirmed cases in the Pacific islands or Timor-Leste, so far, but fears about the virus are widespread in the region, with rumours and misinformation circulating on social media. Many Pacific countries do not have adequate health infrastructure to deal with a serious outbreak and some are already battling illnesses like malaria, dengue fever and drug-resistant tuberculosis. A devastating measles outbreak swept through the region late last year, claiming the lives of more than 80 people in Samoa, most of them young children. Australia\u2019s department for foreign affairs issued a statement saying it had responded to requests for assistance from the region and was providing personal protective equipment and medical supplies for healthcare workers in Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Fiji, as well as assisting with planning, surveillance, risk communication and case management in Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Palau, Tonga, the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji. Chinese state media is reporting that Apple will be hard hit by the coronavirus shutdown. It says the plant in Shanghai which delivers 40%of the iphone handsets only has 25% of workers are back at work. Also Foxconn\u2019s plant is only running at 22%. The health minister in the Australian state of New South Wales, Brad Hazzard, has confirmed more cases in NSW, taking the number of cases there to 13. These include a 39 year-old man who arrived from Iran, and a 53 year-old man who returned to Sydney from Singapore, a woman in her sixties who returned from South Korea, and a woman in her sixties just returned from Japan. \u201cWe are seeing an escalating number of people,\u201d he is telling reporters at a press conference. Meanwhile an Air Asia flight was met by paramedics upon landing at Avalon airport in the state of Victoria on Tuesday morning after showing symptoms of the coronavirus. T he passenger was then taken to hospital and quarantined. Ambulance Victoria confirmed it received a call about a passenger just after 11.30am. Other plane passengers will be allowed to go home but will be notified if the passenger tests positive for the virus. The social media giant Twitter has called on its staff around the globe to work from home, due to the virus outbreak. \u201cBeginning today, we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they\u2019re able,\u201d it said on a blog post. \u201cOur goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus for us - and the world around us. We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy.\u201d It says working from home will be \u201cmandatory\u201d for its employees in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. Chinese authorities have asked overseas-based citizens to reconsider or minimise their travel plans as the coronavirus epidemic spreads across the world and prompts an uptick of imported cases arriving in the country, Reuters reports. \u201cWe are trying to distance ourselves from the virus, but what cannot be broken is the flesh and blood relationships between overseas Chinese and their families in their hometowns,\u201d said the government of Qingtian county in the southeastern Zhejiang province. Travellers from countries with severe coronavirus outbreaks who arrive in Guangdong province, an economic and export powerhouse in the south, must undergo a 14 day quarantine - state media reported on Tuesday. It added that travelling was the easiest way for cross-infections to happen, describing staying home as the \u201cbest form of protection\u201d. \u201cFor the sake of your family\u2019s health and safety, please strengthen your precautions, carefully decide on your travel plans and minimise mobility,\u201d it said. More on South Korea, where cases are approaching 5,000. President Moon Jae-in said the country had begun a \u201cwar\u201d against Covid-19 and placed all government agencies on a 24-hour alert. He said the country was in a \u201ccritical phase\u201d and planned to inject US$25 billion into the virus response. \u201cThe crisis in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province reached its peak and the whole country has entered a war against the infectious disease,\u201d Moon said. He ordered all of the government\u2019s organisations to shift to a \u201c24-hour emergency situation room system\u201d. Australian bank Westpac announces interest rate cut Westpac is first out of the gate to announce interest rate cuts following Australia\u2019s Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates. In an announcement that landed in Guardian Australia\u2019s inbox just nine minutes after the central bank\u2019s decision was revealed, Westpac said it would pass on the full 0.25 point cut to home loan borrowers from 17 March. Importantly, it also said it would reduce the interest rate it charges on certain loans and overdrafts to small business customers by the same amount. The pressure is now on the other banks to match Westpac\u2019s move. South Korea has revised up its figures to report 600 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24-hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 4,812. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut official rates by 0.25% to a new record low of 0.5%. Futures market traders had been banking on a cut, with ASX data showing trading on the exchange implied a 100% chance of a reduction to 0.5%. The probability of a cut had been tracking at between 10% and 20% last week but suddenly surged to 100% on Monday. Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July. Hong Kong announces flight to bring 533 people home from Wuhan Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has announced a charter flight operation to bring home 533 Hong Kong residents from Wuhan. On both Wednesday and Thursday the Hong Kong governments will run two charter flights from Wuhan to bring the people home. There are a number of pregnant women and cancer patients among the group, a press conference in Hong Kong heard today. Lam told reporters: For people who are strands in Hubei, they are quite anxious to return to Hong Kong. If possible, Hong Kong will make arrangements to bring them back. In the past week we have announced we will send charter flights to bring people back to Hong Kong in batches. This week many departments have been working together on this arrangement with support from the Hubei provincial government. Now we are ready. The 533 includes 443 people in the city of Wuhan, while the rest are from elsewhere in the province. Among the 93 they have \u201csome special situations and we have to bring them back as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Lam said the operation \u201cposed a great challenge to the SAR government\u201d. Hong Kong minister, Patrick Nip, said they will be taking care of \u201cemergency cases\u201d, including 14 pregnant women, 11 students needing to take an exam, and 22 residents who need to receive medical treatment in Hong Kong. Some are cancer patients who have to undergo chemotherapy. \u201cThere may be some fine-tuning in regards to the actual numbers,\u201d said Nip. More than 40 staff members from immigration department, and health and other authorities will take the first flight to Wuhan to undertake \u201cpreparatory work\u201d at the airport with Wuhan counterparts. Anyone who has presented symptoms or tested positive will not be allowed to board, and people\u2019s temperatures will be checked before boarding the flight, one of four times each passenger will be checked over the journey. There will be at least two doctors and two nurses for each flight. There will also be special seat arrangements to lower the risk of cross infection. They will then be taken by special transport to a quarantine centre for 14 days. \u201cWe hope that throughout the process everything will be smoothed and we can minimise the public health risk,\u201d said Nip. There are 100 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hong Kong, and Lam said the condition was controllable \u201cbut we still need to stay alert because the virus has no borders\u201d. Authorities have restricted entrants from Japan, South Korea, Italy and Japan, who must go through 14 days quarantine on arrival in Hong Kong. Signs at Hong Kong airport inform arrivals there are hefty penalties, including more than 10 years in jail, for not disclosing having been in the relevant countries in the past two weeks. The Australian government is holding a forum for aged care providers on Friday about preparations that should be taken to protect those most vulnerable to Covid-19. Aged care minister Richard Colebeck told The Guardian: The Chief Medical Officer has written to aged care providers reminding them that while the number of cases of COVID-19 in Australia is still small, services need to plan and be prepared for a change to these circumstances. The Chief Medical Officer has shared references to information with providers to help their planning. The Department is also planning a forum to inform the sector\u2019s preparations for dealing with cases of COVID-19 that might arise. Aged care homes are expected to assess the risk of, and take steps to prevent, detect and control the spread of infections. Infection management, such as isolating infectious consumers, and applying standard precautions to prevent transmission, minimises the risk of transmission. It is also expected that homes develop and implement an effective infection prevention and control program that is in line with national guidelines. The Australian Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Infection in Healthcare set out the requirements for best practice infection control. The world\u2019s top basketball league, the NBA, has told teams avoid high-fiving fans and strangers and avoid taking any item for autographs. In a memo sent to teams on Sunday and obtained Monday by The Associated Press, offered 10 recommendations to players with hopes of decreasing risks of getting the virus \u2013 among them, not taking items such as pens, markers, balls and jerseys from autograph-seekers. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s report: The NBA also told teams that it is consulting with infectious disease experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and infectious disease researchers at Columbia University in New York. \u201cWe are also in regular communication with each other, NBA teams including team physicians and athletic trainers, other professional sports leagues, and of course, many of you,\u201d the league wrote in its memo to teams, their physicians and athletic training staffs. ESPN first reported on the contents of the memo.Some players are already heeding the advice. \u201cCorona,\u201d Bobby Portis of the New York Knicks said as he offered some fist-bump greetings on Monday night before his team faced the Houston Rockets. Portland guard CJ McCollum said that he is taking the matter seriously. South Korea has reported 476 new cases of virus, taking the total in the country to 4,212. We are expecting ant Chinese state media is reporting another seven new cases of of the virus in people returning from Italy. And just on handshaking, Australia\u2019s chief medical, Brendan Murphy, officer says people don\u2019t need to stop doing this in general: Social isolation should be focused on people who have returned from countries or people who have symptoms that might suggest they have picked up this. The same as you would if you ink you have the flu, but if you have come back from SouthKorea or Italy or Iran, then we would certainly want you to practise some social distancing, not go to mass gatherings, and in that context, shaking hands, good hand hygiene is probably best to be avoided. We are not suggesting those practices should be considered by the broader general community. The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, is talking about the low rates of infections for children. One of the very important reassurances for families is about on the evidence we have, limited transmissibility to children, which is very important for families and parents, and then the mild impact on those children on the evidence across the globe. The chief health officer, Brendan Murphy adds to this: I thank the evidence around the world is that when children are infected, they are incredibly mild, in fact so mild that they almost don\u2019t have symptoms. The only child we have had in Australia infected feel that criteria. We are not entirely sure the extent to which they get the virus, but we do know that symptomatic significant disease is not a feature and we have been very little evidence of a significant problem in children, and that is quite different from flu where we often have some quite sick children. So that is a good positive message. The Australian PM is now being asked about whether people should be stocking up at supermarkets. \u201cI can understand the anxiety out there in the community. That is why it is important to get information from the trusted official sources,\u201d Scott Morrison says. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now. He says his teams are concentrating on containment, but says there is no evidence of sustained community transmission in Australia, despite two suspected cases on Monday. There is no reason for people to stop going to mass gatherings on stop going about their normal business. Our focus is now on return travellers. If you have comeback from one of the countries where coronavirus is particularly a high-risk country. He singles out Iran as a country of particular concern. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt, now has the microphone. He says authorities are trying to track close contacts of the people who have been diagnosed in the country over the past day or so, when community transmission is believed to have happened for the first time in the country. Officials from primary care and aged care professions are meeting today to map out a plan and to \u201cmake sure supply lines are maintained in Australia\u201d. Morrison now foreshadowing the expected interest rate cuts when Australia\u2019s central bank, the Reserve Bank, meets later today... and putting pressure on the banks to pass on any cuts to customers There is no doubt that if the bank were to take a decision today on cash rates that the government would absolutely expect the four big banks to come to the table and to do their bit in supporting Australians as we go through the impact of the coronavirus. That is why, if the bank were to go down that path, they would be going down that path. What\u2019s evident is he is trying to set a positive tone...that businesses and the community will bounce back \u201con the other side\u201d of this coronavirus outbreak, but caveats that people must take this seriously. If you don\u2019t work to get the details of a package like this right, then it can have very serious implications, both economically and more broadly, and frankly, we saw that last time, and we don\u2019t intend to repeat those mistakes. Scott Morrison says this is a health crisis with significant economic implications but is different to a financial crisis. There is no problem with the banking system. There is no problem, structurally, with the stability of the economy or things of that nature. This is a health crisis which has had serious disruptive impact on the trouble, the movement of people, and of goods around the world. Morrison touches on possible measures to control the spread of the virus. \u201cIf we had concerns, there is the ability to lockdown aged care facilities, out of protection for the residents in those aged care facilities.\u201d We\u2019re now hearing from Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison. He says he\u2019s spoken to the two of the major supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths, about their response to the virus ... but gives no further details. He encourages people to continue going about their daily business. Last week Australia enacted its emergency response plan to the outbreak. He says border control restrictions and travel will be looked at again today. He confirms there have been 34 cases in the country, 21 of whom have recovered. He calls on Australians to exercise \u201ccommon sense\u201d. I am looking forward to getting to places of mass gathering, particularly if it involves my football team playing, or going to kids\u2019 concerts or doing any of these things. Australians should continue to go about their lives and our normal way and just exercise commonsense. In the same way that you would during a severe winter season where there may have been an outbreak of influenza or something like that. On Monday a WHO team of experts arrived in Iran, to help with the outbreak of coronavirus. To date, 1,501 COVID-19 cases, including 66 deaths, have been reported in the country. The WHO says cases with a travel history to Iran have also been reported from Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, Lebanon, Pakistan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. We are expecting a news conference from the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, shortly. Australia now has 34 cases of coronavirus, after a 20-year-old man from China has been diagnosed with COVID-19. We know that authorities are looking at whether to use additional powers to control the spread of the virus. We\u2019ll bring you coverage of that as soon as it starts. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the cases in the country: 15 of the 34 cases were either Chinese tourists or residents recently returned from China. All 15 have cleared the virus. 10 of the 34 were infected after travelling on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Six of those 10 have cleared the virus and have left hospital. One of the 10 from the ship - 78-year-old James Kwan - died in a Perth hospital on Sunday. It was the first coronavirus death in Australia. Six other cases involve people recently returned from Iran. The final two cases are Australia\u2019s first person-to-person transmissions. One is a Sydney doctor, the other the sister of an infected man who recently returned from Iran. Neither recently travelled overseas. Passengers from Australia, New Zealand and the UK on board a Princess Cruises liner have been met by violent protests in R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean due to fears over coronavirus. The Sun Princess docked early on Sunday with 2,000 passengers on board. It is operated by Princess Cruises, the same company that operated the Diamond Princess which quarantined by Japanese authorities with 3,700 on board in Yokohama after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19. You can read our full story below: In Australia, Queensland Health authorities have said a 20-year-old man from China has been confirmed to have coronavirus. The man is currently in a stable condition in isolation in the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital. The man had travelled to Dubai for at least 14 days before entering Australia, via Brisbane on 23 February. He became unwell on 25 February. Dr Jeannette Young, Queensland Chief Health Officer, said authorities are looking into where the man may have contracted the disease. \u201cThe male has recently returned to Brisbane and we are working closely with relevant authorities to undertake contact tracing,\u201d Young said. \u201cThe male lived with one other housemate in Toowong. We are in contact with the male\u2019s housemate, who is undergoing assessment. Our contact tracing methods are tried and trusted and we will take every opportunity to raise awareness of this case in the community if there has been any community exposure.\u201d There have now been ten people in Queensland with COVID-19, including the three people from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. The most recent case, a 63-year-old woman, remains in isolation in a stable condition at Gold Coast University Hospital. The other eight patients have been clinically cleared by their treating team and discharged from hospital. Overall 33 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Australia. State and territory health departments are giving updates throughout the morning, with a press conference from the federal chief medical officer and health minister, Greg Hunt, expected later in the day. China has announced its daily figures of deaths and infections, with numbers still dropping. There were 125 new confirmed cases (114 in Hubei), and 31 new deaths (all in Hubei). The death toll now stands at 2,943, with a total of 80,151 infections. The daily update also said 47,204 people, or 59% of people diagnosed, have recovered. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer says it has identified certain antiviral compounds it had in development that have the potential to inhibit coronaviruses and is engaging with a third party to screen the compounds, Reuters reports. The company said it hopes to have the results from that screening by the end of March and if any of the compounds are successful, it would hope start testing them by the end of the year. Pfizer\u2019 chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, was one of a number of pharmaceutical executives who met with President Trump at the White House on Monday. This footage shows President Trump appearing to question the length of time it may take to make a vaccine for the coronavirus, and being corrected by Dr Anthony Facui, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In this clip, Trump asks if the influenza vaccine could be used to treat coronavirus. The WHO boss, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the world has \u201cnever seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can be contained with the right measures\u201d. He said containment must be the top priority for all countries and that there is \u201cno one-size fits all approach\u201d. First up let\u2019s have a look at what\u2019s happening on the markets. Yesterday there were big falls on fears of the virus spread, including in. Australia, which plunged more than 2.5% when it opened yesterday. But with widespread predictions the Australian central bank, the Reserve Bank, will cut interest rates today, the market was up almost 1.6% at about 10.40am. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. We\u2019re expecting another busy news day as infections spread outside of China. Before we get started, here are the main points so far: Italy\u2019s death toll has risen to 52, with 1,835 confirmed cases The US has now recorded six fatalities from the virus, with 75 confirmed cases WHO chief says: \u201cWe have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures.\u201d UK supermarkets have drawn up plan to \u201cfeed the nation\u201d as coronavirus spreads. Confirmed cases stand at 39. The virus outbreak has reached more than 60 countries. The level of risk of contracting coronavirus within Europe has been raised from moderate to high. Australia\u2019s chief medical officers will meet on Tuesday to discuss if extra measures are needed to combat outbreak.

Health authorities said with \u201ccontinued vigilance\u201d the chance of widespread community outbreak in New Zealand was expected to remain low. Director-General of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said the affected family needed kindness from their fellow New Zealanders. \u201cI want to say that this is a Kiwi family that has been affected by a virus that is part of a worldwide outbreak.

Morrison is currently trying to pivot away from the government\u2019s economic inaction using the coronavirus outbreak as cover, but the only reason the coronavirus might push Australia into recession is because the economy has been languishing since the Coalition took office in 2013. In the past seven years of Coalition government, including the five years Scott Morrison has been treasurer or prime minister, the Australian economy hasn\u2019t once grown above its trend rate of growth.

The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo on 11 March, exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The government had considered scaling down the ceremony or asking participants to take precautions against the virus, but is making plans to cancel it, according to public broadcaster NHK. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, last week recommended the cancellation of large-scale sports and cultural events after the government drew criticism for its handling of the outbreak. Japan recorded its 1,000th Covid-19 infection on Wednesday, in the western prefecture of Yamaguchi. The total includes 706 passengers and crew from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner. Twelve people have died from the virus in Japan, including six linked to the ship. This week the organisers of two of Tokyo\u2019s biggest cherry blossom festivals said they were scaling back the events to discourage large numbers of people from viewing the flowers when they come into bloom in the capital later this month. While people will still be able to view the famous blossoms along the Meguro river during the day, organisers said the area would not be lit at night. Visitors will also be able to arrange private hanami gatherings in Ueno park, but there will be no mobile food trucks or rubbish bins provided. Many of the most popular attractions in Tokyo have announced closures until at least the middle of the month. The long list of leisure and cultural attractions to have temporarily closed their doors include Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, the Ghibli Museum, Tokyo Skytree and the Kabukiza theatre. A travelling exhibition of 60 paintings \u2013 including Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers \u2013from the National Gallery in London has been postponed until at least 17 March after its Japanese host, the National Museum of Western Art, said it would close. The exhibition is due to move to Osaka in early July. The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku district \u2013 a popular destination for overseas tourists \u2013 will not reopen until 9 March, while the Toyosu fish market, known for its dawn tuna auctions, will be off-limits to visitors until the middle of the month. The outbreak has also hit the capital\u2019s culinary scene, with the conveyer-belt sushi chain Hamazushi saying that diners will now have to order dishes via a touch-screen panel rather than selecting plates as they pass in front of them, NHK said.",

      "body": "<p>The resurrection of Joe Biden is almost complete. In less than a week, the former vice-president has walked out of the tomb of loser candidates into the glorious sunshine of frontrunner greatness.</p> <p>This is a remarkable turnaround by any measure. It also reflects no change in Biden\u2019s qualities or character, and everything about a party with a singular focus on one factor: kicking Trump out of office.</p> <p>Super Tuesday\u2019s super wins for Biden change nothing about his flaws as a candidate but they do underscore the strength of his sales pitch to a Trump-weary world.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s wins also change nothing about Bernie Sanders\u2019 strength as an insurgent critic of the establishment; they may even boost them.</p> <p>But they most definitely blow a hole in his sales pitch to Democrats: that he can build a vast turnout machine to energize the base of the party to beat Donald Trump.</p> <p>Whatever Nevada bestowed on Bernie, the south hath taken away. In Las Vegas, Sanders seemed to build a diverse coalition of supporters. But across the south, the bedrock of the party \u2013 African American voters in Virginia, the Carolinas and Alabama \u2013 made their choice of Biden so clear and loud, the cable networks didn\u2019t wait to count the votes.</p> <p>Until now, the debate among nervous Democrats has been about whether the party\u2019s superdelegates could take a contested convention away from Sanders. Could the party survive that schism, and would Bernie\u2019s fans reconcile themselves to another nominee?</p> <p>But after Tuesday, there\u2019s a vastly bigger question to consider. Could the party really nominate a candidate who isn\u2019t competitive among the black voters who delivered such huge victories in the congressional contests in 2018, and the presidential contests of 2012 and 2008?</p> <p>There is precedent for what we\u2019re witnessing. The last nominee to come back from the dead like this is actually Joe Biden\u2019s friend and former fellow senator in all things foreign relations: John Kerry.</p> <p>Back in 2004, Democrats were on fire for another progressive Vermont firebrand. Howard Dean was building huge numbers of online donors and seemed to be the only candidate with an energized base to take on a deeply-polarizing president. But when big news broke through \u2013 at the time, the capture of Saddam Hussein \u2013 the contest flipped on its head. Kerry won in Iowa and never looked back. Within two months, Kerry had sewn the whole thing up.</p> <p>As the bumper stickers said at the time, Democrats dated Dean but they married Kerry. And the reason for the shift was their desperate desire to beat an incumbent president they loathed. The party wanted to leave as little room for error as possible, even though they knew that Kerry was a flawed frontrunner.</p> <p>Although we like to think that everything is different about Donald Trump, some things look pretty similar. Bush was hated around the world, seemed to be destroying core American values, and counted on the die-hard support of the conservative media echo chamber. Trump is all that on Viagra.</p> <p>It looks like Joe Biden is playing a similar role to John Kerry, and there are good reasons why. After all the turmoil of Trump, voters are understandably anxious to return to normal life. The global threat of a botched response to coronavirus underscores the catastrophic effects of an utterly incompetent, but perfectly sociopathic president.</p> <p>Every single exit poll in the Democratic contests have stressed a single factor: beating Trump. In the states that voted on Tuesday, between 60 and 70% of Democrats <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/politics/super-tuesday-exit-polls/index.html\">said</a> they preferred a candidate who could beat Trump over someone they agreed with on the issues.</p> <p>This is not a subtle choice, which is just as well, because the Trump campaign has all the subtlety of a jackboot.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the collapse of Biden\u2019s competition at the center of the party is not surprising. From Pete Buttigieg to Amy Klobuchar, the signs are clear: Democrats will not look favorably on anyone who interferes with their best chance to beat Trump.</p> <p>What is surprising is the speed of Biden\u2019s turnaround. Just two weeks ago, reliable polling in Virginia <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/virginia/\">suggested</a> the race was tied. The speed and direction of this contest is not good for the Sanders campaign.</p> <p>Which takes us to the dismal news of the night. If you think Sanders fans were disappointed, you should talk to staffers and consultants propping up Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. It feels odd to lump them together: one is plainly trying to buy his way to the nomination, the other has tried to wonk her way to it.</p> <p>However, Bloomberg\u2019s poor showing on Super Tuesday simply reinforced how this contest is no different from all the others that came before it. You can dump a lot of money into the toilet bowl that is TV advertising, but you still can\u2019t ignore the early states and jump straight into Super Tuesday.</p> <p>Warren\u2019s bad night was arguably worse and far less fair on the merits. Bloomberg just wanted to be relevant; Warren wanted to be right. She trounced the field on policy details and on the debate stage. But she wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t turn her fire on Bernie, to consolidate the left behind a candidate with crossover appeal. So she ended up losing her home state of Massachusetts after running one of the very best campaigns of the cycle \u2013 and winning precisely nothing.</p> <p>Sanders himself declared victory with just two states under his belt, one of which is his home state of Vermont. \u201cWhen we began this race for the presidency, everyone said it couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d he said in Essex Junction, Vermont. \u201cWe are going to win,\u201d he continued as his fans chanted BER-NEE, BER-NEE, \u201cwe are going to defeat Trump because we are putting together an unprecedented grassroots multigenerational multiracial movement\u201d.</p> <p>That movement somehow doesn\u2019t include African Americans in the south.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,\u201d Sanders said, before attacking Biden for his vote on the war in Iraq. That was a debate from 18 years ago, which is approximately the age of Sanders\u2019 most enthusiastic voters.</p> <p>By the time Sanders stopped talking, Biden had won another state \u2013 Arkansas \u2013 to add to another five he had already locked up early on Tuesday.</p> <p>Never mind that Biden started his victory speech by mistaking his sister for his wife. Or the way two protesters rushed on stage as he began to fire up the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cFor those who\u2019ve been knocked down, counted out and left behind, this is your campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to report this campaign is very much alive.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s revival after weeks of bad news is his model for the country\u2019s revival after years of Trump news. \u201cWe are better than this moment,\u201d Biden shouted. \u201cWe are better than this president!\u201d</p> <p>He was speaking from a teleprompter, and yet he still screwed up plenty of lines. But Biden still landed some zingers, just as he scrapped out several big wins. As he walked off stage, he was declared the winner in Minnesota.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 victory in California will be a source of hope for his campaign. But scraping out a slender delegate lead is not the same as a multigenerational, multiracial movement to beat Trump. For now the momentum is with Biden: it\u2019s his race to lose once again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Could the party really nominate a candidate who isn\u2019t competitive among the black voters who delivered such huge victories in the congressional contests in 2018, and the presidential contests of 2012 and 2008? There is precedent for what we\u2019re witnessing. The last nominee to come back from the dead like this is actually Joe Biden\u2019s friend and former fellow senator in all things foreign relations: John Kerry. Back in 2004, Democrats were on fire for another progressive Vermont firebrand. Howard Dean was building huge numbers of online donors and seemed to be the only candidate with an energized base to take on a deeply-polarizing president. But when big news broke through \u2013 at the time, the capture of Saddam Hussein \u2013 the contest flipped on its head. Kerry won in Iowa and never looked back. Within two months, Kerry had sewn the whole thing up. As the bumper stickers said at the time, Democrats dated Dean but they married Kerry. And the reason for the shift was their desperate desire to beat an incumbent president they loathed. The party wanted to leave as little room for error as possible, even though they knew that Kerry was a flawed frontrunner. Although we like to think that everything is different about Donald Trump, some things look pretty similar. Bush was hated around the world, seemed to be destroying core American values, and counted on the die-hard support of the conservative media echo chamber. Trump is all that on Viagra. It looks like Joe Biden is playing a similar role to John Kerry, and there are good reasons why. After all the turmoil of Trump, voters are understandably anxious to return to normal life. The global threat of a botched response to coronavirus underscores the catastrophic effects of an utterly incompetent, but perfectly sociopathic president. Every single exit poll in the Democratic contests have stressed a single factor: beating Trump. In the states that voted on Tuesday, between 60 and 70% of Democrats said they preferred a candidate who could beat Trump over someone they agreed with on the issues. This is not a subtle choice, which is just as well, because the Trump campaign has all the subtlety of a jackboot. That\u2019s why the collapse of Biden\u2019s competition at the center of the party is not surprising. From Pete Buttigieg to Amy Klobuchar, the signs are clear: Democrats will not look favorably on anyone who interferes with their best chance to beat Trump. What is surprising is the speed of Biden\u2019s turnaround. Just two weeks ago, reliable polling in Virginia suggested the race was tied. The speed and direction of this contest is not good for the Sanders campaign. Which takes us to the dismal news of the night. If you think Sanders fans were disappointed, you should talk to staffers and consultants propping up Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. It feels odd to lump them together: one is plainly trying to buy his way to the nomination, the other has tried to wonk her way to it. However, Bloomberg\u2019s poor showing on Super Tuesday simply reinforced how this contest is no different from all the others that came before it. You can dump a lot of money into the toilet bowl that is TV advertising, but you still can\u2019t ignore the early states and jump straight into Super Tuesday. Warren\u2019s bad night was arguably worse and far less fair on the merits. Bloomberg just wanted to be relevant; Warren wanted to be right. She trounced the field on policy details and on the debate stage. But she wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t turn her fire on Bernie, to consolidate the left behind a candidate with crossover appeal. So she ended up losing her home state of Massachusetts after running one of the very best campaigns of the cycle \u2013 and winning precisely nothing. Sanders himself declared victory with just two states under his belt, one of which is his home state of Vermont. \u201cWhen we began this race for the presidency, everyone said it couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d he said in Essex Junction, Vermont. \u201cWe are going to win,\u201d he continued as his fans chanted BER-NEE, BER-NEE, \u201cwe are going to defeat Trump because we are putting together an unprecedented grassroots multigenerational multiracial movement\u201d. That movement somehow doesn\u2019t include African Americans in the south. \u201cYou cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,\u201d Sanders said, before attacking Biden for his vote on the war in Iraq. That was a debate from 18 years ago, which is approximately the age of Sanders\u2019 most enthusiastic voters. By the time Sanders stopped talking, Biden had won another state \u2013 Arkansas \u2013 to add to another five he had already locked up early on Tuesday. Never mind that Biden started his victory speech by mistaking his sister for his wife. Or the way two protesters rushed on stage as he began to fire up the crowd. \u201cFor those who\u2019ve been knocked down, counted out and left behind, this is your campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to report this campaign is very much alive.\u201d Biden\u2019s revival after weeks of bad news is his model for the country\u2019s revival after years of Trump news. \u201cWe are better than this moment,\u201d Biden shouted. \u201cWe are better than this president!\u201d He was speaking from a teleprompter, and yet he still screwed up plenty of lines. But Biden still landed some zingers, just as he scrapped out several big wins. As he walked off stage, he was declared the winner in Minnesota. Sanders\u2019 victory in California will be a source of hope for his campaign. But scraping out a slender delegate lead is not the same as a multigenerational, multiracial movement to beat Trump. For now the momentum is with Biden: it\u2019s his race to lose once again. Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist",

There are currently no known cases of the virus among Indigenous Australians, and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho) is working with state and federal health authorities to prevent or control any outbreaks. Dawn Casey, the deputy CEO of Naccho, told Guardian Australia that while there were vulnerable people with multiple health issues in Aboriginal communities, the organisation and its members were well-equipped after receiving several briefings from state and federal governments in recent days. The organisation was well-placed to look after its own people, Casey said. Research following the 2009 swine flu pandemic showed that Indigenous Australians made up 11% of all identified cases and had a \u201csix-fold death rate compared with non-Indigenous Australians\u201d. The federal government has set up an Indigenous advisory committee to respond to Covid-19, which will meet on Thursday. That will be followed by a meeting next week between Naccho, its state and territory affiliates, public health medical officers, and Aboriginal medical directors from the Kimberley, Cape York and other communities. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday that there was \u201ca real vulnerability\u201d if the virus were to reach small Indigenous communities, but confirmed the government was working closely with those communities to aid preparations. In the Northern Territory, about a quarter of the population is Indigenous. Nearly 80% of those people live in remote or very remote communities, with many speaking English as a second language. NT Health is taking proactive steps to protect those people, said its chief health officer, Dianne Stephens. \u201cNT Health is meeting regularly with external organisations to develop and prevent and if required, manage, a Covid-19 outbreak in remote communities,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe plan will take into account the unique needs of our remote communities, including the delivery of messages in local languages.\u201d She did not specify whether steps will be taken to allow individuals to self-isolate, if required, in remote communities where household overcrowding is a significant issue. The government\u2019s current advice says that anyone who may have come into contact with the virus should seek accommodation within three hours of major municipalities in the state, and not visit or return to a remote community, even if they live there. While Stephens acknowledged the risk posed by Covid-19 to those who live with chronic conditions, she said that \u201cit must be stressed that most people who have contracted the Covid-19 infection develop only mild to moderate symptoms and do not require hospitalisation\u201d. In Western Australia, a spokesperson for the health department said that \u201cpreparations recognise the greater vulnerability of Aboriginal people\u201d, and that the department was working closely with the Aboriginal Health Council of WA and Aboriginal community-controlled health services. A working group with representatives from remote communities is working to address concerns around self-isolation. The spokesperson didn\u2019t confirm what alternatives were being considered. The department has not specifically developed resources in languages other than English. Instead, it is directing Western Australians to the federal resources \u2013 which are available in Farsi and Simplified or Traditional Chinese, but not Indigenous languages. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, did not give details of how the state\u2019s response was being tailored to Indigenous communities, but said that Indigenous health organisations were part of the planning process.

Chinese services sector falls to lowest level since GFC The coronavirus lockdown has wiped out demand for shopping, eating out and going to the cinema in China, according to a key survey. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) almost halved for February to 26.5 from 51.8 in January. It was the first drop below the 50-point margin on a monthly basis since the survey began in late 2005.

The company announced it had \u201cmoved to apply a quantity limit on toilet paper packs\u201d limiting customers to four per purchaser to \u201censure more customers have access to the products\u201d.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One advertiser, Novads OU, based in Tallinn, Estonia, ran display ads and webpages for an Oxybreath Pro face mask, which highlighted the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak and referred to a \u201cgrowing sense of panic\u201d before touting the mask\u2019s \u201cunparallelled [sic] protection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another ad for the face mask, which appeared on the CNN website through the Outbrain network, linked to a webpage that claimed the virus was spreading at \u201cthe speed of light\u201d and declared \u201cpeace of mind is priceless during this terrifying time\u201d and urged people to buy the mask while it was still available.</p> \n<p>Yet another ad appeared on the Scottish Sun website and linked to a webpage that resembled a news story.

But the concerns over increasing spread of the virus have prompted England to withdraw Mako Vunipola from their squad for Saturday\u2019s Six Nations fixture against Wales, who expect Dan Biggar to be fit for the match at Twickenham. The England striker Ellen White is still haunted by the VAR decision which ruled out her equaliser, with her toe adjudged to have been in an offside position in their World Cup semi-final defeat against USA last summer. Chris Froome has led the tributes to Nicolas Portal after the sporting director at Team Ineos died aged just 40. Gareth Southgate is optimistic about the possibility of Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford being fit for Euro 2020 and has left the door open for Phil Foden. And Spike Lee, the director and New York Knicks fan, has said he would not be attending another home game this season after a disagreement with Madison Square Garden officials. Business High street banks will issue emergency loans to businesses badly affected by the disruption to the world economy due to the coronavirus outbreak. Barclays, Santander and RBS have begun contacting at-risk customers whose companies might be suffering due to loss of demand and the disruption in supply chains in the wake of China\u2019s economic shutdown. The FTSE 100 is expected to open flat at the opening bell while the pound is buying \u00a31.287 and \u20ac1.148.

Others show more style, twinning the picture with various coronavirus angles. \u201cLife on hold for three months\u201d is how the Mail sums up the possible emergency scenario. \u201cPatients face video check as NHS plans virus wards\u201d says the Times, as medicos are told to limit face-to-face contact.

And if there are any elements of that that we can move more quickly, fine. </p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s not a simple thing to do. You can\u2019t just turn on an infrastructure project, not even necessarily one that\u2019s even under way in terms of ramping up its level of activity.</strong></p> <p><strong> I mean, they will have issues about supply lines as well. And so what you have to focus on is that is the things that can move more readily. </strong></p> <p>We\u2019re dealing with a very time limited issue here, because the demand and supply disruption impacts will appear for a time. </p> <p>And when the health issue is addressed and passes, then the economy will return to what was a more structurally sound basis. </p> <p>And it\u2019s important that when you address the budgetary issues, you also keep in mind the structural integrity of the budget.</p> </blockquote> <p>DO THESE PEOPLE EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T06:18:12.645Z\">at 6.18am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5f3c348f08e1332474edb2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T05:27:50.476Z\">5.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He seems like a good bloke and all, and I will never begrudge anyone doing overtime, but come on people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/7NewsAdelaide/status/1235070750639316992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt\u2019s flat out.

Two, it also said we have deployed three navy ships and multiple defence planes and helicopters to assist with the response.</p> <p>... Three, it sets an extra $20m to further firefighting planes for current and future request.

Six, paying volunteer firefighters up to $6,000 for lost income. Seven, 5m P2 facemasks made available for bushfire smoke, and eight, emergency payments for those who have lost homes due to fires, Mr Speaker. </p> <p>This was important information communicated to the Australian people.

And the real problem here is, Fran, that this is a pattern. </p> <p>We can\u2019t find out when the prime minister went to Hawaii \u2013 the issue there was that they couldn\u2019t even say who the acting prime minister was. It was that lack of scrutiny. </p> <p>We had the <strong>Brian Houston</strong> incident whereby for reasons beyond my comprehension, the prime minister said that was just gossip. </p> <p>And now a month later has confirmed that it\u2019s a fact. And on sports rorts, we have seen an attempt to cover this up, an inquiry by the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff examining the independent Audit Office\u2019s findings, which didn\u2019t even get access to the emails, which didn\u2019t interview any of the prime minister\u2019s staff, and which was designed to come up with a reason to throw Bridget McKenzie under the bus and protect the prime minister.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T23:17:00.832Z\">at 11.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5ecef28f0811db2fb03176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T21:41:34.133Z\">9.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sport Australia will appear in the community affairs Senate estimates from 9am.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T21:44:47.648Z\">at 9.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5ece438f08e1332474eb28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-03T21:40:45.699Z\">9.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This exchange between <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and <strong>Leigh Sales</strong> was particularly unedifying:<br></p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> You won\u2019t release the Gaetjens report into the sports rorts.

The government cited national security to avoid answering a question under FOI about whether Pastor <strong>Brian Houston</strong> was invited to a White House dinner, although you\u2019ve finally admitted this afternoon that he was invited. Why all the secrecy on stuff that on the surface would seem to be not that big a deal?</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Well, those things aren\u2019t that big a deal that you\u2019ve talked about. And I\u2019m always focused on the \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> But why the secrecy then?</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Leigh, I\u2019m just focused on the things that I took to the Australian people. And I know \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> No, no, I just want to know why the secrecy? You\u2019re not answering what I\u2019m asking. </p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Leigh, well I\u2019ve disclosed the issues you\u2019ve referred to. So, I mean, in relation to one of those matters, I mean, I could have been more candid the time about it. I wish I was, but frankly, it wasn\u2019t a big deal \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> But you want, you go back to the trust question, you want Australians to trust you. Does this excessive secrecy help that? </p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> No. Well, I don\u2019t accept \u2013 I don\u2019t accept the assertion you\u2019re putting to me, Leigh. I mean, you\u2019re making accusations like the Labor party \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> I just gave three examples.</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> \u2013 does \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> No, no, I gave you three concrete examples.</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> These are these are minor matters, Leigh, that I don\u2019t think go to the issues you\u2019re talking about \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> That\u2019s my point.</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> If you want to if you want to join in on the accusations that the Labor leader makes in parliament every day, well, you can join in \u2013</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> I\u2019m not interested in what the Labor leader\u2019s got to say.

      "bodyText": "And I am done. I will probably be back tomorrow, but who knows. The great toilet paper crisis of 2020 may take me before then, and I\u2019ll suddenly wake up in a frenzy that I only have 12 rolls left to last me for the next two days and I\u2019ll be forced to take up residence at my local supermarket. A very big thank you to everyone who attempted to keep my sane today. You went above and beyond. There are five sitting days left before the budget. Unless we are all smothered by bog rolls by then. Or the astroid rightly takes us out. Until then, take care of you. The Greens are moving on this. Tony Burke has watched estimates and seen the Gerard Boyce questions. He had some thoughts: The government appointed Gerard Boyce to the Fair Work Commission a little over a year ago. Last year he had to be counselled for making partisan political and anti-union social media posts \u2013 damaging the commission\u2019s reputation as a fair and impartial umpire. In Senate estimates today we learned this same guy decorated his section of the workplace with \u201ca large number\u201d of sexualised anime figurines that were the basis of an avalanche of complaints from his colleagues. What did he do in response to these complaints? He set up surveillance cameras in his office. This is truly bizarre behaviour and the government must explain how they think Mr Boyce is a fit and proper person to hold this important position. I welcome Senator Marise Payne\u2019s acknowledgement in estimates that this behaviour is inappropriate and her undertaking to raise it with Minister Christian Porter. But the conduct revealed today will undermine trust in the professionalism of the commission. The government must act to restore that trust. ...Mr Porter is due to make further appointments to the commission in the coming weeks. Surely he can do better than Gerard Boyce? Nek minute That last post.... *That last post...hand over face emoji* In Senate estimates, Labor has asked the Fair Work Commission about deputy president Gerard Boyce, already a target for his partisan social media posts and now in trouble over inappropriate figurines in his office. FWC general manager Bernadette O\u2019Neill said that \u201cthere were some personal items the deputy president had in chambers that a number of people ... expressed some concern about and considered inappropriate\u201d. My view is the figurines were inappropriate,\u201d she said. O\u2019Neill described the figurines as not nude but \u201cscantily clad\u201d, and when asked if they were anime cartoon girls she suggested this was \u201cnot an inaccurate description\u201d. Boyce had a \u201clarge number\u201d of them, then some were removed due to comments and feedback from colleagues - both senior and junior - and then later the remainder were removed. Labor senators then asked if Boyce installed surveillance cameras in his office as a result of the complaints. O\u2019Neill replied that a couple of months ago this had been raised with Boyce but he claimed the camera was \u201cfake or certainly not working\u201d and committed to remove it. Labor\u2019s Tony Sheldon then asserted that Boyce had a life-size cardboard cutout of Donald Trump in his office and asked whether this would constitute a breach of the code of conduct. O\u2019Neill said: I would need to consider that. It would certainly be unhelpful at the very least and may for some viewers be considered partisan or political in some way ... It would be at the very least unwise.\u201d Look, it may be the eastern European in me, or it may be that I have a particular mind for Michael McCormack stuff-ups, but honestly. The deputy prime minister made a big song and dance about *writing* to the states and territories today, asking them to speed up infrastructure projects. For the good of the nation. This is *literally* what the prime minister Scott Morrison had to say about this yesterday in a press conference, when asked about that very thing: Now, we brought forward $3.8bn worth of infrastructure projects last year. And I sat down together with the infrastructure minister and the urban infrastructure minister with states and territories to identify those elements of the supply pipeline and our infrastructure program to get as much of that into this next, you know, this six months and the next financial year. Now, I\u2019m pleased we did that, because that means those projects are now being accelerated and that will play a part in what can be made to occur. And if there are any elements of that that we can move more quickly, fine. But it\u2019s not a simple thing to do. You can\u2019t just turn on an infrastructure project, not even necessarily one that\u2019s even under way in terms of ramping up its level of activity. I mean, they will have issues about supply lines as well. And so what you have to focus on is that is the things that can move more readily. We\u2019re dealing with a very time limited issue here, because the demand and supply disruption impacts will appear for a time. And when the health issue is addressed and passes, then the economy will return to what was a more structurally sound basis. And it\u2019s important that when you address the budgetary issues, you also keep in mind the structural integrity of the budget. DO THESE PEOPLE EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER? He seems like a good bloke and all, and I will never begrudge anyone doing overtime, but come on people. Where the hell did the toilet paper craze start? Here is that exchange between Penny Wong and Angus Campbell in estimates (the conversation Scott Morrison wouldn\u2019t talk about in QT). Campbell: The Australian defence force in particular needs to, wherever possible, and always be in a non-partisan in both reality and perception. So I am discomfited but I did not see ill-intent in the actions. Wong: Who did you contact? Campbell: And spoke to the prime minister. Wong: Personally? Campbell: Yes. Wong: And you provided your advice? Campbell: Yes. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, actually just had to say this in a press conference, with a straight face: The other message I have for the Queensland community is that if you are required to be isolated for 14 days, we will put supports around you. The Red Cross as well as our health staff will be there to help you. If you are under our instruction, self-isolating for that period of 14 days then of those supports will be there. If you run out of toilet paper the Red Cross will be able to assist you to get toilet paper, there is no need to be stockpiling toilet paper. Those supports are there in place of people currently self-isolating and will be there if you need to self-isolate into the future.\u201d I can. not. anymore. Get. In. The. Bin. \u201cOur\u201d bushfire response, said the Liberal party about an Australian government response: Question time ends. On that last answer: We haven\u2019t got answers to how the sports rorts were allowed to happen, or what process was used to make the decisions, beyond \u2018ministerial discretion\u2019. We don\u2019t know if the minister had the legal authority to make those decisions. If there were no problems with it all, then why the jump to make it all transparent in the future? We don\u2019t know what was in the 136 emails between the prime minister\u2019s office and sport minister\u2019s office. We are not allowed to see the Gaetjens report as it has been declared cabinet-in-confidence. Bridget McKenzie wasn\u2019t asked to resign over the program, she was asked to resign for not declaring a shooting membership (as per the Age and SMH\u2019s Rob Harris\u2019s original reporting) which was found to be a breach of ministerial standards. There has been no word on whether Stuart Robert will be held to the same standard for this: Scott Morrison on that question: The more desperate the Labor party become on this ... the more feeble their accusations become in this place, the more desperate they become and the more extreme language they use. The tone of that question and the mysteries in that question only reflect upon him and his desperation, Mr Speaker. Let\u2019s be very clear. [The auditor general] conducted a serious report into this matter. All the recommendations of that report were accepted by the government and are being implemented by the government. The auditor general who had access to all the material, all the correspondence, they found none of the matter that the member was alleging in that question. None of them in relation to me or my office. The ANAO had access to all these things and they made no such finding. I asked the secretary of the prime minister and cabinet to investigate this matter into this statement of ministerial statements and any possible breaches of the ministerial standards and the minister, when I presented those findings to her, resigned as minister. Now, Mr Speaker, I have taken this matter extremely seriously. We have adopted the recommendations of the report. A further inquiry was initiated and the minister resigned from her post. One side of the House is taking this matter very seriously and has taken the actions that are necessary. The other side of the House is just engaged in a desperate political smear campaign to prop up what is a very feeble leader of the Labor party. Pat Conroy to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Today the sport minister told Senate estimates he met with two staff from the prime minister\u2019s office at 6pm last night to discuss how to handle questions about sports rorts. Did the prime minister know before or after that meeting that the parliament had been misled about sports rorts? Can the prime minister confirm that his office is coordinating the cover-up? Christian Porter gets the call up to dispute the questions: Well, Mr Speaker, that last part of the question clearly is something that would have to be moved by substantive motion, because it is a direct accusation of wrongdoing. Tony Smith: I am going to hear from the manager of opposition business. Tony Burke: Mr Speaker, to the point of order, I am not aware of any precedent which would prevent us asking about the office of the prime minister trying to cover something up. Tony Smith allows the question. The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, has also responded to the national accounts: \u201cPrivate sector investment remains the crucial missing link in building a competitive and growing economy that delivers for all Australians. The national accounts show that business investment has fallen for the past two quarters and productivity, which drives wages growth, has been flat for more than three years. \u201cWe continue to call for an economy-wide investment allowance to boost growth, supercharge the private sector economy and protect Australians as we enter a period of even greater economic uncertainty. \u201cAustralia can\u2019t control the global economy but we can prepare ourselves for unexpected shocks by boosting investment and driving the private economy harder. \u201cThat means making Australian workers the most skilled in the world, making Australia more attractive to investment and an easier place to do business through better regulation. \u201cAn investment allowance will encourage businesses to invest, innovate, export more, help build new industries and give Australians the chance to move into new markets and new sectors.\u201d Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: I refer to the prime minister\u2019s earlier answer. Did General Campbell, the chief of the defence force, speak to the prime minister personally to indicate that he was, and I quote, discomfited by the use of Australian Defence Force imagery in this post? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I talk to the chief of the defence force very regularly, Mr Speaker, and when I have private discussions with the chief of the defence force, I respect those private discussions, Mr Speaker. And when he raises whether these issues or any other issues, I always respect and thank him very much for the advice that he provides me with those matters. And Mr Speaker, we seek to ensure that we reflect in our own actions the advice that we are provided. Now, Mr Speaker, the other thing I have listened very carefully to the chief of the defence force about is the need to ensure that we boost our defence capability in this country. Tony Burke: It is on direct relevance. The information the prime minister is now providing is important, but it is not relevant to the question he was asked. We are simply asking for a straight answer to a simple question. There was no preamble in this at all, and the issue that allowed him to go on attention in the previous question is not present in this question. Tony Smith: I say to the prime minister I agree with the manager of opposition business in this regard. It was a very specific question. I do say to the manager of opposition business, the prime minister is not required to give a yes or no answer, and I believe at the beginning of his answer he was directly relevant to the question. There\u2019s no question about that. But this is not an opportunity to talk about other matters, given that there was no preamble. Oh \u2013 the prime minister has decided he has concluded his answer. Brendan O\u2019Connor has put out this statement: In Senate Estimates today, under questioning by Senator Jenny McAllister, it was revealed that the Minister for Industry\u2019s office requested changes to the final document. Two distinctly different documents were tabled \u2013 a draft and final version, with references to important information about the trends in weather patterns, or the predominant causes of the fires, removed from the publicly available report. The question must be asked, why would the Minister want to change a scientific, CSIRO branded document? There are some significant changes to the document that raise concerns, including the deletion of the following statements: \u201cConsistent with predictions from more than a decade ago, this [bushfire] pattern has shifted with climate change\u201d and \u201cthere is a clear trend in recent decades towards a greater number of very high fire weather days in Spring\u201d. \u201cThe annual national mean maximum temperature was also warmest on record at 2.09 degrees Celsius above average.\u201d \u201cLightning activity has been a predominant cause of ignition for the 2019 bushfires.\u201d \u201cTragically, lives have been lost, properties destroyed, millions of native animals killed, and smoke has covered towns and cities for many days.\u201d The Minister must explain if she was involved in rewriting the CSIRO\u2019s report on climate change. A couple of things on the government ad linked to a Liberal party donation page. The Scott Morrison, Liberal party authorisation was attached to an ad showing what the Australian government was doing (bit of a difference) and the ADF didn\u2019t give permission \u2013 or were consulted \u2013 about its imagery being used. Richard Marles has heard what Angus Campbell has said in estimates and has a question for Scott Morrison: My question as to the prime minister. Did General Campbell, the chief of the defence force, speak personally to the prime minister to object to the use of Australian Defence Force imagery in the Liberal party\u2019s bushfire advertisement the prime minister published on 4 January, and remains published online to this day? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Liberal party did not post an advertisement, Mr Speaker, at all. Mr Speaker, let me read the text of the post that the member referred to. This is what it says. It says, one, we are calling out up to 3,000 defence force reservists to help in fire-affected areas. Two ... thank you, Mr Speaker. Two, it also said we have deployed three navy ships and multiple defence planes and helicopters to assist with the response. ... Three, it sets an extra $20m to further firefighting planes for current and future request. Four, that on top of the $26m which was committed this year, Mr Speaker, five, that means 140-plus aerial firefighting aircraft in operation across Australia. Six, paying volunteer firefighters up to $6,000 for lost income. Seven, 5m P2 facemasks made available for bushfire smoke, and eight, emergency payments for those who have lost homes due to fires, Mr Speaker. This was important information communicated to the Australian people. I observed, Mr Speaker, the requirements of the Australian electoral act that any such videos need a proper authorisation, and that authorisation was provided. And if you need any proof of that, Mr Speaker, a couple of days before I made that post, the leader of the opposition made this post. Listening to people, respecting people ... ... The point being made about the Labor party, Mr Speaker, if they have misrepresented this as a political advertisement, as they stated in their question. Mr Speaker, two days before, the leader of the opposition posted a video on bushfires, and it was titled authorised Anthony Albanese ... So when the leader of the opposition makes posts on bushfires, Mr Speaker, it is authorised by Anthony Albanese, ALP, Canberra. Mr Speaker, the only AAA rating this guy knows about is always about Albanese. Scott Morrison on Tuesday: You can\u2019t just turn on an infrastructure project, not even necessarily one that\u2019s even under way in terms of ramping up its level of activity. They will have issues about supply lines as well. And so what you have to focus on is that is the things that can move more readily. Michael McCormack on Wednesday: Turn on the infrastructure projects. Fiona Phillips to Scott Morrison: On January 6, the prime minister promised $2bn of immediate support for bushfire-affected communities. This week he admitted his rollout has failed and he needs to rephase and revise his efforts. We also learned this week that only 10% of his promised funds have been spent. Why has the prime minister failed to deliver his promise to my bushfire-affected community? Morrison: I think the member for her question and her ongoing efforts in her electorate in relation to the bushfire. As I do acknowledge the efforts of all members across this chamber for the support they have provided in those communities so terribly affected by bushfire. I must take issue with the member on some of the matters she has raised and the misrepresentation made within her question. Of the $2bn that were permitted as part of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, and the fund that was established for that, there were $2bn in the phasing of that expenditure was $500m in this financial year, Mr Speaker. And I can confirm, it was confirmed at estimates, that some $205m of that $500m in this financial year, which was to be spent this year, has already been spent. We are in the first week of March and we committed these funds two months ago and we have spent $200m already in the last two months and $500m is the allocation for this six months to the end of June 30. I can go through them, Mr Speaker: $7m of volunteer payments, a financial counselling support of $5.5m, emergency relief funding of $26m, mental health package of $10.4m ... industry grants program that has already rolled out $43.5m, and this is the program where we need to rephase and re-engineer based on the feedback we have had on the ground to $2.9m that has been provided under the small business disaster recovery grant. Michael McCormack thinks pointing out an MP has spent four terms on the backbench is a compliment. But this is a man who thinks writing a letter to the states begging them to speed up infrastructure spend is sound leadership. I have passed burps with more impact. Josh Frydenberg gets the next dixer as well as the following question from Jim Chalmers. He hasn\u2019t been this popular since accidentally announcing the Turnbull government was considering an emissions intensity scheme. The chief of the defence force, Angus Campbell, has revealed that he raised Scott Morrison\u2019s use of images of defence force personnel in material advertising the government response to bushfires directly with the prime minister. The material had a political authorisation from Morrison, and some posts had a link to donate to the Liberal party. Penny Wong and Kimberley Kitching are asking about ADF policy that images of defence personnel not be used in advertising, display material, websites, or other public mass media without authorisation. Greg Moriarty, the secretary of the department, said that authorisation wasn\u2019t sought or given. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, claimed the government didn\u2019t seek permission because it \u201cwasn\u2019t required\u201d, because it wasn\u2019t an \u201cadvertisement\u201d, it was an information video about the response to the bushfires. Asked for his view, Campbell said: Whenever the ADF or any other apolitical body finds itself between political parties, I am discomfited. I don\u2019t believe there was intentionality in that circumstance, but the ADF should wherever possible be non-partisan \u2013 both in reality and perception. I am discomfited, but I did not see ill intent in the actions. This conversation is an example of where the ADF does not want to be. Campbell confirms that he gave the government advice about the material within hours of hearing about it on morning radio, speaking directly with the prime minister. He won\u2019t go to the content of that advice. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: My question as to the treasurer. I ask him again. Does he still stand by his guarantee that his budget is back in the black? Frydenberg: Mr Speaker, We stand by our commitment to ensure a stronger Australian economy, Mr Speaker. We stand by our commitment to ensure a stronger budget, Mr Speaker. We stand by our commitment to ensure lower taxes, Mr Speaker. We stand by our commitment to create more small businesses, Mr Speaker. We stand by our commitment through this, our most recent MYEFO, and the most recent numbers we saw in national accounts, to ensure that the Australian economy continues to deliver for all Australians. You\u2019ll notice what he doesn\u2019t stand by, though. Tony Burke moves an extension of time to allow Josh Frydenberg to scream into a microphone about the #SmugMug slogan \u2018Back in Black\u2019 Yup Zali Steggall has the independent\u2019s question: I refer to my question of last week. To have a balance sheet in order in the future, has your government now assessed the economic impact of a 3C warmer world to jobs and to coastal and regional communities, and if you have, what are those costs? Scott Morrison: ... I thank the member again for her question, because the question, Mr Speaker, probably would be better put to the Labor party, who do not have a 2030 target. They want to talk about 2050 and they can\u2019t even tell you what they want to happen by 2030. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Given today\u2019s national accounts show the economy grew at a slower pace last quarter than the one before, does he still stand by the guarantee that the budget is back in the black and the economy is back on track? Frydenberg: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I can confirm to the House that this economy continues to grow and in the national accounts today it grew by 0.5% for the December quarter and 2.2% through the year. That is an increase of 1.8% through the September quarter. Mr Speaker, what we have delivered is the biggest tax cuts for more than 20 years, the lowest welfare dependency in 30 years, the first current surplus in more than 40 years, and the first balanced budget in 11 years. No one can take that away from the Coalition, Mr Speaker. The reality is under the Labor party, under the Labor party, when the member for Rankin was running around... Anthony Albanese interrupts with a point of order that the question was about the #SmugMug \u2018back in black\u2019 claim. Frydenberg: I can confirm that the budget is back on track and I can confirm that we will deliver a balanced budget and we will deliver more under our plan compared to the Labor party. Under questioning from the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, defence officials have told Senate estimates the $1.6bn upgrade of the Tindall air base would allow it to accommodate B2 bombers. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and a separate Pacific treaty would not allow the transit of a bomber carrying a nuclear weapon, but then dismissed the question as a hypothetical. Another shoutout to Qantas for doing its job. We have a very, very low bar in this country. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister guarantee that Australia\u2019s three-decade run of unbroken economic growth that began with the former Labor government will survive ... his prime ministership? Morrison: Thank you, I think the member for his question because as he knows, the global coronavirus is a very dramatic situation that has been emerging now for the past seven weeks and a situation which the government has moved quickly to protect the health of Australians and equally we have been meaning to fully understand the economic impacts of this very significant event. This health crisis, Mr Speaker, is different from others that we have seen before, whether it be Sars or Mers, and the economic impacts of the virus are significant and we have seen global financial crisis before, some 12 and 13 years ago, and the economic impact of this crisis was different than what we saw in the GFC. Not a failing of the Australian financial system or the global financial system. They are not the same sort of issues that went to credit flows and economy at the time and Mr Speaker, importantly, during the previous global financial crisis, which had a very muted effect on the Chinese economy, and the Chinese economy at that time during the GFC proved to be extremely important to the Australian economy at that time, Mr Speaker. There are very real differences between the circumstances we face today and previous circumstances. They are all significant and serious issues and that is the way that the government is approaching it in fashioning responses that we will be providing. We will continue to ensure we do everything within the government\u2019s power, not just a need to address the very serious health effects and the risk to the Australian population, as we have been doing, but to also address the very real and significant economic impacts. What this health crisis is doing is disrupting supply chains and disconnecting travellers from where they would otherwise have gone, it is disconnecting exporters from their markets. It is disconnecting and disrupting the global economy. We will engage with that and we will be doing it from a position of strength as the treasurer just outlined. We will be pursuing policies that are responsible, that are targeted, Mr Speaker, and we will get the best possible outcome for the Australian people. We are right into it. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Why did you neglect to mention that the numbers today show economic growth was below the previous quarter, below average, below what he inherited and all before the coronavirus hit? Frydenberg: Thank you for that Dorothy Dixer from the member for Rankin, who we know likes to tax a lot. The reality is this. That in this most recent national accounts for the December quarter, growth was 0.5%, better than expectations, and it\u2019s all through the year growth to 2.2%. Now, in the quarter before the December quarter was the September quarter. What was through the year growth there? 1.8%! The member for Rankin is the only person who thinks that 2.2% is below 1.8%! Frydenberg has forgotten how to use a microphone in the excitement of the national accounts. The chief of the Australian Defence Force, Angus Campbell, has been asked whether the inspector general of the ADF\u2019s investigation into 55 possible incidents in which Australian special forces allegedly breached the laws of war in Afghanistan will be released. Campbell: \u201cIt will be presented to me as commissioning officer of that report. I will have to receive it and absorb what it contains, and assess the degree to which content will be required for further processes of investigation or judicial action. So I can\u2019t give you any guarantee at this stage, other than that I have a desire that Australia understands what has happened as fully as possible. There will be legal and privacy constraints.\u201d Campbell won\u2019t go into what the IGADF might have meant by saying the investigations did not consider the \u201cheat of battle\u201d, citing the IGADF\u2019s independence. It seems every government department is now being taught how to wash their hands. The Australian Defence Force Inspector-General is now appearing in estimates. There will be some very interesting questions asked there. One I missed: It is almost time for QT Jim Chalmers on the national accounts: Annual growth is well below trend, well below what it was before Morrison and Frydenberg took over, and well below what is needed to address stagnant wages and record high underemployment. Today\u2019s data shows that on the Liberals\u2019 watch, before the virus and the worst of the fires hit: Quarterly growth has slowed to 0.5% in the December quarter, down from 0.6% in the previous quarter. Annual growth was well below trend at 2.2% and is a full percentage point below what it was before Morrison and Frydenberg took over. The private economy did not grow at all in the quarter and has stalled over the past year. Annual consumption growth is still at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis increasing by only 1.2% over the year. Total private business investment continues to go backwards, having now declined for three consecutive quarters, and is down 1.4% over the year. As a percentage of nominal GDP it is around its lowest level since the early 1990s recession. Wages growth remains weak, with quarterly growth in average compensation per employee slowing even further in the December quarter. It is clear to everyone but the Morrison government that Australia\u2019s longstanding economic challenges didn\u2019t just appear with coronavirus and they won\u2019t disappear after it. The day so far, as seen by Mike Bowers: I missed this yesterday: *Grandstanding* *Actually evidence from officials* The Australia Institute is not a fan of the GDP growth. From its statement: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm that GDP in Australia is still stuck in the slow lane. The last time the Australian economy grew above its long run trend was back in 2012 when Wayne Swan was still treasurer,\u201d said Dr Richard Denniss, chief economist at the Australia Institute. \u201cThe government\u2019s agenda of cutting taxes over the past seven years has done nothing to boost wages, productivity growth or business investment. Business investment remains low and, with slow wages growth, price growth and consumer spending it is unlikely that any further tax cuts will reverse this trend. \u201cThe recent US experience under President Trump has demonstrated that even massive tax cuts for business does virtually nothing to help the economy. \u201cThe ABS makes clear that two of the biggest contributors to Australia\u2019s GDP growth last quarter were a decline in imports and an increase in business inventories. Both of these numbers provide more evidence of a slowing economy not a growing economy.\u201d The government is looking at the deeming rate for pensioners after the RBA cut interest rates yesterday. Just in case you missed it a few posts back, just weeks after the horror bushfire season ended, Senate estimates has heard that the government funding for the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, which studies bushfires, predicts behaviours and prepares firefighters, will cease from next year. David Wilson told Kim Carr the funding program would end in June 2021. The government accepted that the cooperative research centre\u2019s 10-year funding pools should not be rolled on, as part of a 2015 review into the CRCs. Josh Frydenberg: Today\u2019s national accounts confirm that the Australian economy continues to grow. Australia is in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth. And in today\u2019s national accounts, in the December quarter the Australian economy grew by 0. 5% and 2.2% through the year. This is a step up on the 1.8% through-the-year growth that we saw at the September quarter. And this puts to rest the claim by some (cough, Jim Chalmers, cough) that the Australian economy was softening at the end of last year. The Australian economy remains resilient and continues to defy all those who seek to talk it down. The bushfires have not had a significant effect on the national accounts in the December quarter. But we know that the fires have had a devastating impact on those communities. Most of the economic effect of the bushfires is expected to be felt in the March quarter. The impact of the coronavirus is serious and is ongoing, and is affecting economies the world over. The coronavirus is impacting on the tourism, education, and export sectors, but also disrupting end-to-end supply chains. The measures the government has already put in place are designed to keep Australians safe, and that remains our first priority. As the prime minister has foreshadowed, the government is working on a targeted, responsible and scalable series of measures that are designed to keep business in business, and Australians in jobs. Josh Frydenberg is talking about today\u2019s national accounts figures, saying they show the Australian economy has remained resilient. The figures showed quarterly growth to the end of December of 0.5% and 2.2% for the year. The treasurer said the figures disproved claims that the Australian economy was softening before the bushfires and coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis puts to rest the claim from some that the Australian economy was softening at the end of last year,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cThe Australian economy continues to defy all those who seek to talk it down.\u201d Frydenberg said the figures showed an uplift in consumer spending, and a 2.6% increase in household disposable income over the six months to December. He stressed, however, that the December figures did not reflect the effect of the bushfires, which are expected to be felt in the March quarter figures, nor the coronavirus. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong has clarified that France\u2019s commitment to 60% spending in Australia is on Australian content \u2013 not Australian \u201csovereign capability\u201d (ie spending that creates a domestic industry). Linda Reynolds had described it as a commitment for \u201cAustralian industry capability\u201d \u2013 but apparently capability is synonymous with content, and IS NOT the same thing as \u201csovereign capability\u201d. Very confusing. This means that spending with a list of 137 contractors published by the defence department and Naval Group all qualify towards the 60% floor. The list includes all manner of services that have nothing to do building a submarine industry: language lessons from Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, media monitoring from iSentia, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of SA. Gregory Sammut: We would expect [the industrial] proportion to increase as we get through the design phases. Wong suggests although the government may argue it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d that Australians would be rightly sceptical of the number of services companies, and not industrial providers, that count towards local content. Reynolds suggests that in this case \u201ctransparency is a double-edged sword\u201d because the list reflects the spending in Australia in the early stage of the design phase, with a wider list of suppliers to be expected as the project grows. In estimates, questioning from Kim Carr has found that the government has decided to cease funding to the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre. That centre\u2019s research has helped firefighters predict how a bushfire might react and therefore gives them time to prepare. But after 10 years of funding, the government has decided it\u2019s time to cut it off. Jim Chalmers will respond to Josh Frydenberg and the national accounts figures at 1.30pm. There is something to say about long-term appointments of public servants serving in statutory roles. The auditor general is appointed for 10 years. That gives the complete freedom to do the job without fear or favour. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher winds up sports grants by asking for the cost of the changes between the decisions conveyed to Sport Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, and the revisions at 12.43pm. Luke McCann says he can\u2019t be precise but he thinks the changes added about $2.7m to the program\u2019s cost of the program. \u201cNow we know what happened in the first hours of caretaker,\u201d Gallagher says. The community affairs committee is moving on. It is worth noting that Josh Frydenberg made the same plea to bring forward infrastructure spending to the states in October last year. And again in November. Michael McCormack has written to state premiers asking them to bring forward infrastructure spending to help deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, drought and bushfires. The deputy prime minister said Australia was reeling from \u201cunprecedented\u201d conditions and the federal government was looking to the states to help stimulate the economy with projects ready to go within the next three to six months. \u201c[This will] help in making sure that the economy stays on track to help to make sure that we get through the elements that have beset our economy and our nation since last November,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIndeed we have had unprecedented, unparalleled hits to the economy, hits to the bottom line, but indeed we are well prepared to meet those head on. \u201cWhether it\u2019s big projects such as highways, byways, right down to roundabouts, making sure that we can start work and indeed even finish them then we are able to do that ... as part of this request to the states today.\u201d The minister for urban infrastructure, Alan Tudge, defended the fact that no money from the $4bn urban infrastructure fund had been spent. \u201cAll of the money goes in stages, aligned with the construction schedules \u2013 that is how all of our infrastructure dollars work,\u201d Tudge said. \u201cWe have made the commitment, we have the agreements with the states and territories for the local councils. And when they do the construction, we deliver the money.\u201d The Labor senator Don Farrell goes back to evidence given last week that there was a late-night teleconference between the then secretary of the health department, the former Sport Australia head Kate Palmer, and the chairman, John Wylie. This call happened after Palmer learned of the colour-coded electoral spreadsheets being used to award the grants. This fact emerged after Sports Australia\u2019s appearance last week at the Senate inquiry into the controversy. Farrell wants to know why Sports Australia didn\u2019t mention that call. Luke McCann says late-night teleconferences are not unusual. \u201cIt was not unusual for the chair and the CEO to have phone conversations after estimates,\u201d he says. \u201cNot unusual.\u201d Farrell moves on then to the prime minister\u2019s role in the saga. \u201cThe prime minister is not telling the truth,\u201d the Labor senator shouts. Richard Colbeck deadbats. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your television moment,\u201d Colbeck says, before adding that Scott Morrison has been transparent about the involvement of his office. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong has been grilling the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, about an announcement she made on 24 February that the French defence minister has agreed to a 60% minimum quota of contract value spent in Australia in the future submarine program. Reynolds explains that she and her French counterpart, Florence Parly, discussed the issue at a security conference in Munich in mid-February and Parly proposed the 60% shortly afterwards. She says the commitment will be \u201ccontractually formalised\u201d. Rear Admiral Gregory Sammut says it will be put into the strategic partnership agreement. Wong asks why it took so long to put an \u201cunremarkable level\u201d of Australian content into the agreement, after years of defence industry ministers and officials claiming that putting a floor in would be counterproductive. Sammut confirms that Australia \u201cdid not want to set an artificially low floor until design had progressed until we could see an acceptable minimum level\u201d. Reynolds says it \u201cseemed the right time\u201d because the project \u2013 although still in the early design phase \u2013 is \u201cprogressing well\u201d. Wong says she is glad to see the \u201cbelated\u201d decision to put the content floor into the contract. This is also worth noting \u2013 the September quarter figures have been revised up by the ABS, from 0.4% to 0.6% That 0.2% boost has helped increase the December quarter, and therefore the annual growth rate. Household spending was up (it was Christmas, so that makes sense) with a 0.4% increase, but car sales were 2.4% down. Disposable income was also down \u2013 1.3%. National accounts are out \u2013 the ABS shows GDP grew by 0.5%. That\u2019s better than 0.3% the market expected for the December quarter. Josh Frydenberg will hold a press conference at midday. The Green senator Janet Rice goes to the emails of 11 April. The one at 12.43pm had one project removed and nine added. She wants to know how the change was characterised. Luke McCann from Sports Australia says the minister\u2019s office conveyed there was an error in the spreadsheet. The nine added projects were five late applications and four applications that had been amended from the original pitch. Rice wants to know why the brief was signed on 4 April if the spreadsheet of approved projects kept changing. Has this happened before, Rice asks? Luke McCann says the same thing happened in round one of the program, and the minister\u2019s office said that was an error as well. The Labor senator Don Farrell is back to Sport Australia providing misleading evidence. Luke McCann says a correction is being drafted. Farrell wants to know if he accepts that the agency has suffered reputational damage as a consequence of the saga? The witness accepts that observation. Farrell counsels that quick action is required to avert further reputational damage. At the moment it\u2019s just \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d, Farrell says. Turns out the economy is wobbly enough that the government has sent Michael McCormack out to talk about the need for infrastructure spending. If the answer is McCormack, you really have to ask yourself what is the question? Sarah Martin, who is a saint, went along to the presser and will have a post on that for you very soon, because she knows that there is only so much a blogger must have to bear. The hearing resumes. The Greens senator Janet Rice wonders whether staff from the prime minister\u2019s office gave Richard Colbeck any talking points for the appearance today. \u201cNot anything I didn\u2019t already have,\u201d Colbeck says. Did they discuss how to characterise Scott Morrison\u2019s role in the sports grants saga? \u201cNot specifically,\u201d Colbeck says. The minister adds he\u2019s had a good understanding of Morrison\u2019s role in sports grants since the beginning. Just if you are confused about what emails went where when \u2013 here\u2019s a quick summary. The parliament was dissolved on 11 April. At 8.46am, Bridget McKenzie sent a brief (dated 4 April) and a list of approved projects to Sport Australia. At 12.35pm, another email went from McKenzie\u2019s office to the PMO with different grants (one project was deleted and another nine added). At 12.43pm McKenzie sent that material to Sports Australia. And the advice? Wash your goddamn hands Prevention and care The best way to avoid infections is to practice good hygiene which includes: Washing your hands often with soap and water Using a tissue and covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze Avoid close contact, such as touching others If you share workspaces or telephones, ensure these are cleaned between use Hand sanitiser, tissues and disinfectant wipes are available on the Complete Office Supplies (COS) catalogue and can be used in conjunction with frequent hand washing. Surgical masks in the community are only effective in preventing people who have coronavirus, or symptoms of, from spreading it to others. If you are well, you do not need to wear a surgical mask as there is little evidence supporting the widespread use of surgical masks in health people to prevent transmission in public. If you become unwell and think that you may have symptoms of coronavirus, seek immediate medical attention. Call ahead to book an appointment and let the medical practice know that you think you may have symptoms consistent with coronavirus. Tell your doctor about your symptoms, travel history and any recent close contact with someone who has coronavirus. We are working with our property provider to review preventative hygiene activities across all tenancies. (Pro tip \u2013 you should be washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds \u2013 you can sing the chorus to Jolene, or Landslide or Truth Hurts in your head, if you need a timer.) Ministerial and parliamentary services staff have been issued this coronavirus update: Advice In addition to the advice provided on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) earlier this month, we would like to provide you with an update, given the approach to managing COVID-19 is being adjusted continuously based on advice. The Department of Health website is providing daily guidance and includes information on the current status of the virus, who is at risk and preventative measures that can be taken. As of 3 March 2020, there were 33 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Australia across 5 states. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe conditions such as pneumonia. People with coronavirus may experience symptoms such as fever, flu-like symptoms and shortness of breath. \u2018Michael McCormack is speaking in Canberra\u2019 #horrormovieinsixwords The committee is on a short suspension now so I\u2019ve just listened back to that evidence to make sure I recorded the sequence accurately. Richard Colbeck met with officials from Sports Australia to discuss their appearance before estimates today at about 3pm yesterday. Subsequent to that, at 6pm, two staff from the prime minister\u2019s office came to Colbeck\u2019s office to discuss the appearance. Katy Gallagher asked Colbeck whether the PMO staff were directing him how to answer. Colbeck says \u201cwe had a meeting about the issues\u201d. The minister said given he was representing the government at today\u2019s hearing, it was \u201cincumbent on me to understand the broader situation\u201d. Just on the advice about the operation of the caretaker convention which I flagged in the last post \u2013 given the brief and the spreadsheet about the approved sports grants arrived at Sport Australia (twice) after parliament had been dissolved for the election \u2013 Sports Australia officials have told the committee they requested advice from the health department about the issue of binding another government to a major decision. That advice was sought in the \u201clate afternoon of April 11\u201d. Richard Colbeck said staff from the prime minister\u2019s office came to his office last night to discuss the appearance by Sport Australia before estimates today. Katy Gallagher asks whether Colbeck advised Scott Morrison\u2019s staff about Sport Australia officials providing misleading evidence to the inquiry last week. Colbeck said they were already aware that had occurred (although he won\u2019t acknowledge the evidence was misleading \u2013 Colbeck says it\u2019s a difference in evidence). Sport Australia officials also say they took advice about receiving material from the minister\u2019s office after the parliament had been prorogued. It is also national accounts day \u2013 which means the economy will be very much the focus over the next few hours. This will be for the December quarter, before the bushfires and coronavirus really took hold, but they will give a decent indication of the state of the economy before those shocks. The RBA\u2019s emergency rate cut decision points to it not being great. Richard Colbeck acknowledges that staff from the prime minister\u2019s office were at the meeting yesterday with Sport Australia to prepare for today\u2019s appearance. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher is cross because Sports Australia officials have arrived at estimates without key documents, including the ministerial brief about the approved grants and the emails: Are you withholding information from this committee? It would seem you are very conveniently underprepared. The officials acknowledge that they met yesterday with the minister and advisers about today\u2019s appearance but say they weren\u2019t given any instructions to withhold material. The minister at the table, Richard Colebeck, says he was made aware yesterday that Sport Australia had provided incorrect evidence last week. Gallagher wants to know why Colebeck didn\u2019t correct the record. He says that\u2019s up to Sports Australia, and they should correct the record promptly. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Gallagher declares. Colebeck said he saw it as a \u201cdifference in evidence, not a case of misleading the Senate\u201d. Sport Australia officials are now up before estimates. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher starts by pointing out that the ANAO has given a materially different account about the briefs and correspondence backwards and forwards between the minister\u2019s office and the agency in the lead-up to the election last year. Luke McCann from Sports Australia acknowledges the agency gave the Senate incorrect information last week, when officials appeared before an inquiry into sports grants. Gallagher is not amused, particularly given there has been no correction of the record by Sports Australia. Does the agency understand its obligation to the Senate? McCann says he does understand those obligations and now acknowledges the error. (Background: the error was failing to acknowledge there was a brief with attachments sent to the agency after noon on the day the election was called.) Gallagher asks McCann why two emails were sent on 11 April, one at 8.46am (which Sports Australia has acknowledged) and one at 12.43pm (which it didn\u2019t mention last week). McCann says the minister\u2019s office said there was \u201cerrors\u201d in the earlier brief, hence the second email at lunchtime. Ten projects changed between the two emails. Sport Australia is about to enter Senate estimates. Oh, and parliament has begun. We would pay attention to the chamber but there is not exactly a huge legislation agenda at the moment, so what\u2019s the point? The Green senator Richard Di Natale, who is a medical doctor, is drilling right down in this morning\u2019s hearing. He wants to know why the rate of infection in Italy is slowing, given that the country is in a phase of community transmission. The chief medical officer says that\u2019s because containment strategies are working. Di Natale is puzzled by this. Generally in a pandemic, he says, containment doesn\u2019t really work. Brendan Murphy says containment does have a positive impact on how the illness spreads. It works to some extent, is his rationale, and you\u2019ll take some extent over no extent. Di Natale wonders whether there should be a move to cancel or bring forward elective surgery in hospitals, saying that\u2019s already happened in Queensland. Murphy says that\u2019s in the national plan. The CMO says if a state has capacity to shuffle a surgical list, they should do it. Di Natale circles back to mortality rates. Who is dying? The CMO says the deaths are mainly older people and people with comorbidities. Children only suffer a mild version of the virus. Di Natale asks is there sufficient testing capacity in the event of large-scale community transmission in Australia. The CMO says that\u2019s being looked at closely. \u201cWe will definitely need to expand testing capacity,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a large outbreak you might need thousands of tests every day, and those plans [to expand capacity] are well advanced.\u201d Scott Morrison praised Qantas for the second day in a row, while speaking this morning to Alan Jones about the planned \u201ceconomic boost\u201d that is definitely not a stimulus. It\u2019s about the cash flow of particularly small and medium-sized businesses. It\u2019s about keeping people in jobs, keeping businesses in business. Because on the other side of this, because this is not, I mean the economic effects here are very significant, but it\u2019s not the same as the global financial crisis, because on the other side, when the virus works its way through, the economy will pick up. And so we want those businesses to be there for that, for that bounce back. And I want them to bounce back strongly. So we\u2019re designing those measures to do that, so they can work immediately. I mean, these things can be difficult. And so we\u2019re getting the design right, and we\u2019re working closely, as you could see yesterday, we worked very closely with the Reserve Bank. And again, I want to thank the four big banks for passing on those rate cuts. I asked them to do it, they did it. I thank them very much for doing that. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened in about five years \u2013 the banks passed on the rate cuts. And it was just like Qantas showing up and doing the right thing by Australians. So, what people can see is everybody\u2019s working together here. Everyone\u2019s working together here to get Australia through it. We will get through it. We will get right through this. And we\u2019ll bounce back on the other side really strongly. As Joe Aston pointed out in the Fin today, the three evacuation flights would have cost the airline about $2m in unmatched costs \u2013 but the amount of free publicity it has received, including multiple shout-outs and snaps from the prime minister, would more than have made up for it. It is also not unusual for a country\u2019s national carrier to step in to evacuate that country\u2019s citizens. I was living in South Korea when American Airlines and BA made arrangements to get out American and British citizens when shiz was getting strange with North Korea. But yes, let\u2019s get all flag wavey over this. Brendan Murphy is asked by the Liberal senator Dean Smith why some countries are under-reporting infections. The chief medical officer said in the case of Iran, it\u2019s likely to be a combination of a less advanced medical system and the mild nature of the illness. He said the penny probably dropped in the country when there were a large number of pneumonia cases presenting, and from there, it\u2019s a matter of trying to catch up. Murphy says the working assumption about Iran under-reporting the number of cases is that the death rate in the country compared with infections is so much higher than in other places. The Greens senator Richard Di Natale is pursuing under-reporting, given that most people only suffer mild symptoms. The CMO says there is likely to be under-reporting in China and elsewhere, but he says coronavirus is more infectious than Sars and Mers, and more infectious than the flu. Di Natale notes it is difficult to calculate an accurate mortality rate in a situation where a lot of people don\u2019t even know they are sick. The chief medical officer agrees with that assessment. The chief medical officer says officials are \u201cdoing a lot of planning\u201d about potential transmissions in Indigenous communities. He says the risks are different in metropolitan areas compared with regional and remote areas. Brendan Murphy says a coronavirus infection in isolated communities could have \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d. He says Fifo workers present particular risks in transiting in and out of communities. The Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy tells Murphy some of the official language about the outbreak is causing alarm in Indigenous communities. The chief medical officer acknowledges that, and he suggests elderly people are also alarmed. Murphy says there is a lot of anguish behind the scenes about getting the communication right. Australians need to be attentive but not alarmed, he said. A lot of the messaging at the moment is about preparing the community for step changes in infection rates: \u201cIt\u2019s a balance between being open and honest with the community but there is no value in sensationalising.\u201d The definitely-not-a-stimulus-don\u2019t-call-it-that-it\u2019s-a-boost the government is planning, is expected to be announced some time in the next few days. All we know is that it won\u2019t be in the form of cheques \u2013 the government has made a big deal of calling it \u201ctargeted, modest and scalable\u201d. We don\u2019t know what industries will be receiving it but tourism and higher education would be good bets. Scott Morrison is very, very intent on not referring to it as a stimulus. Partly because the government still needs to talk up the economy \u2013 that is one of its jobs \u2013 and you can talk your way into a recession, which is good for no one. But at the same time, the government has also boxed it way into a corner by already claiming a surplus it may not be able to deliver, and you are not supposed to need to stimulate a surplus economy. The coffee in the Smug Mug (the Back in Black Liberal party merchandise which is suddenly \u201csold out\u201d) must be tasting increasingly bitter. The CMO has given the latest statistics on infections. He says there are now more than 90,000 cases globally and 3,078 deaths. Italy has 2,036 cases, Iran 1,501 cases and 66 deaths, Korea 4,212 cases, France 178, Germany 157. Australia has 40 cases, with 15 in NSW. Brendan Murphy notes again that Iran is likely to be significantly understating the size of its outbreak. He says the government will reconsider the various travel advice today. The CMO says the risk of people from mainland China (outside of Hubei) transmitting the virus is likely to be less at the moment than people from Iran. We expected Sports Australia to kick off estimates this morning, but they are on standby while the chief medical officer provides a briefing and answers questions about coronavirus. Brendan Murphy has started with a general outline. He says there are now \u201csignificant outbreaks\u201d in a number of countries and growth of the illness outside of China \u201chas accelerated\u201d. He tells the committee the number of cases in Iran is seriously understated. He says there has been limited community transmission in Australia and there are significant concerns about potential transmissions in aged care facilities. \u201cThis disease is going to be with us for a while,\u201d Murphy says. But he tells people to calm down on toilet paper hoarding. That isn\u2019t \u201cproportionate or sensible at this time\u201d, the CMO says. Anthony Albanese also had some advice about dealing with coronavirus, at a personal level: People need to keep calm and wash their hands, effectively. I\u2019ll add \u2013 STOP STOCKPILING TOILET PAPER. We make toilet paper in Australia. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF TOILET PAPER. Calm your farms, people. Anthony Albanese was on ABC radio RN, talking to Fran Kelly. This is where Labor\u2019s attack line will land today: The Audit Office said to Senate estimates this week, gave evidence on oath, Brian Boyd said that it was the prime minister\u2019s office was the reason why a project was removed and another one added after the parliament had been prorogued. This was on the morning of the 11th of April. And then after that there were further lists go to the prime minister\u2019s office from Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office. Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office then sent, that afternoon, another list that added nine projects and took one out. The fact is that what we have seen here is 136 emails from the prime minister\u2019s office and from Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office to each other. And the prime minister won\u2019t release those emails, won\u2019t release that information. The prime minister\u2019s office has been in this up to the neck. And that is obvious for all to see. And the real problem here is, Fran, that this is a pattern. We can\u2019t find out when the prime minister went to Hawaii \u2013 the issue there was that they couldn\u2019t even say who the acting prime minister was. It was that lack of scrutiny. We had the Brian Houston incident whereby for reasons beyond my comprehension, the prime minister said that was just gossip. And now a month later has confirmed that it\u2019s a fact. And on sports rorts, we have seen an attempt to cover this up, an inquiry by the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff examining the independent Audit Office\u2019s findings, which didn\u2019t even get access to the emails, which didn\u2019t interview any of the prime minister\u2019s staff, and which was designed to come up with a reason to throw Bridget McKenzie under the bus and protect the prime minister. Sport Australia will appear in the community affairs Senate estimates from 9am. This exchange between Scott Morrison and Leigh Sales was particularly unedifying: Sales: You won\u2019t release the Gaetjens report into the sports rorts. Your office tried to conceal when you were on holidays in Hawaii in December. The government cited national security to avoid answering a question under FOI about whether Pastor Brian Houston was invited to a White House dinner, although you\u2019ve finally admitted this afternoon that he was invited. Why all the secrecy on stuff that on the surface would seem to be not that big a deal? Morrison: Well, those things aren\u2019t that big a deal that you\u2019ve talked about. And I\u2019m always focused on the \u2013 Sales: But why the secrecy then? Morrison: Leigh, I\u2019m just focused on the things that I took to the Australian people. And I know \u2013 Sales: No, no, I just want to know why the secrecy? You\u2019re not answering what I\u2019m asking. Morrison: Leigh, well I\u2019ve disclosed the issues you\u2019ve referred to. So, I mean, in relation to one of those matters, I mean, I could have been more candid the time about it. I wish I was, but frankly, it wasn\u2019t a big deal \u2013 Sales: But you want, you go back to the trust question, you want Australians to trust you. Does this excessive secrecy help that? Morrison: No. Well, I don\u2019t accept \u2013 I don\u2019t accept the assertion you\u2019re putting to me, Leigh. I mean, you\u2019re making accusations like the Labor party \u2013 Sales: I just gave three examples. Morrison: \u2013 does \u2013 Sales: No, no, I gave you three concrete examples. Morrison: These are these are minor matters, Leigh, that I don\u2019t think go to the issues you\u2019re talking about \u2013 Sales: That\u2019s my point. Morrison: If you want to if you want to join in on the accusations that the Labor leader makes in parliament every day, well, you can join in \u2013 Sales: I\u2019m not interested in what the Labor leader\u2019s got to say. I\u2019m putting to you three examples. Morrison: Well, there\u2019s an uncanny resemblance between the allegations, Leigh. The definition of trust, according to Merriam-Webster, is \u201can assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something. One in which confidence is placed.\u201d It\u2019s something that is the recipient\u2019s to lose. And it\u2019s what Labor is targeting as the sports rorts train rolls on. Scott Morrison\u2019s interview with Leigh Sales on 7.30 last night showed the prime minister now has a habit of using the line \u201cI could have handled it better\u201d when being forced to admit something he had previously deflected or straight-out denied. It was what he said when he came back from Hawaii during the bushfire crisis, after his office spent days replying to questions about the holiday with \u201cwrong\u201d and it\u2019s what he has said in regards to Brian Houston\u2019s White House invitation, which he admitted yesterday, after months of dismissing it as \u201cgossip\u201d. Now Labor is targeting Morrison over his continued insistence his office had nothing to do with the awarding of the grants, despite 136 emails passing between his office and then sports minister, Bridget McKenzie. And then there is the Brian Boyd of the ANAO evidence at Senate estimates, that a project was removed and another added to the sports grants list, \u201cat the direction\u201d of the prime minister\u2019s office. And yet, we continue to hear that there is \u201cnothing to see here\u201d. Boyd: No, the minister\u2019s office maintained the spreadsheet at all times. We mentioned, I think when we spoke to the Senate select committee, that there were representations, including sometimes from the prime minister\u2019s office, and, as we said then, not all of those representations led to a change. Sometimes they did. For example, when I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46 am version, that was at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office. But of the changes made later that day, for the 12.43pm version, none were evident as being at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office rather than the minister\u2019s office making the changes. When Sales questioned Morrison about the discrepancy between what he is saying and what the independent auditor general\u2019s office has said, he accused her of parroting opposition attack lines. No prime minister, they are legitimate questions. Katharine Murphy covers that point off in her analysis of the last few days here. Morrison says he wants to concentrate on the \u201cbig\u201d issues impacting Australia right now. That includes coronavirus and the need to inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Except, the government can\u2019t even call it stimulus. Instead, it is a \u201ctargeted, modest and scalable\u201d economic boost. We\u2019ll cover that, plus everything else as the day rolls on. You have the Canberra team, as well as the extended Guardian brains trust at your disposal. I am almost through my third coffee, so we are almost there. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Two days before Larry Kudlow was announced as a member of the White House taskforce on coronavirus, the director of the National Economic Council declared coronavirus \u201ccontained\u201d in the US, despite a plethora of data that suggested it was not. \u201cI won\u2019t say airtight, but it\u2019s pretty close to airtight,\u201d Kudlow told CNBC, swaddling himself in a comforting narrative that was probably destroyed in his first meeting with the taskforce. Kudlow\u2019s public statements on the level of threat to the US posed by the virus outbreak sit uneasily in the minds of health experts warning of its severity, but they probably rested far more peacefully in the White House, where the favored message seems to be: there is nothing to see here. There have been seven deaths from coronavirus in Washington state and many more positive cases are expected in the US, prompting public health experts to warn that honest, measured communication is of the utmost importance. But that has not been the case with the Trump administration\u2019s response so far, which has been marked by late action, delays, a lack of resourcing on tests, attacks on Democrats for warning of the seriousness of the crisis and, critics say, a politicized emphasis on placating the political concerns of the occupant of the Oval Office, rather than pursuing effective virus containment policy. Michael Carome, director of the Health Research Group at Public Citizen, a not-for-profit consumer advocacy organization, said if the government\u2019s response was not transparent, it could make the problem worse by sowing mistrust. \u201cPeople may do things that undermine the public health response to it because they may not believe what the government is saying, they may not follow instructions for how they protect themselves and respond to disruptions that may result,\u201d Carome said. Carome also drew a line between Trump\u2019s communication style \u2013 which is often brash, unreliable and incoherent \u2013 to the traditionally measured, fact-based style of health experts. Last week, a senior health department official alleged that she was retaliated against after raising concerns that staff had been sent to assist Americans evacuated from China because of coronavirus without proper training or appropriate protective gear. \u201cIf efforts are being made to muzzle them, to control messaging so that it suits the political needs of the administration, that\u2019s ultimately going to endanger the public,\u201d Carome said. The nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, hinted that publicly discussing facts while keeping the president happy was easier said than done. \u201cYou should never destroy your own credibility,\u201d Fauci, told Politico. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to go to war with a president. But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.\u201d For 35 years, Fauci has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health. He said he was not being muzzled from speaking about the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 which he does not expect the US to escape \u201cunscathed\u201d \u2013 but that he has been told to run interviews past the vice-president\u2019s office for clearance. Fauci was one of several top public health officials reportedly told to run their messaging past Pence, after a CDC official warned the spread of coronavirus was inevitable. The CDC\u2019s announcement triggered a dramatic response from the media and public health officials across the US, but Trump insisted everything was fine. Last week, Trump tweeted: \u201cCoronavirus is very much under control in the USA.\u201d He has repeatedly claimed warmer weather will cause coronavirus to disappear, though it is too early to know if that\u2019s true. The day after the CDC said coronavirus\u2019s spread was inevitable, the president said it wasn\u2019t. Over the weekend, he said Democrats were politicizing the crisis, and compared it to impeachment as their latest \u201choax\u201d. Political appointees of the Trump administration, and the president\u2019s children, have lined up to defend Trump\u2019s response. The acting white house chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told people to turn off the television and ignore media reports about the virus last week. Mulvaney said the media had started paying attention to coronavirus because \u201cthey think this is going to be what brings down the president\u201d.

If a health crisis is seen as a political issue, it can affect support for emergency funding to fight the outbreak and policies meant to stem its spread. Myers highlighted how only Democrats signed on to a congressional letter asking for more information about faulty coronavirus test kits distributed by the CDC, a demonstrable problem that has even been raised by a few conservative media commentators. \u201cOversight over something like a public health emergency should very much be a bipartisan thing,\u201d Myers said. \u201cRepublicans can ask for information about these kinds of topics without attacking the administration or attacking the president.\u201d Myers\u2019s book Pandemics and Polarization examined how a Republican-held Congress\u2019s distrust of Barack Obama\u2019s administration affected the government\u2019s response to the Zika virus. Months before the 2016 presidential election, Republicans held up $1.1bn in funding to the outbreak by inserting provisions that would restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and reverse a ban on flying the Confederate flag at veterans\u2019 cemeteries. \u201cThis is why people hate Congress,\u201d Senator Tim Kaine said at the time.

Despite a wave of support from Republican lawmakers, there has been pushback to Trump\u2019s subdued messaging in the conservative magazine National Review.

The tourism industry has been hit hard by the global spread of the novel coronavirus, which has encouraged many people to cancel their holiday plans, especially as health agencies recommend social distancing and self-quarantine measures to combat the virus. Those people who still wish or need to travel, however, may find themselves the beneficiaries of the deep discounts currently being offered across the sector.

The best deals, though \u2013 at $73 per day \u2013 were with the beleaguered Princess Cruises. The coronavirus crisis has dovetailed with the bushfire crisis locally, leaving some areas crying out for visitors \u2013 and tourism operators organising package deals to entice people back. At Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island in South Australia, for example, SA Tourism\u2019s #BookThemOut campaign has seen companies band together to offer food, wine, accommodation and adventure packages to help the industry recover.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond avoiding overseas travel, 15% of those involved in a separate UK household survey by Retail Economics said they were avoiding public transport.

      "bodyText": "Japan has lifted an evacuation order for parts of a town in the shadow of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, weeks before the area is to host the start of the Olympic torch relay. Futaba, 2.4 miles (4km) west of the plant, has been almost deserted since the nuclear meltdown nine years ago, while other areas in the region have mounted a partial recovery after the government declared them safe for residents. The start of the relay\u2019s Japan leg at the end of the month is supposed to showcase Fukushima\u2019s recovery from the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, but some residents say their home towns may never return to normal. Futaba\u2019s 7,000 residents were forced to evacuate after the March 2011 disaster, which was triggered by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan\u2019s north-east coast. The reopening of a 1.5 sq mile area of Futaba means reconstruction workers can stay in accommodation near the railway station, but residents will not be able to return for another two years, when its water supply and other infrastructure will have been restored, according to local officials. They will be able to enter and leave for short visits without going through security, and will no longer need to wear protective clothing, but will not be allowed to stay overnight. While the coronavirus outbreak has prompted speculation that the Olympics could be cancelled or postponed, Japan\u2019s government is keen to promote Tokyo 2020 as proof that the region, including Fukushima, has recovered from the triple disaster. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with emotion as we finally bring part of our town operations back to our home town,\u201d said Futaba\u2019s mayor, Shiro Izawa. \u201cI pledge to push forward with our recovery and reconstruction.\u201d The domestic leg of the torch relay is due to begin on 26 March at J-Village, a football training complex that functioned for years as a logistics hub for crews working to control and decommission the damaged nuclear plant 12 miles away. Although organisers have said the route is subject to change, the torch is scheduled to pass through Futaba later the same day, before being taken through other parts of Fukushima prefecture over the following two days. \u201cIn addition to building excitement across the country ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Games and promoting the Olympic values, the Olympic torch relay aims to demonstrate solidarity with the regions still recovering from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami,\u201d the organisers said last month. More than 160,000 people were forced to flee their homes during the Fukushima meltdown. Many have decided not to return, despite government reassurances on safety, and many of those who have returned are older residents. Futaba is no exception, with just 10% of residents saying they intend to return. Some, particularly those with young children, are concerned about radiation levels, while others have built new lives elsewhere. Yuji Onuma, a Futaba resident, said recent work to repair streets and decontaminate the town centre was designed to give the world a false impression before the Olympic torch relay. \u201cI wish they wouldn\u2019t hold the relay here,\u201d Onuma told Reuters. Pointing at workers repaving a road expected to be on the relay route, he added: \u201cTheir number one aim is to show people how much we\u2019ve recovered. I don\u2019t think people will understand anything by just seeing cleaned-up tracts of land.\u201d Radiation readings in the air taken in February near Futaba\u2019s railway station were around 0.28 microsieverts per hour, higher than the government-set target of 0.23 microsieverts an hour. Another part of the town had a reading of 4.64 microsieverts per hour on the same day, meaning a person would reach the annual exposure upper limit of 1 millisievert, recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, in just nine days. The torch is due to pass through the village of Iitate the following day, but campaigners this week described the relay as inappropriate and warned they had found radiation \u201chotspots\u201d in the village. In a survey of 69 locations along and around the proposed relay route, the grassroots group the Radioactivity Monitoring Centre for Citizens said it had found 44 sites with radioactive levels above 0.23 microsieverts per hour, including one \u201csevere hotspot\u201d of 0.85 microsieverts per hour along the torch relay route. The discovery of hotspots near J-Village by Greenpeace Japan at the end of last year prompted the environment ministry and the nuclear plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, to perform extra decontamination work. While some independent monitors have said the discovery of isolated hotspots does not present an accurate picture of the overall situation in Fukushima, Nobuyoshi Ito, an Iitate farmer, said the civic group\u2019s findings cast doubts on government claims that decontamination work had been a success. \u201cRadiation exposure for runners passing along the route may not be very high, but the overall situation in places like Iitate is severe,\u201d Ito said. \u201cLevels are several times to as many as 20 times higher in the village than they were before the disaster, and people who moved back have to put up with that 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\u201d Of Iitate\u2019s pre-disaster population of 6,100, only 1,200 people have returned, Ito said. \u201cThe small number of people coming means that the nuclear disaster is not over yet.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Johan Neyts, who will carry out the analysis in Leuven, said he expected results within a fortnight of the shipment arriving in Belgium.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation hopes that there are one or more molecules among the 15,000 substances that can also inhibit the new coronavirus.

Writing on the website\u2019s foundation Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest private individuals, said he believed there were promising efforts being made to find vaccines \u201cready for larger-scale trials as early as June\u201d. He added: \u201cDrug discovery can also be accelerated by drawing on libraries of compounds that have already been tested for safety and by applying new screening techniques, including machine learning, to identify antivirals that could be ready for large-scale clinical trials within weeks.\u201d There are no proven treatments for coronavirus but a few drugs are already being tested on humans in China. One, Kaletra, has previously been used to treat people with HIV. It has been tested on 200 people so far and results are expected in about a week. A second, Remdesivir, was tested during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018 but it was found to be insufficiently effective. Both trials were expedited by the World Health Organization. As they have been approved for other conditions there will not need to be the usual safety tests on animals and humans.",

Despite the unprecedented attempts at isolation and containment, with about 50 million people locked down and economic activity virtually halted in China, cases have spiked in recent weeks. Sixty-seven countries are now reporting a total of more than 8,000 infections outside China. The World Health Organization has been wary of using the word pandemic, but last week it advised countries to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/24/who-tells-countries-prepare-coronavirus-pandemic-too-soon-to-make-call/\" title=\"\">prepare as if one were imminent</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-live-updates-who-global-recession-fears-update-latest-news\">Coronavirus live updates: first case confirmed at European Union offices</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the same day, in a rare bit of good news, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced it had already received the first candidate for a vaccine against the novel virus, now being called Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 produced by a company called Moderna \u2013 and that trials could begin as early as April. Anthony Fauci, the institute\u2019s director, said that just three months between discovery and trials was a new record, noting that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/drugmaker-moderna-delivers-first-coronavirus-vaccine-for-human-testing-11582579099\" title=\"\">\u201cnothing has ever gone that fast\u201d</a>, before dropping the other shoe: even with the rapid start, completing the trials and scaling up production would take until at least next year, and there was no guarantee it would even get to that stage.</p> <p>Vaccines remain science\u2019s best \u2013 and virtually only \u2013 weapon against viruses, and yet the timeline for developing a vaccine, measured in years, seems hopelessly mismatched to a pandemic, which can spread, kill and often disappear in a matter of weeks or months. The modern record doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence. There have been multiple international viral outbreaks over the past two decades \u2013 Sars-CoV-1, Mers, Zika, Ebola \u2013 that all provoked similar races to produce a vaccine. Yet to date only the efforts on Ebola have been successful, with a vaccine <a href=\"http://investors.linkp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/newlink-genetics-announces-fda-approval-ebola-vaccine-v920\" title=\"\">being approved last year</a>.</p> <p>Why is this? Vaccines for epidemics have to overcome the same scientific and regulatory hurdles as other promising treatments, but they also suffer from a near total lack of interest from the markets that drive the pharmaceutical industry. Only a few massive companies retain the ability to develop and produce a vaccine from start to finish, partly because of the expense and the timescales involved and partly because they\u2019ve consolidated the patents on manufacturing processes \u2013 a situation analysts openly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-brings-light-to-the-35-billion-vaccine-market.html\" title=\"\">call an oligopoly</a>. A success for one of these companies is a treatment for a widespread, persistent disease that they can sell every single year in perpetuity. The last industry blockbuster was Merck\u2019s HPV vaccine Gardasil, in development for nearly 20 years, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689551/\" title=\"\">released in 2006</a>, and still bringing in over \u00a31bn annually. There is no way to easily apply their slow-burn research and profit model to an epidemic. As the leader of the UK\u2019s Ebola response, Adrian Hill, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/ebola-outbreak-big-pharma-failed-victims-why-9716615.html\" title=\"\">told the Independent in 2014</a>, \u201cUnless there\u2019s a big market it\u2019s not worth the while of a mega-company \u2026 There was no business case to make an Ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most.\u201d</p> <p>Even if research begins during a pandemic, the unpredictable nature of outbreaks means work is often shelved if the crisis dies down, and so progress halts until the next time a similar infection flares up. Sars and Mers were also coronaviruses but after they petered out, work on them essentially stalled. Jason Schwartz, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said as much to the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/\" title=\"\">Atlantic earlier this month</a>: \u201cHad we not set the Sars vaccine research programme aside, we would have had a lot more of this foundational work that we could apply to this new, closely related virus.\u201d Clinical trials take nearly a year at minimum, but sustaining basic research on viruses known to have epidemic potential means when a novel variant pops up, we\u2019re not starting from zero each time.</p> <p>The current setup is often the worst of both worlds \u2013 too slow to pick up research on new threats because the money isn\u2019t there, and too quick to drop it if it can\u2019t be sure the money will be there in the future. It\u2019s a highly market-dependent system, and the market usually fails us. Peter Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, previously declared the entire research and development system <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/coalition-for-epidemic-preparedness-innovations-launches-in-davos-89489\" title=\"\">\u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d for epidemics</a>.</p> <p>The question is, how can we fix it? The quick delivery of the first Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidate suggests that some recent efforts are paying off. The Moderna vaccine is in part backed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organisation based in Norway and funded by governments and foundations such as the Wellcome Trust. Its goal is to keep research attention on potentially epidemic diseases, even when there isn\u2019t an outbreak, and to develop broader treatments it calls \u201cplatforms\u201d that could be tailored to multiple virus variants. For example, the vaccine sent to NIAID is RNA-based, making it far easier to customise and faster to produce than traditional protein-based vaccines. And CEPI was already funding a DNA-based vaccine for another coronavirus, as well as a platform to block viral cell entry, that it hopes to quickly adapt to Sars-CoV-2.</p> <p>These kinds of programmes can maintain long-term vision and planning, foster international collaboration and supercharge vaccine research \u2013 but they still can\u2019t deliver a vaccine at pandemic scale, because the biotech firms and universities they work with are simply too small, working on the order of millions of doses. The French pharma giant Sanofi alone produces over a billion doses per year. Even the US army, after producing a promising Zika vaccine in 2017, had to sign over the rights to Sanofi to get it produced. (The <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/sanofi-army-request-pricing-zika-vaccine\" title=\"\">deal later fell through</a> after criticism over profiteering by watchdog organisations and senator Bernie Sanders.)</p> <p>There have been calls over the years, usually after an outbreak or a terrorist attack, for the state to match its commitment to research \u2013 the US government has spent more than <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/blind-spot/\" title=\"\">\u00a3500m on coronavirus research</a> over the past 20 years \u2013 with the manufacturing capacity to become truly self-reliant. The <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401423/should-the-government-make-vaccines/\" title=\"\">US had a facility like that until the 1990s</a>, producing vaccines for the army at pennies per dose. The UK recently announced a <a href=\"https://innovateuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/12/03/dramatic-increase-in-the-uk-vaccine-capability/\" title=\"\">new state of the art facility in Oxford</a> that would allow the government to manufacture its own vaccines, an incredible step, but it won\u2019t be operational until 2022.</p> <p>A panicked world will be watching the vaccines inch through clinical trials over the next year. The markets will be watching too. After Fauci said it was <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/11/major-drug-makers-havent-stepped-up-to-manufacture-coronavirus-vaccine-top-u-s-health-official-says/\" title=\"\">\u201cvery difficult and very frustrating\u201d</a> that no large pharma companies had stepped up to produce vaccines, both <a href=\"http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/us_backs_sanofis_fast-track_coronavirus_vaccine_1326478\" title=\"\">Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> announced new partnerships with the US government on potential treatments.

(The deal later fell through after criticism over profiteering by watchdog organisations and senator Bernie Sanders.) There have been calls over the years, usually after an outbreak or a terrorist attack, for the state to match its commitment to research \u2013 the US government has spent more than \u00a3500m on coronavirus research over the past 20 years \u2013 with the manufacturing capacity to become truly self-reliant. The US had a facility like that until the 1990s, producing vaccines for the army at pennies per dose. The UK recently announced a new state of the art facility in Oxford that would allow the government to manufacture its own vaccines, an incredible step, but it won\u2019t be operational until 2022. A panicked world will be watching the vaccines inch through clinical trials over the next year. The markets will be watching too. After Fauci said it was \u201cvery difficult and very frustrating\u201d that no large pharma companies had stepped up to produce vaccines, both Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson announced new partnerships with the US government on potential treatments. However, the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, gave no guarantee it would be affordable. \u201cWe need the private sector to invest,\u201d he said, \u201cprice controls won\u2019t get us there.\u201d \u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has promised sick pay from day one for all those with suspected coronavirus and hinted at further measures to stop gig economy workers losing pay if they need to self-isolate. The prime minister said the government was changing the rules to make sure statutory sick pay was temporarily available from the first day off sick instead of the fourth day. The new policy will not help self-employed or gig economy workers, who may have to choose between losing pay during quarantine periods or carrying on with coronavirus symptoms . But Johnson hinted at further possible measures that would go beyond the current advice that workers with no sick pay can claim universal credit. Speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions, he said: \u201cWe will take every step we can to make sure that \u2026 no one whether employed or self-employed \u2013 whatever the status of their employment \u2013 is penalised for doing the right thing.\u201d He said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would be leading on how this would work, following calls from all the major unions to deal with the problem to help gig economy workers who cannot afford to take time off sick.

The move brings England into line with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland, which have already added the coronavirus to their lists of notifiable diseases. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cTo mitigate the impact on businesses, we will register Covid-19 as a notifiable disease. This will help companies seek compensation through their insurance policies in the event of any cancellations they may have to make as a result of the spread of the virus.\u201d Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has also suggested that small firms could get cash boosts to help stay afloat. The government released its coronavirus action plan on Tuesday, showing that sweeping new measures may be necessary if an epidemic occurs. The Guardian revealed that police investigations into some homicides could be halted and 999 response times extended under contingency plans to help forces cope with a severe coronavirus outbreak. Schools may be closed, public events cancelled and some doctors called in out of retirement, the government also said. As the number of confirmed UK cases reached 51, officials said the worst-case scenario was that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick during the peak of a potential epidemic. On Tuesday evening, tests on thousands of patients in hospital intensive care units were ordered by NHS England amid concerns about the possible spread of the virus among people with respiratory problems. Twelve more people across England tested positive for coronavirus \u2013 the second-highest single-day increase in cases to date \u2013 with all thought to have contracted it abroad. Eight had recently travelled from Italy, while the others came from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran.",

      "bodyText": "Tensions at the Greek-Turkish border and the coronavirus show why the European Union needs a climate law that binds member states to net zero emissions by 2050, the EU\u2019s top official on climate action has said. Frans Timmermans, a European commission vice-president who leads on the climate emergency, said the different crises facing Europe underscored the need for a climate law in order not to lose track of reducing emissions. The long-awaited climate law unveiled on Wednesday is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, a plan to transform Europe\u2019s economy, promised by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, within her first 100 days. \u201cIt will be our compass for the next 30 years and it will guide us every step as we build a sustainable new growth model,\u201d Von der Leyen said announcing the law. Some political leaders have argued that the commission needs to focus on the protection of the EU\u2019s external border, rather than the climate crisis \u2013 arguments that Timmermans rejected. \u201cThe focus this week should be completely on the happening in Syria, in Turkey and what is happening in Greece, should be on containing the coronavirus and solving it. That\u2019s absolutely a priority,\u201d he said. The climate law was \u201cso important\u201d, because \u201cit allows you to focus on other things without losing track of what you need to do to reach climate neutrality\u201d. \u201cEven if the Eye of Sauron is on something else for a bit, the trajectory to 2050 will be clear,\u201d he said, in a reference to the dark forces in the Lord of the Rings. \u201cBecause we discipline ourselves with the climate law.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian and six other European newspapers shortly before the law was published, Timmermans said the proposal was revolutionary because all EU legislation would have to be in line with net zero emissions by the mid-century. Even before the text was officially released, the climate activist Greta Thunberg and teenage school strike leaders across Europe gave a blistering verdict, accusing the commission of ignoring climate science. Thunberg, who is meeting Von der Leyen, Timmermans and the rest of the commission\u2019s top team, described the law as \u201csurrender\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Chicago State University men\u2019s basketball team will not travel for two regularly scheduled Western Athletic Conference games this week, and its women\u2019s team will not host two games, the school said late Tuesday, citing the spread of the coronavirus. The school said in a statement it was making the move with the \u201chealth and well-being of the campus community in mind\u201d. The cancellations are believed to be the first by a major sport in the United States due to the virus. The university said the men\u2019s team would not travel to Seattle University or Utah Valley University for Western Athletic Conference games on Thursday and Saturday. The school also said the women\u2019s team would not host Seattle or Utah Valley at the campus\u2019 Jones Convocation Center on the same days. \u201cChicago State athletics views our decision as a reaffirmation of our commitment to the well-being, health and safety of our student athletes,\u201d Chicago State athletic director Elliott Charles said in the statement. The Western Athletic Conference and Seattle University declined to comment about Chicago State\u2019s decision. Worldwide, more than 93,000 people have been infected and more than 3,100 have died, the vast majority of them in China. The number of countries hit by the virus has exceeded 70. Virus clusters in the United States have spread fears among nursing home residents, who are especially vulnerable, and led schools and subways to sanitize. The number of the infections in the US topped 100, and the death toll climbed to nine. All of the deaths were in Washington state, and most of them were residents of a Seattle-area nursing home. Chicago State said it also is evaluating whether to attend next week\u2019s WAC tournament in Las Vegas. The school said it would make a decision about participation later this week. The school also indicated it is reviewing travel plans for its other intercollegiate sports teams. Chicago State men\u2019s basketball team is 0-14 in WAC play and 4-25 overall this season. The women\u2019s team is 1-13 in conference and 1-26 overall. An NCAA tournament with empty arenas? Imagine an NCAA tournament with no fans in the arenas. What normally would be thought an impossibility isn\u2019t so far-fetched as the United States and the rest of the world attempt to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. An advocacy group for college athletes has urged the NCAA to consider holding its winter sports championships with no fans, and the idea has not been dismissed out of hand. \u201cIf you can think of it, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve gone through an analysis around,\u201d NCAA chief operating officer Donald Remy told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. \u201dWe\u2019ve contingency planned for all circumstances.\u201d The NCAA declined further comment to the Associated Press on the possibility of no fans in the stands. Presumably, the games still would be televised. Also Tuesday, the Stanford athletic department announced the school\u2019s emergency coronavirus task force has recommended postponing or adjusting events on campus between 4 March and 15 April. Stanford said it plans to \u201climit the number of attendees at our competitions in order to allow for sufficient social distancing\u201d. Stanford\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team is ranked No 7 in the AP poll and was listed by the NCAA on Monday as one of the 16 teams that would potentially host the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament. The NCAA offers an early look at the possible top seeds in the tournament, known as a reveal. Also Tuesday, the NCAA announced it has established an advisory panel of medical, public health and epidemiology experts and NCAA schools to address the virus, also known as COVID-19. NCAA chief medical officer Dr Brian Hainline will lead the group. \u201cThe NCAA is committed to conducting its championships and events in a safe and responsible manner,\u201d Remy said in a statement. \u201cToday we are planning to conduct our championships as planned; however, we are evaluating the COVID-19 situation daily and will make decisions accordingly.\u201d Hainline said the advisory group will make recommendations on competition based on evolving medical protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and state and local authorities. \u201cWe are in daily contact with the CDC and are advising leadership on the Association\u2019s response to this outbreak,\u201d he said. The NCAA generates nearly $1bn a year, most of it coming from the men\u2019s basketball tournament through media rights fees, corporate sponsorships and ticket sales. Total attendance for the 2019 tournament was 688,753, an average of 19,132 per game. The Final Four at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis drew 72,711 for the semifinals and 72,062 for the championship game. Attendance for the 2019 women\u2019s basketball tournament was 274,873, an average of 6,545 per game. The men\u2019s tournament is scheduled to open 17 March and the women\u2019s tournament begins on 20 March. The men\u2019s Final Four will be played the first weekend in April at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, and the women\u2019s Final Four is set for Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The NCAA wrestling tournament is March 19-21 at US Bank Stadium, the first time the event has been held in a football stadium. The tournament is expected to break the attendance record of 113,743, set in Cleveland in 2018. Conference basketball tournaments are set to begin next week, and the Big East, Pac-12, Mountain West, West Coast and Western Athletic conferences said in statements to the AP that they are proceeding as if their tournaments will go on but monitoring the situation. The WAC noted that if its tournament is not completed, the tournament\u2019s No 1 seed will advance to the NCAA tournament as the league\u2019s automatic qualifier. Sporting events across the globe have been canceled or contested with no spectators allowed in stadiums or arenas. Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association, urged the NCAA and the schools to take steps to protect athletes. \u201cPrecautions should include cancelling all auxiliary events that put players in contact with crowds such as meet and greets, and press events,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAthletic programs should also take every possible measure to sanitize buses and airplanes used to transport players. \u201cIn regard to the NCAA\u2019s March Madness Tournament and other athletic events, there should also be a serious discussion about holding competitions without an audience present. ... The NCAA and its colleges must act now, there is no time to waste.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe plane was half-empty,\u201d said Andrew Ross, who works in construction in the Netherlands and flies from Amsterdam to London a few times each year. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected it \u2013 it\u2019s usually busier.

      "body": "<p>As the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitizer gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online?</p> \n<p>Hand sanitizer is not new. In 1966, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/13/do-we-really-need-hand-sanitisers\" title=\"\">Lupe Hernandez</a>, a student nurse from Bakersfield, California, patented the idea of an alcohol-based gel to clean hands in the absence of handwashing facilities. However, it was not until the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/\" title=\"\">H1N1 swine flu pandemic</a> in 2009 that the product went from being used in institutions to something the public carried with them. That year, sales of antibacterial gels and wipes in the US soared by more than 70% in six months. By 2010, little bottles of the stuff were everywhere \u2013 from checkout counters in airport bookshops to online retailers offering customisable dispensers.</p> \n<p>The popularity of hand gels has not just been driven by the fear of pandemics. Lucrative opportunities to market them have pushed sales: they now come in pretty, child-friendly colours (bubblegum pink, bright blue) and with wellness-friendly scents (cinnamon, lavender) that are a far cry from the pungent-smelling version found in hospitals.</p> \n<p>Sanitizers have also evolved to include other active ingredients in place of alcohol, and there are recipes online for making your own. Good Housekeeping suggests vodka. Wellness bloggers plump for things such as witch-hazel and aloe vera. But are these effective in killing germs?</p> \n<p>Hygiene experts, the NHS and Public Health England all agree that to kill most viruses, a hand sanitizer requires at least 60% alcohol content (most contain 60-95%). For those with sensitive skin, there are now options that don\u2019t contain alcohol. For decades, there were also versions made with another powerful antibacterial agent, triclosan, which was found in everything from soaps to toothpaste. However, research has since found that triclosan can be detrimental to the body\u2019s endocrine system, and the US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://msc.ul.com/en/resources/article/u.s.-fda-bans-use-of-triclosan-in-health-care-antiseptics\" title=\"\">banned its use</a> in hygiene products at the end of 2017.</p> \n<p>Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that viruses are much more resistant to disinfectants than bacteria. Luckily, she says, coronavirus is an envelope virus, meaning it has a coating around it which the alcohol can attack, thereby eliminating the threat. (Norovirus and rhinovirus, by contrast, do not).</p> \n<p>This means that making your own sanitizer, while potentially effective against some bacteria, is not something Bloomfield would recommend. \u201cIt\u2019s very unwise, dangerous, even,\u201d she says. Shop-bought products also contain emollients to make them softer on the skin, without which you run the risk of hurting your hands. Getting the mix right at home would very tricky \u2013 so it is a big no-no.</p> \n<p>The key thing is when to use hand sanitizer. Covid-19 is a new illness, so no one knows exactly how it spreads. According to the NHS, it is likely that it is through cough droplets spread from person to person and very unlikely that it is transmitted through objects, be that packages or food.</p> \n<p>Bloomfield\u2019s advice is to wash your hands with soap and water \u2013 or, if that is not possible, use hand gel \u2013 when you return to your \u201csafe place\u201d, by which she means your home, your desk or work station, or your seat on the train or plane, for example. Avoid touching anything you don\u2019t need to touch, and be mindful of what you do touch \u2013 such as door handles and bus poles \u2013 and if you can\u2019t wash your hands or use gel after coming into contact with things, do not touch your face.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A virus needs a host \u2013 living cells \u2013 to reproduce: so don\u2019t rub your eyes, or touch your mouth or any wounds if your hands are not clean. Keep your hands clear until you have access to gel or can wash them.</p> \n<p>The best option is soap and water. According to a <a href=\"https://msphere.asm.org/content/4/5/e00474-19\" title=\"\">2019 study</a> by the American Society for Microbiology, using running water and soap to wash your hands is more effective than a dab of gel that you have not quite rubbed in.</p> \n<p>When it comes to hygiene and safety, what matters isn\u2019t a single viral cell, it\u2019s how much of the virus is on any given surface. We don\u2019t have conclusive proof of the extent to which soap can deactivate enough of the viral cells to make a surface safe. However, we do know that washing with soap will dislodge viral cells from your hands, and rinsing thoroughly with water will remove them completely and flush them down the drain. You can touch your hands to your face and not get infected.</p> \n<p>So, wet your hands with water, lather them up properly, on both sides, in between the fingers and under the nails, one hand and then the other.

      "bodyText": "As the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitizer gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online? Hand sanitizer is not new. In 1966, Lupe Hernandez, a student nurse from Bakersfield, California, patented the idea of an alcohol-based gel to clean hands in the absence of handwashing facilities. However, it was not until the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 that the product went from being used in institutions to something the public carried with them. That year, sales of antibacterial gels and wipes in the US soared by more than 70% in six months. By 2010, little bottles of the stuff were everywhere \u2013 from checkout counters in airport bookshops to online retailers offering customisable dispensers. The popularity of hand gels has not just been driven by the fear of pandemics. Lucrative opportunities to market them have pushed sales: they now come in pretty, child-friendly colours (bubblegum pink, bright blue) and with wellness-friendly scents (cinnamon, lavender) that are a far cry from the pungent-smelling version found in hospitals. Sanitizers have also evolved to include other active ingredients in place of alcohol, and there are recipes online for making your own. Good Housekeeping suggests vodka. Wellness bloggers plump for things such as witch-hazel and aloe vera. But are these effective in killing germs? Hygiene experts, the NHS and Public Health England all agree that to kill most viruses, a hand sanitizer requires at least 60% alcohol content (most contain 60-95%). For those with sensitive skin, there are now options that don\u2019t contain alcohol. For decades, there were also versions made with another powerful antibacterial agent, triclosan, which was found in everything from soaps to toothpaste. However, research has since found that triclosan can be detrimental to the body\u2019s endocrine system, and the US Food and Drug Administration banned its use in hygiene products at the end of 2017. Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that viruses are much more resistant to disinfectants than bacteria. Luckily, she says, coronavirus is an envelope virus, meaning it has a coating around it which the alcohol can attack, thereby eliminating the threat. (Norovirus and rhinovirus, by contrast, do not). This means that making your own sanitizer, while potentially effective against some bacteria, is not something Bloomfield would recommend. \u201cIt\u2019s very unwise, dangerous, even,\u201d she says. Shop-bought products also contain emollients to make them softer on the skin, without which you run the risk of hurting your hands. Getting the mix right at home would very tricky \u2013 so it is a big no-no. The key thing is when to use hand sanitizer. Covid-19 is a new illness, so no one knows exactly how it spreads. According to the NHS, it is likely that it is through cough droplets spread from person to person and very unlikely that it is transmitted through objects, be that packages or food. Bloomfield\u2019s advice is to wash your hands with soap and water \u2013 or, if that is not possible, use hand gel \u2013 when you return to your \u201csafe place\u201d, by which she means your home, your desk or work station, or your seat on the train or plane, for example. Avoid touching anything you don\u2019t need to touch, and be mindful of what you do touch \u2013 such as door handles and bus poles \u2013 and if you can\u2019t wash your hands or use gel after coming into contact with things, do not touch your face. A virus needs a host \u2013 living cells \u2013 to reproduce: so don\u2019t rub your eyes, or touch your mouth or any wounds if your hands are not clean. Keep your hands clear until you have access to gel or can wash them. The best option is soap and water. According to a 2019 study by the American Society for Microbiology, using running water and soap to wash your hands is more effective than a dab of gel that you have not quite rubbed in. When it comes to hygiene and safety, what matters isn\u2019t a single viral cell, it\u2019s how much of the virus is on any given surface. We don\u2019t have conclusive proof of the extent to which soap can deactivate enough of the viral cells to make a surface safe. However, we do know that washing with soap will dislodge viral cells from your hands, and rinsing thoroughly with water will remove them completely and flush them down the drain. You can touch your hands to your face and not get infected. So, wet your hands with water, lather them up properly, on both sides, in between the fingers and under the nails, one hand and then the other. Rinse them thoroughly under running water for 20 seconds (or as the NHS puts it, the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice). Rinsing thoroughly is key to washing away any viruses. Dry your hands well with a disposable towel, then use that towel to turn off the tap before throwing it away. It might seem counterintuitive, but a study published in the medical journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012 concluded that, from a hygiene standpoint: \u201cPaper towels are superior to air dryers.\u201d This is because the towels dry your hands more quickly and more thoroughly than dryers do, and contamination happens more through wet hands than dry.

Damaged skin increases vulnerability to infection, so hand sanitizers, like most things, are best used in moderation \u2013 and only when handwashing is not an option. As Bloomfield puts it, it is not about being paranoid. She likens the process to vaccinations or wearing seatbelts: it is about being disciplined.

It is impossible not to engage with the world, so you just need to be cautious and methodical in your hand hygiene. \u201cIf everyone complies with good hygiene,\u201d says Bloomfield, \u201cthen you\u2019re making sure as far as possible that you\u2019re not picking it up, and in the unlikely event you are infected you\u2019re not spreading it.\u201d \u2022 This article was last amended on 6 April 2020.

The chorus is almost exactly 20 seconds long and the lyrics are, if anything, less challenging than Happy Birthday. They are also vaguely encouraging, reminding you, just when you think you\u2019re done, to wash your hands that little bit more.</p> <h2><strong>Take on Me \u2013 A-ha</strong></h2> <p>The chorus of this one is also 20 seconds once through, provided you can hold the last note and resist the urge to rush it along. The high notes might be a problem for some, so start on the lowest note available to you.</p> <h2><strong>Jolene \u2013 Dolly Parton</strong></h2> <p>This, which comes from a song list supplied by journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenMonnier/status/1234532567610605568\" title=\"\">Jen Monnier on Twitte</a>r, has another 20-second chorus. It is also only 25 words long, and eight of them are Jolene.</p> <h2><strong>Happy Birthday to You (You Live in a Zoo version)</strong></h2> <p>You know what never gets old? This classic parody of the traditional celebratory singalong. Also recommended are Jingle Bells (Batman Smells version), This Land Is My Land (It Is Not Your Land version).</p> <h2><strong>4\u201933\u201d \u2013 John Cage</strong></h2> <p>Obviously you will only need the first 20 seconds of this silent orchestral piece, but it is ideal if you have a terrible singing voice. Just use a timer, like the conductor.</p> <h2><strong>Any Dream Will Do \u2013 Andrew Lloyd Webber &amp; Tim Rice</strong></h2> <p>The standout song from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat should get you at least 15 seconds into your ablutions before you forget what comes next, unless you are a diehard fan, in which case you will have very clean fingernails. You can also adjust the words to narrate the whole operation (\u201cI wash my hands / For 15 seconds / Not enough they reckon / It will have to do\u201d), making it a bit more instructive.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNFzfwLM72c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fNFzfwLM72c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Stayin\u2019 Alive \u2013 Bee Gees</strong></h2> <p>As has been pointed out on Twitter, the chorus of Stayin\u2019 Alive is a generous, health-and-safety conscious 24 seconds, but it is also recommended as the song you are meant to do CPR to in order to maintain the correct pace. In the coming months, we may well be doing a lot of both handwashing and CPR, so it is probably safer to have one song for everything.</p> <h2><strong>Signs \u2013 the Five Man Electrical Band</strong></h2> <p>The first verse of the 1971 hit single by the Canadian rockers, the one that begins: \u201cAnd the sign said: \u2018Long-haired Freaky People Need Not Apply \u2026\u2019\u201d \u2013 will take you about 20 seconds to warble through. If you don\u2019t know it already, learn it. You will wake up every morning absolutely gagging to wash your hands.</p>",

Ooh Ahh\u2026 Just a Little Bit \u2013 Gina G Britain\u2019s 1996 Eurovision entry only came eigth, but that\u2019s probably because there wasn\u2019t a worldwide pandemic on at the time. The chorus is almost exactly 20 seconds long and the lyrics are, if anything, less challenging than Happy Birthday. They are also vaguely encouraging, reminding you, just when you think you\u2019re done, to wash your hands that little bit more. Take on Me \u2013 A-ha The chorus of this one is also 20 seconds once through, provided you can hold the last note and resist the urge to rush it along. The high notes might be a problem for some, so start on the lowest note available to you. Jolene \u2013 Dolly Parton This, which comes from a song list supplied by journalist Jen Monnier on Twitter, has another 20-second chorus. It is also only 25 words long, and eight of them are Jolene. Happy Birthday to You (You Live in a Zoo version) You know what never gets old? This classic parody of the traditional celebratory singalong. Also recommended are Jingle Bells (Batman Smells version), This Land Is My Land (It Is Not Your Land version). 4\u201933\u201d \u2013 John Cage Obviously you will only need the first 20 seconds of this silent orchestral piece, but it is ideal if you have a terrible singing voice. Just use a timer, like the conductor. Any Dream Will Do \u2013 Andrew Lloyd Webber &amp; Tim Rice The standout song from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat should get you at least 15 seconds into your ablutions before you forget what comes next, unless you are a diehard fan, in which case you will have very clean fingernails. You can also adjust the words to narrate the whole operation (\u201cI wash my hands / For 15 seconds / Not enough they reckon / It will have to do\u201d), making it a bit more instructive. Stayin\u2019 Alive \u2013 Bee Gees As has been pointed out on Twitter, the chorus of Stayin\u2019 Alive is a generous, health-and-safety conscious 24 seconds, but it is also recommended as the song you are meant to do CPR to in order to maintain the correct pace. In the coming months, we may well be doing a lot of both handwashing and CPR, so it is probably safer to have one song for everything. Signs \u2013 the Five Man Electrical Band The first verse of the 1971 hit single by the Canadian rockers, the one that begins: \u201cAnd the sign said: \u2018Long-haired Freaky People Need Not Apply \u2026\u2019\u201d \u2013 will take you about 20 seconds to warble through. If you don\u2019t know it already, learn it. You will wake up every morning absolutely gagging to wash your hands.",

Mindful of coronavirus \u2013 no respecter of nations or faiths \u2013 there would be no blessed chalice and the communion wafers would be placed only in our hands, not on our tongues.

But the ritual of the holy water \u2013 the four faint, soon-fading, watery marks on our foreheads and chests \u2013 have always kind of ached with meaning for me. But what really unsettled me was the plea not to shake hands during the sign of peace. Just in case you have never had the pleasure, the sign of peace, in a Catholic mass, comes between the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the breaking of the bread. The priest invites us to \u201cOffer each other the sign of peace\u201d. We then shake hands with those around us and say: \u201cPeace be with you\u201d. Before I was a Catholic, this bit astounded me. I would go along to mass with one or more of my beery, footbally college mates, and then suddenly we would be wishing each other peace, which wasn\u2019t the kind of thing we ever wished each other in the general run of things. Nice. It has always been a highlight of mass for me, and not only because it is a sign that you are, er, nearer to the end of mass than the beginning. I love it for its simplicity. Who, of whatever faith or none, could possibly object to having peace wished upon them?</p> <p>And so the moment came for this unfamiliar no-touching sign of peace. I assumed it would lack something but curiously the opposite was true: for me, it actually felt more sincere without the handshake. Less was more. There are two key components to the standard sign of peace: the handshake and the words. But the key bit is the eye contact, which can be fleeting or missed out entirely. The beauty of taking the handshake away was that it elevated the eye contact to a level of great importance. After all, in the absence of physical contact, if you do not make eye contact, the whole enterprise is rendered somewhat pointless. So, uncertainly \u2013 gingerly, even \u2013 we bowed awkwardly in each other\u2019s direction and had no alternative but to lock eyes. And then, staring into each other\u2019s souls, we wished each other peace. Now this was real intimacy. And there was the added advantage that we were not restricted to those around us. Eyes met and the words were mouthed across the aisles.</p> <p>So never mind the toe tapping and elbow bumping, and whatnot, let\u2019s just say hello by stopping, nodding slightly (optional), and meeting eyes for a little more than a moment. I really think it is better. And how much simpler, too. Let\u2019s say goodbye to the handshake with all its troubling variables \u2013 whether to shake, how hard to grasp, how long to hold on for etc. And as for kissing \u2013 whether to kiss, how to kiss, how many kisses, which cheek first \u2013 don\u2019t get me started. It\u2019s all in the eyes; the eyes have it.<br><br>\u25cf This article was amended on 5 March 2020 to correct the spelling of Harborne.</p>",

Throughout the year, the economy grew just 1.8% \u2013 worse than even during the GFC.

      "bodyText": "The latest national accounts figures released on Wednesday by the bureau of statistics show that 2019 was the worst performing calendar year since the 1990s recession. Throughout the year, the economy grew just 1.8% \u2013 worse than even during the GFC. The figures show an economy dependent upon exports and government spending and very much ill-prepared to face the impact of the coronavirus. As a general rule we look at the growth in the economy from quarter to quarter \u2013 and when you hear \u201cannual growth\u201d what it really means is a comparison of the current quarter with the same quarter a year ago. On this score the latest GDP figures show a bit of improvement in December \u2013 GDP growth of 2.1% in trend terms \u2013 up from 1.9% in September: But the latest figures allow us to judge the performance of the entire year, and here there is no good news. At the end of 2018 Australia\u2019s GDP was worth $1.871tn in real terms, 12 months later it had risen to $1.905tn \u2013 an increase of just 1.8%, the worst calendar year result in 29 years: So yes, the economy was improving towards the end of last year, but only because it was coming off a dreadful low. And when we look more closely, we see a rather worrying situation given these numbers pre-date the impact of the coronavirus and the bushfires. In the December quarter, the biggest contribution to economic growth was government spending, and together with net exports it contributed more than household spending in the past year: That is a rather stunning situation because household spending makes up 56% of the entire economy. And yet by the end of last year household spending was growing a truly woeful 1.2% \u2013 and that was after the tax cuts of last year: Looking at household incomes we see that the tax cuts merely provided a one-off sugar hit but generated absolutely no ongoing improvement. In September, household disposable income grew a stunning 1.1% in the quarter; and yet total household income in that quarter actually fell by 0.1%. What this showed was that the only reason households had more after-tax income in real terms was due to the tax cuts, not because of any actual increase in their income. And with the impact of the tax cuts all gone in the December quarter, so too was any rise in our disposable income \u2013 they actually fell 0.3%: It means that average Australian real household disposable income per capita is $50,063 \u2013 barely above what it was at the end of 2011: The latest figures also showed that the domestic private sector is shrinking \u2013 down 0.2% in the past 12 months: Essentially it means government spending and exports are keeping the economy afloat. Now that is fine as far as it goes, but when you are facing a global crisis that is affecting trade, then it means you need to fall back on your private sector domestic economy. And right now the domestic private sector is in dire trouble. It means the base of our economy is much less secure than before the Sars crisis of 2003. Prior to the Sars impact, our private domestic sector was growing strongly \u2013 both households and private investment was strong, and exports contributed little. Now exports and public spending are all important and household consumption and private investment are in the doldrums: The underlying foundations of the economy are also in a bad way. Over the past three years, annual productivity growth has been lower than ever recorded: Given productivity growth is the basis for increased living standard, this is a terrible result. So long as productivity remains at such crisis levels, the chances of any increase in wages growth is effectively nil. Earlier this week, the OECD revised down its prediction for Australia\u2019s economic growth this year from 2.3% to 1.8% and suggested that \u201cadditional stimulus measures could be implemented without endangering debt sustainability\u201d. And these figures show such stimulus is greatly needed. It is clear that despite the treasurer suggesting these figures show the economy \u201cremains resilient and continues to defy all those who seek to talk it down\u201d the underlying aspects of the economy are very weak. Households and businesses are struggling, and government spending and exports have kept things afloat. Take away exports, as is likely to occur due to the coronavirus, and we find a domestic private economy woefully unready to shoulder the burden. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "body": "<h2>Italy</h2> <p>By far the worst European outbreak: more than 3,000 confirmed cases so far and 107 deaths. The virus has spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, with the majority of cases in Lombardy, followed by Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. Most Italian regions have under 50 confirmed cases.</p> <p>Having already placed 11 towns in lockdown and closed schools in Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Veneto and Piedmont, the government will now put more towns in quarantine and close all schools and universities across Italy until mid-March. It is also considering closing cinemas and theatres and banning public events that \u201centail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre\u201d. People have been told to refrain from greeting each other by kissing on the cheek and hugging, to avoid crowded places. Those over 75, over 65 with a health problem, and anyone with respiratory problems have been advised to stay at home. The new guidelines also warn people not to drink from the same cups or bottles as anyone else.</p> <p>The Venice carnival was cut short this weekend and many smaller carnivals have been cancelled. Performances at the La Scala opera house in Milan have been halted, and Milan fashion week was closed to the public. Important trade fairs such as the Milan furniture fair and Bologna\u2019s children\u2019s book fair have been postponed, and all sporting fixtures of any description cancelled in the so-called red zone (the northern regions most affected). Several Serie A football matches have been postponed and future fixtures may be played behind closed doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/corona_stockpiles-zip/giv-39029YkHntnRDzNF/\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus precautions around Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/corona_stockpiles-zip/giv-39029YkHntnRDzNF/\">Coronavirus precautions around Europe</a> </figure>  <h2>France</h2> <p>A total of 257 confirmed cases and four deaths. Thirteen regions affected. Four main clusters so far: Oise in northern France (64 cases), Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan in Brittany (12 cases); the fourth relates to a group of tourists who took part in an organised visit to Egypt (11 cases), while five members of the same family caught the virus after attending an evangelical church service at Mulhouse in eastern France.</p> <p>Airport screening is in place for arrivals from affected countries. A dedicated Covid-19 emergency facility is being established in each <em>d\u00e9partement</em>. The government has banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people and is considering outdoor events on a case-by-case basis; in affected areas, all public meetings have been banned and about 100 schools closed. \u201cEvery French woman and man\u201d has been asked to help by washing their hands thoroughly every hour if possible and avoiding cheek-kissing. All available and future FFP2 masks from private and public stocks have been requisitioned by decree.</p> <p>Apart from the cancelled Paris half-marathon and the Paris-Nice bike race, most sporting fixtures are going ahead at present, even international ones involving large numbers of visiting fans (although a Paris Saint Germain-Dortmund Champions League match on 11 March may take place behind closed doors). The Paris book fair has been cancelled and the agriculture fair closed a day early. The Louvre museum, which closed over staff coronavirus concerns, has reopened. Municipal elections on 15 and 22 March are expected to go ahead.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>A total of 240 confirmed infections. Individual cases in 15 of the country\u2019s 16 federal states, but the earliest and heaviest hit region is the Heinsberg district in North-Rhine Westphalia, on the border with the Netherlands, with 104 confirmed infections. The majority had already fully recovered and showed no symptoms, the health ministry said on Wednesday.</p> <p>German households have had standing advice for several years now to keep enough food for 10 days, but that has not stopped \u201chamstering\u201d: shelves have been cleared of tinned foods, pasta, rice and toilet roll. The government disease control and prevention agency, RKI, advised people in high-risk groups to shop only once a week to avoid unnecessary exposure to the virus. Whole-town lockdowns are not yet being considered, though some schools, hospitals and workplaces have been temporarily closed. The focus is on keeping track of travellers inside the country and ensuring easy contact. The export of medical protection gear such as masks and gloves has been banned.</p> <p>A number of large trade fairs have been cancelled including the Leipzig book fair and the ITB tourism fair in Berlin. The Hanover Messe, one of the biggest industry trade fairs in the world, has been postponed until 13-17 July. Football matches in the Bundesliga are set to go ahead, though fans planning to come from Heinsberg for this Saturday\u2019s Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach-Borussia Dortmund game can exchange their ticket for another fixture later in the year.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>210 cases nationwide, including 76 in Madrid; two fatalities. Health authorities are monitoring two infection clusters \u2013 one in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, a satellite town 25km north-east of Madrid, and another in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. There are 19 cases in Valencia, 17 in the Basque country; 24 in Catalonia, 13 in Andaluc\u00eda; 12 in Castille-La Mancha; 11 in Castilla y Le\u00f3n; 10 in Cantabria, seven in the Canary islands; six in Extremadura; five in the Balearic islands, four in Asturias; three in Navarra, and three in Rioja.</p> <p>Government advice remains the standard, to wash hands frequently, avoid touching the face, cough and sneeze into a disposable handkerchief or the crook of an arm, and avoid others if you think you have symptoms. It says the general population need not use face masks and warns against all but essential travel to affected countries. People who have done so are asked to watch out for any symptoms for 14 days after returning to Spain.</p> <p>The health ministry has ordered football and basketball matches involving teams from affected countries to be played to empty stadiums and advised that large medical conferences and events should be cancelled to free up health professionals. It also wants anyone thinking of attending Spain\u2019s huge annual rallies to mark International Women\u2019s Day this Sunday to use their common sense and stay home if they suspect they might have the virus.</p> <h2>The Netherlands/Sweden</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee9a54286d503ddac9d66e26be44d726551b0fdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9a54286d503ddac9d66e26be44d726551b0fdb/0_220_6595_3957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The OLVG hospital in Amsterdam, where two outpatient clinics have been closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The OLVG hospital in Amsterdam, where two outpatient clinics have been closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sweden has 35 confirmed cases, including 10 new infections in the Stockholm area announced on Wednesday, all linked either to contact with people already infected or recent travel to China, Italy, Iran or Germany. The Netherlands has 38 cases, four of whom are being treated in hospital, and most of whom were recently in, or related to someone who was in, northern Italy.</p> <p>Advice in both countries is to adopt the standard hygiene practices described above. Both countries are advising against travel to China\u2019s Hubei province and to avoid non-essential travel to elsewhere in China, and all travel to Iran. People who recently travelled to China, South Korea, Iran or affected areas in Italy have been told to stay at home if they start to develop symptoms.</p> <p>A department of Amsterdam\u2019s OLVG hospital has been closed for deep cleaning after an employee tested positive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Italy By far the worst European outbreak: more than 3,000 confirmed cases so far and 107 deaths. The virus has spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, with the majority of cases in Lombardy, followed by Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. Most Italian regions have under 50 confirmed cases. Having already placed 11 towns in lockdown and closed schools in Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Veneto and Piedmont, the government will now put more towns in quarantine and close all schools and universities across Italy until mid-March. It is also considering closing cinemas and theatres and banning public events that \u201centail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre\u201d. People have been told to refrain from greeting each other by kissing on the cheek and hugging, to avoid crowded places. Those over 75, over 65 with a health problem, and anyone with respiratory problems have been advised to stay at home. The new guidelines also warn people not to drink from the same cups or bottles as anyone else. The Venice carnival was cut short this weekend and many smaller carnivals have been cancelled. Performances at the La Scala opera house in Milan have been halted, and Milan fashion week was closed to the public. Important trade fairs such as the Milan furniture fair and Bologna\u2019s children\u2019s book fair have been postponed, and all sporting fixtures of any description cancelled in the so-called red zone (the northern regions most affected). Several Serie A football matches have been postponed and future fixtures may be played behind closed doors. France A total of 257 confirmed cases and four deaths. Thirteen regions affected. Four main clusters so far: Oise in northern France (64 cases), Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan in Brittany (12 cases); the fourth relates to a group of tourists who took part in an organised visit to Egypt (11 cases), while five members of the same family caught the virus after attending an evangelical church service at Mulhouse in eastern France. Airport screening is in place for arrivals from affected countries. A dedicated Covid-19 emergency facility is being established in each d\u00e9partement. The government has banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people and is considering outdoor events on a case-by-case basis; in affected areas, all public meetings have been banned and about 100 schools closed. \u201cEvery French woman and man\u201d has been asked to help by washing their hands thoroughly every hour if possible and avoiding cheek-kissing. All available and future FFP2 masks from private and public stocks have been requisitioned by decree. Apart from the cancelled Paris half-marathon and the Paris-Nice bike race, most sporting fixtures are going ahead at present, even international ones involving large numbers of visiting fans (although a Paris Saint Germain-Dortmund Champions League match on 11 March may take place behind closed doors). The Paris book fair has been cancelled and the agriculture fair closed a day early. The Louvre museum, which closed over staff coronavirus concerns, has reopened. Municipal elections on 15 and 22 March are expected to go ahead. Germany A total of 240 confirmed infections. Individual cases in 15 of the country\u2019s 16 federal states, but the earliest and heaviest hit region is the Heinsberg district in North-Rhine Westphalia, on the border with the Netherlands, with 104 confirmed infections. The majority had already fully recovered and showed no symptoms, the health ministry said on Wednesday. German households have had standing advice for several years now to keep enough food for 10 days, but that has not stopped \u201chamstering\u201d: shelves have been cleared of tinned foods, pasta, rice and toilet roll. The government disease control and prevention agency, RKI, advised people in high-risk groups to shop only once a week to avoid unnecessary exposure to the virus. Whole-town lockdowns are not yet being considered, though some schools, hospitals and workplaces have been temporarily closed. The focus is on keeping track of travellers inside the country and ensuring easy contact. The export of medical protection gear such as masks and gloves has been banned. A number of large trade fairs have been cancelled including the Leipzig book fair and the ITB tourism fair in Berlin. The Hanover Messe, one of the biggest industry trade fairs in the world, has been postponed until 13-17 July. Football matches in the Bundesliga are set to go ahead, though fans planning to come from Heinsberg for this Saturday\u2019s Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach-Borussia Dortmund game can exchange their ticket for another fixture later in the year. Spain 210 cases nationwide, including 76 in Madrid; two fatalities. Health authorities are monitoring two infection clusters \u2013 one in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, a satellite town 25km north-east of Madrid, and another in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. There are 19 cases in Valencia, 17 in the Basque country; 24 in Catalonia, 13 in Andaluc\u00eda; 12 in Castille-La Mancha; 11 in Castilla y Le\u00f3n; 10 in Cantabria, seven in the Canary islands; six in Extremadura; five in the Balearic islands, four in Asturias; three in Navarra, and three in Rioja. Government advice remains the standard, to wash hands frequently, avoid touching the face, cough and sneeze into a disposable handkerchief or the crook of an arm, and avoid others if you think you have symptoms. It says the general population need not use face masks and warns against all but essential travel to affected countries. People who have done so are asked to watch out for any symptoms for 14 days after returning to Spain. The health ministry has ordered football and basketball matches involving teams from affected countries to be played to empty stadiums and advised that large medical conferences and events should be cancelled to free up health professionals. It also wants anyone thinking of attending Spain\u2019s huge annual rallies to mark International Women\u2019s Day this Sunday to use their common sense and stay home if they suspect they might have the virus. The Netherlands/Sweden Sweden has 35 confirmed cases, including 10 new infections in the Stockholm area announced on Wednesday, all linked either to contact with people already infected or recent travel to China, Italy, Iran or Germany. The Netherlands has 38 cases, four of whom are being treated in hospital, and most of whom were recently in, or related to someone who was in, northern Italy. Advice in both countries is to adopt the standard hygiene practices described above. Both countries are advising against travel to China\u2019s Hubei province and to avoid non-essential travel to elsewhere in China, and all travel to Iran. People who recently travelled to China, South Korea, Iran or affected areas in Italy have been told to stay at home if they start to develop symptoms. A department of Amsterdam\u2019s OLVG hospital has been closed for deep cleaning after an employee tested positive.",

      "bodyText": "One more thing.... the IMF has also announced it will offer up to $50bn in emerging financing for countries stricken by the coronavirus outbreak. The proposal could sugar today\u2019s bitter news that economic growth forecast this year will fall below 2019\u2019s 2.9% due to the virus. In a statement, the Fund says: The IMF is making available about $50 billion through its rapid-disbursing emergeincy financing facilities for low income and emerging market countries that could potentially seek support. Of this, $10 billion is available at zero interest for the poorest members through the Rapid Credit Facility. Time for a quick recap Concern is growing over the economic damage caused by the coronavirus, as more cases are recorded outside China - including in the UK. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its growth forecasts, warning the global economy won\u2019t match the measly 2.9% expansion achieved in 2019. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that Fund was looking at \u201cmore dire\u201d scenarios, after the coronavirus spread further beyond China - with rising infections across the globe. This also prompted the World Bank to launch a new $12bn loan package overnight. The IMF is pushing for coordinated action from governments and central banks....and Canada has responded, by cutting borrowing costs by 50 basis points, more than expected. The BoC warned that Covid-19 is a threat to many economies, with a knock-on effect on Canada. But economists believe that rate cuts alone won\u2019t help -- the economy needs government spending, and more targeted assistance to stop good companies being dragged down. EU finance ministers have been warned that Italy and France could be dragged into recession, Bloomberg reports. That may bolster French finance minister Bruno Le Maire\u2019s calls for a fiscal response. China\u2019s economy continues to bear the brunt of the crisis, with car sales slumping by 80% year-on-year in February. Its services firm suffered its worst slump on record. But eurozone and UK services sector firms are also suffering - new surveys show a drop in business confidence and overseas orders. Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain, has told its staff to prepare to work from home. James Bond fans have been told to wait until November for the next film - postponed from April. Andrew Bailey, the incoming Bank of England governor has called for government support for small firms struggling with Covid-19. He also revealed he will examine whether the central bank should move some staff out of London, as he faced criticism of his time running Britain\u2019s financial watchdog. Global stock markets are rallying today, lifted by hopes of stimulus to fight the global downturn -- and welcoming Joe Biden\u2019s success in the Super Tuesday primaries. That may be all for today....GW Just in: The coronavirus has forced the next James Bond film to be delayed until November. No Time To Die was scheduled for April. However, fans had already lobbied for a postponement, saying it wasn\u2019t the right time to see Daniel Craig\u2019s last outing as 007. The producers now agree: Tesco has told more than 5,000 office-based staff to prepare to work from home, in the latest sign of Britain\u2019s biggest companies bracing for the coronavirus outbreak to worsen. Staff at its Welwyn Garden City headquarters and other offices were told on Wednesday to take everything they needed to work from home with them, such as laptops and work mobile phones, sources said. The move has been taken as a precaution in case the government changes its guidance for businesses. Public Health England\u2019s advice remains for businesses to carry out normal operations, although people who have travelled from affected areas such as China\u2019s Hubei province are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. Tesco and other retailers regularly carry out exercises to prepare for flu pandemics, including cutting product choice and moving to a \u201cfeed-the-nation\u201d footing. Tesco declined to comment. Back in Westminster, Andrew Bailey is fairly scathing about Facebook\u2019s Libra digital currency project, telling MPs: \u201cIt\u2019s been handled pretty poorly.\u201d Libra\u2019s launch got a \u201cpretty poor reception\u201d and was \u201cvery vague\u201d about how it works, the governor-to-be says. \u201cIt was frankly not a very well done and very well developed initiative. \u201cI remain pretty suspicious.\u201d All the main European stock markets closed higher tonight, despite the IMF\u2019s gloomy warnings that the coronavirus is hurting global growth. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index ended 1.2% higher, with gains in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. Investors seem to be banking on fresh monetary and fiscal stimulus measures -- not dampened by Canada\u2019s rate cut a couple of hours ago. But they\u2019re also taking their cue from Wall Street, where stocks have jumped 2%. New York investors seem convinced that Joe Biden will become the Democrat\u2019s candidate to take on Donald Trump, following his Super Tuesday triumph. Healthcare stocks, including insurers and pharmaceutical companies, are leading the rally. Bernie Sanders\u2019 dream of Medicare For All would have hit their profits (while also giving Americans much-needed health protection). Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has continued its recovery, and just closed 97 points higher at 6815 points (up 1.45%). That\u2019s above last Thursday\u2019s close (6796 points), meaning we\u2019ve shaken off Friday\u2019s slump. But, as you can see, the index is still sharply lower than in mid-February. Andrew Bailey has hinted the Bank of England is not close to an emergency rate cut amid the coronavirus outbreak, telling MPs: \u201cWhat we need is frankly more evidence than we have at the moment as to how this is feeding through\u201d He says there is nothing to stop the Bank acting before the next MPC, but that it\u2019s still \u201cworking hard\u201d to assess the potential economic fallout as the virus spreads. \u201cWe are still looking at the evidence and the precise sort of balance of what the shock is likely to be\u201d. That might dampen some of the speculation that the BoE follows the US Federal Reserve with an unscheduled cut (UK rates are currently 0.75%) Bloomberg is reporting that EU finance ministers have been warned to expect recessions in Italy and France, if the coronavirus outbreak worsens. They say: The coronavirus outbreak threatens to plunge both France and Italy into recession, and the ripples from a prolonged outbreak could incite a \u201cvicious\u201d spiral of declining markets, European finance ministers have been warned. \u201cA longer and more widespread epidemic could have a disproportionate negative impact through uncertainty and financial-market channels,\u201d according to a European Commission briefing note on the economic impact, seen by Bloomberg. \u201cCascading effects could stem from liquidity shortages in firms that have to stop production, amplified and spread out by financial markets.\u201d\u2019 As France and Italy both shrank in the last quarter of 2019, they\u2019re already on the brink of recession. Another contraction this month will shove them over the line. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the insurance market has announced \u201cemergency trading protocols\u201d that it can wheel out if the coronavirus situation escalates. Lloyd\u2019s 1,000 staff, along with thousands of brokers and underwriters, would be asked to work from home and to resort to electronic trading. More details here. Asked about the government\u2019s levelling-up agenda, Andrew Bailey drops a hint that the Bank could move some staff out of London! Saying that there are good reasons why the central bank is based in the capital, he admits: The time has now come to say \u2018what\u2019s the right distribution of the Bank of England?\u2019. The Bank does have regional agents across the country, of course, as well as its staff in Threadneedle Street, at Bank. Andrew Bailey then tells MPs that as governor of the Bank of England he wouldn\u2019t hold back from telling the government that a free trade deal with the EU is vital. \u201cMy strong view is we should do all we can to get a free trade agreement with the EU and not fall back on the WTO. On the climate emergency, he pledges to maintain the momentum created by Mark Carney. \u201cYou should be assured that none of the momentum behind this is going to decline\u201d He also warns the financial markets are not pricing in the risks of global heating. Labour MP Rushanara Ali is now tearing strips out of Andrew Bailey at the Treasury committee, saying: \u201cTo what extent do you take personal responsibility for not being feared by these people [bankers and finance industry execs]. And they quite frankly took the biscuit?\u201d Bailey points to the FCA\u2019s crackdown on high-cost credit, which he says has saved the poorest in society about \u00a31.5bn a year, and put several payday lenders out of business. \u201cThe way they were treating constituents across the country was unacceptable\u201d. Back in parliament, Andrew Bailey is being pummelled by MPs over his running of the Financial Conduct Authority. Asked on the FCA\u2019s, um, shameful toilet hygiene, Bailey says the leaked staff memo showed the FCA needs to lead by example. After the inevitable stinking headlines, \u201cother organisations\u201d got in touch to say they had the same problems.... (Good grief - Ed). The next BoE governor is also challenged about the FCA\u2019s inquiry into GRG -- Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u2018turnaround division\u2019 that drove some companies to the wall. On GRG... Bailey is robust, saying that the FCA could not have released its RBS report into the scandal at its global restructuring group (GRG) or it would break the law. \u201cIt was a difficult moment. [But] I\u2019m afraid to say as a public body we can\u2019t break the law. We had to stand our ground at that point and I would have to again. We can\u2019t as a public regulator break the law.\u201d Generally, Bailey says his time at the FCA was tough \u201cIt\u2019s hellishly tough at times. But that\u2019s the nature of it. I don\u2019t regret it [taking the job] for a moment.\u201d The Bank of Canada justifies its rate cut by pointing to the damage caused to the global economy by the spread of coronavirus: Before the outbreak, the global economy was showing signs of stabilizing... However, COVID-19 represents a significant health threat to people in a growing number of countries. In consequence, business activity in some regions has fallen sharply and supply chains have been disrupted. This has pulled down commodity prices and the Canadian dollar has depreciated. Global markets are reacting to the spread of the virus by repricing risk across a broad set of assets, making financial conditions less accommodative. It is likely that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate, further depressing activity. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of Canada has aggressively slashed interest rates, in an attempt to protect its economy from the impact of coronavirus. The BoC has cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points, from 1.75% to 1.25%, at its scheduled meeting today. That\u2019s a bigger cut than expected -- just a day after the US Federal Reserve surprised markets with a 50bp cut of its own. Canada\u2019s central bank says: \u201cWhile Canada\u2019s economy has been operating close to potential with inflation on target, the COVID-19 virus is a material negative shock to the Canadian and global outlooks, and monetary and fiscal authorities are responding,\u201d The incoming governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey has called on the government to launch emergency financial support to aid smaller firms through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee before he is formally due to start at the Bank on 16 March, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s quite reasonable to expect that we are collectively going to have to provide some form of supply chain finance in the not too distant future now.\u201d Suggesting that the support be coordinated between the Bank and the Treasury, Bailey adds the help would be required to \u201censure the effects of this shock from the virus are not too damaging to many forms of activity - and particularly to small and medium sized firms.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do that very quickly.\u201d Bailey says he has spoken to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, about the need for a coordinated response between the Bank and the Treasury. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear in a situation like this that we must act in a coordinated fashion.\u201d Asked by the Treasury committee chair Mel Stride if he is the right man for the job of governor during a time of crisis - given his reputation as slow but steady \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d - Bailey says he was anything but slow-moving during the 2008 financial crisis. Stride rather cheekily says there is a rumour that certain figures in No10 would rather someone else was in Bailey\u2019s chair today. \u201cI think I can say that I\u2019ve had a strong history of doing things very quickly and having to change course very quickly,\u201d adds Bailey (who was appointed by Sunak\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid). The IMF had previously expected China\u2019s economy would grow by 5.6% this year -- which is now Not Going To Happen. Last year China grew by 6.1%, which was the weakest in three decades. On China, the IMF says that its previous growth forecasts are \u201cno longer valid\u201d. Covid-19 will have a more significant impact on the Chinese economy than previously thought, MD Georgiava warns. But, she also expresses optimism that Chinese production levels keep rising as factories reopen. David Malpass, head of the World Bank, is appearing alongside Kristalina Georgieva. He warns that the coronavirus will hurt poorer countries harder, which is why the World Bank announced a $12bn package of loans yesterday to help them fund healthcare and other measures to combat Covid-19. Q: How much support will the IMF and the World Bank provide to Africa? Georgeiva says that the IMF\u2019s analysis of the coronavirus crisis shows that sub-Sarahan Africa is a particular concern. Malpass says the World Bank is speeding up its aid, and that \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d is available. Q: How about oil-producing nations in the Middle East? Georgieva says oil producers were already suffering from lower oil prices, and the IMF are looking into the impact on growth. With the coronavirus now a threat, these countries should use their fiscal buffers, and prioritise health spending, she adds. Q: How much growth is the IMF now forecasting for 2020? Kristalina Georgieva says the IMF is still working on its new projections, and will release them in the coming weeks (they were due in April at the Spring Meetings, which are now being held virtually). But she warns that the IMF has moved towards its \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d as the coronavirus crisis has intensified. As long as we do not know the duration of this outbreak, we will be in a higher uncertainty place. But on the upside, there are \u201cencouraging signs of mobilisation\u201d, and new targeted measures in place in several countries. They will soften the impact of Covid-19, and hopefully shorten the duration of the crisis. Q: So could we see a contraction in global growth this year? Georgieva repeats that the IMF expects growth to be lower than in 2019 (when it was 2.9%, but won\u2019t be drawn further. Q: Do you welcome the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency cut to US interest rates yesterday? Georgieva says it\u2019s important that central bankers work in a coordinated manner, and act where possible (depending on how much \u2018space\u2019 they have). What caused policymakers to suddenly galvanise themselves into action against the coronavirus? It is the sheer geographic spread of the disease around the world, Kristalina Georgieva replies. And also the knowledge about how the virus spreads. Unfortunately it is spreading undetected more than first thought, Georgieva explains. Plus, it is clearly not just affecting China, and the countries around it. The coronavirus crisis calls for a \u201cco-ordinated response mechanism\u201d, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva continues. The top priority for governments is to ensure that front-line health-related spending is strong enough to handle the coronavirus impact, she adds. And the IMF is \u201cfully committed\u201d to supporting its members, particularly the low-income countries at the greatest risk. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that global growth this year will fall BELOW last year\u2019s levels due to the coronavirus crisis. Previously, the IMF had predicted that global growth would rise to 3.3% this year, up from 2.9% in 2019. But that forecast has been torn up, due to the damage being caused by Covid-19 -- both to supply and demand across the world economy. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva is holding a press briefing now, where she explains that the Fund is \u201cwrestling with is uncertainty,\u201d and that defines our projections Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year\u2019s levels But how far it falls, and how long the impact will be, is difficult to predict. It depends on how the epidemic develops, and timeliness and effectiveness of policymakers\u2019 actions, she says. Georgieva also explains the Fund\u2019s 189 members just held a conference call -- which showed there is a \u201cclear commitment for action in a co-ordinated manner\u201d. She expresses the fund\u2019s deep sympathy for those affected by coronavirus: We are determined to act to reduce the risk and impact on people. Georgieva says that one-third of the IMF\u2019s members have been hit by the coronavirus. This is no longer a regional issue, it is a global problem calling for a global response. Georgieva predicts that the outbreak will \u201ceventually retreat\u201d. But.... we don\u2019t know how fast that will happen, and how the virus will respond when treatments and a vaccine are available \u201cat scale\u201d. Georgieva explains that the coronavirus shock is unusual, as it affects both supply and demand. Supply is suffering due to people falling ill or dying, and also due to the efforts to restrict the virus. Demand is also falling due to uncertainty and rising financial costs. These effects spill over across borders, she explains. One third of the damage will be direct -- from loss of life, workplace closures, and quarantine move. The other two-thirds are indirect costs -- including the tightening of financial markets and lower demand. Crumbs! German airline Lufthansa is grounding 150 of its aircraft, Reuters reports. It\u2019s another clear sign that the travel industry is experiencing weak demand, as consumers shun flights for fear of catching Covid-19. A Lufthansa spokesman says: \u201cWe are dynamically adjusting our plans to reflect extraordinary circumstances,\u201d According to Lufthansa\u2019s website it has 752 aircraft, so this is roughly a fifth of its fleet. Storm clouds are gathering over troubled UK regional airline Flybe. The FT is reporting that the government has rejected Flybe\u2019s request for a \u00a3100m loan to keep itself in the air. If so, that\u2019s a big blow -- Flybe has been pinning its hopes on a loan, after coming close to collapse in January. The coronavirus outbreak is obviously very bad news for airlines -- it means less demand for Exeter-based Flybe\u2019s routes between UK cities, and to Europe. But....this is also an interesting test of the idea that governments and central bankers should help companies survive the economic damage of Covid-19. Policymakers should use targeted measures to protect healthy firms (as Bank of America\u2019s Ralf Preusser argued)... but what about companies who were already in trouble? The latest US jobs data is a little mixed. The good news is that American companies hired 183,000 new staff in February, according to payroll operator ADP. That\u2019s more than expected. It suggests that US companies weren\u2019t panicking about Covid-19 last month. However, January\u2019s data has been revised down a lot -- from 291,000 to just 201,000. So overall, fewer jobs have been created this year than we thought.... Last week\u2019s market sell-off in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic has hit Legal &amp; General\u2019s solvency position, a key measure of its capital strength. The insurer said today its solvency ratio had fallen by 10 percentage points since the start of this year to 174% on 28 February. A level above 100% indicates insurers have enough capital, although regulators usually want to see a higher number. Insurers will face a two-fold hit from the virus outbreak due to increased payouts on travel insurance policies, for example, as well as investment losses. L&amp;G offers life insurance and pensions, and its finance chief Jeff Davies said the firm had \u201cvery little\u201d exposure to the epidemic. \u201cWe prepare and plan for a whole range of different scenarios both in terms of mortality and the market, the market is the big focus.\u201d L&amp;G is also encouraging staff not to worry about self-isolating themselves: Even before the coronavirus arrived, poor employee health has become the most frequent cause of disruption to businesses. That\u2019s according to the latest annual Horizon Scan Report, conducted by the Business Continuity Institute and the British Standards Institution and published today. It interviewed 665 businesses and found that illness-related disruptions were a bigger problem than cyber-attacks (previously the top problem). A third of businesses said they had faced disruption from health incidents -- with physical illness, mental illness or stress. But despite this, health worries only ranked 15th on a list of threats this year. I imagine it\u2019s rocketed to the top of many lists now! Rachael Elliott, Head of Thought Leadership at the BCI, says many firms weren\u2019t giving enough attention to workers\u2019 health (and now face a wake-up call). The Coronavirus outbreak is the kind of event that is both predictable and extremely disruptive \u2013 but its infrequency means it is considered unlikely to occur and so is often overlooked until its effects are all too apparent. This reality shows the importance and great value of taking time to scan the horizon and prepare for the unexpected.\u201d Hundreds of billions of dollars could be wiped back onto America\u2019s largest companies today: Wall Street is on track to recover almost all yesterday\u2019s slump when trading begins in 90 minutes....and Joe Biden can take the credit. Italy\u2019s stock market is also rallying today, as its government announces plans to shut schools and universities until mid-March. The FTSE MIB is up almost 1.5%. Supermarkets, pharmaceuticals companies and cleaning product makers are driving the FTSE 100 higher. Morrisons (+4.5%) and Sainsbury\u2019s (+3.8%) are the top risers as City traders grab a lunchtime sandwich. They should be benefitting from panicky stockpiling as Britons prepare for quarantine measure to be imposed. Astrazeneca (+3.2%) is also in demand, as is packaging firm DS Smith (+3.5%) which reported that coronavirus isn\u2019t impacting its operations. Reckitt Benckiser (+3.7%) is also among the FTSE risers. Last week it reported a surge in demand for its disinfectant products, Dettol and Lysol. But while 91 stocks are driving the FTSE 100 higher, there are nine fallers. Hotel chain Whitbread (-0.7%), food group Compass (-0.6%) and airlines group IAG (-0.3%) aren\u2019t sharing in today\u2019s rally. On the global economic front, growth in Brazil has slowed. Brazilian GDP only expanded by 0.5% in October-December, down from 0.6% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s better than the UK and Germany, who both stagnated, while France, Italy and Japan all shrank. But its another sign that the world economy was losing some oomph even before the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Britain\u2019s financial services regulator has said it has \u201cno objection\u201d in principle to City staff working remotely due to coronavirus quarantine measures. But, the Financial Conduct Authority says firms must take all reasonable step to keep operating effectively and support their customers. \u201cFor example, we would expect firms to be able to enter orders and transactions promptly into the relevant systems, use recorded lines when trading and give staff access to the compliance support they need. \u201cIf firms are able to meet these standards and undertake these activities from backup sites or with staff working from home, we have no objection to this.\u201d Over in the UK parliament, Boris Johnson has announced new measures to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the first day someone is sick, not from day four. That is designed to help households help with the coronavirus....and cut the danger that people keep working while suffering from Covid-19. But it\u2019s not immediately clear whether it will help gig employees workers or the self-employed, who often aren\u2019t entitled to sick pay at all. Johnson indicates that universal credit could help - but that often involves a wait of several weeks.... Our Politics Liveblog has more details: European markets are pushing higher, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 now up 112 points or 1.7% at 6830. That takes it back to last Thursday\u2019s closing levels (although it was also briefly higher yesterday). Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, spies anxiety in the City, despite this rebound. Markets are really worried about how the coronavirus disruption will affect corporate earnings, consumer spending and ultimately economic growth. \u201cA lot of precautionary measures are being put into place such as more people working from home, yet there are concerns about how that will affect productivity and spending,\u201d says There\u2019s no relief from the stock market volatility. Wall Street is currently being called higher, with the Dow up 500 points (or 2%) in pre-market trading. On Monday it jumped 1,293 points (5%), only to slump by 785 points (3%) on Tuesday. Ralf Preusser, global head of rates research at Bank of America, argues that interest rate cuts aren\u2019t the right policy response to the coronavirus. Instead, central banks and finance ministers need to take steps to avoid fundamentally healthy companies running into liquidity problems, because of the physical disruption to their business model and supply chains. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Preusser cited Italy\u2019s stimulus package, which includes credit lines, and delays in tax and mortgage payments in the areas affected by Covid-19. All these things are much more likely to be effective than monetary policy.\u201d Preusser adds that the ECB should consider \u201ctargeted liquidity operations\u201d -- ie cheap loan to help eurozone companies whose operations are being hit by the coronavirus outbreak. It could also boost its asset purchase scheme, to ease monetary conditions in the euroarea. Almost a quarter of British retailers are reporting severe disruption to their supply of goods as a result of the spread of coronavirus, a new survey has found. My colleague Mark Sweney reports: News that retailers are starting to struggle to maintain supplies of some products comes as a survey found that one in 10 people have already started stockpiling food because of fear of an outbreak in the UK. A survey from the consultancy Retail Economics has found that 24% of British retailers \u2013 ranging from food and fashion to health and beauty \u2013 say that supply chain disruption is having a significant impact on their business. However, only 7% of those businesses surveyed said that they had enough flexibility in their supply chain to be able to switch suppliers. The interest rates on UK government bonds has fallen to a fresh record low this morning. 10-year UK gilts are yielding just 0.35%, an extremely low rate of return, as investors pile into government debt. That\u2019s a signal that traders are feeling anxious - yields slump when the City expects a recession, or a prolonged period of weak growth. It\u2019s also suggests that some traders are anticipating a cut to UK interest rates soon. It also means the UK government can borrow very cheaply -- useful if Boris Johnson\u2019s administration decides to launch new infrastructure projects to improve long-term growth rates. Two more major European trade shows have just fallen victim to the coronavirus outbreak. The London Book Fair has been cancelled, after major publishers including HarperCollins UK, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette said they would not attend. It was due to run from 10-12 March, but is now off until 2021. More details on The Bookseller. And over in Germany, the Hannover Messe industrial fair has been postponed from April until July. Reuters has learned that European Central Bank policymakers held an unscheduled telephone conference call late on Tuesday to discuss their emergency response to the coronavirus outbreak. However, policy action was not on the agenda, they\u2019re heard. Instead, the eurozone\u2019s top bankers discussed how they\u2019d address a coronavirus panic - and ensure there are enough banknotes circulating. More here. Swiss bank UBS now expects the ECB to cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory at its meeting next Thursday -- or sooner. That would hurt commercial banks who leave deposits at the ECB\u2019s vaults. They had expected the ECB to hold fire until April -- but the coronavirus crisis is now forcing earlier action, argues Reinhard Cluse of UBS: In light of the 50bps emergency rate cut by the Fed, we are changing our ECB call. We now expect the ECB to cut rates by 10bps to -0.6% on 12 March \u2013 if not earlier \u2013 and not wait until 30 April as our previous call implied. In light of the Fed emergency cut \u2013 the next Fed meeting was originally scheduled for 18 March \u2013 and the G7 statement, we think the ECB can poorly afford to wait until end-April to deliver a policy response, even if the assessment of the economic fallout from the Covid-19 is not yet clear. European stock markets are rallying this morning, lifted by hopes of stimulus measures...and the results of Super Tuesday. Every index is up, with the FTSE 100 gaining 77 points or 1.1% to 6794. That\u2019s a boost for savers and pension-holders -- but still leaves the Footsie 8% lower than two weeks ago. Some investors are betting on more action from central banks and governments, following yesterday\u2019s US interest rate cut and Bruno Le Maire\u2019s call for fiscal intervention this morning. Joe Biden\u2019s stunning success in the Democratic primaries overnight is also lifting stocks, as the former vice-president proved he could yet challenge Donald Trump in November. Raffi Boyadjian, senior investment analyst at XM, says: After the Fed\u2019s unscheduled rate cut ended up creating more panic than allaying concerns about the virus impact, investors found some solace in the results of Super Tuesday where 14 US states voted to choose their favourite for the Democratic nominee of the 2020 presidential election. The big winner of the night was undoubtedly former Vice President Joe Biden, who made a remarkable comeback after a lacklustre start to his campaign. Biden now has more delegates than his main rival, Bernie Sanders, and this is music to Wall Street\u2019s ears, who have less to fear from Biden\u2019s centrist policies than Sanders\u2019 socialist agenda. US stock futures were last trading around 1.5% high. Economic activity in Hong Kong has also slumped last month. The IHS/Markit private sector PMI revealed a deepening recession, falling for the 23rd month in a row, from 46.8 in January to 33.1 in February, the steepest decline in history. Job shedding accelerated to its steepest rate in more than 18 years. More here: Just in: Growth across Britain\u2019s service sector slowed slightly in February, as the coronavirus hits sales. Data firm Markit reports that business activity, new orders and employment all rose at slower rates than in January. It says: There were a number of reports citing a negative impact on sales from the coronavirus outbreak, particularly to clients in overseas markets. The loss of momentum for incoming new business also contributed to the sharpest drop in backlogs of work since last September. This pulled the UK Services PMI down to 53.2 for February, from 53.9 in January. That still shows growth, but means some of the post-election bounce has faded. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the picture is mixed: On one hand, February saw future output expectations climbing to the highest for over four and a half years as firms remained optimistic that reduced political uncertainty in particular will help drive further growth. On the other hand, the survey also highlights the risks to the economy from the coronavirus. The outbreak was linked to reduced tourism numbers and lower travel and transport business volumes, but was also seen as having a wider hit to demand via reduced confidence and financial market volatility, as well as through supply shortages limiting the ability to fulfil orders. Uncertainty regarding the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU also lurks in the background as a risk to exports. The recent stock market volatility has helped to scupper UK shopping centre Intu\u2019s bid to raise over \u00a31bn in fresh funding. The cash call was always going to be a stretch -- given Intu has a \u00a34.5bn debt pile, and is struggling from the slowdown on the high street. This failure means Intu has missed the criteria set by its banks to grant a new four-year \u00a3440m revolving credit facility. More here: The coronavirus crisis has (understandably) hurt confidence across Europe\u2019s service sector companies. That\u2019s according to IHS Markit\u2019s latest survey of purchasing managers, which says: Business confidence regarding future activity was a little lower than January\u2019s 16-month high during February. There were reports from across the region of worries over the impact on business from an escalation of the Covid-19 outbreak. German companies remained the least optimistic, whilst those in Ireland were the most confident. More encouragingly, Markit also found that eurozone company growth reached a six-month high in February - with its eurozone composite PMI rising to 51.6, from 51.3 in January. Just in: The European Central Bank has banned all \u201cnon-essential travel\u201d by staff, including its executive board, until 20 April, as it responds to the coronavirus outbreak. The eurozone\u2019s central bank is also postponing all its conferences, apart from the monetary policy press conferences (to discuss interest rate moves and stimulus packages). It is also suspending all non-essential visits including its visitor group programme. ECB President Christine Lagarde says the moves will \u201censure the safety and well-being of our staff while maintaining a fully operational central bank and banking supervision function.\u201d This chart from Bloomberg shows the dramatic slump in China\u2019s car sales last month. Coronavirus has \u201cemptied\u201d car showrooms, they add: The outbreak has paralyzed the industry just as it was looking to gradually halt a two-year decline, with manufacturers now left with little visibility into when sales might recover. Automakers have poured billions of dollars into the world\u2019s largest car market over the past decades in a bet on its growth potential. China has also suffered its biggest monthly drop in car sales ever, in another sign of economic pain. New auto sales slumped by 80% year-on-year in February, the China Passenger Car Association reports. Astonishingly, that\u2019s an improvement on the 92% slump recorded in the first two weeks of February. It underlines just how much economic activity has been wiped out by Beijing\u2019s efforts to contain the coronavirus. Many dealerships were shuttered last month, as workers were sent home to quarantine themselves. Many factories also remained closed, which is likely to hit the supply of new cars. Overnight, we\u2019ve seen fresh signs that China\u2019s economy is suffering heavy economic damage from the coronavirus. Activity in its service sector slumped at a record pace, according to the latest survey of company bosses. Firms reported that total new business fell at the steepest rate on record, with domestic and overseas demand slumping. New export orders took a big tumble, as clients cancelled orders or cut travel to China. This dragged Caixin China services purchasing managers index down to just 26.5 in February from 51.8 in January. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction -- and this is a shockingly low reading. Zhengsheng Zhong, chairman and chief economist at CEBM Group, says: \u201cStagnating consumption amid the coronavirus epidemic has had a great impact on the service sector.\u201d French finance minister Bruno Le Maire believes that Europe may need to boost government spending to protect its economy from the impact of the coronavirus. Speaking on BFM business radio this morning, Le Maire said eurozone governments should be ready to use fiscal stimulus, if economic growth is damaged. Le Maire also predicted that Covid-19 will knock more than 0.1% off France\u2019s economic growth this year. That\u2019s a blow, as France contracted by 0.1% in the last quarter. He is also pledging to support businesses \u201con a daily basis\u201d, so that French economic activity could restart \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After days of market turmoil, policymakers are starting to take action to protect the world economy from the ravages of the coronavirus outbreak - as it threatens to turn into a global pandemic. Overnight, the World Bank announced a $12bn package of support for countries who are struggling to cope with the health and economic impacts of the global outbreak. These loans can be used to help strengthen their health systems and safeguard their populations -- with better disease surveillance and stronger public health interventions. Its president David Malpass says the World Bank Group is trying to provide a fast, flexible response to the crisis. \u201cThis includes emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance, building on the World Bank Group\u2019s existing instruments and expertise to help countries respond to the crisis.\u201d The move came hours after America\u2019s central bank yanked its own policy levers, with its first emergency interest rate cut since 2008. That failed to reassure Wall Street, where the Dow suffered another tumble (down 785 points by the close) But there are signs that investors are a little calmer today. European markets have just opened calmly, with the FTSE 100 rising by just 0.1%. Wall Street futures are signalling a rebound (although that could easily change!). With the global death toll from Covid-19 now at 3,190, we may see more policy intervention in the days ahead. Yesterday, the G7 said they \u2018stood ready\u2019 to cooperate further. The Bank of Canada is due to set (and probably cut) interest rates today, and further emergency rate cuts can\u2019t be ruled out. Indeed, analysts at Nomura think we might get an emergency cut in UK interest rates this week! We\u2019ll also get the latest surveys of eurozone and UK services sector companies -- likely to show signs that the coronavirus crisis hurt business last month. The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone services PMI for February 9.30am GMT: UK services PMI for February 2.15pm GMT: New Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s appointment hearing at parliament 3pm GMT: Bank of Canada interest rate decision",

I\u2019m so busy with the horses, I hardly think about it.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt just seemed such a simple fall, but I kind of fell under the horse and then he tripped over me. I had a compound fracture of my right leg, a broken collar bone and a few ribs and I punctured my lung. About a month after the accident, I still had my leg in a cast but I just had to get on a horse, to see if I could, so I rode around the roads.

The positive with her is that she won the same Grade 3 which both Limini and Laurina won before taking this. In contrast to the traditional National Hunt background, all four winners to date were trained by Willie Mullins and had started their careers in France.</p> \n<p><em>The Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide 2020, written by Paul Ferguson, is published this week and <a href=\"https://bettrendsshop.co.uk/weatherbys-cheltenham-festival-betting-guide-2020/\">available through this link for \u00a315.95</a>.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ab065ce2-2d9f-4651-a8d9-ec5f2478da56\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Catterick</b><b> 2.20</b> Pepper Street <b>2.50 </b>Django Django (nap) <b>3.20</b> Zoutoise <b>3.50</b> Las Tunas <b>4.20</b> Transpennine Star <b>4.50</b> Wishing And Hoping <b>5.25 </b>Anythingforlove (nb)</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield</b><b> 2.30</b> Golden Times <b>3.00</b> Renardeau <b>3.30</b> Pitcher\u2019s Point <b>4.00 </b>Al Daiha <b>4.30</b> Corvair <b>5.00</b> Percy\u2019s Prince<br></p>\n    <p><b>Kempton</b><b> 5.15</b> Star Of Bengal <b>5.45</b> Songo&nbsp;<b>6.15 </b>Be Fair <b>6.45</b> Cemhaan <b>7.15</b> Chares&nbsp;<b>7.45</b> Fujaira King <b>8.15</b> Griggy<br><b><br>Fontwell</b> <i>Abandoned (waterlogged)</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Rose Loxton, who used to show up in a lot of pictures alongside Kauto Star and Big Buck\u2019s during her years working for Paul Nicholls, is planning to have no fewer than three runners in the Foxhunter Chase on Friday week, giving her a serious chance of a first success in jump racing\u2019s biggest week. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it,\u201d she says, having answered the phone while riding out on Tuesday morning. \u201cI\u2019ve only got two racing bridles, I\u2019m going to have to borrow one from Paul.\u201d Victory would be an extremely welcome change of luck because Loxton has been in the wars. A horror fall in November 2018 sent her to hospital in an air ambulance with a laundry list of injuries and, while she was being treated, doctors discovered she was also suffering from cancer. Showing the toughness for which jump-racing folk are known, Loxton, born and raised on the Galway coast, is inclined to look for the positives. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t fallen off a horse, I would never have found out I had cancer. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of treatment, I\u2019ve had operations and I\u2019m still going in every three weeks to have what they call a management drug. That goes on for another three or four months, I think. Fingers crossed, the doctors seem really happy. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can cure. It\u2019s something you just keep under the thumb. I\u2019m so busy with the horses, I hardly think about it. \u201cIt just seemed such a simple fall, but I kind of fell under the horse and then he tripped over me. I had a compound fracture of my right leg, a broken collar bone and a few ribs and I punctured my lung. About a month after the accident, I still had my leg in a cast but I just had to get on a horse, to see if I could, so I rode around the roads. The children were furious.\u201d Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Ferguson Mares who started life in point to points and bumpers have a poor record in the Dawn Run Mares Novice Hurdle, which would be a negative for current market leader Minella Melody. The positive with her is that she won the same Grade 3 which both Limini and Laurina won before taking this. In contrast to the traditional National Hunt background, all four winners to date were trained by Willie Mullins and had started their careers in France. The Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide 2020, written by Paul Ferguson, is published this week and available through this link for \u00a315.95.",

In her own mind she stepped down of her own accord despite repeated phone calls begging her to stay on, and no one has as yet been heartless enough to break the bad news to her. Which is how she came to make one of the least self-aware and most self-indulgent resignation speeches ever heard in the Commons.</p> <p>It may even catch on. Last week we had Sajid Javid\u2019s statement, which was all the more powerful for having delivered a warning shot to Boris Johnson. Andrea\u2019s? Not so much. But if every third-rate minister who has been fired is now going to be awarded the primetime gig after PMQs to witter on about their non-existent achievements, then the next few months could get very busy. Priti Patel should probably book her slot now to avoid any future disappointment. It looks as if she\u2019s going to need it.</p> <p>After a swift jab at the former Speaker \u2013 she and John Bercow are united in their mutual loathing of one another \u2013 Leadsom settled down to a 15-minute dirge of denial. There were no telling points to be made or scores to be settled. Just a total rewrite of her career to raise it into the realms of mediocrity. It was as if someone who didn\u2019t know her very well had been asked to give the eulogy at her funeral and was struggling to come up with anything memorable.</p> <p>Even her closest friends squirmed a little as she tried to pass off her two failed attempts to be party leader as an act of supreme selflessness rather than a personal embarrassment. Other Tory MPs just stared at the floor, willing it to be over. The opposition was even less kind. Though it\u2019s customary to sit through these things in their entirety, Labour and SNP headed for the exits in their masses. Preserving their own sanity took precedence over precedent. By the end, Leadsom was pretty much talking only to herself. The story of her time in parliament.</p> <p>Still, the statement did serve one purpose in reminding the Tories of the bullet they had dodged. A part-time Boris was still a lot better than a full-time Andrea. Not that some Conservatives aren\u2019t beginning to have a few second thoughts about their choice of leader. Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority is rather more fragile than it may seem and if he fails to deliver on his promises, he \u2013 and they \u2013 are goners. Sooner or later, Boris is going to have to do more than just bluster.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn had opened PMQs with three straight questions about the coronavirus that yet again exposed how slow the government had been to react to the threat of a pandemic. Even with the experts \u2013 much to Michael Gove\u2019s annoyance \u2013 now onboard, Boris still doesn\u2019t have a credible response plan if things get noticeably worse. The jibes about him being a part-time prime minister are beginning to wound. Principally because they are true. Boris has never been into anything for the long-haul.</p> <p>There were no answers to how already overstretched hospitals were going to cope with an extra 2 million patients. Presumably Boris expects the 40 new hospitals to build themselves, cancer patients to go into spontaneous remission, and thousands of workers who have left the NHS due to ill health and stress to volunteer to put themselves at risk of contagion. While he continues to stay safe by working from home. No need for everyone to die.</p> <p>Nor were his reassurances that \u201cwe haven\u2019t yet\u201d reached a point where the police will stop investigating murders that reassuring. Give it a few days and you can top anyone you want. That bastard who lets his dog shit on the pavement? He\u2019s on borrowed time. As for the workings of statutory sick pay and universal credit, Boris was totally clueless. But then those are just for the skiving little people.</p> <p>Boris also appeared out of his depth when Corbyn switched to the ever-increasing number of bullying allegations being made against Priti Patel. He didn\u2019t seem at all bothered about the need for an independent inquiry and just said over and over again that as far as he was concerned the home secretary could do whatever she liked as she was doing an outstanding job terrorising both her staff and immigrants. The people had voted for a bully and he had given them a bully. He wasn\u2019t bothered how abusive or incompetent Priti was, he was going to stick by her regardless. Up until the point when he wasn\u2019t and chose to throw her under a bus. The more Boris praised her, the more uncomfortable Patel looked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Brexit done,\u201d Boris said randomly. No one on the frontbench had the heart to tell him they really hadn\u2019t. Brexit had barely started.</p> <p>PMQs ended in a moment of total absurdity when the hapless Peter Bone \u2013 what have the people of Wellingborough done in a previous life to deserve an MP like him? \u2013 tried to claim that Boris\u2019s visit to a hospital in Kettering had been done out of the media glare. It was just a total coincidence that photos of the trip had been all over the front pages of several Tory papers.</p> <p>Still, by then everyone was past caring. Especially Boris. He\u2019d already done his bit for one day. In fact, he needed to be elsewhere, so he persuaded Matt Hancock to chair the Cobra coronavirus meeting in the afternoon as he had an antenatal refresher course. After all, he\u2019d done the press conference the day before and that was more than enough for any prime minister for one week. If 600,000 people died, they died. No great biggy. Time for a lie down.</p>",

But then those are just for the skiving little people. Boris also appeared out of his depth when Corbyn switched to the ever-increasing number of bullying allegations being made against Priti Patel. He didn\u2019t seem at all bothered about the need for an independent inquiry and just said over and over again that as far as he was concerned the home secretary could do whatever she liked as she was doing an outstanding job terrorising both her staff and immigrants. The people had voted for a bully and he had given them a bully. He wasn\u2019t bothered how abusive or incompetent Priti was, he was going to stick by her regardless. Up until the point when he wasn\u2019t and chose to throw her under a bus. The more Boris praised her, the more uncomfortable Patel looked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Brexit done,\u201d Boris said randomly. No one on the frontbench had the heart to tell him they really hadn\u2019t. Brexit had barely started. PMQs ended in a moment of total absurdity when the hapless Peter Bone \u2013 what have the people of Wellingborough done in a previous life to deserve an MP like him? \u2013 tried to claim that Boris\u2019s visit to a hospital in Kettering had been done out of the media glare. It was just a total coincidence that photos of the trip had been all over the front pages of several Tory papers. Still, by then everyone was past caring. Especially Boris. He\u2019d already done his bit for one day. In fact, he needed to be elsewhere, so he persuaded Matt Hancock to chair the Cobra coronavirus meeting in the afternoon as he had an antenatal refresher course. After all, he\u2019d done the press conference the day before and that was more than enough for any prime minister for one week. If 600,000 people died, they died. No great biggy. Time for a lie down.",

      "body": "<p>Every prime minister has at some stage been <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpubadm/74/7407.htm\" title=\"\">frustrated</a> with the machinery of government. They feel it is not geared to delivering their manifestos or, in more paranoid moments, that civil servants are engaged in sabotage. But the current intensity of Downing Street\u2019s hostility to Whitehall is abnormal. Boris Johnson does not stoop to public attacks on senior mandarins, but his aides and parliamentary outriders talk about the civil service as <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/europe/britains-boris-johnson-takes-blob\" title=\"\">an enemy</a>. That view flows from the belief \u2013 not always wrong; usually exaggerated \u2013 that most civil servants thought Brexit was a mistake and approach it in terms of damage limitation. Mr Johnson wants the company of people who see only glorious opportunities in the UK\u2019s separation from the EU. That prejudice breeds impatience with evidence and disregard for people who rely on it. That is a recipe for bad government.</p> <p>Mr Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\" title=\"\">already lost a chancellor</a> by demanding that the Treasury surrender any independence from No 10. Sajid Javid resigned rather than tolerate institutional debilitation. Whether his successor, Rishi Sunak, puts up with it has yet to be seen. There might be gains in political efficiency from a submissive Treasury, but there are costs in downgrading a powerhouse of experience in economic policy. Suspicion of Whitehall also radiates from Downing Street\u2019s defence of Priti Patel, the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/03/dominic-cummings-fostering-culture-of-bullying-says-labour\" title=\"\">over allegations of bullying</a>. It is normal for the prime minister to take an ally\u2019s side when there are rival accounts of what has happened, but the anonymous Conservative \u201csources\u201d who have been pressing Ms Patel\u2019s case go much further. They accuse Home Office officials of campaigning against their boss because of her political stances. The ugly inference is that officials who say they have been bullied are lying and their motive is softness on immigration and crime.</p> <p>There is often a trade-off in ministerial appointments between competence, loyalty and ideology. Prime ministers like cabinets that agree with them, but also need departments to be run well. Mr Johnson seems uninterested in balancing that equation. What matters is belief in a project that sometimes looks as if it only exists to remake Britain as a regulatory autarky away from Europe. There is no room on board for people who are mindful of the risks. Since that is a function the civil service traditionally performs, the Brexit revolution must bulldoze its way through the established structures of government. Such is the ambition of Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, whose belief in the archaism and inadequacy of a permanent civil service is <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/europe/britains-boris-johnson-takes-blob\" title=\"\">well documented</a>. He thinks it lacks agility and imagination, which is often true. It is not true that a better system can be reached by waging total war on the system in place.</p> <p>The challenge of dealing with coronavirus is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live\" title=\"\">instructive on this point</a>. The politics of managing an epidemic demonstrate the value of expertise (in science and medicine) alongside the need for a professional bureaucracy (to administer emergency measures). The Johnson-Cummings doctrine denigrates those qualities, but relies on them in a crisis. Politics always contains tension between politicians\u2019 demand for quick change and the institutional caution of the civil service. Ministerial memoirs are full of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview11\" title=\"\">battles on this front</a>.

      "bodyText": "Every prime minister has at some stage been frustrated with the machinery of government. They feel it is not geared to delivering their manifestos or, in more paranoid moments, that civil servants are engaged in sabotage. But the current intensity of Downing Street\u2019s hostility to Whitehall is abnormal. Boris Johnson does not stoop to public attacks on senior mandarins, but his aides and parliamentary outriders talk about the civil service as an enemy. That view flows from the belief \u2013 not always wrong; usually exaggerated \u2013 that most civil servants thought Brexit was a mistake and approach it in terms of damage limitation. Mr Johnson wants the company of people who see only glorious opportunities in the UK\u2019s separation from the EU. That prejudice breeds impatience with evidence and disregard for people who rely on it. That is a recipe for bad government. Mr Johnson has already lost a chancellor by demanding that the Treasury surrender any independence from No 10. Sajid Javid resigned rather than tolerate institutional debilitation. Whether his successor, Rishi Sunak, puts up with it has yet to be seen. There might be gains in political efficiency from a submissive Treasury, but there are costs in downgrading a powerhouse of experience in economic policy. Suspicion of Whitehall also radiates from Downing Street\u2019s defence of Priti Patel, the home secretary, over allegations of bullying. It is normal for the prime minister to take an ally\u2019s side when there are rival accounts of what has happened, but the anonymous Conservative \u201csources\u201d who have been pressing Ms Patel\u2019s case go much further. They accuse Home Office officials of campaigning against their boss because of her political stances. The ugly inference is that officials who say they have been bullied are lying and their motive is softness on immigration and crime. There is often a trade-off in ministerial appointments between competence, loyalty and ideology. Prime ministers like cabinets that agree with them, but also need departments to be run well. Mr Johnson seems uninterested in balancing that equation. What matters is belief in a project that sometimes looks as if it only exists to remake Britain as a regulatory autarky away from Europe. There is no room on board for people who are mindful of the risks. Since that is a function the civil service traditionally performs, the Brexit revolution must bulldoze its way through the established structures of government. Such is the ambition of Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, whose belief in the archaism and inadequacy of a permanent civil service is well documented. He thinks it lacks agility and imagination, which is often true. It is not true that a better system can be reached by waging total war on the system in place. The challenge of dealing with coronavirus is instructive on this point. The politics of managing an epidemic demonstrate the value of expertise (in science and medicine) alongside the need for a professional bureaucracy (to administer emergency measures). The Johnson-Cummings doctrine denigrates those qualities, but relies on them in a crisis. Politics always contains tension between politicians\u2019 demand for quick change and the institutional caution of the civil service. Ministerial memoirs are full of battles on this front. Nearly always some accommodation was reached, and change happened. But Mr Johnson\u2019s team are playing a more dangerous game. They do not just see the civil service as inefficient at delivering their goals. They see breaking the apparatus of government as a goal in itself and its impartial staff as enemies to be crushed in order to complete a revolution. That would be a hazardous undertaking even in the hands of serious, evidence-led politicians. But Mr Johnson does not like having those around, perhaps because he is not one himself.",

      "bodyText": "Care workers could be redeployed to look after elderly people in coronavirus hotspots across the UK as officials investigate whether criminal records checks need to be loosened to fill vacancies left by sick carers. Whitehall officials have started talks with nursing homes and home care operators about how to pool workers in preparation for large numbers of care visitors and care home workers going off sick or self-isolating. The Department of Health and Social Care has asked providers whether the system of obligatory background checks for workers who have close physical contact with vulnerable people is a barrier to implementing the emergency plan, care industry sources said. Altering the requirement could also allow people who have recently left care work or retirees whose background checks have expired to be drafted back in without the usual weeks-long wait for approval, according to a Whitehall source. Care bosses have said that without emergency measures the projected levels of infection in the UK could force homes to close and residents to be moved to NHS facilities, causing considerable distress and increasing the burden on already stretched clinical services.

We are immediately establishing which staff and patients may need to self-isolate and be tested for Covid-19 should they be unwell.\u201d</p> <p>Two Australians have been diagnosed with a coronavirus infection that was acquired in the community and cannot be traced back to a source.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has passed on her sympathy to the family of a 95-year-old resident from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge at Macquarie Park, who died on Tuesday in hospital and tested positive to the virus. It is Australia\u2019s second death record from coronavirus after a 78-year-old who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess died in hospital in Perth. An additional six confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Sydney on Thursday brings the total number of positive infections in NSW since the outbreak began to 22. The new cases include a doctor who works at Liverpool hospital, a patient from the northern beaches, a man from Cronulla and a woman who is believed to have returned from the Philippines. \u201cThe female doctor who was diagnosed on March 4 had no history of overseas travel. We are immediately establishing which staff and patients may need to self-isolate and be tested for Covid-19 should they be unwell.\u201d Two Australians have been diagnosed with a coronavirus infection that was acquired in the community and cannot be traced back to a source. Both people worked with vulnerable people, including hospital patients and the elderly. There are now more than 40 confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia, prompting the federal government to tighten its travel restrictions in relation to Iran, with anyone who has returned since 19 February required to self-isolate for 14 days. On Wednesday the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said a 50-year-old woman working at the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility in northern Sydney had tested positive to Covid-19. On Monday, a 53-year-old doctor working at Ryde hospital was also diagnosed. The aged care worker became ill at work on 24 February, at which point she was isolated, and there is concern she may have spread the virus to patients and staff she was in close contact with in the 24 hours before that, Hazzard said. The woman is now stable and in isolation at Royal North Shore hospital. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most sick, so out of caution health authorities trace back an infected person\u2019s contacts to the day before they fell ill. As a result, 11 of the health worker\u2019s patients had been placed in isolation. Two patients had developed symptoms and had been tested for the virus, with the results due by Thursday. One of those patients was the 95-year-old woman who died. \u201cIt is concerning when we have somebody present with coronavirus and we can\u2019t track the source,\u201d Hazzard said. The aged care worker, like the doctor, had not travelled overseas. \u201cSo that raises the question, how did she end up with coronavirus?\u201d Hazzard said. The doctor had been in close contact with eight patients. Only people in close contact with the infected doctor and health worker are at risk. A close contact is considered to be someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes with an infected person, or in the same closed space with an infected person for at least two hours without protective gear. Once you remove an infected person and their close contacts from a facility or isolate them in hospital rooms, and disinfect surfaces, there is no longer any ongoing risk of infection. Despite this, people on social media are already speaking of avoiding BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Ryde hospital. Chant said they were ill-informed.

It\u2019s not because we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We ask that the community follows our messages.\u201d Meanwhile in Victoria on Wednesday, a man who has returned from Iran was confirmed as the 10th case of coronavirus in that state. Queensland confirmed its 11th case, a 26-year-old man who returned from Iran on 26 February. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said the man had felt unwell before the flight so authorities were tracking down people who had sat within two rows of him, to recommend they begin 14 days of self-isolation. They have already identified and isolated nine people who had close contact with him. Queensland Health is also awaiting test results on the housemate of a 20-year-old man who tested positive on Tuesday. The state\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, said it was unnecessary for people to stockpile supplies against the small chance that they would be asked to go into home isolation. \u201cIf you are required to be isolated for 14 days [the Queensland government] will put supports around you, the Red Cross as well as our health staff will be there to help you \u2026 if you run out of toilet paper the Red Cross will be able to assist you to get toilet paper,\u201d Miles said. Those most at risk of the disease are people with co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, cancer and diabetes, and elderly people. There is still no sustained community spread in Australia. Most of the 41 people diagnosed with coronavirus in Australia have recovered or were in a stable condition, but one man, a 78-year-old Western Australian, died on Sunday. All but the two NSW cases can be traced back to travel to an affected country, or contact with an infected family member who had travelled to an affected country. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said the extended quarantine order for Iran was due to the \u201cuncontrolled spread\u201d there and was being implemented \u201cout of an abundance of caution, but recognising that the situation in Iran is clearly far worse than has been documented and significantly higher than the recorded case numbers\u201d. Globally, the numbers have increased to more than 92,000 infections with more than 3,100 lives lost, Hunt said. \u201cIt has now spread to over 78 countries, with Ukraine and Morocco included amongst those new countries.\u201d There is still no need for members of the Australian community to change their behaviour.

Instead, it planned to put out a regional breakdown once a week, it said.</p> \n<p>It went down badly. Twitter users accused the government of a lack of transparency. Some said they would now be pulling their children out of school because they did not know where the virus was lurking (even though children are rarely infected).</p> \n<p>With anxiety at fever pitch in the UK, it probably was not a smart thing to do. It\u2019s clear officials are worried about the workload. The fact that the number of UK cases has risen by 70% in a day is not surprising, given that we are fairly sure, from China\u2019s experience, that each person with the virus will infect on average 2.5 others. The numbers will carry on rising, just as they are elsewhere in Europe, and many people will want to know where the hotspots are, on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>In fact, most infections are likely to be indoors in families. You won\u2019t contract the virus from somebody who walks past you in a shopping mall and probably not from the shop assistant either. It takes exposure to somebody\u2019s coughs or speech within a range of about two metres for 15 minutes to get infected.

      "bodyText": "In South Korea, those worried about new coronavirus cases can trace the commute and daily movements of infected people before their diagnosis by logging on to an app. In China too, you can track new cases as they are confirmed in real time and find out whether you have been on a flight or in a train with somebody who was later diagnosed. In the UK, however, as confirmed cases jumped by 36 \u2013 the biggest surge so far \u2013 the Department of Health and Social Care announced on Twitter that it would no longer be tweeting their general locations, let alone their travelling habits, \u201cdue to the number of new cases\u201d. Instead, it planned to put out a regional breakdown once a week, it said. It went down badly. Twitter users accused the government of a lack of transparency. Some said they would now be pulling their children out of school because they did not know where the virus was lurking (even though children are rarely infected). With anxiety at fever pitch in the UK, it probably was not a smart thing to do. It\u2019s clear officials are worried about the workload. The fact that the number of UK cases has risen by 70% in a day is not surprising, given that we are fairly sure, from China\u2019s experience, that each person with the virus will infect on average 2.5 others. The numbers will carry on rising, just as they are elsewhere in Europe, and many people will want to know where the hotspots are, on a daily basis. In fact, most infections are likely to be indoors in families. You won\u2019t contract the virus from somebody who walks past you in a shopping mall and probably not from the shop assistant either. It takes exposure to somebody\u2019s coughs or speech within a range of about two metres for 15 minutes to get infected. Most people who get ill will be infected by friends and relations. In South Korea, the apps and websites that developers have built to track people with the virus \u2013 using very detailed, if anonymised, information from the government about their movements \u2013 may not have the effect of reassuring the public. One of them, Coronamap.live, has a button labelled: \u201cSee whether I am safe.\u201d But most countries now are giving out locations and maps are being drawn \u2013 even in the United States, where, according to President Trump, there were initially no cases at all.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 5 March. Top stories Mike Bloomberg has quit the race to become the Democratic presidential candidate and Elizabeth Warren will \u201cassess the path forward\u201d after Joe Biden stormed to victory in nine states on Super Tuesday, overtaking Bernie Sanders with 553 pledged delegates compared with the Vermont senators\u2019 tally of 488. The former New York city mayor had spend more than $500m during a bumbling campaign that garnered just 50 delegates and won only American Samoa, despite an unprecedented advertising blitz. A rejuvenated Biden, buoyed by commanding wins in North Carolina and Virginia, and surprise wins in Massachusetts and Minnesota, crowed to supporters in Los Angeles: \u201cThey don\u2019t call it Super Tuesday for nothing.\u201d Faced with an unprecedented turn of events, Rachel Bitecofer asks how did Biden claim a stunning Super Tuesday surge, while Sanders hit a wall? And Ankita Rao writes reports on how Warren destroyed Bloomberg\u2019s campaign in 60 seconds. A second death from the coronavirus has been confirmed inside Australia after a 95-year-old woman died at a Sydney hospital. At least 42 cases have been confirmed across the nation, including transmissions that have happened locally. Around the world Italy has announced the closure of schools and universities as its death toll has passed 100, while the UK\u2019s chief medical officer has confirmed the probability of an epidemic there was \u201clikely\u201d. Meanwhile fears of a global economic slowdown have risen after a lukewarm response from markets to an attempt at stimulus by the US Federal Reserve. A federal government-backed economic stimulus package is expected within days as Canberra looks to protect the Australian economy from the fallout from the coronavirus through a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses. Economists have warned that Australia could slide into recession despite economic growth during the December quarter. Australia The conditions that fuelled Australia\u2019s bushfire emergency could become eight times more likely if global heating reaches 2C, research suggests. A team of international scientists modelling increased greenhouse gases also found that the risk of Australia suffering severe bushfires has increased four-fold since 1900. Australian Associated Press staff have been told that its major shareholders, Nine Entertainment and News Corp, no longer wanted to subsidise a breaking news service for their competitors. A critic of the decision to close AAP from June, Paul Hamra, said it \u201cgives more strength to the bigger players, and fewer voices\u201d. Residents of Norfolk Island say it is running out of food after the decommissioning of a ship by the main freight company servicing the island. Supermarket shelves have been without staples including rice, flour and toothpaste. The world Arab politicians are likely to become the third biggest force in the Knesset as another inconclusive election result appears likely in Israel. Joint List alliance candidates have secured 15 of the 120 seats, while Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party appears two or three seats short of forming government. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has ousted the nation\u2019s prime minister after less than six months in office characterised by political infighting and falling approval ratings. India has announced it will restrict the export of dozens of drugs including paracetamol and antibiotics, prompting concerns of global shortages of essential medicine. Seventy per cent of the ingredients used by India\u2019s pharmaceutical firms come from Chinese factories, many of which have been shutdown due to the coronavirus. Tropical forests are losing their ability to anchor carbon dioxide, raising concerns that inside the next decade the Amazon could become a net-producer of carbon instead of an absorber, owing to widespread logging. Recommended reads \u201cSelf-isolation\u201d during the coronavirus might not sound too bad to some as long as you\u2019re healthy \u2013 a little holiday where you can decimate that bedside pile of books, plough through Netflix and have the perfect excuse for the millennial\u2019s most beloved pastime \u2013 bailing on plans. But a period of convalescence gave Josephine Tovey a little insight into how lonely it can be and how much we will crave human connection while we\u2019re isolated. The Australian economy is ill-prepared for the impact of the coronavirus, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cGovernment spending and exports are keeping the economy afloat. Now that is fine as far as it goes, but when you are facing a global crisis that is affecting trade, then it means you need to fall back on your private sector domestic economy. And right now the domestic private sector is in dire trouble.\u201d It\u2019s the bestselling games machine of all time and, as the PlayStation 2 turns 20, Keith Stuart examines why it became so transformative. \u201cIt took developers time to understand the architecture of this forward-looking console \u2026 designed to generate large, explorable 3D environments and fill them with life.\u201d But by including a DVD player as well as a console, the PS2 became the first to graduate \u201cfrom teen bedroom to family living room\u201d. Sport Formula One is facing legal action from seven of the 10 teams after it reached a secret agreement with Ferrari that neither cleared nor condemned the manufacturer of illegality for the engine it raced with last season, writes Giles Richards. The Brumbies coach, Dan McKellar, is considering an approach from Rugby Australia to become the Wallabies forwards coach but for the sake of his club and the Australian team he should stay right where he is, writes Bret Harris. Media roundup Major resources companies will hold crisis talks over the coronavirus\u2019 risk to more than 60,000 fly-in, fly-out workers, reports the West Australian. The National Trust has raised major concerns about a proposed rezoning of a development area near Central station in Sydney, which could allow 200-metre-tall buildings to \u201coverwhelm\u201d historic landmarks, the Sydney Morning Herald writes. And local chocolate makers who re-bought the beloved Violet Crumble brand have had to introduce 24-hour shifts to keep up with demand, the Adelaide Advertiser says. Coming up Parliament resumes with the government seeking to pass legislation it says will give police faster access to data held by tech giants. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, will give his department\u2019s estimate of the coronavirus\u2019 impact on the economy when he faces a Senate committee. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 It was the mysterious glowing orb and a photo that launched a thousand internet memes but what ever happened to the globe at the middle of geopolitical mystery? According to a new book, the sphere is now in US possession \u2013 but locked away for fear of scandal, writes Martin Pengelly.

      "bodyText": "Emergency talks have taken place in Westminster between the Speaker and the government\u2019s chief medical officer about the possibility of parliament closing during the Covid-19 outbreak. The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is said to be concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, not only for the staff working in the building but because the Palace of Westminster is a major tourist attraction. Boris Johnson said more information could be released in the next couple of days on the advice for parliament, which employs 3,000 people, as well as for other large gatherings of people. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to speak for parliament but I\u2019m sure parliament will itself be led by the advice of the experts in terms of taking the steps it needs in order to protect the people that work there. \u201cDiscussions are already taking place with parliamentary authorities and scientific and medical advisers.\u201d Hoyle has had briefings from the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the director general of the House of Commons, Ian Ailles. The commissions of both the Commons and the Lords are due to meet on Monday, presenting another chance to discuss the virus. However, some MPs believe any talk of a parliamentary shutdown is premature and would be very difficult to implement. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a former deputy leader of the Commons, said parliament could be doing much more to safeguard against the spread of Covid-19 before it took such a drastic step. \u201cThere are early-days measures they could do tomorrow like toilets with hot water, and it isn\u2019t there. They should be thinking about it. There could be more hand sanitiser,\u201d he said. Bryant said emergency powers would also need to be voted on every 28 days and that would require MPs to come back to parliament. Another plan being considered is that Easter recess is brought forward in an effort to reduce the rate of transmission, he suggested. Before any such decision was made the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, would have to become involved. Many in the Palace of Westminster will be looking to his turn at the despatch box on Thursday for more guidance. The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said there were older peers with health issues who were considering not coming into the House of Lords. \u201cAt this moment I don\u2019t think they are running to the hills but if there are more cases in London and they rose significantly then perhaps this could happen but I\u2019m not aware of anybody taking that step yet,\u201d said Lord Newby.

In Los Angeles, frustrated voters waited in lengthy queues to cast their votes, prompting the campaign of senator Bernie Sanders to file an emergency request to extend voting hours. The last voter at Texas Southern University cast his ballot in the early hours of Wednesday morning after waiting nearly seven hours in line. Experts say a combination of factors are responsible for the long lines, but it was an alarming reminder of the extreme barriers Americans can face if they want to cast a ballot on election day. In Texas, advocates said the long lines disproportionately appeared in minority and student neighborhoods, areas most likely to vote Democrat at the general election in November.

Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of the Texas chapter of Common Cause, a government reform group, also said the lines were linked to a recent Republican-backed law that prohibits local election officials from opening temporary polling stations on college campuses and other places where it\u2019s difficult to get to the polls. Having more early voting sites available, he said, may have eased lines. He also said the waits may get worse in November, when voters will no longer be able to check a single box to vote for all the candidates in a party, but instead must fill out each individual race. At a late night press briefing in Austin, bleary eyed leaders of the Texas Democratic party voiced their frustration at local Republican party officials in a number of metropolitan counties who they claim had made voting harder on election day.

I know he says he wants to adopt the same values that the Labour party currently has, but what does that mean in practice?</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she trusted him to stick to Jermey Corbyn\u2019s legacy, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we need to see more detail, we need to see more meat on the bone in terms of what Keir believes in.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that in principle she thought it would be a good idea for the Labour membership to have the chance to reconfirm her as leader in another ballot before the general election.</strong> But it might not be practical, she said. Asked if she supported mandatory reselection for party leaders, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad idea. I think it would be quite disruptive potentially to do that in the months before a general election. But I certainly like your way of thinking. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She accepted that, if she lost the next general election as leader, there would be another leadership contest. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we have the general election, after that if we don\u2019t win the general election, then we\u2019ll have another leadership election.</p> </blockquote> <p>There was no leadership election after Corbyn lost the 2017 general election (although he had been challenged the year before.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said it was wrong to describe her as continuity Corbynism, because there was no such thing as Corbynism.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no such thing as Corbynism and this is one of the things that always irks me. There is socialism and there are principles in the Labour party. And if I continue them, then I\u2019m proud to do that. But I\u2019m certainly not a continuation of Jeremy Corbyn or indeed any other member of the shadow cabinet or previous leader.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said, when she gave Corbyn 10 out of 10 in an interview, she was passing judgment on him as a person, not as a leader.</strong> She refused to give him marks out of 10 as a leader.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She insisted she did have what it took to be prime minister. </strong>When this was put to her, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there\u2019s two elements to a leader. The first is being electable and resonating with communities and speaking the language of aspiration. The second is actually having the policies to improve their lives. And you need to have those two things, one doesn\u2019t come without the other. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected claims that at a meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee in July 2018 she sided with those opposed to the party adopting in full the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance definition of antisemitism.</strong><em> </em>She was in favour of that, and assumed it would be adopted, she said. When <strong>Andrew Neil</strong> told her that <em>\u201c</em>people who were in the room have told us that you stayed silent and you went along with those who opposed it\u201d, she said that there was no vote taken at the meeting and that she could not remember if she spoke on the subject. But she said she fully supported adoption of the definition.</li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewar</strong>t\u2019s story about the two interviews.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/04/keir-starmer-andrew-neil-and-long-bailey-keep-up-donation-pressure\">Keir Starmer: Andrew Neil and Long-Bailey keep up donation pressure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6009a68f085f0b8d942346\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T20:48:05.880Z\">8.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Keir Starmer's interview - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the main points from the <strong>Keir Starmer </strong>interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer said that the \u00a3100,000 donation to his campaign from the lawyer Robert Latham, that was declared yesterday, was the largest single donation he has received. </strong>His opponents have been suggesting that he has been concealing his wealthy backers because he has not yet disclosed all the people who have given money. Asked why he was not willing to name all his donors now, Starmer said he was following the procedure proposed by the party, and that donations had to be vetted before they were disclosed to the parliamentary authorities and published.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer implicitly accepted that he was not an extrovert, charismatic leader, but he claimed he could be effective and inspiring.</strong> When <strong>Andrew Neil </strong>put it to him that Labour needed someone \u201cwith fire in their belly\u201d as leader, Starmer replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It needs someone who can unite our party and bring it together, it needs someone who can effectively take on Boris Johnson at the despatch box, and it needs someone unrelentingly focused on winning that general election. </p> <p>And there are different ways to inspire people. You can inspire people so they want to sit at your feet, listening to your next word; that\u2019s not me. Or you can inspire people by building a team of people who want to come with you on a journey and change their party and their country ... That\u2019s the way I want to inspire people.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer did not deny a claim that he privately thought Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was awful.</strong> A recent <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyashton/keir-starmer-profile\">BuzzFeed profile</a> quoted the Labour peer <strong>Charlie Falconer</strong> as saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think [Starmer\u2019s] been appalled by the awfulness of the current leadership \u2014 not so much on policy but on the nastiness and the way they did things.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer accepted that he knew Falconer well. He said he challenged Corbyn in shadow cabinet. When he was asked directly if he was appalled by the awfulness of Corbyn, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We obviously got it very wrong in that general election.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He defended his decision not to criticise Corbyn in the leadership campaign, saying he wanted to unite the party and be positive</strong>. When it was put to him that he was frightened of saying anything negative about Corbyn, he denied it. He went on: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been running a very positive campaign, actually not just not criticising Jeremy, but not criticising the other candidates, because I profoundly believe that if our party can\u2019t pull together and unify, then we\u2019re going to carry on losing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He accepted that he had not said anything in the campaign unacceptable to the Corbynite left.</strong> When this was put to him, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I\u2019m not particularly interested in finding things that they find palatable or unpalatable. I\u2019m setting out my positive case, I\u2019m saying, we need to unite the party, we need to be a very effective opposition against Boris Johnson, and we need to unrelentingly focus on winning that next general election. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that his pledges to renationalise water, energy, rail and the Royal Mail would be in Labour\u2019s next manifesto - but he also described them as indicating the \u201cdirection of travel\u201d, implying a degree of flexibility.</strong> They were \u201cbaseline indicators of where we\u2019re going\u201d, he said. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lots of things are going to change between now and 2024. It\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019ll be leaving the EU without a deal. We don\u2019t know what the state of the economy will be. Manufacturing could well may take a hit, so we\u2019re going to have to craft that 2024 manifesto looking forward. My pledges are an indication to our members as to what I think is important, the direction of travel and what we will build on. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested voters in the \u201cred wall\u201d northern seats that Labour lost were not as opposed to EU free movement as people assumed.</strong> Describing conversations with voters in those seats, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We got to the nitty-gritty of it, which is, should people in this country be able to go and work in Europe, should those in Europe be able to come to work here; most people thought that was a good idea. When we got to, should families be able to live together, broadly speaking, most people agreed with that.</p> </blockquote> <p>People in those communities were more interested in infrastructure, jobs and decentralisation, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He defended his decision to give more credibility to people making sexual abuse allegations when he was director of public prosecutions. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me then explain how those guidelines came about. We were actually dealing with some of the grooming gangs up in the North West, and it came to my attention that some of those that we were now going to charge with very serious offences had previously been arrested but not charged. So I asked to see the file, because the question was, well if there\u2019s offences this serious, why weren\u2019t they charged.</p> <p>When I looked into the file I saw that we were dealing there with girls, 13, 14, 15, who had been passed around between men in the most appalling circumstances. I looked into the file and what I saw was good faith decisions made by the police and prosecutors, using assumptions about credibility. So they were asking themselves, did this person go straight to the police and tell them what had happened; and the reality was, none of these victims had ...</p> <p>So the assumptions that were being made in the criminal justice system were assumptions that were there for the model victim that doesn\u2019t [exist] \u2026 So it absolutely needed to be changing. </p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that Paul Gambaccini had accused him of ruining lives, by approving sexual abuse prosecutions that resulted in acquittals, Starmer said the Gambaccini case never crossed his desk.</p> <p>I will post a summary of the Long-Bailey interview next.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e60085f8f087df56e4c24bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T20:01:44.196Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: You believe in open selections.

Here is some reaction.</p> <p>From<strong> Jeremy Corbyn</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are two million workers on low pay, many of them women in the care sector, who are not eligible for statutory sick pay. The Prime Minister has not been clear whether or not they are covered.</p> <p>The government\u2019s emergency legislation must guarantee that the right to sick pay from day one will include those people who are not currently eligible for statutory sick pay, and that no one on social security will be sanctioned if they miss appointments. We will also be pressing the government to bring in further support for low-paid and self-employed workers, and those on universal credit.<br></p> <p>No one should have to choose between health and hardship. This is a matter of public health concern for everybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an important step forward for working people. But it\u2019s not enough.</p> <p>Two million workers still don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay. They can\u2019t afford not to work. And statutory sick pay still isn\u2019t enough to live on.</p> <p>Government must go further to ensure that no one is penalised for doing the right thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>From the SNP MP <strong>Marion Fellows</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am pleased that statutory sick pay (SSP) will now begin from the first day of a worker\u2019s absence instead of after four but the UK government must extend the policy further to ensure that sick pay is set at an hourly rate and available for everyone for 52 weeks instead of 28.</p> <p>Current rules around SSP are not flexible enough to meet real life needs, and fall far short of meeting a dignified standard of living \u2013 even with this new change. We must have a sick pay system fit for the 21st century which does not force people to choose between working while ill and hardship.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Laura Gardiner, a research director at the <strong>Resolution Foundation </strong>thinktank</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a welcome announcement that will go some way towards reassuring workers who need to self-isolate from the coronavirus that they will not lose all of their income by doing so.</p> <p>However, this extra support will not help the UK\u2019s five million self-employed workers who aren\u2019t entitled to SSP, along with around two million low-paid employees who don\u2019t earn enough (\u00a3118 a week) to qualify.</p> <p>The government should now extend coverage of SSP further to ensure that no worker loses all of their income from doing the right thing if they\u2019re affected by the coronavirus, and start a broader review to ensure we have an adequate sick pay system. It shouldn\u2019t take a pandemic to prompt this.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Mike Clancy, general secretary of the <strong>Prospect </strong>union</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While welcome this move will do little to help freelancers and the self-employed, who will be some of the hardest hit by self-isolation.</p> <p>Most cannot access statutory sick pay, so will still be faced with the dilemma of no pay or going to work when it may be putting their colleagues at risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Susan Harris, legal director at the <strong>GMB</strong> union</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government can and must now move fast to use existing powers under the 1996 Employment Rights Act to ensure all employees are entitled to full pay from day one during medical suspension due to coronavirus.</p> <p>Ministers should be supporting employers to do the right thing and help keep the British public safe during this unfolding crisis.</p> <p>This Covid-19 outbreak has exposed the woeful limitations of statutory sick pay \u2013 which is just \u00a394.25 a week.</p> <p>The current arrangements give people a perverse incentive to come into work even if they may be infected - as it doesn\u2019t cover the cost of housing or food.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5fd1958f08c2df6d27320e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T16:06:15.866Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Asked about Lord Reed\u2019s comments (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/04/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-brexit-urges-ministers-to-extend-statutory-sick-pay-to-2m-people-in-light-of-coronavirus-live-news?page=with:block-5e5fc2e28f08c2df6d273130#block-5e5fc2e28f08c2df6d273130\">3.20pm)</a>, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the afternoon lobby briefing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have said repeatedly we respect the independence of the judiciary and have no plans for the political appointment of judges.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5fc87f8f087df56e4c2125\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T15:50:04.323Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Using Huawei for 5G like letting Nazis build British radar in 1939, claims Duncan Smith</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It has been clear for some time that Boris Johnson faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/27/brexit-labour-boris-johnson-must-let-eu-boats-continue-to-fish-in-its-waters-if-it-wants-trade-deal-covering-banking-irish-pm-implies-live-news?page=with:block-5e2f11e68f0811db2faec2ae#block-5e2f11e68f0811db2faec2ae\">a sizeable revolt</a> from Tory MPs over his decision to allow the Chinese company Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. The government has said that the involvement of Huawei (or the involvement of \u201chigh risk vendors\u201d, to use the government\u2019s terminology) should be capped at 35%. The critics are demanding that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/05/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-bbc-could-end-up-as-defunct-as-blockbuster-unless-it-adapts-to-digital-era-says-culture-secretary-nicky-morgan-live-news?page=with:block-5e3ac2808f086a28115a6083#block-5e3ac2808f086a28115a6083\"> the 35% limit should over time be reduced to 0%.</a></p> <p><strong>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</strong>, the former Conservative leader, held a debate on this in Westminster Hall this morning and he said Huawei should be excluded from the 5G network within three years. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re in a mess and the only way to get out of that mess is ... to ensure that Huawei reduces from its present position not to 35% that the government wants but simply down to 0%. I recognise that may take a little bit of time but I say in the next two to three years that should be the purpose of the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Duncan Smith also claimed that using Huawei, which is ultimately answerable to the Chinese government, was like using a Nazi firm to develop radar in 1939. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can I just simply say, imagine in 1939 had we been we developing our radar systems, we decided actually to have one of the Nazi companies in Germany involved directly in doing it. This is the level. \u2018Oh, but we reduced to the 35% of the involvement, so only 35% was controlled by them.\u2019 I wonder how ridiculous that is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Westminster Hall debates do not involve debates on substantive motions. But they do involve government ministers having to reply, and the culture minister <strong>Matt Warman</strong> told MPs that the government did want to reduce its reliance on Huawei. Without saying when this would happen, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to reassure members that we share the ambition that our long-term goal is that our reliance on high-risk vendors should reduce.</p> <p>A timetable must be contingent on diversification in the market. Successive western governments have failed to ensure that there is effective competition in the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Huawei has repeatedly denied that its technology poses a security threat to the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56a594785c1cad354649637a598b598a4a39c984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56a594785c1cad354649637a598b598a4a39c984/0_121_1800_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Duncan Smith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Duncan Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T15:54:44.956Z\">at 3.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5fc2e28f08c2df6d273130\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T15:20:46.846Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US-style confirmation hearings for judges would be 'intolerable', says supreme court president</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Giving evidence to the Lords constitution committee this morning, <strong>Lord Reed</strong>, the president of the supreme court, said he would resign if the government tried introduce US-style confirmation hearings for judges. He refused to rule out quitting if the government introduced plans for a \u201cpoliticised\u201d judiciary. Pressed on what would force him to go, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sort of system they have in the United States would be unacceptable. I know some of the justices there who have gone through that process. It is really intolerable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last year, after the supreme court declared that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament was illegal, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/28/boris-johnson-interview-surrender-act-like-abject-capitulation/\">told the Sunday Telegraph </a>that \u201cif judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability\u201d. In what was seen as a hint that he favours US-style confirmation hearings for supreme court judges, Johnson said: \u201cThe lessons of America are relevant.\u201d</p> <p>Since then the government has backed away from this idea, although the Conservative election manifesto did commit the government to setting up a commission to consider \u201cthe relationship between the government, parliament and the courts\u201d. Last month, in an interview the day before he was sacked as attorney general, Geoffrey Cox said that one option might be to allow a parliamentary committee to interview candidates for the supreme court. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/12/pmqs-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-in-red-wall-seats-won-by-tories-to-lose-out-disproportionately-from-switch-to-universal-credit-report-finds-live-news?page=with:block-5e43cf038f0811db2faf620c#block-5e43cf038f0811db2faf620c\">He claimed a system like this worked well in Canada.</a></p> <p>In the Lords this morning Reed said he was not against greater political involvement in the appointment of judges, as long as the principles of appointment on merit and judicial political neutrality were preserved. </p> <p>But he said that confirmation hearings by MPs risked drawing judges into discussion of political issues. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is in the nature of the beast.

If there are allegations, of course it\u2019s right they should be properly investigated by the Cabinet Office and that is what is happening.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, when the Labour MP <strong>Matthew Pennycook</strong> asked if Patel would be expected to resign if the inquiry found her conduct had in any way fallen below that expected of a cabinet minister, Johnson went further. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The home secretary is doing an outstanding job delivering change, putting police out on the streets, cutting crime and delivering a new immigration system, and I\u2019m sticking by her.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his question, Corbyn said that it was wrong for the government to be \u201cjudge and jury\u201d in this case. And he made a joking reference to <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-historic-child-sex-abuse-spending-spaffed-wall-lbc-police-76367\">a phrase once popularised by Johnson himself</a> when he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overnight, further allegations have emerged that the home secretary repeatedly harassed and humiliated her private secretary while she ran the Department for International Development.</p> <p>If this is true, this suggests a shocking and unacceptable pattern of behaviour across three government departments - on each occasion, tens of thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers\u2019 money has been spaffed up the wall to buy their silence.</p> <p>Was the prime minister aware of these allegations? And if he was, why did he appoint her?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson refused to say whether he knew about the DfID allegations against Patel when he made her home secretary. And he refused to agree to any of the three things Corbyn called for: an independent inquiry, led by an external lawyer; a deadline for the report\u2019s conclusion, and a commitment that its findings will be published. (In the past the Cabinet Office has sometimes just published a summary of its conclusion, not its full report.) </p> <p>But Johnson did confirm that Alex Allan, his independent adviser on ministerial conduct, would be working on the inquiry.

In its document setting out its negotiating terms, it even says the fisheries agreement should be separate from the fisheries agreement. Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee, told Eustice this was unrealistic. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don\u2019t we potentially need to get real here. There is no snowball\u2019s hell in chance that the other side won\u2019t tie up the access to fisheries EEZ [exclusive economic zone] with the trade negotiation. They are bound to do it, they are going to do it, they have said they are going to do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Responding to Eustice\u2019s point about Johnson being adamant that he will not use fishing as a bargaining chip, Teverson also said that Johnson was just \u201chalf the equation\u201d in the talks.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice claimed that the EU would give up its attempts to link fishing with trade under pressure from countries that do not fish in British waters.</strong> Responding to Teverson\u2019s argument (see above), Eustice said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the European commission ... understand what an independent coastal state is. I think they will be realistic about what a sensible settlement looks like.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that \u201cdivide and rule\u201d did not work well in the first stage of the negotiations, Eustice said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are many, many other member states who don\u2019t have any access to our waters or our stocks. It would be quite a big ask for countries like Italy or Germany, who don\u2019t really benefit from access to UK waters, to say we\u2019re going to reject a trade deal on all those important industrial goods that they do seek access to the UK market for. So I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s sustainable for the EU to hold to the position that some member states have been articulating.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice said it was reasonable for the UK to refuse to link fishing to trade.</strong> Asked about the possibility of fishing rights being used as a bargaining chip, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t see that as a possibility, because they are very separate things. There will be a trade negotiation where we will be seeking access to the UK market in particular for shellfish, where we export quite a lot, but also other sectors such as lamb and barley in the food sector. And the EU correspondingly will be seeking access for Irish beef and Danish bacon and Dutch poultry and fresh produce from Spain and France and so on. So there will be a mutual exchange of opportunities in any free trade agreement ...</p> <p>How we manage a fisheries resource in a shared way, on some stocks ... is a matter for a fisheries agreement. And there really isn\u2019t a precedent for linking a trade deal in the round with sacrificing, forfeiting, your rights as an independent coastal state. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice was unable to explain what the UK government would do if French fishermen blocked the port of Boulogne in retaliation for losing access to British waters.</strong> </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that the UK government did want the EU to have reduced access to British waters</strong>. Asked if the EU would lose access, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, there will be areas where we will also reduce their access. So we gave notice to leave the London fisheries convention for a reason, which is because we want to reduce fishing pressure from foreign vessels definitely in the six to 12-mile zone. We want that to be reserved predominantly for our own fishing vessels. So, yes, there will be some change to access arrangements.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the UK had increased by five-fold its capacity to enforce its fishing borders (ie, its ability to keep out foreign boats).</strong> Giving details, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have significantly increased our enforcement capabilities. The Royal Navy introduced three new offshore patrol vessels, but <a href=\"https://www.forces.net/news/uk-retain-three-patrol-ships-uk-waters-after-brexit\">a decision was taken not to decommission the old ones,</a> so that there was additional capacity there. We\u2019ve also taken on some extra capacity from the private sector, to give us extra vessels. We\u2019ve launched a new joint maritime control centre, together with both Border Force and Coast Guard, so that we can make better coordinated use of the various assets that we have ... We\u2019ve trained a significant number, I think around 50, new fisheries protection officers to support us in this work. And we\u2019ve also taken out an aerial surveillance contract as well. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the UK had a \u201cvery strong hand\u201d in the talks.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have, as an independent coastal state, given the resources that are in our waters, we do have a very strong hand. And controlling access to our waters is a very powerful card. But in a very British way we will play that strong hand in a gracious and diplomatic fashion, as we always do.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T14:14:10.624Z\">at 2.14pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5f92828f087df56e4c1e88\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T11:37:47.761Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Supreme court president says he would like to enable MPs to better understand way judges work</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lord Reed,</strong> the new president of the supreme court, has been giving evidence to the Lords constitution committee. <strong>John Hyde</strong> from the Law Society Gazette has some lines from the hearing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohnHyde1982/status/1235154531769626624\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lord Reed, president of the Supreme Court, is giving evidence to a House of Lords committee.

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, hinted in the Commons yesterday afternoon that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/03/labour-facing-one-of-worst-local-election-performances-in-recent-history-leaked-party-report-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5e5e5b3d8f0811db2fb02c39#block-5e5e5b3d8f0811db2fb02c39\">rules on sick leave might be relaxed.</a> But now the TUC is stepping up the pressure on this issue, calling for emergency legislation to extend statutory sick pay (SSP) entitlement to the 2m people who currently don\u2019t qualify.<br></p> <p>In an open letter to Hancock and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, <strong>Frances O\u2019Grady</strong>, the TUC general secretary, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>More cases of Covid-19 \u2013 widely referred to as coronavirus \u2013 are being confirmed in the UK, as the Department of Health warns that it is highly likely that the spread could significantly increase. The government\u2019s own plans indicate that up to a fifth of the workforce may be off work during the peak of the epidemic.</em></p> <p><em>The government has confirmed that any worker who is required to go into self-isolation, quarantine or who falls ill with symptoms will be entitled to SSP.</em></p> <p><em>Because nearly two million workers in the UK don\u2019t currently earn enough to qualify for sick pay, many may find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Even for those who are eligible, the payment is still too low at just \u00a394.25 a week. And workers at present must be off sick for four days or more in a row to receive any SSP.</em></p> <p><em>These arrangements, if not improved, may lead to workers not taking the appropriate time off work, either in self-isolation to prevent infection, or when genuinely ill in order to avoid a financial loss. This is an impossible choice that has serious implications for us all.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>SSP is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay\">hardly generous.</a> The TUC is also urging the government to increase it to the equivalent of the national living wage, and to require employers to ensure that anyone who has to self-isolate at home on health grounds continues to receive full pay.</p> <p>We are likely to hear more on this topic at PMQs.

      "bodyText": "And here are the main points from the Rebecca Long-Bailey interview. Rebecca Long-Bailey accused Keir Starmer of not having clear policies. Asked about the policy differences between her and him, she replied: I don\u2019t know what Keir\u2019s policy ideas are, if I\u2019m honest. I know he says he wants to adopt the same values that the Labour party currently has, but what does that mean in practice? Asked if she trusted him to stick to Jermey Corbyn\u2019s legacy, she replied: I think we need to see more detail, we need to see more meat on the bone in terms of what Keir believes in. She said that in principle she thought it would be a good idea for the Labour membership to have the chance to reconfirm her as leader in another ballot before the general election. But it might not be practical, she said. Asked if she supported mandatory reselection for party leaders, she said: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad idea. I think it would be quite disruptive potentially to do that in the months before a general election. But I certainly like your way of thinking. She accepted that, if she lost the next general election as leader, there would be another leadership contest. She said: When we have the general election, after that if we don\u2019t win the general election, then we\u2019ll have another leadership election. There was no leadership election after Corbyn lost the 2017 general election (although he had been challenged the year before.) She said it was wrong to describe her as continuity Corbynism, because there was no such thing as Corbynism. She said: There\u2019s no such thing as Corbynism and this is one of the things that always irks me. There is socialism and there are principles in the Labour party. And if I continue them, then I\u2019m proud to do that. But I\u2019m certainly not a continuation of Jeremy Corbyn or indeed any other member of the shadow cabinet or previous leader. She said, when she gave Corbyn 10 out of 10 in an interview, she was passing judgment on him as a person, not as a leader. She refused to give him marks out of 10 as a leader. She insisted she did have what it took to be prime minister. When this was put to her, she said: I think there\u2019s two elements to a leader. The first is being electable and resonating with communities and speaking the language of aspiration. The second is actually having the policies to improve their lives. And you need to have those two things, one doesn\u2019t come without the other. She rejected claims that at a meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee in July 2018 she sided with those opposed to the party adopting in full the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance definition of antisemitism. She was in favour of that, and assumed it would be adopted, she said. When Andrew Neil told her that \u201cpeople who were in the room have told us that you stayed silent and you went along with those who opposed it\u201d, she said that there was no vote taken at the meeting and that she could not remember if she spoke on the subject. But she said she fully supported adoption of the definition. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about the two interviews. Thanks for the comments. Here are the main points from the Keir Starmer interview. Starmer said that the \u00a3100,000 donation to his campaign from the lawyer Robert Latham, that was declared yesterday, was the largest single donation he has received. His opponents have been suggesting that he has been concealing his wealthy backers because he has not yet disclosed all the people who have given money. Asked why he was not willing to name all his donors now, Starmer said he was following the procedure proposed by the party, and that donations had to be vetted before they were disclosed to the parliamentary authorities and published. Starmer implicitly accepted that he was not an extrovert, charismatic leader, but he claimed he could be effective and inspiring. When Andrew Neil put it to him that Labour needed someone \u201cwith fire in their belly\u201d as leader, Starmer replied: It needs someone who can unite our party and bring it together, it needs someone who can effectively take on Boris Johnson at the despatch box, and it needs someone unrelentingly focused on winning that general election. And there are different ways to inspire people. You can inspire people so they want to sit at your feet, listening to your next word; that\u2019s not me. Or you can inspire people by building a team of people who want to come with you on a journey and change their party and their country ... That\u2019s the way I want to inspire people. Starmer did not deny a claim that he privately thought Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was awful. A recent BuzzFeed profile quoted the Labour peer Charlie Falconer as saying: I think [Starmer\u2019s] been appalled by the awfulness of the current leadership \u2014 not so much on policy but on the nastiness and the way they did things. Starmer accepted that he knew Falconer well. He said he challenged Corbyn in shadow cabinet. When he was asked directly if he was appalled by the awfulness of Corbyn, he replied: We obviously got it very wrong in that general election. He defended his decision not to criticise Corbyn in the leadership campaign, saying he wanted to unite the party and be positive. When it was put to him that he was frightened of saying anything negative about Corbyn, he denied it. He went on: I\u2019ve been running a very positive campaign, actually not just not criticising Jeremy, but not criticising the other candidates, because I profoundly believe that if our party can\u2019t pull together and unify, then we\u2019re going to carry on losing. He accepted that he had not said anything in the campaign unacceptable to the Corbynite left. When this was put to him, he said: Well, I\u2019m not particularly interested in finding things that they find palatable or unpalatable. I\u2019m setting out my positive case, I\u2019m saying, we need to unite the party, we need to be a very effective opposition against Boris Johnson, and we need to unrelentingly focus on winning that next general election. He confirmed that his pledges to renationalise water, energy, rail and the Royal Mail would be in Labour\u2019s next manifesto - but he also described them as indicating the \u201cdirection of travel\u201d, implying a degree of flexibility. They were \u201cbaseline indicators of where we\u2019re going\u201d, he said. He went on: Lots of things are going to change between now and 2024. It\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019ll be leaving the EU without a deal. We don\u2019t know what the state of the economy will be. Manufacturing could well may take a hit, so we\u2019re going to have to craft that 2024 manifesto looking forward. My pledges are an indication to our members as to what I think is important, the direction of travel and what we will build on. He suggested voters in the \u201cred wall\u201d northern seats that Labour lost were not as opposed to EU free movement as people assumed. Describing conversations with voters in those seats, he said: We got to the nitty-gritty of it, which is, should people in this country be able to go and work in Europe, should those in Europe be able to come to work here; most people thought that was a good idea. When we got to, should families be able to live together, broadly speaking, most people agreed with that. People in those communities were more interested in infrastructure, jobs and decentralisation, he said. He defended his decision to give more credibility to people making sexual abuse allegations when he was director of public prosecutions. He said: Let me then explain how those guidelines came about. We were actually dealing with some of the grooming gangs up in the North West, and it came to my attention that some of those that we were now going to charge with very serious offences had previously been arrested but not charged. So I asked to see the file, because the question was, well if there\u2019s offences this serious, why weren\u2019t they charged. When I looked into the file I saw that we were dealing there with girls, 13, 14, 15, who had been passed around between men in the most appalling circumstances. I looked into the file and what I saw was good faith decisions made by the police and prosecutors, using assumptions about credibility. So they were asking themselves, did this person go straight to the police and tell them what had happened; and the reality was, none of these victims had ... So the assumptions that were being made in the criminal justice system were assumptions that were there for the model victim that doesn\u2019t [exist] \u2026 So it absolutely needed to be changing. When it was put to him that Paul Gambaccini had accused him of ruining lives, by approving sexual abuse prosecutions that resulted in acquittals, Starmer said the Gambaccini case never crossed his desk. I will post a summary of the Long-Bailey interview next. Q: You believe in open selections. Do you support that for the party leader? Long-Bailey says she does not know how practical it would be for the party to have a leadership election just before a general election. But she says in principle she can see advantages to the idea. Q: What would be different about you? Long-Bailey says they need to understand why Labour lost. The first was Brexit. The manifesto should have been fine-tuned. Antisemitism was a problem. Disunity was a problem. And Labour did not have a message that could compete with \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. And that\u2019s it. The interviews are over. I\u2019ll post reaction and a summary soon. Q: For Labour to meet its carbon targets, it would need to replace every gas biler in six years. How much would that cost? Long-Bailey says the party would be starting now. Q: Do you know how much that would cost? Long-Bailey says the manifesto commitment was to cut most carbon emissions by 2030. She says gas is more complicated. Q: You have not costed it. We have, says Long-Bailey. She says Neil can read the costings tonight if he wants. Q: It is a menu without prices. It is not, she says. But she says it is hard to know what the situation would be for 2024. Q: You did not call out antisemitism when someone made an antisemitic comment at a recent meeting. Neil is referring to this. Long-Bailey says she thought she had addressed this in her answer. Q: You did not call it out. Long-Bailey accepts that she should have done. Q: Should someone like that be allowed in the party? Long-Bailey says someone like that needs to go through education. Q: Starmer and Emily Thornberry have said you did not speak up against the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism at shadow cabinet. Long-Bailey says that is not correct. She did speak up. Q: We have been told that you did not call for the party to adopt the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance definition of antisemitism when the national executive committee discussed it. Long-Bailey says she did support that, and that it was assumed it would go through. Q: What policy differences are there between you and Keir Starmer? Long-Bailey says she is not sure. She says: I don\u2019t know what Keir\u2019s policy ideas are, if I\u2019m honest. I know he says he wants to adopt the same values that the Labour party currently has, but what does that mean in practice? She says she knows about his principles, but not about his policies. She says people need to see \u201cmore meat on the bone\u201d from Starmer. Long-Bailey says Starmer needs to show more \u2018meat on the bone\u2019 on policy because she does not know what he stands for. Q: You said when you were a candidate that you worked for the NHS as a lawyer. But you didn\u2019t. Long-Bailey says she was working for a firm that was working for the NHS. Q: Did you work on PFI contracts? Long-Bailey says her firm worked on those. She says such was the nature of the NHS, that could not be avoided. The firm worked on property. She says what she learnt about PFI made her realise how wrong it was. Q: But you said that your work at the time was defending the NHS? She says as an MP she has been trying to stop PFI contracts. Q: Michael Ashcroft is a Tory peer, but he is a respected pollster. He has been polling on what people think of Labour. He found 55% of people would be more likely to vote for it if it were centrist, but only 8% of people wanted it to be more leftwing. Long-Bailey repeats the point about Labour\u2019s policies being popular. Q: What is the evidence that if Labour moved to the centre, it would never win again? Long-Bailey says the Tories are trying to set a trap for Labour. Q: But you won elections from the centre. And the vote share declines, says Long-Bailey. Q: That always happens after a government has been in power. Long-Bailey says Labour lost touch with its voters. Q: You are continuity Corbynism. Long-Bailey says there is no such thing as Corbynism. There is socialism. Q: You want the same policies. Long-Bailey says many of the policies were popular. Too many were put through at once. There were days when the election when there were three or four a day. Q: So you are talking about just having a better wrapper, and not changing policy. Long-Bailey says the principles don\u2019t change. Neil says he is talking about policy, not principles. Q: You gave Jeremy Corbyn 10 out of 10 for his leadership. What would you have given him if he won? Long-Bailey says that was a cheeky interview. She was commenting on Corbyn as a person. Q: What would you give him for leadership? Long-Bailey says she won\u2019t give him marks It\u2019s \u201cnot Top Trumps\u201d, she says. Neil says she did give him marks in the 10 out of 10 interview. Rebecca Long-Bailey is being interviewed now. Q: The UK is facing a crisis. What is the biggest crisis you have handled? Long-Bailey says she drew up Labour\u2019s policies to address climate change. Neil says that was making policy, not handling a crisis. He tries the question again. But Long-Bailey sticks to the same answer. The programme is now showing an extract from the Lisa Nandy interview in January (written up by the Guardian here). Q: Labour has never recovered from a defeat this big. Doesn\u2019t Labour need a leader with charisma, with fire in their belly, who can inspire people. That is not you, is it? Starmer says there are different ways of inspiring people. He is not a leader who will say \u2018sit at my feet\u2019. But he will unite people behind a vision that can lead to victory. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. Neil is now asking about the child abuse allegations from the past pursued by the CPS when Starmer was DPP. He says Paul Gambaccini (who was unfairly accused) has said Starmer ruined lives. Starmer says that case never crossed his desk. He says it came up after he left the CPS. He says the situation beforehand was wrong. Cases were not being properly, he says. He says the rules about prosecutions needed to be revised. This is what the Press Association has filed on the Starmer interview. Sir Keir Starmer has declined to identify all of his donors, after coming under pressure to disclose who is funding his Labour leadership campaign. The frontrunner in the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn insisted on Wednesday that he was sticking by party rules on finances, but his rivals say they have gone further. Rebecca Long-Bailey and her allies have called for greater transparency from Sir Keir, with shadow minister Jon Trickett suggesting the delays were \u201canti-democratic\u201d. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir criticised \u201cthis line of attack\u201d when repeatedly pressed to reveal all of his donors during an interview for The Andrew Neil Show on the BBC. \u201cHow can you say I\u2019m hiding behind process when it\u2019s the Labour party process,\u201d Sir Keir said, when pressed on who his five biggest donors are. \u201cI\u2019ve got a compliance team in place who are checking every donation is in accordance with the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve done that they pass it to the Parliamentary authorities for them to publish it. So two lots have gone up, another lot is with the Parliamentary authorities as of today, I\u2019m following the rules.\u201d While not saying who his biggest donors are, he did, however, say that the biggest donation he has received was \u00a3100,000 from fellow lawyer Robert Latham, which was published on parliament\u2019s register of interests on Tuesday. Q: You are a bigger remainer. Doesn\u2019t that make you the wrong person to rebuild the red wall. Starmer says he voted for article 50. And he then spent two years trying to find a deal that would be acceptable. He says Labour has been losing in many of these places for years. He says he does not accept the view that, if it had not been for the Brexit policy, Labour would have won them. Q: Gareth Snell, who lost in Stoke, says he begged you not to adopt the referendum policy. He says that lost him the seat. Starmer says he knows that. But other candidates from similar constituencies, like Jenny Chapman who was MP for Darlington, are backing him. He says he has visited many of these seats. He asks people what they want him to focus on, what he should be reading on the train. They mention three things, he says: infrastructure; jobs with dignity; and decisions being taken closer to the people affected. Starmer reaffirms his pledge to keep Labour\u2019s manifesto commitments to take rail, water, energy and mail in to public ownership. Q: Why have you not set out details of all your donors? Starmer says he is following Labour rules. Candidates have to check donations are in order. Then they give details to the parliamentary authorities, who will publish them. Q: You seem to be hiding behind the process. Other candidates have published this information. Why don\u2019t you publish the figures now? People want to know who is funding you. Starmer says he has said that. It is individuals, unions and crowd funders. Q: Why not say who the five biggest donors are? Is that lawyer one of them. Yes, says Starmer, He is referring to a donation disclosed yesterday from the lawyer Robert Latham, who gave \u00a3100,000. Starmer says that is his biggest donation. Starmer says he has not received any donation bigger than the \u00a3100,000 one from lawyer Robert Latham declared yesterday. Q: People say once you win, you will move to the left. Is that right? Starmer says he wants to develop policies for the future. Q: 80% of members think you will move to the right. Starmer says he has seen that. Q: Can you identify any position you are taking in this campaign that the Corbynite left cannot accept? Starmer says he has been stressing the need to unite. Q: That is not unacceptable to them. Starmer says he does not want to pick fights with anybody. He is being positive. Q: You tried to undermine Corbyn on Brexit. Starmer denies that. Q: You said you would campaign for in and vote for in. That was when Labour was committed to a second referendum. Q: That\u2019s wrong. It was before. You said it in January 2019. Starmer says at that point the shadow cabinet was debating this. He says Corbyn was happy for there to be a debate. The Keir Starmer interview is being shown first. Q: Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to a devastating defeat. So why won\u2019t you criticise him? Starmer says Labour lost the last four elections, not just this one. He says there were four factors behind the defeat. (He explains them using the same terms he did in the Guardian hustings last week.) Q: Charlie Falconer says you were appalled by the awfulness of Corbyn. [That is a quote from this profile.] Were you? Starmer says he was in shadow cabinet. Corbyn is standing down. Q: The truth is you are frightened of criticising him. Starmer says that is not the truth. He served Corbyn. Sometimes he disagreed with him. When he did, he had it out with him, either in the shadow cabinet or in Corbyn\u2019s constituency office. He says he has deliberately been running a positive campaign. He has not been criticising other candidates either. The two interviews were recorded earlier today. Here is the BBC\u2019s story about what was said. And this is how it starts. Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey have been challenged about their electability and leadership skills in BBC interviews with Andrew Neil. Asked whether he had the charisma to transform Labour\u2019s fortunes, Sir Keir said there were \u201cdifferent ways to inspire people\u201d and his \u201cunrelenting\u201d mission was to return Labour to power. Mrs Long-Bailey said she had the \u201cbig ideas\u201d needed to win the next election. The pair also were also quizzed on donations and action on anti-Semitism. In separate interviews to be broadcast on the Andrew Neil show at 19:00 GMT, both the Labour leadership contenders committed to retain key policies from the party\u2019s 2019 manifesto despite its overwhelming defeat. Lisa Nandy, the third candidate still in the race, was interviewed by Andrew Neil in January. Most commentators thought (like this one) that she handled the encounter very well. The BBC is about to show the Andrew Neil interviews with Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey. They are on BBC 2. Boris Johnson has given the government\u2019s strongest backing yet for Priti Patel in the wake of fresh bullying allegations, insisting the home secretary was doing an \u201coutstanding job\u201d, as Jeremy Corbyn demanded an independent inquiry into whether she had broken the ministerial code. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has jumped by 60% to 85 cases, in the biggest daily increase recorded to date. For full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, do read our separate live blog about all the latest developments worldwide. Boris Johnson has promised sick pay from day one for all those with suspected coronavirus and hinted at further measures to stop gig economy workers losing pay if they need to self-isolate. Opposition parties and trade unions have said this does not go far enough. (See 4.30pm.) George Eustice, the environment secretary, has said the EU will abandon its attempt to make a trade deal conditional on the UK granting fishing rights to EU boats because many EU member states do not care about the issue. (See 12pm.) Judges are not staging a power grab to take over parliament\u2019s role and do not make up law \u201cas we go along\u201d, the new president of the supreme court has told a parliamentary committee. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, has argued that using Huawei for 5G would be like using a Nazi firm to develop Britain\u2019s radar system in 1939. (See 3.50pm.) He spoke in a debate where a ministerial promise that Huawei would eventually be phased out of future UK network failed to quell a brewing Conservative revolt over the issue. That\u2019s all for the moment. But I will be reactivating the blog later, at about 6.45pm, to cover the Andrew Neil interviews with Labour leadership contenders Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey that are being broadcast between 7pm and 8pm. The Guardian\u2019s latest Politics Weekly podcast is up. Heather Stewart is joined by Polly Toynbee, Matt Forde and Andrew Gimson to discuss the various crises embroiling the Tory government, from coronavirus to bullying claims. Plus, Paul Owen breaks down the results from Super Tuesday. At PMQs Boris Johnson announced that, in the light of coronavirus, the government is changing the rules to make sure statutory sick pay is temporarily available from the first day off sick instead of the fourth day. But opposition parties, union and thinktanks have said this does not go far enough. Here is some reaction. From Jeremy Corbyn There are two million workers on low pay, many of them women in the care sector, who are not eligible for statutory sick pay. The Prime Minister has not been clear whether or not they are covered. The government\u2019s emergency legislation must guarantee that the right to sick pay from day one will include those people who are not currently eligible for statutory sick pay, and that no one on social security will be sanctioned if they miss appointments. We will also be pressing the government to bring in further support for low-paid and self-employed workers, and those on universal credit. No one should have to choose between health and hardship. This is a matter of public health concern for everybody. From Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary This is an important step forward for working people. But it\u2019s not enough. Two million workers still don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay. They can\u2019t afford not to work. And statutory sick pay still isn\u2019t enough to live on. Government must go further to ensure that no one is penalised for doing the right thing. From the SNP MP Marion Fellows I am pleased that statutory sick pay (SSP) will now begin from the first day of a worker\u2019s absence instead of after four but the UK government must extend the policy further to ensure that sick pay is set at an hourly rate and available for everyone for 52 weeks instead of 28. Current rules around SSP are not flexible enough to meet real life needs, and fall far short of meeting a dignified standard of living \u2013 even with this new change. We must have a sick pay system fit for the 21st century which does not force people to choose between working while ill and hardship. From Laura Gardiner, a research director at the Resolution Foundation thinktank This is a welcome announcement that will go some way towards reassuring workers who need to self-isolate from the coronavirus that they will not lose all of their income by doing so. However, this extra support will not help the UK\u2019s five million self-employed workers who aren\u2019t entitled to SSP, along with around two million low-paid employees who don\u2019t earn enough (\u00a3118 a week) to qualify. The government should now extend coverage of SSP further to ensure that no worker loses all of their income from doing the right thing if they\u2019re affected by the coronavirus, and start a broader review to ensure we have an adequate sick pay system. It shouldn\u2019t take a pandemic to prompt this. From Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union While welcome this move will do little to help freelancers and the self-employed, who will be some of the hardest hit by self-isolation. Most cannot access statutory sick pay, so will still be faced with the dilemma of no pay or going to work when it may be putting their colleagues at risk. From Susan Harris, legal director at the GMB union The government can and must now move fast to use existing powers under the 1996 Employment Rights Act to ensure all employees are entitled to full pay from day one during medical suspension due to coronavirus. Ministers should be supporting employers to do the right thing and help keep the British public safe during this unfolding crisis. This Covid-19 outbreak has exposed the woeful limitations of statutory sick pay \u2013 which is just \u00a394.25 a week. The current arrangements give people a perverse incentive to come into work even if they may be infected - as it doesn\u2019t cover the cost of housing or food. Asked about Lord Reed\u2019s comments (see 3.20pm), the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the afternoon lobby briefing: We have said repeatedly we respect the independence of the judiciary and have no plans for the political appointment of judges. It has been clear for some time that Boris Johnson faces a sizeable revolt from Tory MPs over his decision to allow the Chinese company Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. The government has said that the involvement of Huawei (or the involvement of \u201chigh risk vendors\u201d, to use the government\u2019s terminology) should be capped at 35%. The critics are demanding that the 35% limit should over time be reduced to 0%. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, held a debate on this in Westminster Hall this morning and he said Huawei should be excluded from the 5G network within three years. He said: We\u2019re in a mess and the only way to get out of that mess is ... to ensure that Huawei reduces from its present position not to 35% that the government wants but simply down to 0%. I recognise that may take a little bit of time but I say in the next two to three years that should be the purpose of the government. Duncan Smith also claimed that using Huawei, which is ultimately answerable to the Chinese government, was like using a Nazi firm to develop radar in 1939. He said: Can I just simply say, imagine in 1939 had we been we developing our radar systems, we decided actually to have one of the Nazi companies in Germany involved directly in doing it. This is the level. \u2018Oh, but we reduced to the 35% of the involvement, so only 35% was controlled by them.\u2019 I wonder how ridiculous that is. Westminster Hall debates do not involve debates on substantive motions. But they do involve government ministers having to reply, and the culture minister Matt Warman told MPs that the government did want to reduce its reliance on Huawei. Without saying when this would happen, he said: I want to reassure members that we share the ambition that our long-term goal is that our reliance on high-risk vendors should reduce. A timetable must be contingent on diversification in the market. Successive western governments have failed to ensure that there is effective competition in the market. Huawei has repeatedly denied that its technology poses a security threat to the UK. Giving evidence to the Lords constitution committee this morning, Lord Reed, the president of the supreme court, said he would resign if the government tried introduce US-style confirmation hearings for judges. He refused to rule out quitting if the government introduced plans for a \u201cpoliticised\u201d judiciary. Pressed on what would force him to go, he replied: The sort of system they have in the United States would be unacceptable. I know some of the justices there who have gone through that process. It is really intolerable. Last year, after the supreme court declared that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament was illegal, Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph that \u201cif judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability\u201d. In what was seen as a hint that he favours US-style confirmation hearings for supreme court judges, Johnson said: \u201cThe lessons of America are relevant.\u201d Since then the government has backed away from this idea, although the Conservative election manifesto did commit the government to setting up a commission to consider \u201cthe relationship between the government, parliament and the courts\u201d. Last month, in an interview the day before he was sacked as attorney general, Geoffrey Cox said that one option might be to allow a parliamentary committee to interview candidates for the supreme court. He claimed a system like this worked well in Canada. In the Lords this morning Reed said he was not against greater political involvement in the appointment of judges, as long as the principles of appointment on merit and judicial political neutrality were preserved. But he said that confirmation hearings by MPs risked drawing judges into discussion of political issues. He explained: It is in the nature of the beast. They are not going to ask me: \u2018Do I like cats?\u2019 or, \u2018How do I like to spend the weekend?\u2019 What politicians are interested in is politics. The Press Association has filed more on what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman told reporters at his post-PMQs briefing about Priti Patel. (See 1.09pm.) The spokesman said: We\u2019ve had government staff contact our office directly with information and allegations about bullying in the Home Office by Priti Patel. The spokesman would not be drawn on how many people had contacted Labour, but said staff from the Home Office and other departments had contacted the party in the last 24 hours. The allegations related to Patel and another former minister, the spokesman said. They are bullying and harassment allegations of government staff and they simply build up the picture that has already accumulated in recent days. It is quite clear this is not an isolated allegation by one individual about one incident or one set of incidents. Patel has repeatedly denied bullying officials. The Scottish National party is reinstating an election candidate, Neale Hanvey, who was suspended for antisemitism before polling day, after he agreed to undergo training on antisemitism. Hanvey was dumped as the SNP\u2019s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath 14 days before December\u2019s snap election after he admitted circulating two antisemitic posts, including one from the Kremlin-sponsored outlet Sputnik. The Sputnik article about the Hungarian financier George Soros was illustrated with a cartoon of him holding puppets of German chancellor Angela Merkel and then US president Barack Obama. The second post was on Israeli policies with Palestine. He offered an \u201cabsolutely unequivocal\u201d apology once they came to light. Despite the controversy and the loss of the SNP\u2019s campaigning resources, Hanvey refused to stand down as a candidate and won the seat by 1,243 votes, toppling the incumbent Labour MP Leslie Laird, then Labour\u2019s shadow Scottish secretary. The seat, and a previous constituency it was partly created from, had been held by Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, for 22 years until 2005. Hanvey has technically been sitting in the Commons as an independent but was being reintegrated by the SNP group at Westminster before the party\u2019s disciplinary committee had reached a decision. He has been told his suspension will end in May, six months after he was first dropped as the party\u2019s candidate, after he agreed to do an education course with the Antisemitism Policy Trust. He told BBC Scotland he had been \u201ctortured\u201d by the accusations of antisemitism: I never intended to cause offence and it was a deeply upsetting experience for me. I can describe it as a moral panic, an internal moral panic. \u2018How can this be me?\u2019 Do you know what I mean, because it didn\u2019t reflect my values and I think the only thing that has kept me going is that I absolutely know \u2013 in a way that nobody else can understand \u2013 that I don\u2019t have antisemitic views at all. Asked whether his thinking had changed now he had studied this issue more deeply, Hanvey replied: My views haven\u2019t changed because I don\u2019t consider myself to be antisemitic anyway but my understanding of the sensitivities absolutely sharply developed. Boris Johnson repeatedly defended Priti Patel, the home secretary, during PMQs, despite the fact that only two days ago he ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into allegations that she has bullied civil servants. When Jeremy Corbyn asked about the allegations, Johnson said: The home secretary is doing an outstanding job, I have every confidence in her. If there are allegations, of course it\u2019s right they should be properly investigated by the Cabinet Office and that is what is happening. Later, when the Labour MP Matthew Pennycook asked if Patel would be expected to resign if the inquiry found her conduct had in any way fallen below that expected of a cabinet minister, Johnson went further. He replied: The home secretary is doing an outstanding job delivering change, putting police out on the streets, cutting crime and delivering a new immigration system, and I\u2019m sticking by her. In his question, Corbyn said that it was wrong for the government to be \u201cjudge and jury\u201d in this case. And he made a joking reference to a phrase once popularised by Johnson himself when he said: Overnight, further allegations have emerged that the home secretary repeatedly harassed and humiliated her private secretary while she ran the Department for International Development. If this is true, this suggests a shocking and unacceptable pattern of behaviour across three government departments - on each occasion, tens of thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers\u2019 money has been spaffed up the wall to buy their silence. Was the prime minister aware of these allegations? And if he was, why did he appoint her?\u201d Johnson refused to say whether he knew about the DfID allegations against Patel when he made her home secretary. And he refused to agree to any of the three things Corbyn called for: an independent inquiry, led by an external lawyer; a deadline for the report\u2019s conclusion, and a commitment that its findings will be published. (In the past the Cabinet Office has sometimes just published a summary of its conclusion, not its full report.) But Johnson did confirm that Alex Allan, his independent adviser on ministerial conduct, would be working on the inquiry. On Monday, when Michael Gove announced the inquiry, he just said that Allan would be \u201cavailable\u201d to provide advice. Earlier, when Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, asked a question at the end of PMQs, I wrongly referred to him as Nigel Dodds, who was DUP leader at Westminster before he lost his seat at the election. I\u2019m sorry for the error, which I\u2019ve now corrected. That was one of the less memorable PMQs, but it very much felt like unfinished business on the two issues that dominated. On coronavirus, Boris Johnson had a mini-announcement to make about statutory sick pay (SSP). (See 12.06pm.) But it did not really address the main concern about people losing out financially because they have to self-isolate \u2013 what will happen to the self-employed, and those in the gig economy? \u2013 and Corbyn sounded much better versed on the detail of SSP than the PM. But Johnson\u2019s statement is almost certainly not the last word, as he implied in his answer to Ian Blackford. (See 12.18pm.) And it will be interesting to find out what the government\u2019s distancing strategy means for parliament. (See 12.31pm.) Corbyn was probably less effective on Priti Patel. That was party because his attack lines, though perfectly coherent, were less effective than the crisp and forensic question on the same topic from Matthew Pennycook (see 12.26pm), and partly because it invited the predictable and not entirely unreasonable pushback about double standards. But Corbyn did get Johnson to give Patel his backing, and the PM went even further in his response to Pennycook, coming close to prejudging the Cabinet Office inquiry with his line: \u201cI\u2019m sticking by her.\u201d In the light of what the Labour party is briefing as I write, this is all starting to look like a well-primed trap. This is from the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson. I will post more on these new Labour allegations when I get more details. Leadsom says the last election showed that, when people said they wanted to leave the EU, they meant it. She says as a backbencher she will now focus on boosting early years education. She says when Johnson asked her to step aside, he gave his word he would back her on this agenda. It has been an incredible 10 years, she says. But it \u201cain\u2019t over yet\u201d, she says. And that\u2019s it. Her career may not be over, but the speech is. Leadsom says, after being defeated in the first round of the Tory leadership contest last year, she gave her wholehearted support to Boris Johnson. She was pleased to become business secretary, she says. She says the UK\u2019s climate change ambitions are not just about doing the right thing; there is also a huge early mover advantage, she says. Leadsom says it was tough resigning as Commons leader last year. But she could not support a bill that might end up endorsing a second referendum, she says. She says she was sorry to see Theresa May resign. She thinks history will judge her kindly. Leadsom is now talking about babies, and her longstanding belief in the importance of early years education. Leadsom is now talking about the parliamentary bullying scandal. She was proud to pull together a commission on this, she says. As leader of the Commons, she had a beautiful office, she says. But a rat lived in the bin, so she was happy to back the restoration and renewal bill. Leadsom is now defending her decision to pull out of the Tory leadership contest in 2016. It was amazing being environment secretary, she says. She recalls some of her ministerial achievements. And she says she backed Theresa May in her determination that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. Leadsom is now reminiscing about her career. (This is more of an after-dinner speech than a resignation statement. Resignation statements normally have a political edge. This one doesn\u2019t - at least, so far.) Leadsom says there were reports that she once told George Osborne to \u201cF off\u201d. There is only one person she might say that to, and the list would not include any former or current chancellor, or any current Speaker. That is a dig at John Bercow, the former Speaker, who had a terrible relationship with Leadsom and who once called her \u201cstupid\u201d in the chamber. Andrea Leadsom, the former business secretary, is making a resignation statement. She says she wants to make a statement about the importance of having women in politics. She says she has learnt a lot, including how, if you are asked to vote for something called a Fixed-term Parliaments Act, you should say no. She says she arrived in the Commons with three priorities, the three Bs: Brussels, business and babies. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, asks for a commitment that British business will continue to have unfettered access to the Northern Ireland market. Johnson says he wants unfettered access for Northern Ireland to continue. UPDATE: This post has been corrected, because originally it named Nigel Dodds as the DUP leader at Westminster who asked the question. Dodds did have that role, but lost his seat at the election. Sir John Hayes, a Conservative, says \u201cmalign, bourgeois, liberal judicial activists\u201d are putting at risk the government\u2019s law and order policies. Johnson says the government has already legislated on sentencing. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall asks how the country will be able to find new care workers when EU workers are excluded? Johnson says there are record numbers of EU workers in the country already. More can come before the end of the year. He has \u201cevery confidence\u201d the country can solve the issue of social care, he says. Johnson says that, if it is true that empty planes are flying just to retain landing slots, that would be \u201ccrazy\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Carol Monaghan says MPs operate in close proximity and meet people from around the world. They could be spreading coronavirus. What will the PM do to ensure MPs do not become part of the problem? Johnson says the chief medical officer will be making a statement soon about what might be done to delay the spread of coronavirus, in parliament and in other large places. Johnson hints that new procedures could be introduced for MPs to stop them spreading coronavirus to each other and to their constituents. Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire says Johnson\u2019s government defends bullies. Johnson says he loathes bullies. But he says he will not accept any criticism from this from a party that has tolerate antisemitism. Labour\u2019s Matthew Pennycook asks if Priti Patel will be expected to resign if the Cabinet Office inquiry finds that she has in any way fallen below the standard expected of a cabinet minister. Johnson says Patel is doing an excellent job, and he goes on: \u201cI\u2019m sticking by her.\u201d Labour\u2019s Ian Mearns says the five-week delay in universal credit leads to many social housing tenants being left in rent arrears. When will the PM stop this deliberate policy of inflicting poverty and destitution on tenants? Johnson claims universal credit is available from day one. (That is only partially true; claimants can get advance payments from day one, but those are effectively loans that have to be repaid.) Labour\u2019s Charlotte Nichols calls for a wider sentencing review, particularly looking at sentences for sex offenders. Johnson says Nichols is \u201centirely right\u201d, even though what she said was probably a \u201cbombshell\u201d for some of her Labour colleagues. Shaun Bailey, a Conservative, calls for investment in the police and tougher sentences. Johnson says this is what Priti Patel, the home secretary, is doing. Steve Double, a Conservative MP, asks if the government will back lithium extraction in Cornwall. Johnson says Cornwall has extensive supplies of lithium and he is glad it is being extracted. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford says up to 80% of the population could get coronavirus. He says the Bank of England governor yesterday proposed a financial bridge for markets to help them out. Will there be one for workers too, so they don\u2019t lose out financially? Johnson thanks the SNP government for its cooperation. He says he wants to ensure that \u201cno one, whatever the status of their employment, is penalised for doing the right thing\u201d. Blackford says workers need specific guarantees. He says workers should be told that they will be fully protected. And SSP should be paid at the rate of the national living wage. Johnson thanks Blackford for the tone of his question. He says the SSP will now be paid on the first day, not the fourth day. \u201cNo one should be penalised for doing the right thing,\u201d he says. He says the chancellor would be happy to discuss this further. Claire Coutinho, a Conservative, says UK carbon emissions have been reduced by a third. Johnson welcomes this. He says later today he will chair the first cabinet committee on climate change. Corbyn asks Johnson to commit to publishing the results of that investigation. He says there are now allegations about Patel in three departments. In each case tens of thousands has been \u201cspaffed up the wall\u201d. Why did he appoint Patel? Johnson says Patel is doing an excellent job. There is an investigation. But he will take no lessons on bullying from Corbyn, who saw female MPs leave the party over bullying. Corbyn says we have a part-time PM who covers up for bullies. Patel has been accused of bullying and harassment, leading to hard-working staff attempting suicide. He says Johnson has no shame. Johnson says Corbyn is a full-time neo-Marxist. He says he is proud of his record. He lists some of the actions taken by the government. That is just in the last 82 days, he says. He is getting on with the people\u2019s priorities. Corbyn asks if the right to SSP from day one, just announced by the PM, will apply to all claimants, and to people who currently do not get it. (This is an issue raised by the TUC - see 9.13am.) Johnson says some people will benefit. Some people will get help through universal credit. Corbyn says the PM is not being clear. If you go on universal credit, there is a five-week wait. He says public health should be a concern for everyone. He says the part-time PM failed to turn up on Monday to answer a question about Priti Patel. Will he commit to an independent inquiry into her, and give a date for when it will conclude? Johnson says there should be an inquiry. That is what Alex Allan, the PMN\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial conduct, would do. He says Patel is keeping the public safe; Corbyn opposes stop and search, he says. Corbyn asks if it is true that the police may have to give up some investigations because of coronavirus. Johnson says the government is not at that point. They are prepared for these sorts of emergencies. Jeremy Corbyn starts by congratulating Johnson and his partner on her pregnancy. He pays tribute to Salisbury, and to the medical staff working on coronavirus. Yesterday the \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d published a plan. He says it \u201cbroadly\u201d has Labour\u2019s support. But the NHS is struggling. What extra funding will it get? Johnson says the government has put in record funding to the NHS. He says the government has promised to give it what it needs. He says he has an update for MPs. The government is not asking people to self-isolate yet, but that may come. If they stay at home, they may lose out financially. So today he is announcing measures to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the first day someone is sick. Johnson announces plan to increase payment of statutory sick pay in light of coronavirus. Richard Graham, a Conservative, asks if there will be a plan to cover any cash flow losses from businesses caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Johnson says Graham is right. The government is monitoring the situation, he says. The action plan, the battle plan, already points to schemes covering this, like \u201ctime to pay\u201d. Boris Johnson is taking PMQs. He starts by saying it is two years since the Russian chemical weapons attack in Salisbury. Here are the main points from the evidence given by George Eustice, the environment secretary, to the Lords EU energy and environment subcommittee about fisheries this morning. Eustice was told to \u201cget real\u201d as he told peers the UK was determined not to use access to British fishing waters as a bargaining chip in the trade talks with the EU. The EU insists that the two issues - trade and fishing - must be linked, but the UK is resisting this. In its document setting out its negotiating terms, it even says the fisheries agreement should be separate from the fisheries agreement. Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee, told Eustice this was unrealistic. He said: Don\u2019t we potentially need to get real here. There is no snowball\u2019s hell in chance that the other side won\u2019t tie up the access to fisheries EEZ [exclusive economic zone] with the trade negotiation. They are bound to do it, they are going to do it, they have said they are going to do it. Responding to Eustice\u2019s point about Johnson being adamant that he will not use fishing as a bargaining chip, Teverson also said that Johnson was just \u201chalf the equation\u201d in the talks. Eustice claimed that the EU would give up its attempts to link fishing with trade under pressure from countries that do not fish in British waters. Responding to Teverson\u2019s argument (see above), Eustice said: I think the European commission ... understand what an independent coastal state is. I think they will be realistic about what a sensible settlement looks like. When it was put to him that \u201cdivide and rule\u201d did not work well in the first stage of the negotiations, Eustice said: There are many, many other member states who don\u2019t have any access to our waters or our stocks. It would be quite a big ask for countries like Italy or Germany, who don\u2019t really benefit from access to UK waters, to say we\u2019re going to reject a trade deal on all those important industrial goods that they do seek access to the UK market for. So I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s sustainable for the EU to hold to the position that some member states have been articulating. Eustice said it was reasonable for the UK to refuse to link fishing to trade. Asked about the possibility of fishing rights being used as a bargaining chip, he said: We don\u2019t see that as a possibility, because they are very separate things. There will be a trade negotiation where we will be seeking access to the UK market in particular for shellfish, where we export quite a lot, but also other sectors such as lamb and barley in the food sector. And the EU correspondingly will be seeking access for Irish beef and Danish bacon and Dutch poultry and fresh produce from Spain and France and so on. So there will be a mutual exchange of opportunities in any free trade agreement ... How we manage a fisheries resource in a shared way, on some stocks ... is a matter for a fisheries agreement. And there really isn\u2019t a precedent for linking a trade deal in the round with sacrificing, forfeiting, your rights as an independent coastal state. Eustice was unable to explain what the UK government would do if French fishermen blocked the port of Boulogne in retaliation for losing access to British waters. He confirmed that the UK government did want the EU to have reduced access to British waters. Asked if the EU would lose access, he replied: Of course, there will be areas where we will also reduce their access. So we gave notice to leave the London fisheries convention for a reason, which is because we want to reduce fishing pressure from foreign vessels definitely in the six to 12-mile zone. We want that to be reserved predominantly for our own fishing vessels. So, yes, there will be some change to access arrangements. He said that the UK had increased by five-fold its capacity to enforce its fishing borders (ie, its ability to keep out foreign boats). Giving details, he said: We have significantly increased our enforcement capabilities. The Royal Navy introduced three new offshore patrol vessels, but a decision was taken not to decommission the old ones, so that there was additional capacity there. We\u2019ve also taken on some extra capacity from the private sector, to give us extra vessels. We\u2019ve launched a new joint maritime control centre, together with both Border Force and Coast Guard, so that we can make better coordinated use of the various assets that we have ... We\u2019ve trained a significant number, I think around 50, new fisheries protection officers to support us in this work. And we\u2019ve also taken out an aerial surveillance contract as well. He said the UK had a \u201cvery strong hand\u201d in the talks. He said: We have, as an independent coastal state, given the resources that are in our waters, we do have a very strong hand. And controlling access to our waters is a very powerful card. But in a very British way we will play that strong hand in a gracious and diplomatic fashion, as we always do. Lord Reed, the new president of the supreme court, has been giving evidence to the Lords constitution committee. John Hyde from the Law Society Gazette has some lines from the hearing. The Lords committee hearing with George Eustice is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Will the devolved authorities be in the room for the negotiation with the EU, and for the annual fisheries negotiations with the EU? Eustice says the former is a reserved matter. The devolved administrations will not be in the room, and they will not have a veto. But they will be consulted. But, in the annual negotiations, representatives from the devolved administrations will be included as part of the negotiating delegation. That has been a tradition in the past, he says. Q: What will be the process for involving the devolved administrations in getting a deal with the EU? And will they be in the room? Eustice says there will be a lot of \u201cclose engagement\u201d with the devolved administrations on the trade agreement, and on the fisheries agreement. But it is a reserved matter for the UK government, he says. Eustice says he is reasonably confident that the EU will agree to \u201czonal attachment\u201d as a basis for deciding how fishing stocks are shared. Lord Kerr goes next. He points out that, if French fishermen were to block Boulogne, it would not just be fishing that would suffer. Q: Is there a back-up plan if you need more resources to police UK waters? Eustice says enforcement capacity has been increased by five-fold. It was based around the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. That is not a danger now, he says. He says the UK has a deal, the withdrawal agreement. And there will now have to be annual negotiations with the EU. Q: But what happens if this five-fold increase is not enough? Neil Hornby, director of marine and fisheries at Defra, who is giving evidence alongside Eustice, says if necessary the government could bring in other boats, such as Border Force vessels or naval vessels. Eustice says the government has significantly increased its enforcement capabilities. It has obtained three new offshore patrol vessels - and decided not to decommission old ones. And it has commissioned enforcement capability from the private sector. Lord Teverson tells Eustice he needs to \u201cget real\u201d. There is \u201cnot a snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d that the EU won\u2019t tie fisheries access to trade. Eustice says this is what some EU countries want. But he says he expects the EU to be realistic. Q: Divide and rule? That did not work in the earlier negotiation, did it? Eustice says it would be quite a big ask for the EU to expect countries like Italy, which do not access UK waters, to be happy to see a trade deal lost on this point. Teverson says France is quite a big player in the EU. Eustice repeats the point about the UK having a strong hand to play. But he says that it will play this hand \u201cin a graceful way\u201d. Lord Kerr, the crossbencher and former diplomat, goes next. Q: The EU is clearly saying in its negotiating mandate that it does see a link between trade and fisheries. Do you intend to reduce EU access to UK waters? Eustice says the UK wants to ensure that access is determined by a more scientific way of assessing fishing stocks. But he also says there will be areas where the UK will want to reduce access. Q: Is it your intention to reduce the EU fleet\u2019s access to UK waters? Eustice says there will be some reduction of access, particularly to inshore waters. But he says it is too early to give an overall answer. Eustice says EU will lose some access to UK fishing waters from next year. Q: If the UK does reduce EU access to our waters, will it be as easy for the UK to restrict their access to our waters as it will be for French fishermen to block UK access to a port like Boulogne. Eustice says the UK already does some enforcement around its waters. The EU does not have any enforcement capability. The UK takes enforcement action against boats from the Faroe Islands. He says the lesson from the cod wars with Iceland is that it is easier to police access to your waters than to retaliate through trade measures. Q: There have been suggestions that some fishing rights could be traded away in the trade bill? Eustice says he does not see that as a possibility. There is a trade negotiation with the EU, and there will be \u201ca mutual exchange of opportunities\u201d in that deal. But how the UK manages a fisheries resource is a matter for a fisheries agreement, he says. He says the two issues are separate. He says the PM has ruled out using fishing as a bargaining chip. Eustice says the legal position is set out very clearly in Unclos - the UN convention for the law of the sea. He says Unclos says, when fisheries rights are considered, some regard should be paid for historic fishing rights. But he says this does not amount to a legal right for EU countries to maintain the access they currently have. Eustice says the EU knows what it means for a country to be an independent coastal state. The EU conducts annual negotiations on fisheries with Norway. But he says the EU\u2019s demand for long-term access to UK waters is a political ask, not a legal ask. Eustice says there will always have to be annual negotiations with the EU, because fish stocks are assessed annually. But he says it remains to be seen whether there will be a long-term agreement too. UPDATE: This is from Politico\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. George Eustice, the environment secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Lords energy and environment subcommittee on the fisheries negotiation with the EU. Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee, asks Eustice what the UK wants from the negotiation. Eustice says the UK wants an arrangement like Norway\u2019s on fisheries. Q: Are you optimistic about getting an agreement by 1 July? Eustice says he is optimistic. He says the legal baseline provides for the UK becoming an independent coastal state. It would take back control of its waters, and there would be an obligation on both sides to work towards having an annual negotiation. Q: So we have all the cards in our hand? Eustice says \u201caccess is a powerful card\u201d. At the moment the UK is only entitled to catch around half the fish in its waters. That will change from next year, he says. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says the Treasury should not be waiting until the budget, which is scheduled for a week today (11 March), to produce plans for coronavirus. In a statement he said: There is no sense of urgency from the chancellor in his response to the potential economic impacts of coronavirus. We cannot wait another week until the budget to have a plan published. People, businesses and the markets need clarity now that the government has a comprehensive economic plan in place. We awaited a detailed economic plan but the sum total of economic thinking in the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan is a restatement of existing HMRC policy. The chancellor has failed to outline how he will respond to potential consequences for production, consumption, and GDP, or provide support for vulnerable workers. The public will be disappointed that the chancellor does not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation facing the economy, and he must urgently issue a plan from a Treasury perspective of the kind that Labour published on Monday. According to Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, Andrea Leadsom, the former business secretary, is planning to make a resignation statement in the Commons after PMQs today. Last week Sajid Javid delivered a resignation statement in the post-PMQs slot. Boris Johnson was mostly applauded by the punditocracy yesterday for the way he presented the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan but he, and other ministers, have been unable to answer a series of questions about what they will do to help workers who lose pay because they have to self-isolate at home - beyond saying that these issues are being kept under review. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, hinted in the Commons yesterday afternoon that rules on sick leave might be relaxed. But now the TUC is stepping up the pressure on this issue, calling for emergency legislation to extend statutory sick pay (SSP) entitlement to the 2m people who currently don\u2019t qualify. In an open letter to Hancock and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, says: More cases of Covid-19 \u2013 widely referred to as coronavirus \u2013 are being confirmed in the UK, as the Department of Health warns that it is highly likely that the spread could significantly increase. The government\u2019s own plans indicate that up to a fifth of the workforce may be off work during the peak of the epidemic. The government has confirmed that any worker who is required to go into self-isolation, quarantine or who falls ill with symptoms will be entitled to SSP. Because nearly two million workers in the UK don\u2019t currently earn enough to qualify for sick pay, many may find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Even for those who are eligible, the payment is still too low at just \u00a394.25 a week. And workers at present must be off sick for four days or more in a row to receive any SSP. These arrangements, if not improved, may lead to workers not taking the appropriate time off work, either in self-isolation to prevent infection, or when genuinely ill in order to avoid a financial loss. This is an impossible choice that has serious implications for us all. SSP is hardly generous. The TUC is also urging the government to increase it to the equivalent of the national living wage, and to require employers to ensure that anyone who has to self-isolate at home on health grounds continues to receive full pay. We are likely to hear more on this topic at PMQs. Of course, the ramifications of coronavirus go much wider than this, and our main coverage is on our coronavirus outbreak live blog, which is here. As usual, I will be focusing on Westminster politics. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Resolution Foundation thinktank publishes a report on infrastructure. 10am: George Eustice, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU energy and environment subcommittee about the negotiation on fisheries with the EU. 10.30am: Lord Reed, the new president of the supreme court, and Lord Hodge, the deputy president, give evidence to the Lords constitution committee. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.15pm: Andrew Bailey, the incoming governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 2.30pm: Bernadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the Department for Transport and Mark Thurston, chief executive officer at HS2, give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The package, expected within days, comes as economists warn that the country is at risk of falling into recession, despite the latest national accounts figures showing the economy grew by 0.5% in the December quarter. Following the rate cut, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was finalising its response to the coronavirus outbreak, with the severity of the downturn expected to be outlined in a meeting with the International Monetary Fund and Treasury officials on Wednesday night. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, will update parliament on the growth forecasts when he fronts Senate estimates on Thursday morning. Revealing the quarterly national accounts, Frydenberg said the government was again looking at the deeming rate, which was last cut in July last year, costing the budget $600m. \u201cIt is also difficult, I have to say, for people who are depositors, and that is something that the government is also considering,\u201d Frydenberg said. The deeming rate is the amount the government deems your income to be from your financial assets and calculates the amount of income received from a financial asset regardless of the actual return. As business groups called on the government to act urgently to address the hit to business from the virus outbreak, Frydenberg said a new business investment allowance was likely. \u201cAs for an investment allowance, this is obviously under very serious consideration (and) this is something that the business community has asked for and if you look abroad some other countries have put in place fiscal responses which include support for business and investment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want \u2026 Australian businesses to get this support through this economic shock, but when we are over this economic shock we want the Australian economy to be stronger, we want to have greater productivity, and investment is a key part of that.\u201d A roundtable of business groups that met in Canberra on Wednesday issued a statement warning that financial assistance measures were needed \u2018early and hard\u2019 to prevent the closure of businesses. \u201cSmall business \u2018lives and dies\u2019 on cashflow. The failure of cashflow is the single biggest cause of small business closure and consequent loss of employment,\u201d the group said. \u201cGiven the flow-on effects, assistance to small businesses impacted by Covid-19 must seek to underpin cashflow so that businesses continue to remain viable and retain staff in the face of any dramatic falls in revenue.\u201d The group is calling for direct cash grants, tax breaks, wage assistance and regional stimulus. The Australian Tourism Industry Council is also pushing the government for immediate financial support for affected businesses, and extra funding for Tourism Australia to spend on promoting domestic tourism. Following the release of the December quarter figures, the Oxford Economics chief economist, Sarah Hunter, said the 0.5% growth recorded for the three months to the end of December was better than expected \u2013 but it was likely that there would be no growth, or a shrinking economy, recorded for the first three months of the year. She said the coronavirus outbreak increased the chance of a recession \u2013 two or more consecutive quarters in which the economy shrinks. \u201cPre all of this, at the end of last year, I would have said the chance of a recession is very, very low,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now obviously everything is changing and we\u2019re only just getting some data points through to get an idea of the size of the shock.\u201d She said the \u201cbest case\u201d for the first three months of the year was zero growth in gross domestic product. \u201cI think though we could easily see a contraction in the economy, in economic activity, just based on the hit to services ... the tourism channel of course and the business channel. \u201cAs we go through March we\u2019re going to see more and more of the supply chain issues coming through.\u201d Spending on retail and eating out would also fall, she said. \u201cAnd also, not to forget, it does get lost at the moment, the bushfires. That was already a substantial shock that we had absorbed at the start of the year that\u2019s layered on top of this.\u201d She said government stimulus would \u201cdefinitely help\u201d support the economy. She said something that acts quickly will be best, while spending on big infrastructure projects would be less effective because they take time to plan and get under way. \u201cSome current spending like road maintenance or something like that would be much more immediate because you can enact that straight away. \u201cTax cuts for households, for instance, would immediately give spending power to households. She said tax incentives for small business could also help if they were brought in immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the financial year. The release of growth figures at 11.30am sparked a brief rally, but the Australian market quickly resumed its downward trend. The benchmark ASX200 index finished the day down more than 1.7%, wiping out gains made on Tuesday. Widespread bans by companies on staff flights due to the virus outbreak punished Brisbane-based Corporate Travel Management, with shares in the company plunging more than 9% to make it the biggest loser of the day. Flight booking website Webjet was the second-biggest loser, tumbling 8.76%. Other big losers included share registry business Computershare, down 8.3%, winemaker Treasury Wine Estates, which fell 6.8%, and retailer Harvey Norman, which lost 5.7%.",

Exeter-based Flybe operates almost two in five of the UK\u2019s domestic flights, employing more than 2,000 people, and is a leading carrier at airports including Belfast, Southampton, Manchester and Birmingham.

Virgin Atlantic \u2013 one of the co-owners of Flybe since last year along with transport firm Stobart Air and hedge fund Cyrus Capital \u2013 has also been impacted by the coronavirus, and on Wednesday loosened rules on altering flight bookings in an effort to restore passenger confidence.
