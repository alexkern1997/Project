      "bodyText": "The devastation wrought on the Australian stockmarket by the coronavirus pandemic has made it impossible for companies to raise fresh money, with two bank funding injections totalling at least $2.5bn called off. Billions of dollars in other attempts to raise money have also been cancelled as investors close their wallets after two wild weeks of trading erased more than a year\u2019s worth of gains. \u201cEffectively, the window to raise capital is closed,\u201d said fund manager Geoff Wilson of Wilson Asset Management, who himself this week canned a plan for one of his funds to buy between $10m and $20m worth of shares back from investors. Asked if he thought it would open again any time soon, he said: \u201cNo. \u201cIt would only be the desperate who would be raising [money] at the moment,\u201d another market observer said. On Thursday evening, after the biggest one-day fall on the Australian market since 1987, NAB abandoned plans to raise about $2bn by selling investors notes \u2013 financial instruments that pay a steady flow of coupons. It\u2019s believed the decision was taken following what sources said were \u201crobust\u201d discussions by the NAB board. Smaller rival Macquarie followed suit on Friday morning, as the market was again plunging, yanking a $500m note issue of its own. The notes, known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt, carry greater risk than either because they are the first to take losses when things go wrong. But they are extremely popular with Australian mum-and-dad investors who have confidence in the strength of the country\u2019s banking sector because they provide relatively high returns. The prices of both were set last month, before the virus smashed the market. But after the falls in the share prices of the banks \u2013 on Friday night, NAB\u2019s share price was down by a third since 20 February and Macquarie\u2019s down almost a quarter over the same period \u2013 those prices became wildly unrealistic. Sources said that if the NAB and Macquarie notes had been issued at pre-crash values then their prices would have immediately crashed once they began to trade, making investors angry and leaving the banks looking like they were under financial pressure. \u201cIf they\u2019d proceeded with it they would have been slaughtered when they came on,\u201d one market source said of the NAB notes. \u201cObviously it\u2019s bad for the investors but it\u2019s also really bad for NAB. \u201cWhich bank wants to issue capital at a massive discount?\u201d Sources say figuring out new prices for the notes was too hard because the markets were too volatile \u2013 a point proven on Friday when, after dropping 8% in early trade, the benchmark ASX 200 rallied to finish the day up more than 4%. Also on Friday, Pengana Private Equity Fund abandoned a $470m capital raising, telling the market that \u201ccurrent market volatility makes it impossible to conduct an orderly process\u201d. The previous day, corporate lender Metrics Credit Partners handed more than $340m back to investors after falling well short on its hopes to raise up to $640m and list a fund on the ASX. Wilson said the market as a whole was in a \u201cfear phase\u201d. \u201cThis is the steepest fall we\u2019ve ever seen in the market,\u201d he said. He said it combined the speed of the falls experienced in the crash of 1987 with the relentlessness of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when markets around the world fell day after day after day. \u201cThis is the steepest fall we\u2019ve ever seen in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the start of the bear market [in 1987] to the bottom, that was about 50% and it took seven weeks. \u201cThis has been faster. \u201cWe\u2019re a month in and we\u2019re down something like 30%.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That does it for me on the west coast as we close out a very busy day for coronavirus news. Here are some of the day\u2019s key moments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that a deal has been reached with the Trump administration that would provide relief to help deal with the fallout of coronavirus. The legislation would provide: paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. The Washington Post has reported that a second person who visited President Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus. It\u2019s the second person in as many days who\u2019s had coronavirus and been near the president, a widely reported germaphobe. International passengers are still stuck on the Grand Princess, the stricken cruise ship that docked in Oakland early this week. Fourteen passengers will likely remain there for the weekend. Officials initially said it would take three days to clear all passengers from the boat. It\u2019s now day 5. Trump blasted PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor for pressing him on whether he takes responsibility for axing the Global Health Security team in the National Security Council, which was set up in the wake of the Ebola outbreak to make sure that the government response to a pandemic would be coordinated. Former officials describe it as the lynchpin of the response mechanism. Trump called the question \u201cnasty.\u201d The outbreak of the new coronavirus has been boon for a number of companies, including those that sell disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizers and toilet paper. But the pandemic also has sales soaring on another bathroom item: the bidet. Home product company Brondell, which sells various types of bidet toilet seats, heated and unheated, has seen an increase in sales over the last few days, a company spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson said Brondell is selling a bidet on Amazon every two minutes, or about one thousand units per day. The company reportedly earned $100,000 in one day this week through Amazon sales, an \u201cexponential\u201djump from its average daily sales. San Francisco mayor London Breed on Friday put a 30-day pause on evicting tenants who cant pay rent due to impacts from the coronavirus. The San Fransisco Examiner reports that Breed is using her legal authority under a local emergency declaration to prevent evictions and is putting the prohibition in place for an initial 30-day period, with the possibility that it could be extended for an additional 30 days. Trump raised eyebrows during the today\u2019s press conference from the Rose Garden when he indicated that the US government is working with Google to build a nationwide website to help people decide whether to get tested. Turns out, it\u2019s not true. The Verge reports that \u201ca much smaller trial website made by another division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is going up\u201d and that it would only be able to direct people to testing facilities in the Bay Area. Debbie Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, showed a flowchart during the press conference that explained how the website would function. She suggested it would be a way for people to enter symptoms and get directed to a nearby \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing facility. Verge points out that very few details are known about this website, including its URL, when it will launch or how it will work. But what is certain is that Google didn\u2019t build it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that a deal has been reached with the Trump administration that would provide relief to help deal with the fallout of coronavirus. Trump hasn\u2019t yet said publicly whether he backs it. \u201cWe are proud to have reached an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter. The legislation would provide paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. It would also expand federal funding for Medicaid to support local, state and tribal health care systems. The announcement comes after Trump denounced the deal in a press conference from the Rose Garden, saying \u201cwe just don\u2019t think they\u2019re giving enough. We don\u2019t think the Democrats are giving enough,\u201d the President said. CNN has more. The California Teachers Association, the most powerful education group in the state, is asking California governor Gavin Newsom to close all K-12 schools and community colleges to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It would be the first state in to adopt such a dramatic measure. Health officials are publicly considering slowing the flow of people across the US-Mexico border. But this time, it\u2019s Mexico that\u2019s eyeing border restrictions. Reuters reports that Mexico so far has only 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus and no deaths \u2014 a sliver of the 1,000 cases and dozens of deaths in the US that have been linked to the virus. That means that some in Mexico are looking at the US as a threat. \u201cThe possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south. If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,\u201d deputy health secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell said at a Friday news conference. \u201cMexico wouldn\u2019t bring the virus to the United States, rather the United States would bring it here.\u201d The Washington Post has reported that second person who visited President Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus, according to emails from Republican party officials to other guests who were present. That\u2019s the second person in as many days who\u2019s had coronavirus and been near the president. A Brazilian official who met Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend also tested positive for coronavirus. The unfolding health crisis appears to be edging closer to Trump, a widely reported germaphobe. Alabama\u2019s governor Kay Ivey has issued a state of emergency after the state the state saw its first confirmed case of coronavirus. State of Emergency declarations can make it easier for a state or city access to federal aid. Congress appropriated more than $8 billion to deal with coronavirus and it appears as though even that will fall short. Nearly 19,000 schools have or will close across the US, affecting more than 8.1m students and counting, according to Education Week, one of the few outlets tracking school closures nationally. There are roughly 76 million students in US schools. That number will likely rise as coronavirus spreads to Midwest and rural areas of the country. Hours before the House was scheduled to vote on a package that would provide assistance those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump criticized the proposal, throwing a compromise into question. \u201cWe don\u2019t think they\u2019re giving enough,\u201d Trump said, referring to Democrats during a midday press conference from the Rose Garden. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing what\u2019s right for the country.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California had previously announced the House would go forward on a vote later in the day on a sweeping package that includes a new paid sick provision, additional unemployment benefits, free virus testing and additional funds for food assistance. The compromise appears to have gotten hung up on a big payroll tax cut, Trump\u2019s highest priority in terms of an economic response to the disaster. The New York Times has more. ABC News is reporting that international passengers are still stuck on board the Grand Princess, the ill-fated cruise ship that docked in Oakland this week Monday. Fourteen of those passengers will reportedly remain at least through the weekend. Public health officials and the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said they expected it would take three days to disembark all passengers. It\u2019s now day five. Passengers who left the ship earlier this week have been transported to military bases and hotels for 14 days of quarantine. The Guardian has spoken with multiple individuals inside quarantine who\u2019ve complained they still haven\u2019t been tested for the coronavirus despite asking for one to be administered. San Francisco Chronicle has posted a tally of cases of the new coronavirus across the Bay Area. The number of total coronavirus cases include: \u2022 277 in California, including 168 in the Bay Area \u2022 1,668 in the U.S., including 41 deaths: 5 in California, 31 in Washington state, 2 in Florida, 1 in New Jersey, 1 in Georgia and 1 in South Dakota \u2022 More than 137,000 in the world and more than 5,000 deaths. More than 69,000 have recovered. Additionally, San Francisco\u2019s mayor London Breed announced emergency child care plans for school closures. Starting Monday, the city\u2019s recreation centers and libraries will suspend regular programming to operate as emergency care facilities and will The provide recreation, learning and three meals a day. Children of healthcare workers, disaster service workers and low-income families will be eligible. Santa Clara County, just outside San Francisco, is banning gatherings of more than 35 people out of concern for coronavirus. More and more gatherings have been canceled across the Bay Area, but so far the ban on groups numbering more than 35 appears to be one of the most conservative approaches to gatherings in California. Twitter is a afire with criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s response to a question from PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor about the president\u2019s responsibility over the nation\u2019s lack of preparedness after he called the question over cuts his administration made to NSC a \u201cnasty one.\u201d But some have pointed out that his response also demonstrated a limited understanding of what an administration actually does. Asked about the cuts, Trump said: \u201cYou say I did that, I don\u2019t know anything about it... It\u2019s the administration. Perhaps they do that, let people go. You used to work for a different newspaper than you do know,\u201d he told Alcindor, turning a question over basic preparedness into a personal one. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor Julian Borger has additional insights: Yamiche Alcindor\u2019s \u201cnasty\u201d question to Trump was about the axing of the Global Health Security team in the National Security Council, which was set up in the wake of the Ebola outbreak to make sure that the government response to a pandemic would be coordinated. Former officials describe it as the lynchpin of the response mechanism. In May 2018, John Bolton, national security adviser at the time, got rid of the whole office, as he did not see pandemics as a priority national security threat. Trump\u2019s claim that he knew nothing about it, and still knows nothing about it (on a day he declares a national emergency over a pandemic) is extraordinary. Here\u2019s video of the exchange: Earlier today Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the favorite candidate of grassroots progressives in the 2020 Democratic primary, delivered his own speech on Coronavirus. Before the hourlong press conference Trump held Friday afternoon, Sanders spoke in Vermont: Needless to say we must massively increase the availability of test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We need to anticipate significant increases in hospital admissions, which means that we will need more ICU units and ventilators, we will need more doctors, nurses, and medical personnel of all kinds - and we must make sure that these frontline personnel are well protected from the diseases they are treating. I have talked to nurses recently who worry very much about whether they are getting the kind of knowledge and equipment they need so that they do not get sick. We need to significantly improve our communications and collaboration with other countries to ensure that we are learning everything that we can about the successes and failures of other countries as they deal with this crisis. And furthermore, we must be honest with the American people and communicate as effectively and directly as we can with all of the scientific information that we can provide.Further, and most importantly, our response to this entire crisis must be guided by the decisions of doctors, scientists, and researchers, not politicians. And then Sanders pivoted to his signature issue, healthcare. He argued that the crisis is a reason the country needs to adopt Medicare for All. But as we struggle with this crisis, it is also important that we learn the lessons of how we got to where we are today, and what we must do in the future so that we are better prepared for similar crises that may come. Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege. As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current healthcare system, my guess is that those numbers and the demand for universal healthcare will only go up. Here is the unsettling moment Trump hit out at PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor, after she asked him about his closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic response team in 2018: During his press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Trump has said that he doesn\u2019t \u201ctake responsibility at all\u201d for the delays in testing for coronavirus. You can watch the moment here: Here\u2019s how some viewers have been responding: Multiple times during this press conference Trump has been asked about the Brazilian official who met the president and tested positive for Coronavirus. He was asked if he was offering different advice to Americans than he\u2019s practicing himself. \u201cI think they have to listen to their doctors and they shouldn\u2019t be jumping to get the test unless they have it,\u201d Trump said. In response to a followup question Trump said he would \u201cprobably\u201d be tested \u201cvery soon.\u201d Asked how long the national emergency would go on for, Trump did not give a specific answer. \u201cI hope not long,\u201d Trump said. But, he added, \u201cit gives us the power it needs to get rid of the virus.\u201d He also said that the Trump administration is in touch with other countries dealing with the Coronavirus. \u201cThey\u2019re calling us and asking for advice. They\u2019re calling for advice from the people behind me,\u201d Trump said. Here\u2019s quite an awkward moment from Trump\u2019s speech that has been spotted and shared by one viewer The spread of the Coronavirus has not been lost on Trump, his team, and the businesspeople at this press conference. At one point vice president Mike Pence said \u201cThe truth is, we now have coronavirus cases in 46 of the American states.\u201d The Guardian has a regularly updated map tracking the spread of Coronavirus cases across the country. See it here. It\u2019s important to note that Trump, during a question and answer session following his remarks, was asked whether he or his staff were taking any precautions to make sure they get tests for Coronavirus. Trump stressed repeatedly that he and his staff did not have any exposure. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve had any exposure but I don\u2019t have any symptoms,\u201d Trump said. Back at the podium, Trump stressed the importance of local governments to stay consistent in their steps to fight coronavirus. A number of governors around the country have issued bans of large gatherings at varying levels. \u201cWe must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions we take,\u201d Trump said. Then Trump made a small tangent to note all the major sporting events that have been postponed, canceled, or dramatically scaled back to prevent transmission of the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible with what\u2019s happened to the sports of the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a great service.\u201d Trump continued: \u201cWe can learn and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of these doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. Interesting terms. And very accurate. In a number of weeks I think you will find it\u2019s a very accurate term.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democratic senator in Congress, released a statement welcoming Trump\u2019s invocation of the Stafford Act. His response, blasted out before Trump\u2019s presser ended, is below: \u201cI\u2019m pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak. I urge New York and other states to immediately request these newly available funds and for the Trump administration to approve these requests without delay. \u201cAs other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis.\u201d Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration is already coming under heavy criticism, and not just because he was about 30 minutes late to deliver it. First of all, his decision to announce it by saying \u201cnational emergency, two very big words\u201d hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. His delivery has also been questioned, as well as his strange aside on Google: And then there was his decision to shake hands with members of his team: There are still questions over Trump\u2019s status at the moment, as he has recently came into contact with at least one person who has tested positive for coronavirus. Trump moved on to introducing representatives from partner organizations working with the White House to combat the coronavirus. They include representatives from Walmart, Walgreens, LHC Group and Signify Health. Most of the business people gave brief remarks about how eager their respective companies are to help. Trump then said as part of the Coronavirus response \u201cwe\u2019ll be changing a lot of the rules and regulations for [the] future\u201d. \u201cI guess that\u2019ll continue to an extent but we hope it never happens but we\u2019ll be changing a lot of the wholes and speculations,\u201d Trump said. Trump added: \u201cI\u2019ve waived interest on all student loans held by government agencies.\u201d The president said he instructed the secretary of energy, Dan Brouillette, to buy \u201clarge quantities\u201d of gasoline \u201cin the US strategic reserve\u201d. Dr. Deborah Birx took a few minutes to explain a new Coronavirus website for texting. She held up a chart to explain how the website would work (C-SPAN\u2019s Craig Caplan snapped a picture). Trump in his remarks said that as part of the national emergency declaration, \u201cthe action I am taking will open up $50 billion.\u201d Trump, flanked by aides including vice-president Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah Birx, also said the move will waive a number of other requirements meant to benefit doctors and fight the Coronavirus pandemic. There\u2019s been an ongoing concern about the availability of tests for the Coronavirus. Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week.\u201d \u201cWhich will bring probably 1.4 million tests next week and five million in a month,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d Donald Trump on Friday afternoon declared a national emergency to address the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. The declaration, made from the White House Rose Garden during a press conference, comes as the Trump administration grapples with the ongoing outbreak. Donald Trump is late to this press conference where he\u2019s expected to declare a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tardiness is unlikely to allay ongoing tensions among the American public about the federal government\u2019s plans for fighting the Coronavirus. Daniel Strauss taking over the blog here for a bit. Over in Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster. The Dallas Morning News has more: Gov. Greg Abbott is declaring a \u201cstate of disaster\u201d over coronavirus disease 2019, and announced that the state on Friday opened a drive-through testing center in San Antonio, with ones to follow soon in Dallas, Houston and Austin. Under state law, in such a disaster, Abbott becomes \u201ccommander in chief of state agencies, boards, and commissions having emergency responsibilities.\u201d As he did with the four drive-through testing centers, the governor can direct supplies, equipment, materials and facilities to mitigate the disaster. Abbott also is directing state health care regulatory agencies to tell nursing homes, assisted living centers and hospitals to restrict visitation. While he didn\u2019t by executive order ban mass gatherings, Abbott strongly discouraged large meetings until public health officials have a better grasp of how many Texans have contracted COVID-19 or are at risk of doing so. Virginia closes schools amidst coronavirus concerns Virginia governor Ralph Northam just announced that Virginia schools will be closed for a minimum of two weeks as the spread of Covid-19 continues in the area. The announcement means that all schools in the DMV area \u2013 Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia \u2013 will be closed for most of the month. Major US companies tell their employees to work from home Thousands of employees of major US companies have been instructed to work from home if they are able to given the spread of Covid-19. Ford, General Motors and AT&amp;T have all told their employees to work from home if possible. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have instructed their staff in New York City to work from home as the number of cases in the New York City metro area rises. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s business editor Dominic Rushe on the effect coronavirus is having on employees and the economy: The long-term economic impact of the shuttering of America will take weeks if not longer to assess. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at CapitalEconomics, said the escalating response to the crisis from the US government, closing schools, banning large gatherings, will take a \u2018sharp toll on the economy\u2019. Capital Economics has cut its US growth forecast for 2020 to just 0.6%, down from 1.8%. Nancy Pelosi holds brief press conference on coronavirus aid package Speaker Nancy Pelosi just gave a short press conference \u2013 taking no questions from reports \u2013 detailing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that House Democrats are planning to pass today. Pelosi said the bill\u2019s main component is \u201ctesting, testing, testing\u2019. \u201cThis legislation facilitates free testing for everyone who needs a test, including the insured,\u201d she said. The speaker also said that federal sick leave and unemployment support was also a priority. During the press conference, which only lasted a few minutes, Pelosi did not divulge any information on how talks with her Republican counterparts in the White House are going. Trump is expected to speak in the Rose Garden at 3pm for his own press conference on the coronavirus outbreak. House majority leader says chamber will vote on coronavirus aid package today House Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer released a statement saying the House will put up the coronavirus aid package up for a vote regardless of whether they have the support of their Republican colleagues. Hoyer said a vote will take place no earlier than 2:30, after Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a press conference on the bill at 2pm. We\u2019ll be tuning in. Delta airlines to reduce capacity to by 40% In response to the coronavirus outbreak, Delta just announced that it is reducing its capacity by 40% \u2013 the largest capacity reduction in the company\u2019s history. The company said it will eliminate all flights to Europe, with the exception of London, for the next 30 days with the possibility of extension. It will also be trying to cut down its workforce, offering voluntary, short-term unpaid leaves and will reduce the number of consultants and contractors it works with. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to give a press conference in 15 minutes on a coronavirus aid package the House deliberated on this morning. What is a national emergency? Donald Trump, as president, has the power to declare a national emergency, which gives power to the federal government to more freely redistribute funds to state and local governments in a time of the crisis. The president is set to declare a national emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak under the Stafford Act, which was signed into law in 1988 and is designed to encourage local municipalities to design and run their own disaster mitigation efforts, with federal assistance. The last time Trump declared a national emergency was in February 2019 when he declared a national emergency to divert funding for his border wall. That national emergency was declared under a different act, the 1976 National Emergencies Act. The Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter Sam Levine: Louisiana will postpone its April 4 presidential preference primary amid ongoing concern over coronavirus, Kyle Ardoin, the state\u2019s top election official announced on Friday. The Democratic contest will be postponed until June 20. Ardoin is acting to the contest using a provision in state law that allows him to move an election in an emergency situation, according to the Advocate. Louisiana is the first state to postpone its primary election as the nation tries to contain the spread of the virus. Election officials in other states are rushing to implement last-minute changes to safeguard against the virus. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose this week ordered local election officials to relocate all polling stations from senior centers and assisted living facilities. Some election officials in Illinois and Florida are taking similar steps. Throughout the country, local election offices are taking extra sanitization steps, providing wipes and hand sanitizer at polling stations. More reports are suggesting that Donald Trump will be declaring a national emergency at a 3pm press conference today. Miami mayor tests positive for coronavirus The mayor of Miami, Florida Francis Suarez has tested positive for coronavirus, the Miami Herald is reporting. Suarez attended an event with a Brazilian government official earlier this week who has since tested positive with coronavirus. Suarez announced earlier this week that he was not displaying any symptoms, but self-quarantined himself out of safety precaution once he learned that one of Bolsonaro\u2019s staff members tested positive. Suarez was one of several politicians who interacted with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and his staff, along with Donald Trump and his staff, when they came to Miami earlier this week. Earlier today, reports said Bolsonaro tested positive for coronavirus, but now other reports are saying the test came back negative. Trump may declare national emergency at 3pm press conference Three Bloomberg reporters are saying that multiple sources have told them that Donald Trump will announce a national emergency over coronavirus at a press conference this afternoon. Declaring a national emergency will allow an easier flow of federal aid to state and local governments who are responding to outbreaks. There are multiple reports that the White House Chief of Staff\u2019s has called for an \u201curgent meeting\u201d among staff because of news that Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who met with Donald Trump Saturday, has reportedly tested positive for covid-19. Donald Trump just tweeted that he will hold a press conference at 3pm EST on coronavirus. We got a sneak peak of what he will say from a tweet he posted moments earlier. He said the 40 coronavirus-related deaths in the US is due to the \u201cvery strong border policy\u201d in place. \u201cIf we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!\u201d he wrote. Keep in mind that the number of cases in the US has been rising dramatically over the past few weeks, yet Trump has stuck to praising himself and his administration for having a handle on a situation that is getting increasingly dire. Boston Marathon postponed until September State and local officials have postponed the Boston Marathon until 14 September over fears of the coronavirus outbreak. The race was originally scheduled for 20 April. WGBH reported that this is the first time the marathon has been delayed in its 124-year history. About 30,000 people run the marathon each year. States experiencing dramatic coronavirus outbreaks are unable to use Medicaid more freely to respond to the outbreak by expanding medical care, the Los Angeles Times is reporting. The White House has tools it can use to assist states looking to bolster their healthcare efforts, but so far, the Trump administration has not made any moves to ease the burden on states. As coronavirus has intensified in the US over the last few weeks, Trump has tried to downplay the effect that the illness will have on Americans. He called the illness Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax\u201d and has compared it to the flu, which has a far lower mortality rate. Additionally, as the LA Times point out, Seema Verna, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been a champion of conservative states who have been trying to cut the number of people on Medicaid. Here\u2019s more from the LA Times: Months into the current global disease outbreak, the White House and senior federal health officials haven\u2019t taken the necessary steps to give states simple pathways to fully leverage the mammoth safety net program to prevent a wider epidemic. That\u2019s making it harder for states to quickly sign up poor patients for coverage so they can get necessary testing or treatment if they are exposed to coronavirus. And it threatens to slow efforts by states to bring on new medical providers, set up emergency clinics or begin quarantining and caring for homeless Americans at high risk from the virus. Ted Cruz extends his self-quarantine Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said in a statement that he has extended his self-quarantine after learning that another person he interacted with on 3 March has tested positive for Covid-19. Cruz tweeted on Sunday that he was in self-quarantine after learning that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference he interacted with tested positive for coronavirus. Cruz said in today\u2019s statement that his self-quarantine was supposed to end tonight and he is showing no symptoms, but will extend his self-quarantine until 17 March. Utah passes bill banning abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned Yesterday, the Utah state legislature passed a bill that would ban all elective abortions \u2013 which excludes abortion procedures for maternal health or procedure disease \u2013 if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. The bill is a signal that conservative states are gearing up for an overturn of the decision in the near future. Under Donald Trump, the Supreme Court has had two conservative appointees who have had reservations about Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion. Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments for June Medical Services v. Russo, a case from Louisiana about a law that significantly restricts abortion access by requiring doctors at abortion clinics to be registered at nearby hospitals. The law is similar to one the Supreme Court overturned in 2016. The swing vote for the decision is likely to be chief justice John Roberts, who is known for being an institutionalist who does not like to disturb precedent. Good morning, this is Lauren Aratani taking over. The US Food and Drug Administration just sent out word that they will allow New York state\u2019s health department to begin authorizing labs to conduct their own testing for Covid-19 once their tests have been validated. Testing has been a serious concern in New York state and the US overall, with many fearing there is a shortage of available and quick testing for people who are showing symptoms. New York governor Andrew Cuomo told CNN that the US is \u201cway behind on testing\u201d and called the \u201cfederal bottleneck\u201d so bad that he authorized New York officials to contract private labs for testing. US Central Command Commander General Kenneth McKenzie is briefing reporters at the Pentagon on the strikes yesterday against Iranian-backed Shia militia facilities in Iraq. You can watch it here. Trump is weighing in on what he wants approved by legislators today - and unsurprisingly it his payroll tax cut plan, not some of the more directly coronavirus-related measures that Democrats on Capitol Hill have been trying to get passed. The house is expected to continue discussion on a coronavirus economic stimulus package when it opens - you\u2019ll be able to watch it here. Noam Levey is reporting for the LA Times on how the Trump administration isn\u2019t allowing states to use Medicaid more freely to respond to the coronavirus crisis by expanding medical services. One reason federal health officials have not acted appears to be President Trump\u2019s reluctance to declare a national emergency. That\u2019s a key step that would clear the way for states to get Medicaid waivers to more nimbly tackle coronavirus, but it would conflict with Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the epidemic. Another element may be ideological: The administration official who oversees Medicaid, Seema Verma, has been a champion of efforts by conservative states to trim the number of people enrolled. Read it here - LA Times: Trump administration blocks states from using Medicaid to respond to coronavirus crisis It is K-9 Veterans Day today. Not an official holiday, of course, but one that is being observed by Donald Trump, who has just issued a White House statement about it. On National K-9 Veterans Day, I join our Nation in celebrating and honoring the important job performed each day by America\u2019s dedicated working dogs who support our military. Established in 1942, the K-9 Corps is a critical part of our armed forces. Since its founding, more than 30,000 dogs have served in America\u2019s military, with approximately 2,500 active Military Working Dogs currently helping to defend our freedom. The president goes on to praise again Conan, the working dog that was part of the raid that lead to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October last year. Here\u2019s a clip of the president appearing with Conan back in November. Associated Press is reporting that the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has endorsed Joe Biden for president, an influential nod of support that could bolster his 2020 Democratic campaign. The endorsement by Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California on Friday is the latest testament of a growing coalescence of support for Biden\u2019s White House bid says AP. Biden\u2019s campaign has seen a resurgence powered by black voters, who have helped cement his front-runner status after commanding wins in several recent primaries, including in South Carolina, in several Southern states and just this week in Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me that he is the best person, not just to beat (President Donald) Trump, but he is the person to lead at this time,\u201d Bass said in an interview. \u201cI think him having a long-standing history of working with African American communities, most notably in his own state but around the country, was qualitatively different from the other candidates.\u201d Bass said she held off endorsing a candidate because two CBC members, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, were running for president. Booker and Harris have since dropped out and endorsed Biden. The CBC as a whole is not officially endorsing a candidate, Bass said, but the majority of members have already announced support for Biden. Although Biden has strong support within the African American community, especially among older voters, concerns have been raised about his ability to energize young and progressive voters. \u201cAs this race settles down, it is my job personally and the job of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to be extremely clear with people in our districts what is at stake here, and what is at stake is their future,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job that we\u2019ve all been doing over the last 3 1/2 years, but we have to step it up.\u201d Asked whether Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard should drop out of the race to unite the party before the Democratic National Convention, Bass said she believes the primary process needs to run its course and allow every voter the chance to weigh in. \u201cI would never be in a position to say, \u2018You need to drop out,\u2019\u201d Bass said. \u201cI do think, though, that math is math.\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was on CBS This Morning talking about the coronavirus, and particularly about the availability - or lack of - testing kits in the US. Here\u2019s the clip: Politico this morning also have a look at what a difference the virus outbreak is going to make to election campaigning this year. Both Biden and Sanders\u2019 teams have already been ordered to work from home. Strategists are gaming out how the lack of in-person campaigning might affect Trump and Biden. Trump\u2019s signature mega-rallies, a source of psychic uplift for the president, are on ice. Biden, a tactile politician whose best moments are often on rope lines interacting one-on-one with voters, will be denied those opportunities for the foreseeable future. Fundraising is also being disrupted. Biden has been forced to move his donor events online. And on Wednesday, the president scrapped a much-anticipated fundraiser. There\u2019s another element - how the president is viewed to have handled the emergency is going to be a big factor in November\u2019s vote now Read it here - Politico: Coronavirus consumes Trump\u2019s reelection bid YouGov and Yahoo! News conducted a poll between March 10 - 11 looking at what Americans felt about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of coronavirus, and it doesn\u2019t make for great reading for the president. 53 percent of the polled US adults did not have faith in the president to tell the truth about the threat of the new coronavirus. Women were less likely to trust the president than men. Newsweek has more on the poll here. It can\u2019t help when the president makes notable errors and omissions when announcing coronavirus measures. Our Voting Rights Editor Ankita Rao has been talking to people for who it is Bernie or bust, people who will support Sanders, but will not back Biden - even against Donald Trump. This year, Martha Baez, a 54-year-old who works in finance, is planning to vote for Sanders in the New York primary, and will not vote for Biden if he is the nominee in November. But she said her real issue was not with the specific candidate, but losing trust in the Democratic party. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I should put aside my values and vote out of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DNC needs an overhaul, it lacks values, real leaders that represent the people not its donors.\u201d Read it here - Bernie or Bust: the Sanders fans who will never vote for Biden Incidentally Ankita has been asking people to get in touch if coronavirus is changing their plans for voting in Florida next week. Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou at Bloomberg has been looking at the impact coronavirus is likely to have on the race for the White House. It\u2019s an added challenge for all three campaigns. With the Democratic race down to two candidates - and with Biden solidly in the lead - interest in the contest would naturally shrink somewhat. Combine that with the pandemic\u2019s overwhelming impact on the economy and daily life, getting voters\u2019 attention is going to be difficult - and expensive. Aside from the obvious reduction in hand-shaking and picking up babies for those cute pictures, the teams are going to have to get more creative digitally. Read it here - Bloomberg: Coronavirus roils 2020 race, forcing a virtual campaign season The president is tweeting - and he is criticising the federal agency responsible for keeping the US safe from coronavirus - and of course somehow it is Barack Obama\u2019s fault as well. He claims, without providing any evidence, that changes he has made now mean that widespread testing for coronavirus will shortly start. There has been widespread criticism of the administration over the lack of testing - just eight tests were carried out on Tuesday. Good morning. It is very much not politics as normal as the US continues to get to grips with the fall-out from the coronavirus outbreak, and the administration\u2019s attempts to handle it. Colleges across the US have begun canceling and curtailing graduation ceremonies, and March Madness is off. The president will be meeting industry executives about the Covid-19 response at 1:30pm. There is a bit of voting action due at the weekend. The Northern Mariana Islands don\u2019t take part in November\u2019s presidential election, but they do have a Democratic caucus tomorrow. It awards six pledged delegate - and in 2016 they broke four-two in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favour over Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden currently leads Sanders 881 to 725. Coronavirus is affecting the candidates\u2019 ability to campaign in public - Joe Biden will take part in a virtual town hall in Illinois at 5pm.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to combat the coronavirus pandemic, freeing up $50bn in federal funding and promising a screening website and drive-by tests. The president was seeking to restore confidence after angering and worrying many with confusing and dismissive public remarks about the outbreak, which in the US has spread to 46 states with at least 1,920 cases and 41 deaths. At a press conference in the White House rose garden, Trump announced: \u201cTo unleash the full power of the federal government for this effort today I am officially declaring a national emergency \u2013 two very big words.\u201d The action will open access to more than $50bn, he said, urging states to set up emergency operation centers and hospitals to initiate emergency plans. Trump has faced particular criticism over a nationwide shortage of testing kits which has been compared unfavourably with South Korea and other countries. On Friday he paraded a series of major US companies entering into a public-private partnership in order to fix the shortfall. Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week which will bring probably 1.4m tests next week and 5m in a month. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d He could not resist adding: \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don\u2019t want everybody taking this test. It\u2019s totally unnecessary. This will pass.\u201d Trump chose not to adopt a German-made test approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) but when questioned by reporters he refused to take the blame for the US now having to play catch-up. \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is redesign it very quickly with the help of the people around me \u2026 We\u2019ll have the ability to do millions over a quick period of time.\u201d The US military said later on Friday that it would halt all domestic travel, with some exceptions, for service members, defense department civilians and their families amid the fast-spreading coronavirus. The memo, signed by defense deputy secretary David Norquist, said the policy would go into effect on Monday through 11 May. It added that exceptions could be granted for mission essential travel, travel necessary for humanitarian reasons, and travel warranted due to extreme hardship. Trump also announced that he would waive interest on all student loans held by government agencies until further notice and was buying big quantities of crude oil for storage in the US strategic reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to fill it up,\u201d he said. The vice-president, Mike Pence; Dr Anthony Fauci; the health secretary, Alex Azar; and other members of the coronavirus taskforce stood behind Trump. He introduced corporate leaders who will be working with them. Dr Deborah Birx, one of the leaders of response efforts, held up a chart showing a website that will allow people to fill out a screening questionnaire to work out of they need a test. There will be \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing centres in car parks at CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens stores. Democrats welcomed the declaration. Chuck Schumer, minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d But he added: \u201cAs other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis.\u201d As coronavirus legislation negotiations continued on Capitol Hill, Trump said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the Democrats are giving enough.\u201d Early on Saturday, the House overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that would provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices. By a bipartisan vote of 363 to 40, the Democratic-controlled House passed the multi-billion dollar effort that would expand safety-net programs to help those who could be thrown out of work in the weeks to come. The 110-page bill is the product of extensive negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin had pressed for tax cuts, while Pelosi had pushed to expand safety-net spending. It does not include the $1 trillion payroll tax cut that Trump had called for. Pelosi and Trump have a frosty relationship, and the two did not speak directly. \u201cThere was no need for that,\u201d Pelosi said at a news conference on Friday evening. Trump said he was invoking the law known as the 1988 Stafford Act, which gives the White House and the federal government special powers to assist state and local governments during \u201cnatural catastrophes\u201d. Only the president can declare a major disaster, under the law. Trump has invoked the Stafford Act many times during his presidency, approving major disaster declarations to address flooding in the midwest and wildfires in California, among other events. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or Fema, is commonly associated with natural disaster response but it can also address pandemics. Trump was asked if he would take a coronavirus test after being photographed with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary, who has tested positive for the virus, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last weekend. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at first. \u201cWe have no symptoms whatsoever.\u201d But pressed on whether he was thereby putting other people at risk, the president reversed position and said he might take a test after all. \u201cMost likely, yes.\u201d Associated Press contributed reporting",

      "bodyText": "Major Australian theme parks including Movie World, Sea World and Wet\u2019n\u2019Wild say they intend to remain open, despite the government saying gatherings of more than 500 people should not occur in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Following a meeting with state premiers on Friday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced mass gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement has thrown sporting codes into chaos, spun the arts industry into disarray and led to the cancellation of major events such as the Royal Easter Show and the Melbourne Grand Prix. But despite that, Australia\u2019s famous cluster of theme parks on the Gold Coast say they intend to keep operating. In a statement on Saturday, Village Roadshow, the owner of major parks Movie World, Sea World and Wet\u2019n\u2019Wild, said that after discussions with the Queensland government it believed \u201cthe nature of our business does not apply to this advisory\u201d. The company said it would put in place \u201cadditional stringent hygiene and safety measures\u201d including \u201can increased number of hygiene hand-washing stations,\u201d \u201cupdated signage\u201d about hand-washing techniques and on-site nurses to address the spread of the virus, but would not close. \u201cAt Village Roadshow Theme Parks, the safety and wellbeing of our guests and team members is our utmost priority,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Council of Australian Government\u2019s advice today regarding public gatherings was directed at static-seated events of more than 500 people for a duration of over two hours. \u201cBased on our discussions with the state government, the nature of our business does not apply to this advisory.\u201d That\u2019s despite other major theme parks including Disneyland and Universal Studios in the US announcing their closure. Disney announced on Friday that it would shut down its California theme parks until the end of March over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, while Florida\u2019s Disney World would close to guests from Sunday. Comcast\u2019s Universal Studios theme park in southern California also said it would close from Saturday and expected to reopen 28 March. The Queensland Electoral Commission will also insist that voters go to the polls for local government elections in the state on 28 March. \u201cThe forthcoming Queensland elections are essential public events required to ensure the continuity of democratic representation and public administration across the state,\u201d the Queensland electoral commissioner, Pat Vidgen, said. \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that more than 500 people would ever be in a polling booth at any one time, and electors generally only spend a short period of time in a booth. \u201cThe ECQ will continue to monitor advice being issued by health authorities to ensure that the elections are conducted with minimal risk to the health and safety of Queenslanders.\u201d Home affairs minister Peter Dutton, a Queensland resident, has taken the state\u2019s coronavirus figure to 35. Queensland also began recording its first cases outside the south-east on Friday, including cases in the towns of Rockhampton and Kingaroy.",

The wartime president Harry Truman used to keep a sign on his desk that said: \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d Trump, however, seems eager to wash his hands of the matter, if not actually wash his hands. \u201cYeah, no, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Then Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked why, in 2018, Trump had dissolved the White House\u2019s National Security Council directorate for global health security and biodefense. Like a schoolboy caught red-handed, he blustered: \u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question because what we\u2019ve done is \u2013 and Tony has said numerous times that we\u2019ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. And when you say \u2018me\u2019, I didn\u2019t do it. We have a group of people I could \u2013 \u201d Alcindor followed up. Trump rambled: \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2013 it\u2019s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.\u201d It is not the first time he has resorted to the word \u201cnasty\u201d when asked a tough question by a woman of colour. The buck stops here.",

On Saturday Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said school closures are not yet warranted, though mass gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned in Australia from Monday. He said not everyone should rush out and get tested if they had symptoms.</p> \n  <p>Murphy said that in Australia, \u201cCommunity transmission is so low at the moment that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are sympathetic. We don\u2019t want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to get tested.

The chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> has just said this has put Australia in a good position.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are starting these measures perhaps a little bit before some have said they are needed. We in Australia want to flatten that curve and keep this under really tight control. We do not want to see rapid increases like we have seen in some parts of the world. That is why we are moving early.</p> \n   <p>We have modelling that says an infection could take some months to go right through the community with a flattened curve. But it depends on how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c310b8f088d75755932eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T01:19:16.449Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier in the day Australia\u2019s shadow health minister <strong>Chris Bowen </strong>slammed the prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s</strong> handling of the virus. Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing.</p> \n  <p>But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c28268f085e564ad83ece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T00:44:46.728Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand cancels Christchurch shootings remembrance service</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a pragmatic decision.

From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities.</p> \n  <p>Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark\u2019s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers.</p> \n   <p>Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Australia\u2019s home affairs minister<strong> Peter Dutton</strong> being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \u201cWe wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\u201d.

These measures include:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Limiting non-essential organised gatherings to fewer than 500 people</li> \n   <li>Limiting non-essential meetings or conferences of critical workforce eg healthcare professionals and emergency services</li> \n   <li>Encouraging all Australians to exercise personal responsibility for social distancing measures</li> \n   <li>Initiating measures to protect vulnerable populations, such as reducing visitors to all residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>However schools, universities and shopping centres are not included in the ban.</p> \n  <p>Australian Medical Association president <strong>Dr Tony Bartone</strong> said the evidence around schools \u201ccan be somewhat difficult to interpret clearly, and we need to be understanding and follow the evidence in that respect\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So we will work with, again with the Chief Medical Officer and the other health officers to ensure the timeliness of that. Clearly, where there\u2019s been an outbreak in... the school it\u2019s appropriate that certain schools will be put into quarantine during that time. However, as we get deeper into the evolving pandemic response and effects, we will have to work with the best possible evidence. If we do nothing, if we turn a blind eye, our public hospital system will be overrun, and that is not in the interest of anyone in our community at all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Saturday morning the president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, <strong>Malcolm Elliott</strong>, told the ABC that \u201csome schools are a little more advanced than others\u201d in their preparation. He said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The show should go on, and if it is possible for schools to remain open then they should. In the interests of children and the interest of families, social organisation, but what happens now of course is that we are all on tenterhooks. We\u2019re all unsure about what the spread the virus will be, when it might strike particular schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly.

Matches this weekend will continue to take place, but without spectators.</p> \n  <p>This morning at a regular press conference which the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading public health and safety body in Germany has been holding for the past two and a half weeks, its director, Lothar Wieler said public health bodies had three aims in their attempts to tackle the virus. </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>To try to \u2018level off\u2019 the epidemic curve, to ensure the most seriously ill don\u2019t end up having to be hospitalised at the same time.</li> \n   <li>To try to speed up the adaptation of hospitals to cope with an increase in intensive care beds and patients who will need respiratory assistance. He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system.</li> \n   <li>To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels.</p> \n  <p>Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. </p> \n  <p>One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b72be8f088d7575592b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:49:21.690Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports <strong>Rory Carroll</strong> in Dublin.<br></p> \n  <p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">announced restrictions on Thursday</a>.

It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. </p> \n  <p>The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East. A German tourist transferred from Luxor to a hospital in the resort town Hurghada died last Sunday from the virus. </p> \n  <p>The outbreak in Mansoura shows that the virus is spreading inside Egypt. \u201cThe 13 new coronavirus cases include six who showed no symptoms and had contracted the virus after coming into contact with people who previously tested positive,\u201d said government-owned outlet Al-Ahram.</p> \n  <p>Egypt\u2019s health ministry continued to update the number of official cases, but has not regularly named the location of infections. The country\u2019s minister for education announced earlier this week that schools were banned from trips in the governorates of Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada due to outbreaks of the virus. </p> \n  <p>The ministry also announced that a school in the central district of Zamalek would close and parents and teachers self-isolate for a fortnight \u201cas a precautionary measure, after a parent of one of the school students was in contact with a foreigner who tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>As the disease shows signs of spreading, some in Cairo attempted to retain a sense of business as usual even as Egypt was battered by a freak storm forcing many to stay indoors.

On Saturday Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said school closures are not yet warranted, though mass gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned in Australia from Monday. He said not everyone should rush out and get tested if they had symptoms. Murphy said that in Australia, \u201cCommunity transmission is so low at the moment that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are sympathetic. We don\u2019t want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to get tested. We need to preserve the testing for those who needed it.\u201d Elsewhere in the world, the US president Donald Trump, after initially declaring coronavirus a \u201choax,\u201d has declared a national emergency, which he described as \u201ctwo very big words\u201d. He\u2019s freed up $50 billion in federal resources to the states to combat the virus, but refused to take responsibility for lack of testing availability and delays in rolling tests out. And in the UK, mass gatherings are set to be banned. In Australia there are now 197 confirmed cases of coronavirus , including three deaths. From Monday, gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned. The chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy has just said this has put Australia in a good position. We are starting these measures perhaps a little bit before some have said they are needed. We in Australia want to flatten that curve and keep this under really tight control. We do not want to see rapid increases like we have seen in some parts of the world. That is why we are moving early. We have modelling that says an infection could take some months to go right through the community with a flattened curve. But it depends on how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day. Earlier in the day Australia\u2019s shadow health minister Chris Bowen slammed the prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the virus. Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister Peter Dutton was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing. But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said; No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said: That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine. This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering. A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. \u201cThis is a pragmatic decision. We\u2019re very saddened to cancel, but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn\u2019t create the risk of further harm being done,\u201d she said. Health officials announced the country\u2019s sixth confirmed case of the disease. Australia\u2019s shadow health minister Chris Bowen has criticised Australian prime minister Scott Morrison for not cancelling large public gatherings sooner. From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities. Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark\u2019s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d. Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government; I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers. Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for Scott Morrison to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people. On Australia\u2019s home affairs minister Peter Dutton being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \u201cWe wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\u201d. However, Bowen said there was \u201ca lack of information before the Australian people, and this confusion makes it worse\u201d. Major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths have announced further restrictions on items such as toilet paper and non-perishable foods as they struggle to cope with panic-buying. The Woolworths website currently appears to be offline as people flock to the site to make purchases.

Here in Australia the Victorian government will soon reveal more details about event cancellations following the cancellation of the Grand Prix on Friday. For the first time in almost a century, Sydney\u2019s Royal Easter Show has been cancelled. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has issued a statement saying \u201cthe time has come to put in place social distancing measures to mitigate spread, rather than a strategy based primarily on case finding\u201d. These measures include: Limiting non-essential organised gatherings to fewer than 500 people Limiting non-essential meetings or conferences of critical workforce eg healthcare professionals and emergency services Encouraging all Australians to exercise personal responsibility for social distancing measures Initiating measures to protect vulnerable populations, such as reducing visitors to all residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities However schools, universities and shopping centres are not included in the ban. Australian Medical Association president Dr Tony Bartone said the evidence around schools \u201ccan be somewhat difficult to interpret clearly, and we need to be understanding and follow the evidence in that respect\u201d. So we will work with, again with the Chief Medical Officer and the other health officers to ensure the timeliness of that. Clearly, where there\u2019s been an outbreak in... the school it\u2019s appropriate that certain schools will be put into quarantine during that time. However, as we get deeper into the evolving pandemic response and effects, we will have to work with the best possible evidence. If we do nothing, if we turn a blind eye, our public hospital system will be overrun, and that is not in the interest of anyone in our community at all. On Saturday morning the president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, Malcolm Elliott, told the ABC that \u201csome schools are a little more advanced than others\u201d in their preparation. He said; The show should go on, and if it is possible for schools to remain open then they should. In the interests of children and the interest of families, social organisation, but what happens now of course is that we are all on tenterhooks. We\u2019re all unsure about what the spread the virus will be, when it might strike particular schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly. So it is a very difficult thing to plan for, in any real meaningful way. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events. The global death toll reached 5,359, while 142,557 cases have been confirmed. In addition, 70,176 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. The US president declared a national emergency. Donald Trump, who started out by dismissing coronavirus as a hoax, took the major step of designating it a national emergency. That allowed him to sweep aside a host of rules and regulations in order to try to stop its spread. But he repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for his own administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, the WHO said. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the continent has more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined apart from China. The UK is set to ban mass gatherings \u2013 a significant U-turn by Downing Street. A Whitehall source briefed reporters that ministers are working on a plan to stop \u201cvarious types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week\u201d. The government has thus deemed such measures unnecessary. The UK death toll reached 11 as the first death in Scotland was confirmed. The nation\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said the patient was an \u201colder person who had underlying health conditions\u201d. The UK could be added to the US\u2019 travel ban, Trump said. Responding to news of a significant uptick in the number of UK cases, Trump indicated he was thinking of extended his ban to a country he has thus far protected, while taking others off the list. UK sporting events and elections were postponed. Almost all professional football in Britain, including a significant portion of the grassroots game, was suspended. Rugby fixtures were put off and the London marathon was postponed. In golf, the Masters, which is played in the US, was also cancelled. Local and mayoral elections due to take place in the UK later this year were put back to 2021. Spain declared a state of emergency, while a host of other countries announced strict new measures. Among them were France, Canada and Cyprus, as well as Bosnia, Switzerland and a string of others. Ivanka Trump working from home after contact with Australian government minister who has the virus. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, who serves in the White House, will not self-quarantine despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier news here. The former chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Clare Gerada, has confirmed she contracted the virus \u2013 and is now recovering: Emotional scenes are playing out across Italy as people sing Italian songs, as well as the national anthem, from their balconies in a show of solidarity as they remain in lockdown country grapples to contain a coronavirus outbreak. In Naples, neighbours sang along to a song by the Neapolitan singer, Andrea Sannino, called \u2018Abbracciame\u2019 (Hug me), while in Turin the choice was a classic by the late Domenico Mudugno, \u2018Meraviglioso\u2019 (wonderful). In Milan, Rome and other places, people sang along to the national anthem Inno di Mameli. Italians have been told to \u201cstay at home\u201d until 3 April. Mauritania has confirmed its first case, according to AFP. The agency reported that the country\u2019s health minister, Mohamed Nedhirou Ould Hamed, said the case involved a recently returned foreigner who tested positive on Friday. In a televised address, he said: He was immediately isolated and the state has all the means at its disposal to take care of those suffering from the virus. A statement from the health ministry, also released on Friday, said the man was an \u201cexpatriate\u201d who had flown into Mauritania from Europe on Monday. He isolated himself after a friend in Europe tested positive for the virus. Health officials discovered he was feverish on Friday morning and he was confirmed positive for coronavirus later in the evening. The health minister also promised, in his televised address, that the government would stop charter flights coming to Mauritania from France. The West African state of Guinea registered its first coronavirus case on Friday too. And Senegal, which shares a border with Mauritania, registered 11 new coronavirus infections on Friday, bringing its total number to 19. Ivory Coast, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Nigeria have all also recently registered coronavirus cases. Eswatini, the land-locked southern African country formerly known as Swaziland, has reported its first confirmed case, its minister of health has said. A 33-year-old woman, who returned from the United States at the end of February and then travelled to Lesotho before returning home to eSwatini, is currently in isolation, Lizzie Nkosi added. The French health minister has announced an increase of 800 cases in the last 24 hours. Olivier V\u00e9ran said the evolution of the spread of the virus was \u201crapid and real\u201d: We now have 3,661 cases, 79 deaths. Of the sick, 154 people re in intensive care. We are only at the beginning of the epidemic and it is progressing, which was expected. V\u00e9ran added that 98% of those who have tested positive have since recovered. France has banned gatherings of more than 100 people across the country as schools began closing on Friday for an indefinite period. The previous maximum was more than 1,000 people. The Eiffel Tower, Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, Louvre, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and Centre Pompidou have closed. The Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, said there would be no Sunday masses held in churches on the Paris region. Thousands of jobs are set to go at the Dutch national airline, KLM, as it deals with the impact of the outbreak, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Its chief executive, Pieter Elbers, said KLM will shed as many as 2,000 jobs and ask personnel to work shortened hours, while grounding its fleet of six Boeing 747s from 1 April. In the coming months we\u2019ll reduce 1,500 to 2,000 jobs to mean that not only in the coming weeks, but in the coming months we will have fewer colleagues. The airline\u2019s top official said the job cuts mainly included part-time workers, those destined for retirement and natural attrition. A cruise ship has been docked in isolation in northeastern Brazil after two passengers were found to have symptoms resembling that of the new coronavirus, local authorities say. According to the Associated Press, the Brazilian state of Pernambuco\u2019s health secretariat decided to keep the ship \u2013 with its 318 passengers and 291 crew members \u2013 in isolation in the capital of Recife on Thursday. Officials have not released the name of the ship. Some passengers had disembarked before officials decided to isolate the ship and Brazil\u2019s health authority asked tourist agencies to facilitate the return of those people. Authorities took action to prevent additional passengers from leaving. The first passenger suspected of having the virus was described as a 78-year-old man who displayed respiratory problems. Officials said the man was taken from the ship to a private clinic for treatment and testing for the coronavirus. Authorities reported a second possible case on Friday. That passenger had a fever and difficulty breathing, so was moved to a private health unit onshore to undergo the coronavirus test. The result of the tests will dictate whether the ship\u2019s passengers are placed into quarantine, the state\u2019s health secretary, Andr\u00e9 Longo, said in an interview with the Globo television network. The former Nato secretary general, Javier Solana, has been admitted to hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, a source has told Reuters, adding that his health was evolving positively and that he had been put under observation as a precaution. Solana, 77, served in the role from 1995 to 1999, as European Union high representative for foreign affairs from 1999 to 2009 and was Spain\u2019s foreign minister under prime minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez from 1992 to 1995. He attended an event with the current Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, on Monday. The US death toll has risen to 47 after six more deaths were reported in Washington state and a further one was reported in Colorado \u2013 the first in that state. Local authorities said a woman in her 80s who had underlying health issues has died. Ukraine is closing its borders to foreigners for at least two weeks and will stop all flights, as it reported its first Covid-19 fatality on Friday. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the country\u2019s Security and Defence Council, said the measure will take effect in 48 hours. Minutes later, Ukraine announced the news that a woman in her 70s, who lived in north-west Zhytomyr region and was suffering from double pneumonia after a trip to Poland, had died. The country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, asked elderly people to remain at home and asked employers to let workers work from home, wherever possible. He alsoasked Ukrainians who were on holiday or who work abroad to return home by the time the travel ban comes into effect. Danilov said all Ukrainians would be allowed to return to the country, and those coming back from the nations most affected by the pandemic will have to be quarantined. The ban on foreigners would only be waived for diplomatic workers, he said. Norway has introduced travel restrictions designed to combat the spread of the virus. Ullensaker municipality has said on its website: Foreign travellers from countries outside the Nordics arriving at Oslo airport will have to return home. Norwegians arriving at Gardermoen airport, located outside Oslo, will immediately be sent home into quarantine. Ireland is advising its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution before deciding to travel to other EU member states due to action over the spread of the coronavirus, the country\u2019s foreign minister says. Ireland has previously only urged against all travel to Italy and advised avoiding non-essential travel to China, Iran and Spain. The Associated Press is reporting that a second person who was at Mar-a-Lago with Trump last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus. The agency is citing a Republican party official who it says spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters. The person attended a Trump fundraising at the president\u2019s Florida resort on Sunday. Trump also spent time last weekend with a Brazilian official who tested positive just days later. A deal has been reached for an aid package and Democrats in the House of Representatives will soon pass it, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said. We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass [the bill]. Pelosi and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have been negotiating since Thursday on a multi-billion US dollar package that aims to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic, which has infected 138,000 people worldwide, killed more than 5,000 and closed down schools, sports arenas, theatres and offices across America. The bill would provide for free coronavirus testing and two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus, Pelosi said earlier in the day. It also would expand safety-net programs that help people weather economic downturns. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress have waited to hear from the president before weighing in on the measure. Pelosi does not need their support to pass legislation out of the House but it is unlikely to get far in the Republican-controlled Senate without bipartisan support. The International Monetary Fund has advised all staff at its Washington, DC headquarters to work from home until further notice after an employee was diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, a spokesman has said. The fund said it also has suspended all mission travel to European countries designated as Level 3 community spread areas by the Centers for Disease Control, but it \u201cremains fully operational and stands ready to serve its members.\u201d In the UK, mass gatherings are set to be banned as part of the battle against coronavirus in a significant shift in the government\u2019s position, the Press Association reports. A Whitehall source has told the news agency: Ministers are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week. We are also talking to businesses and other bodies about the timing of moving towards much more widespread working from home. There are many complex considerations to make all these measures as effective as possible. We will make the right decisions at the right time based on the best scientific evidence. Other countries to introduce stringent measures include Cyprus, Bosnia and Uzbekistan. Cyprus is banning entry to non-residents for 15 days, its president Nicos Anastasiades has announced. From Sunday, only Cypriots, legal residents, diplomats, registered students and specific authorised people will be admitted. Anastasiades asked Cypriots abroad not to travel back to Cyprus unnecessarily and said all private and public educational institutions will remain closed until 10 April. Anastasiades said restrictions at crossing points on the divided island\u2019s ceasefire line would remain in place, asking Cypriots to cross only for \u201cnecessary trips\u201d. Bosnia\u2019s authorities have agreed to require two weeks of isolation starting Monday for all its nationals arriving in the country from abroad. The move is likely to discourage members of the large Bosnian diaspora from visiting during forthcoming Easter holidays. And Uzbekistan has suspended all flights to and from France, Spain, and Britain, as well as barring citizens of six countries \u2013including Iran and Italy \u2013 from entering the country. In addition to Italian and Iranian nationals, Uzbekistan has barred French, Spanish, South Korean and Chinese citizens from entering. The Central Asian country, which had already suspended flights to China, South Korea and Iran, has yet to report any cases of the virus. Canada has unveiled aggressive new measures to contain the outbreak; shutting down parliament and advising against foreign travel, even as Justin Trudeau urged citizens to remain calm in a national address delivered from self-imposed quarantine. He told the nation: We have an outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job. We will get through this together. Trudeau, whose wife has been confirmed as having contracted the virus, said he remained symptom free. Of course, [working from home] is an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating. We are all social beings after all. But we have to do this because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends \u2013 especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with pre-existing conditions. Officials announced a raft of new measures including closing parliament for five weeks and redirecting incoming international flights to a small number of airports as part of enhanced screening measures. The government also announced it will ban cruise ships with 500 people from docking in the country\u2019s ports until 1 July \u2013 but stopped short of closing the borders. Canada\u2019s health minister, Patty Hajdu, said: Borders don\u2019t stop travellers. Travellers find other ways into countries. Travellers become less honest. Canada\u2019s approach from the very beginning has been to use science and evidence. Instead, the government has asked Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside the country and to limit contact with crowds. Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, said: Social distancing is an important contribution that everyone can make to our control efforts. This means avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings, considering shopping or taking public transport in off-peak hours and greeting one another with a wave or elbow instead of a handshake, kiss or hug. The actions you take today will save lives. This is a serious public health threat, and a crisis as well as an emergency. Officials in Toronto, the country\u2019s largest city, announced the closure of all child care facilities, public libraries and community centres. They also announced the surprise cancellation of all spring break camps and urged residents to reconsider taking public transit. Experts cautioned that no clear blueprints yet exist on now to stem the spread of the virus\u2014 but that certain measures have shown degrees of success. Dr Susy Hota, an infectious disease specialist and the medical director of prevention and control at Toronto\u2019s university health network, said: There\u2019s no complete science behind any of it really \u2014 but it\u2019s worthwhile to explore different ways of trying to control things. That\u2019s where the social distancing makes sense to consider doing it early and trying to reduce the overall impact on everybody. Egypt has reported 13 new cases, bringing the total of cases detected in the country to 93, Reuters quotes its health ministry as saying. The new cases reported include five Egyptians and eight foreigners. The country has recorded two deaths because of coronavirus \u2013 one of a German tourist and another of a 60-year-old woman, the ministry added. Another to reported its first coronavirus cases was Kosovo, which said a 20-year-old Italian woman and a 77-year-old Kosovar man were confirmed sufferers. The health minister, Arben Vitia, has said: Their condition is stable. We are identifying others that were in contact with the two patients and they are being isolated. We are closing land borders but not for Kosovo citizens who want to return, and our citizens will be self-quarantined for 15 days. From March 16 all flights will be cancelled. Local media said the 20-year-old Italian woman was working for a humanitarian organisation, while the man had also arrived from Italy in the past few days. The also government said it would isolate two regions where the first patients were discovered, as well as closing all restaurants and shopping centres. Schools were closed on Wednesday. Uruguay has also confirmed its first four recorded cases, its ministry of health announced in a tweet. All four cases were people who had arrived to Uruguay from Milan, Italy between 3 and 6 March, the ministry said, adding that the patients are stable and at their homes. Suriname has identified its first case, the country\u2019s vice president told the national assembly. Michael Ashwin Adhin said the patient had traveled to the South American country last week from the Netherlands and that borders and airports will close at midnight for all persons and flights. Plans to close off Catalonia have been announced by the northeastern Spanish region\u2019s president, Quim Torra, who called on the central government to help by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways. The evolution of the contagion calls for most drastic action. We need to restrict entry and exit to protect ourselves. While Catalonia is one of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, major transport hubs come under the mandate of the central government. His call, which would affect Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents, came hours after the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said that a national state of emergency would be declared on Saturday. And, in Madrid, the regional president Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso recommended that residents not leave their homes. In Europe, Hungary is closing all schools and will continue education as best as it can via digital channels, its prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has said. In a Facebook video, he said he expected the Hungarian economy to stall soon and it will have to be restarted; an effort the government will participate in. Multiple times during this press conference, Trump has been asked about the Brazilian official whom he met and who subsequently tested positive. He was asked if he was offering different advice to Americans than he\u2019s practising himself. I think they have to listen to their doctors and they shouldn\u2019t be jumping to get the test unless they have it. In response to a followup question Trump said he would be tested \u201cfairly soon.\u201d Asked how long the national emergency would go on for, Trump did not give a specific answer. Trump said: I hope not long [but] it gives us the power it needs to get rid of the virus. He also said that the Trump administration is in touch with other countries dealing with the coronavirus. They\u2019re calling us and asking for advice. They\u2019re calling for advice from the people behind me. Trump again refuses to take responsibility for the US\u2019s response to the spread of coronavirus, which many have said was too slow. Asked about the closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic office under his watch, he said: When you say \u2018me\u2019, I didn\u2019t do it. We have a group of people in my administration we could ask, perhaps ... I don\u2019t know anything about it. You say we did that but I don\u2019t know anything about it. Here\u2019s a little more detail on Trump\u2019s comments in respect of the US\u2019s travel ban. Addressing potentially adding the UK to the list, he said: We are looking at it based on the new numbers that are coming out and we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will, you could say ban or whatever it is, during this period of time, but yeah their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours so we may be adding that and we may be adding a couple of others and we may frankly start thinking about taking some off. Trump also stressed the importance of local governments staying consistent in their steps to fight coronavirus. Governors around the country have issued bans of large gatherings at varying levels. We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions we take. Then Trump made a small tangent to note all the major sporting events that have been postponed, canceled, or dramatically scaled back to prevent transmission of the virus. It\u2019s incredible with what\u2019s happened to the sports of the world. They\u2019ve done a great service. We can learn and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of these doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. Interesting terms. And very accurate. In a number of weeks I think you will find it\u2019s a very accurate term. It\u2019s important to note that Trump, during a question and answer session following his remarks, was asked whether he or his staff were taking any precautions to make sure they get tests for coronavirus. Trump stressed repeatedly that he and his staff did not have any exposure. I don\u2019t if I\u2019ve had any exposure but I don\u2019t have any symptoms. Trump is asked why the UK was exempted from the travel ban list. He says that was the expert advice and, looking at the increase in the number of cases in the UK, the country may be added to the list soon, while other countries might be taken off it. Trump, who initially called coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d, explicitly refuses to take responsibility for the \u201clag\u201d in testing in the US, blaming what he says were outdated rules and regulations that he says were not designed for this sort of outbreak. Fauci backs him up, saying the CDC-designed system was not designed for this and the US needed the help of private business. Trump also said the United States would take advantage of low oil prices and buy a large quantity of crude to fill the nation\u2019s strategic reserves. Based on the prices of oil, I\u2019ve ... instructed the secretary of energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. strategic reserve ... We\u2019re going to fill it right up to the top. The US vice president, Mike Pence, says coronavirus is now present in 46 of the 50 states of the union. He says the administration will be able to say when Google\u2019s screening website will be available by Sunday. Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democratic senator in Congress, released a statement welcoming Trump\u2019s invocation of the Stafford Act. His response, blasted out before Trump\u2019s presser ended, is below: I\u2019m pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak. I urge New York and other states to immediately request these newly available funds and for the Trump administration to approve these requests without delay. As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis. Trump has introduced representatives from partner organisations working with the White House to combat the coronavirus. They include representatives from Walmart, Walgreens, LHC Group, Signify Health. Most of the business people gave brief remarks about how eager their respective companies are to help. Trump then said as part of the coronavirus response \u201cwe\u2019ll be changing a lot of the rules and regulations for future.\u201d [SIC] \u201cI guess that\u2019ll continue to an extent but we hope it never happens but we\u2019ll be changing a lot of the wholes and speculations,\u201d Trump said. Trump added that \u201cI\u2019ve waived interest on all student loans held by government agencies.\u201d The president said he instructed secretary of energy Dan Brouillette to buy \u201clarge quantities\u201d of gasoline \u201cin the US strategic reserve.\u201d Trump has said: To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50bn \u2013 a very important and a large amount for states and territories or localities in our shared fight against this disease. Trump says the federal government is partnering with the private sector to accelerate production of test kits to make them more widely available to Americans. Alongside Trump was Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert who is on Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force. He says: We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases. But we\u2019ll take care of that. What\u2019s going on here today is going to help it end sooner than it would have. Dr Birx took a few minutes to explain a new coronavirus website for texting. She held up a chart to explain how the website would work (C-SPAN\u2019s Craig Caplan snapped a picture). Dr Birx also set out how the screening website will work \u2013 saying it will guide people through a series of yes or no questions and then, based on their responses, direct them to where they can get the type of health they need locally. This will include whether or not a test is needed at all. Here\u2019s a little more detail on Trump\u2019s comments. Flanked by aides including vice-president Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah Birx, has said the move will waive a number of other requirements meant to benefit doctors and fight the coronavirus pandemic. There\u2019s been an ongoing concern about the availability of tests for the coronavirus. Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week\u201d. \u201cWhich will bring probably 1.4 million tests next week and five million in a month,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d Trump also refers to the sort of drive-through testing systems that have been seen in other countries and that are designed to minimise the exposure of medical staff. He stresses that the US authorities do not want people to get tested if it\u2019s not necessary. The president also thanks a series of private enterprises for their work in equipping the US with some of the tools with which to battle the spread of the virus; including Google, which he says will set up a screening website. Trump claims as many as half a million coronavirus tests will be made available next week, while millions more will follow. Trump says the order will give broad new authority to the US health secretary to waive a series of laws and regulations to give healthcare operators more flexibility as the battle the spread of the virus. The US president says the step will \u201copen up access to up to $50bn\u201d and ordered all 50 states to set up centres to deal with the virus and activate contingency plans. Trump is speaking now. He opens by saying the US has made more progress than \u201cother areas of the world\u201d, attributing that to an \u201cearly\u201d decision to \u201cclose the borders\u201d. Denmark is shutting its borders to most foreign visitors for a month from Saturday, in a move unprecedented in peacetime as part of efforts to halt the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions will come into force at 11am GMT on Saturday and continue until at least 13 April, the country\u2019s prime minister Mette Frederiksen has said. All tourists, all travel, all vacations, and all foreigners who cannot demonstrate a credible reason to enter Denmark will be denied entrance at the Danish border. Danish citizens and foreigners working in Denmark will still be free to enter and leave the country. The transport of goods, including foods, medicine and industry supplies, will also not be affected, she said. The country of 5.7 million people has reported 801 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far and no deaths. Large swathes of Denmark have been in lockdown since Thursday after the government shut all schools and universities and sent home all public sector workers with non-critical jobs in an effort to curb the spread of the disease. The government has notified neighbouring countries Germany, Norway and Sweden as well as the European Commission, Frederiksen said, adding that authorities would need a few days to fully establish the border controls. What is a US national emergency? Donald Trump, as US president, has the power to declare a national emergency, which gives power to the federal government to more freely redistribute funds to state and local governments in a time of the crisis. The president is set to declare a national emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak under the Stafford Act, which was signed into law in 1988 and is designed to encourage local municipalities to design and run their own disaster mitigation efforts, with federal assistance. The last time Trump declared a national emergency was in February 2019 when he declared a national emergency to divert funding for his border wall. That national emergency was declared under a different act, the 1976 National Emergencies Act. Amid reports he\u2019s preparing to declare a national emergency, the US president Donald Trump is due to speak soon. Our US politics live blog will be covering it and I\u2019ll post those updates that are relevant to the pandemic here as well. In addition to the measures we reported earlier, Poland says it will ban foreigners from entering the country from Sunday and impose a 14-day quarantine on its citizens returning home. Morawiecki has said: The state will not abandon (its citizens). However, in the current situation we cannot allow ourselves to keep borders open to foreigners. Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister in the UK\u2019s government who tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week, says her mother has now been confirmed as having contracted the virus. Azerbaijan has banned wedding celebrations and other public events, the authorities have said the day after the country recorded its first death. The measures, which come into force on Saturday, also include shuttering museums, cinemas and theatres. The authorities said the country\u2019s border with Georgia will be closed for 10 days and that all large cultural and sporting events will be postponed by a month. The former Soviet country said on Thursday that a woman who had been quarantined after returning from neighbouring Iran had died from the virus. Schools and universities in the country have been closed since the beginning of March and the authorities extended the closure of the border with Iran for another two weeks on Thursday. Azerbaijan has so far recorded 19 cases. Tunisia will immediately suspend prayers in mosques, close cafes at 4pm every day, and ban all cultural, sports and economic gatherings to combat the spread of the coronavirus, its prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said. The government has also closed Tunisia\u2019s maritime borders, suspended all flights to and from Italy, in addition to reducing flights with Egypt, Germany, Britain and France. Tunisia has confirmed 16 cases; mostly among recent arrivals from Europe. And the disease is expected to hit its crucial tourism sector hard. In London, parliament is limiting visitor access from Monday and introducing restrictions on overseas travel. The Speakers of the Commons and the Lords, Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord Fowler, have said: We are resolved that parliament should, insofar as possible, continue to fulfil its important constitutional duties of passing legislation, holding government to account and, crucially, representing the views of the people of the United Kingdom and making their voice heard. In order to preserve the operation of parliament, it is our duty to take proportionate and reasonable measures to reduce the risk to those who work on the parliamentary estate and those who have to visit. We are clear that now is the time to be pragmatic; everyone in the country is being asked to strike a balance and it is right that we do the same. It is in this spirit that we have decided to implement a number of restrictions relating to overseas travel and visitor access. These steps have been developed in conjunction with Public Health England and reflect the government\u2019s current approach. Members of the public wishing to enter the parliamentary estate solely to view Westminster Hall will not be admitted. The number of people in Germany with coronavirus has climbed again \u2013 this time to 3,634. The eighth death in the country was announced on Friday and a German man died in Egypt last week. In a brief press conference, the chancellor Angela Merkel pledged government support for the economy and for society \u201con all levels\u201d. She described the widespread closure of schools, the announcement of a massive credit programme for businesses and a work reduction programme to support workers and employers as far-reaching measures that would help ease the burden. In contrast to the financial crisis of 2008/9, she said: Here we\u2019re dealing with an opponent, if I may put it like that \u2013 a virus that we don\u2019t know, where we don\u2019t know how we can combat it either, through vaccines or medicine. And that\u2019s why we have to act where we can do so in the most vigorous way we can. Merkel said she hoped all citizens would show solidarity by keeping their distance. She said it was an \u201capparent paradox\u201d that the weakest, oldest and those with pre-existing conditions could be best helped if social contact was avoided Meanwhile, Berlin\u2019s senate has decided \u2013 along with 12 of Germany\u2019s 16 other states \u2013 to close all schools and kindergartens. To its list of cultural institutions forced to close, which included theatres, opera houses museums and concert halls, it has now added nightclubs and bars. The famous fish hall in the northern port city of Hamburg has closed for the first time in its 300-year history, authorities said. India has reported its second coronavirus death. Its ministry of health and family welfare said the person lived in the capital, New Delhi. In Poland, public gatherings are to be limited to 50 people, restaurants, bars and casinos are to close and no inbound flights will be allowed from Sunday onwards, the country\u2019s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said. He said food deliveries would still be allowed and the flight ban would not include charter flights. The American singer, Kelis, has cancelled her two UK gigs next week, which were scheduled for Manchester on Monday and London on Tuesday. She has said: The health and well-being of you, me, our families, friends, and our greater community is of utmost importance ... I look forward to seeing you soon and in the meantime, please take care of yourselves and each other. The singer, who is touring to mark 20 years since the release of her debut album, Kaleidoscope, said she hope the shows can be rescheduled for the summer. The number of cases in Germany has increased from the 3,000 reported earlier on Friday to 3,062, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. It said five people had died after testing positive for the virus. Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, a State Department official has confirmed the Chinese ambassador was \u201csummoned with regard to what the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said over Covid-19\u201d. Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian made the accusation on Thursday on his Twitter account. An editorial in the official China Daily on Friday intensified a war of words with the United States, blasting \u201cChina-bashers\u201d. Earlier this week, the US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said China reacted slowly to the emergence of the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing. The US State Department has summoned the Chinese ambassador over a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson\u2019s comments about claims that the US military was responsible for bringing the new coronavirus to the province of Wuhan at the start of the outbreak. That\u2019s just breaking now on Reuters. Some more interrogation now of that \u2018Herd Immunity\u2019 strategy which appears to be a par of the UK government\u2019s response to the pandemic. While questioning the logic that underpins it, this piece by a virologist in The Converstion online journal questions how much of the discussion around herd immunity is actually part of the policy being pursued. Jeremy Rossman, Honorary Senior Lecturer in Virology and President of Research-Aid Networks, University of Kent, argues: A delay strategy when combined with surveillance and containment, as recommended by the WHO, could be very effective in combating the spread of COVID-19. Yet if we slow the spread of the virus but are relying on herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable people, we would still need 47 million people to be infected. Many of Britain\u2019s biggest insurers are pulling down the shutters to new travel insurance customers, with Aviva, Direct Line and Churchill the latest to stop selling policies as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Responding to the moves, the consumer body Which? said the government, insurers and the travel sector needed to \u201curgently\u201d work together to tackle the challenge because \u201cthe industry depends on people having the confidence to travel knowing they will be covered\u201d. On Wednesday 11 March, LV became the first big insurer to stop selling travel insurance to new customers. Then on Friday 13 March, Direct Line and Churchill said they had taken a decision to temporarily suspend the sale of travel insurance to new customers \u201cso we can focus on our existing customers\u201d. The World Health Organisation has been rolling out details of a new disease Solidarity Response Fund. It enables private individuals, corporations and institutions around the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO. The director general of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said earlier that Europe is now at the centre of the global coronavirus outbreak. School closures lasting four weeks could cut 3% from the UK\u2019s GDP, costing the economy billions of pounds, according to research being considered by the government as it weighs up the benefits and risks of shutting down classrooms. Advisers at the Department for Education and No 10 are examining a range of options from complete closure of all schools and colleges in England, which would affect around 7 million children, to more nuanced policies. Measures being looked at include those effected in Japan, where schools sent home individual classes and age groups when a certain percentage of children were infected, and Austria, where elementary schools have stayed open to effectively act as daycare for the children of essential workers. Belgium has followed a similar path. Other countries have closed all schools. Extraordinary times - or carnage - in the business world. After we reported earlier that Lufthansa was considering an application for financial aid from the German government news now also breaks that Delta Airlines is in talks with the White House regarding support that can be provided. That\u2019s according to a memo to employees from the company\u2019s CEO, and which has been reported by Reuters. Peru has announced it will suspend all flights to and from Europe and Asia for 30 days beginning on Monday, March 16. The government announced the measure via supreme decree on Friday just two days after closing all its schools until the end of the month and ordering travelers from France, Spain, Italy and China to quarantine themselves for 14 days on arrival in the country. The country had 28 Coronavirus cases as of Friday morning, according its health ministry. Gatherings of more than 300 people have been banned while concerts and football matches have been cancelled or postponed. The Andean country is a major tourist destination and Canatur, the main tour operators union, says the $5.2bn sector is in crisis. Cancelled trips from Europe and Asia represent $650m in lost revenue and the loss of some 800,000 direct and indirect jobs, it said on Thursday. The Scottish government has confirmed the first coronavirus related death in Scotland. Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Catherine Calderwood said: I am saddened to report that a patient in Scotland who has tested positive for Coronavirus has died in hospital. I offer my deepest sympathy to their friends and family at this difficult time. The patient, who was being treated by Lothian Health Board was an older person who had underlying health conditions. No further information will be available to protect patient confidentiality. The British government strategy of striving to achieve \u2018herd immunity - by broadening the peak of the epidemic, and allowing immunity to build up among the population - is beginning to come under greater scrutiny. Critics including the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt have expressed concern about the decision to delay more drastic measures, such as school closures. Sir Patrick Vallance, England\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has defended the approach, seeking to underline that it is epidemiology that is guiding the decision not to impose more draconian restrictions on the public\u2019s day-to-day lives immediately. But among others asking questions about the strategy is Anthony Costello, a paediatrician, research scientist and former director of mother, child and adolescent health at WHO. In this twitter thread, he states that vaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself and asks: \u201cIs it ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of an uncertain future benefit\u201d He also asks if the herd immunity strategy conflicts with WHO Policy, adding: \u201cAfter the announcement of this being a pandemic, Dr Tedros, Director General WHO, said \u2018The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u2019\u201d The London marathon has been postponed until October 4, organisers have just announced. Hugh Brasher, the event\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of COVID-19 and public health is everyone\u2019s priority. \u201cWe know how disappointing this news will be for so many \u2013 the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year.\u201d Greek health authorities have announced further preventative measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, saying all bars, malls, restaurants, take-aways and beauty parlours have been ordered closed as the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 190. Supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies and other private health stores can remain open. Earlier Friday, the Greek ministry of culture said all archaeological sites and state-run museums would stay shut until at least March 30, citing the extraordinary circumstances. The move was announced after it emerged that several sites had reported shortages of staff and guards because of Covid-19 concerns. Announcing the introduction of the extra measures, health minister Vassillis Kikilis said it was clear that not all Greeks were adhering to restrictions that had been introduced for their protection. \u201cI had said that we would enforce whatever measure was needed to protect our people,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cToday we are extending the measures so as not to enable coronavirus to spread. Firstly, because new cases have appeared. Secondly, because the restrictive measures are not being adhered to.\u201d Of the 190 confirmed cases, 47 are currently hospitalised in isolation wards around the country. The world\u2019s citizens are being put at risk because of a lack of leadership, according to the former UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, writing today for the Guardian. Brown also called for much greater collaboration on a global scale to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, asking: Why is there, as yet, no internationally coordinated medical project \u2013 equivalent to the wartime Manhattan Project \u2013 mobilising all available global resources to discover a coronavirus vaccine and to fast-track a cure? Brown also takes aim at a familiar opponent, populism, writing that the very idea of global collaboration \u2013 and the convening of what would be a \u201cvirtual\u201d G20 \u2013 sits uneasily with what he describes as the \u201cAmerica first\u201d, \u201cChina first\u201d, \u201cIndia first\u201d and \u201cRussia first\u201d populist nationalism of recent years. The outbreak in Venezuela ( which earlier confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus) could hardly come at a worse time for Venezuela, which despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil, reports Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogota. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. The country\u2019s health services are among the hardest hit by the crisis, with hospitals regularly facing power outages while basic supplies - from latex gloves to routine antibiotics - are often hard to come by. 4.5m people have fled Venezuela, with health care workers and disease specialists among them. Around 3.4 percent of confirmed coronavirus patients have died, according to the World Health Organization, a rate that analysts say would likely be much higher in Venezuela. \u201cJust one case in a hospital could lead to transmission within the system, putting already sick patients at risk,\u201d Kathleen Page, associate professor and medical doctor at Johns Hopkins University, and Tamara Taraciuk Broner, a Venezuela expert at Human Rights Watch, wrote this week in Foreign Policy. \u201cThere is no capacity for complex care due to a lack of basic X-rays, laboratory tests, intensive care beds, and respirators.\u201d Yesterday, Venezuela\u2019s president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared a health emergency ahead of any confirmed cases of Covid-19, banning flights from Europe and neighbouring Colombia. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau - whose wife tested positive for Covid-19 following a trip to the UK - has told a press conference that he has no symptoms of the coronavirus and he is feeling good. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau announced Thursday evening that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and plans to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms have been described as mild. He said that Canada is looking to reduce the number of airports receiving visitors from overseas The leading German business daily, Handelsblatt, is reporting that Lufthansa, the nation\u2019s flagship airline, will apply to the German government\u2019s multibillion liquidity fund for help due to the financial fallout from the coronavirus. In an internal video message to employees, the airline\u2019s CEO, Carten Spohr, said the company would look to the German government for help, as well as entering discussions with governments in the other countries where it has a subsidiary, about possible state aid. A spokesman for the company, Europe\u2019s largest-grossing airline, which last week announced it would cut the number of its flights by 50% in response to the health crisis, confirmed the reports. Apple\u2019s worldwide developer\u2019s conference, the company\u2019s biggest annual event where it reveals the changes heading its software over the coming year, will be online only for the first time, it said today. \u201cThe current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. The company is avoiding the word \u201ccancellation\u201d, instead the press that this year\u2019s even, which will take place in June, \u201cwill take on an entirely new online format packed with content for consumers, press and developers alike\u201d. The event the phone-buying public will be most interested in, the keynote speech that launches the conference, has been streamed live online for several years. But behind the scenes, WWDC is an important annual occurrence for the community of developers who work on iOS and macOS apps, offering them their only real chance for face-to-face conversations with Apple staff. Apple is also committing $1m to local organisations in San Jose, where the conference would have taken place, to offset revenue loss. Security forces in Iran are to empty the streets of cities across Iran in the next 24 hours in a drive to fight the spread of the new coronavirus, according to state television. The move came as the World Health Organization (WHO) said Iran needed to do more to contain the disease. Tehran has recorded 514 people killed and 11,364 diagnosed infections, making Iran one of the worst affected countries outside China. Iranian officials have repeatedly complained that many Iranians have ignored calls to stay home and avoid travel, Reuters reports. \u201cOur law enforcement and security committees, along with the interior ministry and provincial governors, will be clearing shops, streets and roads,\u201d state TV cited Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri as saying at a meeting about the virus. \u201cThis will take place in the next 24 hours.\u201d Back at the WHO press conference and Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies program, has said that each country must decide on measures to protect its own population. As part of an overall strategy there is a place inside national borders for restricting movement. Earlier, he compared the pandemic to the way in which HIV was treated, where those who had tested positive were in a position to protect others. Berlin\u2019s mayor, Michael M\u00fcller has announced that the German capital\u2019s public transport system is to be drastically scaled back to an \u201cemergency service\u201d in line with other measures to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, and in order to protect its staff and passengers. Buses and trams will run a skeletal service from now on, until at least until the end of the easter holiday, with passengers asked to enter buses by the middle door, rather than the front. Tickets will have to be bought in advance because they will no longer be available from the driver. So far no plans have been publicised over whether the S-Bahn train service which runs through the city, is to be scaled down. Unlike the rest of the transport network, it is owned and operated by the national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn. A press conference later today will follow a meeting ofBerlin\u2019s senate place this afternoon is expected to make more details known. Demand for public transport has already fallen, over fears of getting coronavirus. And with schools, kindergartens and most institutions either closed or due to close on Monday, and many people working from home, it is expected demand will further decrease in the coming days. Meanwhile Deutsche Bahn has said while it has no plans to curtail its train service, passengers with tickets for journeys they now no longer feel able to take, will be able to rebook journeys at a later date at no extra cost. Mixed messages have been coming out of Mexico today, where health experts expect localised spread of coronavirus to begin in the last week or March or first week of April, according to reports. By then, health officials say the country will have 20,000 tests ready to go, and private and public labs across the country prepped for testing. So far, Mexico has 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with no deaths. The biggest threat still lies from people already infected entering the country, which is why the government is considering introducing travel restrictions and extra surveillance on travellers from the US. \u201cThe possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south. If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,\u201d the deputy health secretary, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, told a news conference last night. \u201cMexico wouldn\u2019t bring the virus to the United States, rather the United States would bring it here.\u201d On the other hand, in response to Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on 26 European countries, US-bound passengers flying on the national airline, Aeromexico, will from today be required to spend 14 days in Mexico before taking a connecting flight. The airline had already imposed a similar rule for passengers travelling from China. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the announcement unleashed furious reactions on social media with some tweeters accusing the government of prioritising American lives over Mexicans. Europe is now the world centre for the coronavirus outbreak, according to the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. In a press briefing at WHO headquarters, he said that Europe had more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined apart from China. The UK government\u2019s coronavirus strategy and the plan to build up herd immunity is facing mounting growing criticism from the scientific community. More experts are questioning the failure to test more suspected cases and the decision to hold back on the more drastic social distancing measures introduced in many other countries. Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the UK strategy is \u201cdangerous\u201d. Peter Drobac, a doctor in global health and infectious disease at Oxford University, says the \u201cthe UK is really out on a limb\u201d. Speaking to the BBC he added: They waited too long to respond, and we really have to question the wisdom of the idea that we can time social distancing interventions just right to blunt the peak. They are taking an approach which puts them alone in the world. And I think it\u2019s a gamble. The broadcaster and physicists Prof Brian Cox tweeted his doubts about the lack of testing. Professor Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization, outlined his concerns about the herd immunity strategy in a Twitter thread. Schools in England should be remain open until the government calls for their closure, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, told a conference of head teachers. \u201cIn the overwhelming majority of situations, there is absolutely no need to close a school or send pupils or staff home. Obviously there is action to be taken in the event of a positive test but even then, your local health protection team can help stabilise the situation,\u201d Williamson told the annual conference of the Association of School and College Leaders in Birmingham. \u201cAt present we are clear that the best course of action is to keep schools open unless you are advised to close by Public Health England. \u201cThe chief medical officer has said the impact of closing schools on children\u2019s education will be substantial, but the benefit to public health would not be. The government is particularly mindful of the strain on public services like the NHS that would be caused by key workers having to stay home to look after their children as a result of school closures. \u201cWe will be constantly reassessing this position based on what the chief medical officer and the government chief scientific adviser tell us about whether the evidence would require us to close schools in the best interests of children and the best interests of teachers. Only in line with this clear advice will we take this step.\u201d The Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has tested negative for the coronavirus, his son told Fox News on Friday following media reports that his father, who recently met with Donald Trump, had tested positive. \u201cThe test is negative,\u201d Eduardo Bolsonaro told Fox News Channel in an interview. The news follows some confusion today after local media in Brazil reported that Bolsonaro had tested positive. Bolsonaro himself has lashed out on Twitter at \u201cfake news\u201d. Switzerland has announced it is closing all schools and is to provide around 10bn Swiss francs in aid for businesses hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe situation is difficult,\u201d the Swiss president, Simonetta Sommaruga, told reporters, as the government listed a range of measures to halt the spread of the virus after the number of positive tests in the country ballooned to more than 1,000. Local elections have been postponed until May next year in England. The contest were due to be held in May for 118 councils in England along with eight posts for directly elected mayors, including for the mayor of London. A councillor in an English village where one of the first UK cases of coronavirus was confirmed has described the government\u2019s strategy of tackling the disease as \u201ca crime against our country\u201d. Samantha Flower, who is a member of the Conservative party and a social care manager for Sheffield City council, said: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned. They [the UK government] are saying they want as many people to get this disease to create a herd immunisation. But it won\u2019t. My suspicion is that they don\u2019t have the money for social care or NHS so that the weak and the old die. \u201cI\u2019m saying that as a Conservative councillor and I don\u2019t care if I get sacked. You judge a society by how they treat their vulnerable people. You judge leadership by how it treats its most vulnerable people. \u201cHow do we care for them \u2013 by saying it would be better for pretty much everyone to get this disease when we know that our loved ones are going to die? It\u2019s not OK.\u201d Flower is a Conservative councillor on High Peak borough council and represents the Derbyshire village of Burbage, where one of the first known UK cases of Coronavirus was confirmed. Burbage primary school and a nearby medical centre were temporarily closed after a parent tested positive for the virus on 27 February, when just 15 cases had been confirmed in the UK. She added: \u201cWe could follow the World Health Organization\u2019s advice and stop this now but the government\u2019s chosen not to. Our prime minister has just said to us \u2018your loved ones are going to die\u2019 and that\u2019s not OK. It\u2019s abhorrent. It\u2019s a crime against our country. We have the measures and capabilities to prevent this. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be an alarmist but the World Health Organization has set very comprehensive guidance and we\u2019re not following it.\u201d The global death toll of the coronavirus pandemic has passed 5,000, according to tallies kept by both Johns Hopkins university in the US and the Reuters news agency. Both source their information from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. Spain has become the latest country to declare a state of emergency after the number of confirmed cases in the country passed 4,200 and the death toll rose to 120. Spain is the second-worst affected EU country after Italy. The president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, tested positive on an initial coronavirus test, but his son cautioned against the press jumping to conclusions. Reports claimed the White House was to hold an emergency meeting on the diagnosis after Bolsonaro dined with Trump last week. In Britain, 208 more cases of coronavirus have been detected since yesterday, bringing the total number of confirmed Covid-19 patients to 798 \u2013 a rise of 35%. There have been 10 deaths so far from the virus in the UK. The Queen has cancelled forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden, London, as a sensible precaution amid the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, as a driver on the London underground transport network tested positive for Covid-19. A number of sports fixtures have been cancelled or postponed, including the Champions League and Europa League, England\u2019s cricket tour of Sri Lanka, the Masters golf tournament, and all professional football in England and Scotland. France limited public gatherings to no more than 100 people, as countries around Europe brought in a range of stringent measures in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. The first cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Venezuela, where the country\u2019s healthcare system has already been under massive strain in recent years. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said that the country is suspending classes at public and private schools starting on Monday, Reuters reports. \u201cEarly today, two cases were certified,\u201d Rodriguez said in a televised statement. \u201cOne 41-year-old citizen was traveling in the United States. The other was traveling in Spain.\u201d The two both arrived on a flight from Spain and both have been put in quarantine, she said. This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog now. You can flag any news tips to me on twitter at @BenQuinn75 or by email on ben.quinn@theguardian.com The Queen\u2019s upcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden, in London, have been postponed as a \u201csensible precaution\u201d amid the coronavirus outbreak, Buckingham Palace said, PA Media reports. A statement said: As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen\u2019s diary commitments in the coming weeks. In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, Her Majesty\u2019s forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden will be rescheduled. Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice. The death toll of the global coronavirus pandemic has passed 5,000 since the virus was first identified in December, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins university. The site, which has been running an interactive map showing the number of infections reported around the world, reports 5,065 deaths so far, out of 136,929 confirmed cases. The total number of patients that have recovered from the disease is 69,623, Johns Hopkins reports. The region with the highest death toll so far is the Hubei province of China, where the Covid-19 disease first emerged, with 3,062 deaths, followed by Italy, Europe\u2019s worst affected nation, with 1,016 deaths, then Iran with 514 deaths. All figures are those officially reported. Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, has tweeted to say that his father\u2019s coronavirus test is not yet complete. It appears that although Bolsonaro\u2019s initial test has come back positive, he is awaiting the results of a second, definitive test. Meanwhile, however, the Fox Business network is reporting that the White House is due to hold an urgent meeting on Bolsonaro\u2019s positive coronavirus test. The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Scotland increased to 85 in the latest daily figure, an increase of 25 from yesterday, Aamna Mohdin reports. A total of 3,314 Scottish tests have been carried out, of which 3,229 tests were confirmed negative. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the largest number of positive cases, 21, followed by Lothian with 20 cases. The increase in positive cases follows the government\u2019s advice to cancel events with over 500 people to reduce the potential impact on emergency services. The figures come as the Scottish Conservatives cancelled their spring conference due to the coronavirus pandemic. The event was due to take place in Perth in mid-May, but will now be moved to later in the year. Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said: It\u2019s become clear we have no option but to postpone the party conference that was planned for May. The same goes for a party convention that was due to go ahead later in March. Wales\u2019 Six Nations game at home against Scotland on Saturday became the latest sport event to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement comes just hours after the Welsh Rugby Union insisted earlier on Friday the game would \u201cgo ahead as planned\u201d. The organisers of the Boston Marathon have announced that the event is to be postponed until 14 September. The Spanish government is to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus epidemic, paving the way for drastic containment measures after the number of confirmed cases in the country passed 4,200 and the death toll rose to 120, Sam Jones reports from Madrid. In an urgent appearance on Friday afternoon, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the cabinet would convene on Saturday to declare an emergency by activating article 116 of the constitution. Its provisions allow the government to limit the movement of people and vehicles in specified places, to temporarily requisition goods, to take over factories and businesses, to ration the consumption of basic items, and to issue the necessary orders to ensure the provision of services. The article has not been used since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\u2019 strike. The state of emergency will initially apply for two weeks, but can be extended with parliamentary approval. Spain is the European country most affected by the outbreak after Italy, which has confirmed 15,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths. The decision came after the government of neighbouring Portugal also enacted a state of alert as the number of cases in the country reached 78, explaining the situation was now \u201ca fight for our survival and for the protection of Portuguese lives\u201d. As well as ordering the closure of schools and universities, it said the number of customers allowed in bars and restaurants would be reduced. The Madrid authorities have not ruled out a lockdown of the capital, the mayor said on Friday morning, as the number of cases in the region reached 2,000. Jos\u00e9 Luia Mart\u00ednez-Almeida told Antena 3 TV that he had not discarded the idea of locking down the city, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d not to look at every possible scenario. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to happen immediately, nor can we say we\u2019ve ruled it out.\u201d The mayor also suspended licenses for terraces and seating areas outside bars and caf\u00e9s in the capital, urging owners to shut them down before it became mandatory. The mayor said \u201cstricter measures would be needed\u201d to halt the spread of the virus, adding that children\u2019s play areas in parks would be closed from Friday. Hours earlier, authorities in the Basque country had activated a civil protection plan, which allows the regional government to order the confinement of people to stop the spread of the disease. \u201cWe need to use all containment and prevention measures as the situation is serious. We\u2019re not over the worst yet,\u201d the Basque president, I\u00f1igo Urkullu, said on Friday morning. The Basque country has confirmed 346 cases of the coronavirus, and here have been 11 deaths. On Thursday night, the regional government of Catalonia ordered around 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for a fortnight after a steep increase in Coronavirus cases in the area. Igualada, Vilanova del Cam\u00ed, Santa Margarida de Montbui and \u00d2dena have been placed in lockdown after the number of cases linked to a hospital in Igualada rose to 58 on Thursday. \u201cNo one is allowed out of these affected areas,\u201d the regional government said on Thursday evening. \u201cOnly emergency personnel and vehicles bringing fuel and food supplies will be allowed to move around the area.\u201d The move comes almost a week after neighbourhoods in a small town in the northern region of La Rioja were placed in lockdown after a cluster of cases was traced to a funeral in the nearby Basque Country. Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is now warning against all but essential travel to the regions that the Spanish Ministry of Health have designated as areas of community transmission of coronavirus. They are Madrid and La Rioja, and the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y Le\u00f3n). Augusta National has not ruled out hosting the Masters later in 2020 after postponing the first major of the year, as scheduled for April, Ewan Murray reports. A statement issued from the club on Friday followed the model of the PGA Tour, which scrapped the Players Championship after just 18 holes and three subsequent tournaments. The Masters, which began in 1934, has been contested each year since the end of the second world war. Care homes across the United Kingdom are banning visits from friends and family and keeping residents indoors in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus, Amelia Hill reports. The government has not told care providers to shut their doors to all non-essential visits but the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday he was \u201cpersonally surprised that we\u2019re still allowing external visits to care homes\u201d. Mario Kreft, the chair of Care Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 care and nursing homes, advised people on Thursday morning to stay away. \u201cSimply put, not visiting care homes is likely to save people\u2019s lives,\u201d Kreft said. He called for bureaucracy to be cut so older people who no longer needed hospital care could be transferred to care homes, freeing up hospital beds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything that we can to ensure that people are safe, and I would say this to anybody who wants to visit a loved one in a care home to think very, very carefully because totally accidentally, this virus could be transmitted,\u201d he said. The Jack Ma Foundation, the charitable foundation set up by the founder of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, has announced plans to donate 500,000 testing kits and a million masks to the US. Ma said in a tweet: Drawing from my own country\u2019s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus. We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic\u201d The foundation has already helped sourcing and delivering materials to combat Covid-19 to other countries suffering outbreaks, including South Korea, Italy and Iran. Ma\u2019s donation follows the purchase of 31 tons of medical supplies from China by the Italian government, which arrived in Rome early this morning. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau tested positive for Covid-19 just over a week after a high-profile event in London where she was filmed hugging the singer Leona Lewis and kissing the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, Matthew Weaver reports. The wife of the Canadian prime minister was also photographed at the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside the F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the actor Idris Elba. Four days later, Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau went to an International Women\u2019s Day party attended by the former supreme court president Lady Hale. It is feared Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau may have contracted the virus during her London trip. She reported feeling unwell following her return to Canada earlier this week. The University of Oxford has announced that it has six students who have tested positive for Covid-19, and that it may switch to \u201cmore extensive use of technology for teaching and assessment\u201d next term. The university said in a statement: To date, six students have been diagnosed positive for coronavirus at the University. All are receiving all necessary support and medical attention and are recovering well. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, has now written to all staff and students to outline new measuresdesigned to ensure the University remains open and operational as far as possible while following the latest public health advice. The measures include advice to all UK undergraduates to return home as soon as possible after the end of term today, unless there is a compelling reason to stay in Oxford. The move is designed to reduce the pressure on colleges and academic departments. Accommodation is being made available for those students who are unable to return home. The small number of exams which were due over the Easter break have all been cancelled or rearranged. Students have been notified and will be kept informed as new arrangements are made Comprehensive and detailed contingency plans are also being drawn up for the next University term, including more extensive use of technology for teaching and assessment. The University will update staff and students when these plans are finalised shortly. Formula One has called off the Bahrain and Vietnamese Grand Prix after the cancellation of Sunday\u2019s Australian season-opener due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian sports desk reports. Bahrain, the second race on the calendar which was due to take place on Sunday 22 March, had already been scheduled to be run without spectators under floodlights at the Sakhir circuit. Vietnam\u2019s first Formula One Grand Prix had been scheduled for 5 April on the streets of Hanoi as the third round of the season. Both races have now been postponed just over 12 hours after the Australian Grand Prix was officially abandoned following a positive coronavirus test from a McLaren team member. According to the latest figures from the Department of Health, there are now 798 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, 208 more than yesterday. Update: Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, has tweeted to say that his father\u2019s coronavirus test is not yet complete The president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for coronavirus, according to local media. The reports of a positive test come after Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary was found to have the disease following a trip to the US. His son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman who was also on the trip, tweeted that his father \u201cis not exhibiting any signs of the disease\u201d Bolsonaro dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night and videos and photos, including some on Wajngarten\u2019s own Instagram account, showed the press secretary, Bolsonaro and Trump all in close proximity. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. Bolsonaro has downplayed the crisis. On Wednesday, he said \u201cOther flus kill more than this\u201d and has also called concern over coronavirus \u201coversized\u201d. Romania\u2019s interim prime minister, Ludovic Orban, announced on Friday that he and other senior party leaders were going into a 14-day self-imposed quarantine after a party colleague tested positive for coronavirus, Kit Gillet reports. The senator, Vergil Chitac, had attended a recent party leadership meeting. Orban also announced that all ministers in his cabinet would be tested for the virus, and would remain isolated in their offices in order to avoid direct contact with others. He recommended that journalists be tested, too. As of Friday afternoon, Romania had 73 confirmed cases of the virus, with no fatalities. Six individual have been discharged from hospital. Schools have already been cancelled across the country, with events of over 100 people banned and museums shut. On Friday, the Romanian Football Federation announced that it was suspending all games until the end of the month. Authorities in France are tightening controls on mass gatherings, limiting numbers to no more than 100, after previously saying no more than a 1,000 would be allowed. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, told TF1 television that the new limit would come into force immediately. The idea is that we can slow the progression and the circulation of the virus 100 people - that means that there will inevitably be signficant consequences for the theatres and the cinemas. The coronavirus has killed 61 people in France and infected 2,876, according to figures released by the health ministry late on Thursday. Austria has just announced it is following Italy in closing almost all shops except for supermarkets and chemists, Kate Connolly reports. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that the communities of Paznautal and St Anton would be placed under quarantine. The coronavirus epidemic is causing inreased stress and anxiety, particularly among people with existing mental health problems, practitioners and campaigners have said, Jessica Murray and Harriet Sherwood report. Reactions to the crisis can include feeling overwhelmed, fearful, sad, angry and helpless, according to experts. Some people may have difficulty sleeping or concentrating. Fear of contact with others, travelling on public transport or going into public spaces may increase, and some people will have physical symptoms, such as an increased heart rate or upset stomach. The World Health Organization has acknowledged that the crisis is generating stress, and has advised people to avoid watching, reading or listening to news that causes feelings of anxiety or distress. Stephen Buckley, of the mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cWe know that the coronavirus and its impact are causing stress and worry for many people. If you already have a mental health problem, it\u2019s possible that the worries of coronavirus may be affecting how you\u2019re coping.\u201d Anyone from anywhere in the world arriving in Malta will have to undergo two weeks of mandatory self-quarantine, the country\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, announced on Friday. Anyone breaking the order will face a \u20ac1,000 fine for each breach, the Times of Malta reports. Police will carry out spot checks to ensure that the quarantine is observed. The paper quoted Abela as saying: If someone breaches it every day of the quarantine, then they will have to pay \u20ac14,000. We will not tolerate people not abiding by quarantine terms. Malta closed all schools, universities and childcare centres earlier this week. Cyprus has been told that a much-anticipated trip to the island by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall next week will be postponed because of the global pandemic, Helena Smith reports. The royals were due to spend three days in the former British colony in a tour that also included visits to Bosnia and Jordan. It was to be the first royal visit since Queen Elizabeth\u2019s trip to Cyprus in 1993. A Clarence House spokesman said: Owing to the unfolding situation with the coronavirus pandemic, the British government has asked Their Royal Highnesses to postpone their spring tour to Bosnia, Cyprus and Jordan. Health authorities in Cyprus\u2019s internationally recognised southern sector have confirmed 14 cases of coronavirus so far. Another five more have been announced in the island\u2019s breakaway Turkish-run north, bringing the total to 19 islandwide. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, believes more needs to be done to coordinate international action on tackling the coronavirus, his official spokesman has said, Heather Stewart, the Guardian\u2019s political editor, reports. In a briefing to reporters on Friday, his spokesman said: The prime minister believes that this is a crisis which affects countries around the globe, and does require a global response. He added that Johnson has discussed the handling of the outbreak with presidents Macron and Trudeau in the past few days, and will hold more talks with leaders today. Former chancellor Alistair Darling told the BBC\u2019s Today on Friday that he was concerned about the lack of coordination. He said: One of the reasons that the global economy recovered 10 years ago was because of international cooperation. We all did the same thing, from communist China to republican-led United States, international cooperation at the moment is in something of short supply. A civil protection plan has been activated by I\u00f1igo Urkullu, the president of the Basque country, which allows the Spanish region\u2019s government to order the confinement of people to stop the spread of the disease. \u201cWe need to use all containment and prevention measures as the situation is serious. We\u2019re not over the worst yet,\u201d Urkullu said on Friday morning. The Basque country has confirmed 346 cases of the coronavirus, and here have been 11 deaths. Separately Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) warned against all but essential travel to the regions that the Spanish Ministry of Health have designated as areas of community transmission of coronavirus. They are Madrid and La Rioja, and the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y Le\u00f3n). In Scotland, launch events for the Edinburgh International Festival have been cancelled and Scottish football authorities have postponed the rest of the season, following advice from the Scottish government to scrap large gatherings above 500 people. The Edinburgh International Festival announced it will cancel all gatherings associated with its 2020 programme launch, initially set to run from 18th to 25th of March in Edinburgh and London. Instead the Festival is creating a digital event to be broadcast live on 18th March, 12pm on its Facebook page. Fergus Linehan, festival director at Edinburgh International Festival, said: \u201cAt this point, the Festival is almost 5 months away. For now we remain committed to running the International Festival as planned. In hope that the pandemic will be curbed by August, we must continue to provide security for our artists and for our sector. \u201cWe hope that in August, our Festival will provide a much-needed moment of joy after what will have been a challenging summer. To reassure our audiences, we have also revised our refunds policy to offer anyone with Coronavirus related concerns a ticket refund.\u201d The Scottish FA and Scottish Professional Football League announced the postponement of this weekend\u2019s and following midweek\u2019s fixtures, starting with tonight\u2019s Premiership match between Motherwell and Aberdeen and the Championship match between Queen of the South and Ayr United. The suspension will also affect non-professional and grassroots games until further notice, Ian Maxwell, Scottish FA chief executive said. Ethiopia has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, Agence-France Presse reports, shortly after Kenya became the first east African country to report a case of the disease. A 48-year-old Japanese man who had arrived in the country on 4 March 4 from Burkina Faso was confirmed to have contracted the virus, the French news agency reported the Ethiopian health ministry as saying. He is undergoing medical follow-up and is in a stable condition. Those who have been in contact with this person are being traced and quarantined. PA Media reports that a school in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, has been closed due to a case of coronavirus. Lanark Grammar school in Lanark was closed by South Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire. Dr John Logan, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health medicine, said: We would like to reassure all staff and parents that the risk of contracting coronavirus from this individual is very low. Our public health team is in the process of identifying and contacting the limited number of people who were in very close contact with the confirmed case and issuing public health advice. We want to reassure these teachers and parents - and indeed everyone at this time - that they should follow the most up-to-date healthcare advice, which can be found on the NHS Inform website. We would like to thank everyone at the school for their cooperation and support. We are working towards reopening the school on Monday. Tony McDaid, executive director for education at South Lanarkshire council, said: The health and safety of our staff and young people are of paramount importance to us. As soon as we were notified of this matter we immediately met with NHS Lanarkshire\u2019s public health officials and agreed that to close temporarily as a precaution would be the most appropriate step to take. We of course regret the inconvenience this will cause but hope parents, carers and others will understand our reasons for this course of action and fully support our decision. We will keep all parents, staff and teachers updated during this period. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised Britons against all but essential travel to Madrid and some other regions of Spain. We are advising against all but essential travel to the regions of Madrid, La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro. Airlines are continuing to run flights as normal to and from these areas. Turkey has announced its second confirmed case of Covid-19, two days after the virus finally reached the tourism and travel hub, Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, reports. The new patient is a relative of the first, who contracted the novel coronavirus after a visit to Europe. Both are in isolation and are in a stable condition, health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Friday morning. The new case follows extra measures announced Thursday evening by Ibrahim Kalin, a senior aide to president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to contain the spread of the virus. Turkey\u2019s spring school holiday will be moved up one week to 16 March, after which there will be at least one week of online remote teaching. Universities will also be closed for at least three weeks from Monday and all sports events will take place without spectators until the end of April. Turkey, a tourist hub linking Europe and western Asia, had around 50 million visitors last year. It also hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, including some 3.5 million Syrians. Aid agencies have warned of possibly catastrophic consequences if the coronavirus reaches vulnerable undocumented and refugee populations in the region. Hospitals in Istanbul and the capital Ankara have been set up to test and quarantine patients suspected of having the virus. The border with Iran, one of the worst affected countries, remains shut, and flights to several destinations with high rates of infection were cancelled last month. International travel for public servants is now under review. On Thursday, Kalin also advised against all travel excluding extraordinary circumstances and 14-day self-quarantine on return to Turkey for all citizens and foreigners. Erdo\u011fan is still set to meet with his German and French counterparts in Istanbul next Tuesday, as well as possibly Boris Johnson, for talks on the fighting in Syria\u2019s Idlib province. In her inaugural speech, Greece\u2019s first female president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, has urged citizens to comply with the emergency measures announced by health authorities to stem the spread of coronavirus, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Speaking after taking the oath of office in a ceremony dominated by Covid-19, the progressive former high court judge singled out the pandemic, underlying the risk it posed especially for the elderly. \u201cWe are called upon, as an absolute priority, to effectively confront the recent coronavirus pandemic which is a real danger for older citizens,\u201d she told the nation emphasising that the restrictions were vital \u201cso as not to sow panic and prompt the collapse of the health system\u201d. Sakellaropoulou, who was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of MPS when she was nominated for the post in January, was sworn in before an almost empty chamber as parliamentarians, in line with a government ban on mass gatherings, stayed away. There were no handshakes in a ceremony depicted on state-run TV as being both swift and subdued, if also emotionally charged. Greek health authorities have so far declared 117 confirmed Coronavirus cases and one death. The country was among the first in Europe to shut schools and universities. On Thursday, after revealing the fatality, the government announced that cinemas, theatres, gyms and nightclubs would also be closed. A 66-year- old man, who contracted the virus during a tour of religious sites in Israel and Egypt, died after waging a week-long battle for his life in a hospital in the western port city of Patras. Michelle O\u2019Neill, Northern Ireland\u2019s deputy first minister, has broken ranks with government colleagues and urged the immediate closure of schools and colleges to slow coronavirus, reports Rory Carroll in Dublin. The Sinn F\u00e9in member said the region should buck the decision by Boris Johnson to keep UK education facilities open and instead emulate Ireland\u2019s shutdown. O\u2019Neill said: People are rightly concerned about the impacts on their families and their children and as a parent, I share those concerns and I have been contacted by many parents who did not send their children to school this morning. To protect the public, schools and colleges should now be closed. There has been contradictory medical evidence and in that context my view is that we should err on the side of caution. On Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in agreed with the decision to keep schools open but the example south of the border, and restrictions announced by sporting clubs and churches, paved a U-turn. Earlier on Friday, Arlene Foster, the first minister and leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said schools would need to close but at a later, unspecified date. Northern Ireland has recorded 20 cases of Covid-19. The split happened hours before the publication of an official report into the cash-for-ash scandal that is expected to censure Foster. From Monday, almost no-one will be allowed to enter or leave the Czech Republic, as it effectively closes its borders in response to the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the world. According to a report on expats.cz, all foreign nationals without residence will be barred from entering, while all Czech citizens and holders of residence permits will be barred from leaving. The only exceptions to the ban will be Czech nationals and holders of residence permits returning to the country - although they may face quarantine - and those who live within 50km of the borders with Austria and Germany and work in those countries. A further 13 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 38, Public Health Wales has announced. On Friday Dr Robin Howe, incident director for the Covid-19 outbreak response at PHW, said the new cases include four people in the Caerphilly area and two in the Swansea area, the Press Association reported. Dr Howe said: All patients are being managed in clinically appropriate settings based on the assessment of a specialist infectious disease consultant.\u201d Public Health Wales is working with our partners in the Welsh Government, the wider NHS in Wales, and others now that we have entered the delay phase of the UK Coronavirus action plan. This is now not just an attempt to contain the disease, as far as possible, but to delay its spread\u201d Kate Connolly, our correspondent in Berlin, reports that 3,000 people in Germany now have coronavirus. Six people have so far died. Berlin, Bavaria and two other states are the first to announce the blanket closure of schools and kindergartens. Two others, the worst-hit state of North Rhein Westphalia where over 1,000 are infected, and Rheinland Pfalz, are expected to make similar decisions later today. Michael M\u00fcller, the mayor of Berlin, said public transport is also due to be reduced to a minimum. In the Bundestag legislation has been passed this morning allowing companies to access compensation if they put their employees on so-called \u2018Kurzarbeit\u2019 or reduced working hours, enabling them to continue paying them their full wage. The law in all its detail will be fully enacted within the next ten days. \u201cWe will not leave anyone alone,\u201d Olaf Scholz, the finance minister said. In addition Scholz and the economics minister Peter Altmaier are planning billions of Euros of liquidity help for businesses, in an effort to protect firms and jobs. Meanwhile the German Football League, the DFL has announced that Bundesliga and second league matches will be halted from next Tuesday until 2 April. Matches this weekend will continue to take place, but without spectators. This morning at a regular press conference which the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading public health and safety body in Germany has been holding for the past two and a half weeks, its director, Lothar Wieler said public health bodies had three aims in their attempts to tackle the virus. To try to \u2018level off\u2019 the epidemic curve, to ensure the most seriously ill don\u2019t end up having to be hospitalised at the same time. To try to speed up the adaptation of hospitals to cope with an increase in intensive care beds and patients who will need respiratory assistance. He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system. To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus. \u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d. Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels. Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress. Ireland is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports Rory Carroll in Dublin. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles. The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest. \u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement. Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government announced restrictions on Thursday. Harris told a media briefing: People need to remain calm about the food supply. The fear of looting should not arise. We\u2019ve had no looting incidents yet. People have been calm and well-mannered in terms of their shopping. We are there but that\u2019s primarily to provide reassurance and help with traffic flow. The garda training college at Templemore, in county Tipperary, is being considered as a medical centre or quarantine facility. The staff union for the NHS, the GMB, is calling on the UK government to requisition all private hospital beds if more capacity is needed to treat patients seriously ill as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. In a statement, GMB London called on the government to act now to give itself the legal powers it would need to take control of private sector hospitals. Warren Kenny, GMB London regional secretary, said: There are approximately 128,000 overnight beds in the NHS in England. Only a small number of these are intensive care beds. It is not clear what the current numbers are of beds in private sector hospitals but estimates put the figure somewhere in the region of 8,000. Some of these will also be intensive care beds. GMB London know that all sorts of contingency plans will be being drawn up in the background by very capable medical and scientific advisers to deal with the emergency. Some of these plans will involve cooperation with private sector hospitals. However, the Government and their advisers must have available to them the powers to requisition these hospital beds if required to increase capacity to deal with the crisis. In particular, using these beds to divert non-coronavirus-related treatments from NHS hospitals may make sense. This could be particularly the case in London. The electorate will expect the government to be able to mobilise all health capacity - be it public or private - to deal with what the Prime Minister has described as \u2018the worst public health crisis for a generation\u2019. The private health sector cannot be excluded from this mobilisation. UK rail unions are reporting widespread anger among tube workers and loss of trust in the Transport for London management, amid fears over workers\u2019 exposure to infection on the London Underground, Gwyn Topham, the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, reports. The RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: There\u2019s a growing sense of anger amongst tube staff that they are being cut adrift in what is clearly a dangerous front-line environment in terms of the coronavirus spread. We cannot allow this situation to continue and we want an urgent top level summit to address this crisis of confidence. The union will take whatever action is required to protect the well-being and livelihoods of our members. A spokesperson said: Our members have the right to a safe working environment and we will issue guidance to retreat to a place of safety if they think their well-being and personal safety is being compromised. A British woman who died in Bali after contracting coronavirus has been named in Australian media as Kimberley Finlayson. Finlayson died earlier this week in a Bali hospital after coming down with Covid-19 while on holiday with her husband, Ken, who has since tested negative for the virus. She was said to have suffered from a series of pre-existing medical conditions. Sanglah Hospital director, Wayan Sudana told 7NEWS.com.au: \u201cBased on information from Bali Health Agency the laboratory test result of the husband of the Covid-19 patient number 25 are complete. The lab test result is negative.\u201d The Scottish government has opened an advice helpline for businesses following yesterday\u2019s announcement that gatherings over 500 will be advised to cancel from Monday, Aamna Mohdin reports. Economy secretary Fiona Hyslop said the government wrote to all planning authorities this week encouraging them to relax their approach to the enforcement of planning restrictions on shop delivery times and opening hours. Scotland\u2019s football authorities announced they would \u201center discussions\u201d with the Scottish government before deciding whether to postpone matches. In a joint statement, the Scottish Professional Football League and Scottish FA confirmed games would go ahead as planned this weekend. Following the discussion with the Scottish government, the football authorities will \u201cprovide clear and unequivocal advice\u201d on what happens to games from next week. The Scottish FA confirmed they would also take part in a Uefa video conference call on Tuesday to discuss whether Euro 2020 will need to be cancelled. Scotland are due to face Israel in the Uefa Nations League play-off semi-final against Israel on 26 March at Hampden Park. The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast has been looking at the question of whether the UK National Health Service is fit to tackle the developing coronavirus pandemic. The NHS is bracing for a major surge in hospital admissions as the coronavirus outbreak continues to grow. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, made a firm commitment to helping the NHS get \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d. Denis Campbell, the Guardian\u2019s health policy editor, tells Rachel Humphreys there is genuine concern among staff that the service will not be able to cope in the event of a sustained crisis of the type being seen in Italy. The Premier League, the Football League and the Women\u2019s Super League and Championship have suspended all matches until 3 April in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Paul MacInnes reports. An unprecedented development, it follows the revelation overnight that several Premier League clubs have members of staff, including players and coaches, who are displaying symptoms of the virus. All schools in Croatia are to shut from Monday, the country\u2019s prime minister announced on Friday morning. Andrej Plenkovic told reporters: The whole world is at war with the virus. The responsibility of every citizen is an essential discipline that will affect the spread of the epidemic. I call on everyone to be accountable and to listen carefully to the instructions and to all public health professionals. The headquarters will continue with all its activities as before, twice a day at 9 am and at 4 pm.\u201d Everybody is thinking about closing schools. Our health experts say that a very small percentage of those infected are below the age of 20. But children are especially important, and we will stop teaching from Monday for two weeks. Reuters currently has the country down as having 27 cases, but a reader who sent in details of the schools closures says the most recent figure is 31. From Monday, all schools in the German state of Bavaria will be shut until the end of the Easter holidays on 19 April, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reports. The five week holiday means almost no child in Bavaria will be able to go to school or kindergarten, with emergency care organised in only a few cases, according to the paper. Bavarian prime minister Markus S\u00f6der also announced that he would ban visits to retirement homes and hospitals and that events with more than 100 visitors would be banned unless they were absolutely necessary. The climbing season on Mount Everest has been called off amid fears over the coronavirus pandemic, Pete Pattisson reports. The Nepal government suspended all mountaineering permits on Thursday and, as we reported earlier, will stop issuing on-arrival tourist visas, dealing a devastating blow to the country\u2019s tourism industry. Nepal\u2019s tourism minister Yogesh Bhattarai told the Guardian, \u201cWe will review the decision if the situation improves, but for now everything has been cancelled. Those who have paid for climbing permits will be refunded.\u201d The Chinese government has also cancelled all expeditions from the north side of Everest. The announcement comes as Nepal enters its peak tourist season when tens of thousands of trekkers and mountaineers were expected to test themselves among the highest mountains in the world. Trekking and climbing are a lucrative and vital source of revenue for Nepal. Last year the government earned over \u00a33.5 million from issuing climbing permits on peaks above 6000 metres, including Everest. Despite its impact, the decision appears to have the support of the tourism industry. Mingma Sherpa, the director of Seven Summit Treks, Nepal\u2019s biggest and arguably most successful expedition company, supported the move. \u201cNo doubt our business will suffer but who will be responsible if the virus spreads on the mountain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mountain is here, it\u2019s not moving anywhere. People can come and climb next year.\u201d Nuru Janbu Sherpa, the CEO of International Sherpa Adventure, a trekking and expedition company said, \u201cIt\u2019s a positive decision as it will help to contain the spread of the virus. If waiting six months helps to protect people, we have no problem with suspending our business.\u201d However, Sherpa warned that the decision will hit many low wage labourers who depend on climbing for their livelihood. The mountaineering industry in Nepal has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years. Climbing on Everest was effectively called off following an avalanche in 2014 and the 2015 earthquake. Last year, the government was widely criticised for failing to manage the huge numbers of climbers on the peak, which some claimed contributed to the deaths of 11 mountaineers. Nepal has had just one confirmed case of the coronavirus, said Basu Dev Pandey, the director of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease hospital in Kathmandu, but he warned the country was at risk due its location between China and India. In a further blow to the economy, last week Qatar barred entry to travellers from 14 countries, including Nepal, leaving tens of thousands of migrant labourers unable to start work in the emirate. Almost 30% of Nepal\u2019s GDP comes from remittances sent by its migrant workers, who are largely based in the Gulf and Malaysia. PA Media has more details on the London underground train driver who has tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who works on the tube\u2019s Jubilee Line, has been off work this week after returning to the UK from holiday in Vietnam, sources told the news agency. An internal message to staff said the driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had been self-isolating but had tested positive for Covid-19. The memo said: The operator is receiving support from health services and is continuing to follow Public Health England (PHE) advice to self-isolate. The train operator has recently returned from a trip abroad, where it is thought the illness may have been contracted. Rail union leaders wrote to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, on Thursday, voicing concern about what advice transport workers are being given. The letter said: We are writing jointly as representatives of workers in the transport industry to implore you to break your silence and give leadership on measures that public transport can take to tackle coronavirus. Transport workers are receiving different advice from different companies - and in some cases even within the same company - about what actions to take in the event of suspected or actual illness. There is concern of \u2018over-managing\u2019 attendance procedures and how they are being applied. Clearly, if someone is told to self-isolate they should not then be penalised by their employer for doing so in the interest of public health, yet this is currently the case in the rail and bus industries. Our privatised transport system is not conducive to swift and co-ordinated responses. There is apparently no consistency across the public transport network in how transport workers will be treated if they fall ill. Companies where employees work side by side with transport workers employed by another company are being treated differently, leading to confusion and frustration. The Scottish government is advising that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled next week, as the number of positive cases jumps to 60 yesterday. Were you planning on attending an event or a trip that might now not go ahead? If so, please get in touch with the Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin, who is based in Edinburgh, at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com. Barack Obama is to blame for shortcomings in the United States government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump has said. But not to worry, he has fixed the problems by slashing red tape. In the UK, a hospital left a patient with coronavirus on a ward of critical ill patients while she was being tested, according to a local newspaper report. The Basingstoke Gazette reports that it was told by an employee of Basingstoke and North Hampshire hospital that the woman, who was showing coronavirus symptoms, was moved into a ward with critically unwell women. However, Hampshire NHS Trust says that the reports are completely untrue. According to the paper: The unwell patient remained on the ward around critically ill people for hours until results revealed she had coronavirus. Nurses in normal uniform and without protective gear moved her. The member of staff contacted this newspaper after being appalled by the practice which they claim will lead to a \u2018dangerous spread\u2019 of the disease and warns the hospital is on the brink of an outbreak. Now a patient who was forced to temporarily share the ward with the Covid-19 sufferer is displaying symptoms of the disease. You can read more on the Basingstoke Gazette website. England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka has been officially called off due to the global spread of the coronavirus, Ali Martin reports. The decision was announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board and their Sri Lankan counterparts on Friday morning while Joe Root\u2019s players were out in the middle playing the second day of their final warm-up fixture in Colombo. The two-match series, part of the World Test Championship, was due to start in Galle next Thursday. But with England supporters due to begin travelling out to the island in the coming days, and apparent unease among the squad about the situation, a postponement became inevitable. The World Health Organisation is using its Twitter feed to highlight the important role that women play - often unpaid and unrecognised - in handling outbreaks such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Uefa has postponed all Champions League and Europa League fixtures next week because of the coronavirus, the Guardian\u2019s sport desk reports. Two Europa League games, those between Sevilla and Roma as well as Inter and Getafe, had already been postponed this week and on Thursday next week\u2019s game between Manchester City and Real Madrid was suspended. On Friday morning the European governing body announced that all games next week had been suspended. Authorities in Madrid, the capital of Spain, have not ruled out a lockdown of the capital, the mayor said on Friday, as the number of cases in the region reached 2,000, Sam Jones reports from the city. Jos\u00e9 Luia Mart\u00ednez-Almeida told Antena 3 TV that he had not discarded the idea of locking downthecity, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d not to look at every possible scenario. He added: We can\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to happen immediately, nor can we say we\u2019ve ruled it out. The mayor also suspended licenses for terraces and seating areas outside bars and caf\u00e9s in the capital, urging owners to shut them down before it became mandatory. He said \u201cstricter measures would be needed\u201d to halt the spread of the virus, adding that children\u2019s play areas in parks would be closed from Friday. On Thursday night, the regional government of Catalonia ordered around 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for a fortnight after a steep increase in Coronavirus cases in the area. Igualada, Vilanova del Cam\u00ed, Santa Margarida de Montbui and \u00d2dena have been placed in lockdown after the number of cases linked to a hospital in Igualada rose to 58 on Thursday. The regional government said on Thursday evening: No one is allowed out of these affected areas. Only emergency personnel and vehicles bringing fuel and food supplies will be allowed to move around the area. The move comes almost a week after neighbourhoods in a small town in the northern region of La Rioja were placed in lockdown after a cluster of cases was traced to a funeral in the nearby Basque Country. The government of the Czech Republic has also declared a state of emergency, restricting the opening hours of restaurants and cafes, closing gyms and sports facilities, and requiring people returning from high risk countries to quarantine themselvs. According to a report in Prague Morning, the rules will permit restaurants and cafes to open only between 6am and 8pm, while refreshments at shopping centres will be banned altogether. Those organising weddings have been asked to keep their guest lists to a maximum of 30 people, while funerals may be attended to 100 people. According to prime minister Andrej Babis: \u201cWe are also banning theatre, music, film and other performances, sports, cultural, religious, community, dancing, traditional events and other meetings.\u201d The Czech government will also require people returning from all high-risk countries to quarantine themselves, widening a requirement so far only applied to those returning from Italy, foreign minister Tomas Petricek said on Twitter on Friday. The list includes Austria, Belgium, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iran, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the US, Prague Morning reported. Bulgaria has become the latest European country to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s parliament voted unanimously on to declare the state of emergency until 13 April after the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 23. It will allow for travel bans to and from countries with large coronavirus outbreaks, the closing of schools and universities, and permit police to intervene when imposed isolation of infected people is not observed. The government also plans a revision of the 2020 state budget to allocate more funds to support the healthcare system, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov told deputies. In news that will be worrying for those of us who travel on the Tube to work every morning, a London Underground driver has tested positive for coronavirus, sources told PA. Earlier this week we reported that Transport for London had stepped up cleaning protocols across its Tube and bus networks. The Portuguese government has put the country on a \u201cstate of alert\u201d and ordered the closure of schools and universities as the number of cases reached 78, Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent reports. It said the move was intended to ensure that \u201ccivil protection and security forces\u201d were ready to react to the situation \u201cpromptly\u201d. The government said the opening hours of shopping centres would be limited to avoid overcrowding and that the number of customers in bars and restaurants would be limited. It added: \u201cThis is a fight for our survival and for the protection of Portuguese lives.\u201d The country\u2019s football league was also suspended. Irish authorities are reportedly trying to identify 10,000 beds around Ireland as a contingency for coronavirus, Rory Carroll reports from Dublin. The Health Service Executive is attempting to source beds in hospitals, hotels, military barracks, student accommodation and other sites for a possible surge in cases, according to RTE. The National Public Health Emergency Team said the delay phase measures announced on Thursday \u2013 such as closing schools and universities and banning big public gatherings \u2013 may slow infections so that 200 people a week catch the virus over five weeks instead of 500 people a week catching the virus over two weeks. The goal is to give health services and society time to handle the pandemic. Simon Harris, the health minister, on Friday said environmental health workers would meet people returning from Spain and Italy. He asked such people to not go to work and curb social interactions for two weeks. \u201cIt is not quite self-isolate, but to restrict their movements.\u201d Ireland has 70 confirmed cases. Northern Ireland has 20. Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, said the region would close schools at some point. The Premier League are expected to convene at 10.30am to determine what happens next. This is an unprecedented time but all 20 clubs will need to come to an unanimous decision for any action to be taken and government officials are also being kept in the loop. The EFL board are likely to follow action taken by the Premier League, who at 9.30pm on Thursday said all of this weekend\u2019s games would \u201cgo ahead as scheduled\u201d before, an hour later, releasing a statement confirming Friday morning\u2019s emergency meeting. In terms of press conferences, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s has been canned, as has Frank Lampard\u2019s. Steve Bruce and Eddie Howe, however, are scheduled to speak as planned imminently. Read more on our football live blog: Egypt has reported its first Covid-19 death of an Egyptian citizen, hundreds of miles away from Luxor, the city at the centre of outbreaks of the virus, Ruth Michaelson reports from Cairo. According to state media and the Egyptian ministry of health, a 60-year-old woman in the Nile Delta town of Mansoura \u201cwas administered a PCR test and tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday evening,\u201d after arriving at a local chest hospital with acute pneumonia. Mansoura is 465 miles away from the ancient city of Luxor, where increasing numbers of tourists have reported infection after departure. The woman was transferred to quarantine and died Thursday night. It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East. A German tourist transferred from Luxor to a hospital in the resort town Hurghada died last Sunday from the virus. The outbreak in Mansoura shows that the virus is spreading inside Egypt. \u201cThe 13 new coronavirus cases include six who showed no symptoms and had contracted the virus after coming into contact with people who previously tested positive,\u201d said government-owned outlet Al-Ahram. Egypt\u2019s health ministry continued to update the number of official cases, but has not regularly named the location of infections. The country\u2019s minister for education announced earlier this week that schools were banned from trips in the governorates of Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada due to outbreaks of the virus. The ministry also announced that a school in the central district of Zamalek would close and parents and teachers self-isolate for a fortnight \u201cas a precautionary measure, after a parent of one of the school students was in contact with a foreigner who tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d As the disease shows signs of spreading, some in Cairo attempted to retain a sense of business as usual even as Egypt was battered by a freak storm forcing many to stay indoors. Certain bars and clubs in Cairo announced they would test patrons temperatures on entry. School classes in Belgium have been suspended from Monday, as the the country\u2019s national security council implemented a number of measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. Other measures include the closure of all restaurants and bars by midnight and the cancellation of all recreational, cultural and sporting events while restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s and nightclubs are ordered to shut at midnight until 3 April. Pharmacies and grocery shops will remain open as normal, while other shops must close at weekends, Eurativ.com reports. The health minister of Kazakhstan has announced that two Kazakh citizens have tested positive for coronavirus the first cases of the disease in the Central Asian country, after returning to the country from Germany. The patients are staying in a specialised hospital in Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest city, Reuters reports him as saying. The British clinical psychologist Simon Baron Cohen has revealed on Twitter that he has advised all staff in his laboratory to work from home. Baron Cohen, who is professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge, included a link in his tweet to a Medium article that claimed that just one day\u2019s delay to implementing social distancing measures could increase the spread of coronavirus by up to 40%. Could the US president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, be infected with coronavirus? She was pictured last week standing next to Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton, whose diagnosis was revealed today. The UK government\u2019s chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance has appeared on BBC Radio 4\u2019s agenda setting news programme Today to defend the measures announced last night by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to combat the spread of Covid-19 in the UK. Many people had criticised the measures, which appeared comparatively relaxed compared to those taken by other countries, even in Europe, as too little, too late. But Vallance said that the government\u2019s reasoning was \u201cbased on which interventions are going to have the biggest effect.\u201d He said the government\u2019s plan was to reduce the peak of the epidemic, \u201cpull it down and broaden it,\u201d which he said everyone agreed was the best approach. The government wanted to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d among the population, Vallance said, suggesting that it would be worse to suppress the disease completely then for it to return in the autumn If you suppress something very hard, when you release those measures it bounces back at the wrong time so our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely. So because most people get a mild illness, to build up some degree of herd immunity as well, so that more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same we protect those who are most vulnerable. The UK cabinet minister who went into self-isolation earlier this week has tested negative. Anne Marie Trevelyan, the secretary of state for international development, said she would nevertheless self-isolate for seven days. All major public events have been banned in Kenya after it confirmed the first case of coronavirus in east Africa. The patient is a woman who had returned to the country from the United States via the UK. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe told reporters on Friday morning I want to inform you that the Ministry of Health has confirmed the first coronavirus case in Kenya. The case is a Kenyan citizen who travelled back to Nairobi, returning from the United States of America via London, United Kingdom, on March 5, 2020. Kagwe told a news conference the government had suspended all public gatherings, sporting events, open-air religious meetings and \u201call events that are of a huge public nature\u201d, Reuters reported. He also warned traders that \u201cThis is not the time to make abnormal profits by charging abnormal prices\u201d. All rugby fixtures in France have been suspended. In the UK, a student at the University of Hertfordshire who has tested positive for coronavirus was a resident of campus student halls, the Guardian has been told. A reader, the parent of another student, has written in to say that students are fearful because the university has said it will not close. Deep cleaning is taking place at the infected student\u2019s flat, the Guardian was told. According to a statement on the university website: A student studying at the University of Hertfordshire has tested positive for Covid-19. We are working closely with the NHS and Public Health England to support the affected student, who is being looked after at home. We want to reassure our students, their parents and our staff that the health, safety and security of our community is always our highest priority. The risk of the virus being passed on to other people on campus is low, we continue to follow PHE and government advice and the university is continuing to operate as normal. As a precaution, we have cleaned the affected areas in accordance with Public Health England advice. Here is a video of the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement that all non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people are to be suspended from Monday. Nepal has announced that visa-on-arrival has been suspended for all visitors to the country and that all foreign arrivals entering the country from tomorrow must stay in self-quarantine for 14 days. Here is the official announcement on the Nepali department for immigration website. Turkey has announced its second coronavirus patient, the day after the government implemented a number of new measure to try to stem the spread of the virus. The health minister, Fahrettin Koca, wrote on Twitter that the second patient, whose test results came on Thursday evening, was from the circle of people close to the first patient diagnosed on Wednesday. It comes after the presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin announced that Turkish schools will be closed for one week and universities for three weeks from 16 March, and all sports events will be played without spectators until the end of April. At a news conference following a meeting of ministers at the presidential palace, Kalin also said that President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign visits and programmes will be postponed for some time due to the spread of the virus, according to Reuters. Kalin said primary, middle and secondary schools would initially be closed for one week and after that students will receive remote online teaching from 23 March. Turkey was the last of the world\u2019s major economies to report an outbreak, though all its neighbours except war-ravaged Syria had reported cases. Spanish-language Twitter feeds have been reporting that Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for coronavirus, Dom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro. It comes after Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary was found to have the disease following a trip to the US, but the reports are being denied as fake news and none of Brazil\u2019s main media sites have confirmed them. Bolsonaro has taken a test, however, according to local media, and the results will be ready on Friday. His son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman who was also on the trip, tweeted that his father \u201cis not exhibiting any signs of the disease\u201d. On Thursday, the Brazilian government confirmed media reports that Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, tested positive following the US trip he was also on, along with ministers, congressmen and the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, as well as Eduardo Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night and videos and photos, including some on Wajngarten\u2019s own Instagram account, showed the press secretary, Bolsonaro and Trump all in close proximity. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. The Intercept has reported that aside from Wajngarten, three other members of the delegation have also reported feeling flu-like symptoms and been tested, quoting an anonymous source. It did not name the three others. Meanwhile conservative Brazilians planning pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations across Brazil that are attacking Congress on Sunday have begun sharing images of people wearing masks \u2013 but are insisting the protests, which Bolsonaro himself endorsed, will go ahead. Bolsonaro has cancelled an interview for the launch of CNN Brasil due to air the same day, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper site reported. Yesterday we reported that a number of UK universities, including the LSE and the Manchester Metropolitan university, had decided to move classes online to combat the spread of coronavirus. But it appears students across the country have called on their universities to do the same. Many other universities across the world have already decided to close their doors and continue semesters remotely, or even to postpone teaching altogether. Change.org says it is hosting more than 40 petitions relating to university measures across the UK, with most calling for teaching to move online. Kajal Odedra, the UK executive director of Change.org, said: Hundreds of people around the UK are turning to Change.org to start petitions around coronavirus and how this global health issue is affecting their community. Coronavirus-related petitions are the biggest trend on Change.org right now and we expect more petitions to be started over the coming days as people wrestle to get the information they need to prepare for the virus. This is Damien Gayle in London taking control of the liveblog now, as the sun moves across the world from Asia towards Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As ever, I will be posting updates from the Guardian\u2019s network of correspondents across the world, as well as the most-important updates from the news wires and social media. If you have any news that you think we should be reporting on the live blog, please do get in touch. You can reach me on email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. With the huge interest in the coronavirus story, I won\u2019t be able to reply to all messages, but I\u2019ll do my best to look at all of them. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle who will be bringing you the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic for the next while. For those of you just waking up, below is our latest coronavirus At a Glance summary piece, as well as the very fresh and more in-depth wrap of the key developments over the last few hours. The latest blog summary is here. The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has confirmed via Twitter that he has coronavirus. \u201cThis morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat. I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for Covid-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,\u201d he wrote. Dutton has been admitted to hospital, per Queensland health\u2019s general advice. Earlier today, Dutton did not attend his usual Today Show interview. Host Allison Langdon said it was \u201ca stomach bug\u201d. As stated in his release today, Dutton said he woke up with the symptoms this morning and got the test back this afternoon. Universities and colleges across the US are halting teaching, moving lessons online, and even asking students to move out of campus accommodation in an attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Dozens of institutions \u2013 including UCLA, NYU, Yale and Princeton \u2013 are cancelling in-person lessons in favour of online teaching. Harvard and Amherst have gone as far as to ask their students to move out, disrupting the lives of thousands of students in the process. The first case of someone suffering from Covid-19 can be traced back to 17 November, according to media reports on unpublished Chinese government data. The report, in the South China Morning Post, said Chinese authorities had identified at least 266 people who contracted the virus last year and who came under medical surveillance, and the earliest case was 17 November \u2013 weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus. The Chinese government was widely criticised over attempts to cover up the outbreak in the early weeks, including crackdowns on doctors who tried to warn colleagues about a new Sars-like virus which was emerging in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province. Singaporeans have been advised by the country\u2019s health ministry to defer all non-essential travel to Italy, France, Spain and Germany. China\u2019s city of Yichang in central Hubei province will loosen travel curbs adopted to rein in a coronavirus outbreak, allowing people to move in and out, the government said on Friday, in a statement on its website. It will also allow the return of people from outside the province, employing a \u201chealth code\u201d monitoring system that makes use of mobile telephone. Nepal has closed all of its Himalayan peaks including Mount Everest this climbing season because of fears of the coronavirus outbreak, a government minister said on Friday, Reuters reports. Nepal, home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, gets more than four million dollars in permit fees for the world\u2019s highest peak and other mountains every year. Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said expeditions to all peaks in the March-May spring season had been suspended. \u201cClimbing this season has been closed,\u201d Bhattarai told Reuters. \u201cIt is as a precaution for that,\u201d he added, when asked it its was because of the coronavirus. Nepal has confirmed just one case of the coronavirus - a student studying in China on a trip home - out of 450 people tested. The suspension of expeditions in Nepal will affect hundreds of foreign climbers now preparing for the spring season, a window of relatively good weather between the end of the bitterly cold winter and the rainy season, which begins in June. Everest, the world\u2019s highest mountain at 8,850 metres (29,035 feet), is on the border between Nepal and the Chinese region of Tibet. China announced the closure of its side of the mountain on Thursday. The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the food service industry to review its policies. This brushing off of illness is common in many places within the food service and restaurant industry and has been for many years. But with the recent coronavirus outbreak, being sick is no longer something people can shrug off given the illness\u2019 ability to spread rapidly and efficiently. The culture around sick leave in the food service industry is that it is nearly nonexistent. The CDC says that 15% of food workers have paid sick leave. That means a bulk of people in the industry are part of the 32 million American workers who are without paid sick leave. Poor sick leave policies are an \u201cindustry standard\u201d in food service, particularly fast food, said Judy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Center. The US does not have a federal sick leave policy, with 12 states and Washington DC having paid sick leave laws. A nurse on the frontline of Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has described the experience as \u201cwar-like\u201d. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock as the country tries to halt the spread of a virus that has so far claimed over 1000 Italian lives. Among the dead was a 59-year-old doctor and close friend of Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna, the region with the second highest number of cases. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience I would compare to a world war,\u201d Re told the Guardian. \u201cBut it\u2019s a war that isn\u2019t fightable with traditional arms \u2013 as we don\u2019t yet know who the enemy is and so it\u2019s difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off.\u201d A summary of the latest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak, below: Today\u2019s Covid-19 news so far has included the effects of the virus on sports stars, politicians, religious ceremonies, New York City, the Nikkei and the United Nations \u2013 as the number of deaths worldwide approached 5,000. Here is what has been going on: A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus. She is the first known case at the world body\u2019s New York headquarters. New York state banned all gatherings with 500 or more people as New York City declared a state of emergency. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints suspended all of its worship services globally because of the spread of the coronavirus. The Vatican closed all Catholic churches across Rome to stem the spread of the virus. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for coronavirus. Justin Trudeau in self-isolation. Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first confirmed infection among Premier League players. The Australian share market closed 4.4% up after falling almost 7% on opening. India registered its first coronavirus death: a 76-year-old man in Karnataka who had fallen sick on returning to India on 29 February after a pilgrimage to Mecca. Japan again insisted that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer, hours after Donald Trump added to speculation that the coronavirus pandemic could force them to be postponed or cancelled. Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort announced they would close through the end of the month, starting at the close of business Sunday. Ghana and Gabon confirmed their first cases, becoming the ninth and tenth countries in sub-Saharan Africa to register positive cases. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison advised against non-essential travel, and, from Monday, gatherings over 500 people. He said he would be attending a football match this weekend. The advice did not extend to schools and universities. The Australian Grand Prix was cancelled, after a member of the McLaren Racing Team tested positive for Covid-19. A second person has tested positive for coronavirus in Turkey, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. In Vietnam, there is also a risk of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam, the British Embassy in Hanoi said in a statement on Twitter. \u201cYou are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Vietnam if you either develop flu-like symptoms, or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested for coronavirus. There are also increased restrictions on British nationals wishing to visit Vietnam. \u201cFrom 12 March, Vietnam has suspended its visa waiver programme for British nationals. There are reports that e-visas have also been suspended and the Vietnamese embassy in London will not be processing visa applications until further notice. \u201cThe Vietnamese embassy in London say that it is possible to get a visa, but there is uncertainty around the replacement process and timeline for such applications.\u201d The statement added that British citizens are \u201cstrongly advised\u201d to familiarise themselves with these risks before travelling. So far, 10 British citizens are among those who have tested positive for the virus. Key attractions across Hanoi, as well as the ancient town of Hoi An, in central Vietnam, have closed, while several areas in Quang Ninh province, including Ha Long Bay, a Unesco world heritage site, and Bai Tu Long Bay, have also stopped receiving visitors. A total of 44 cases have so far been confirmed across the country. The British embassy in Hanoi has warned UK travellers of a risk that they will be placed in \u201csafe but basic\u201d quarantine centres and turned away from hotels if they travel to Vietnam, where a cluster of cases has been linked to a flight from London. Tens of tourists believed to have been exposed to the virus on board a flight that arrived in Hanoi on 2 March have been placed in isolation. Meanwhile, a growing number of Vietnam\u2019s most popular holiday attractions have closed their doors to tourists. The country appeared to have contained the virus after recording no new cases for 22 days. But over the past week, 28 new infections have been confirmed. The British embassy in Hanoi said on Friday that there is \u201ca high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Vietnam, regardless of your route. It added: Vietnamese quarantine centres are safe but basic, not guaranteed to meet Public Health England\u2019s standards.\u201d JP Morgan is calling a global recession. They have \u2018dramatically\u2019 revised their forecasts for two main reasons, they said in a note: A sudden stop. The breadth of \u201csocial distancing\u201d is increasing at a dramatic pace. Italy is now in total lockdown and the US as well as other countries are suspending flights from a wide range of nations. A broad range of public events has been canceled for the coming weeks. Markets spasm. Financial conditions are tightening sharply as perceptions of credit quality across a wide range of asset classes deteriorates and market liquidity dries up. Credit spreads and market measures of corporate and sovereign default risk have widened markedly. The bank says: We now see a 1H20 contraction in GDP that is both significant and spreads across nearly all of the global, we believe that our forecast represents an event best characterised as a recession. The Australian market has finished up 4.4% for the day, after being down as much as 8% during the day. That\u2019s a range of more than 12 percentage points, representing an extraordinary rollercoaster ride of a day. Earlier, the Reserve Bank made a dramatic intervention in the markets in a bid to stop a credit crunch, pumping AU$8.8bn (US$5.3) in short-term funding into the banks. It did this by agreeing to buy assets such as portfolios of loans from the banks for cash, and then sell them back the same assets later on. While the late rally erased losses experienced on Thursday, when the market dived 7.4%, the damage inflicted since coronavirus selling began on 20 February still means all gains since the start of last year have been wiped out. India has registered its first coronavirus death: a 76-year-old man in Karnataka who had fallen sick on returning to India on 29 February after a pilgrimage to Mecca. He died on Tuesday and was later confirmed to have tested positive. Officials are tracing all the people he came into contact with. As the number of cases rose to 73, the Delhi government ordered the closure of all schools, colleges, and cinemas till 31 March and made it mandatory for shopping malls, government offices and public spaces to be disinfected every day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has told all ministers not to travel abroad. With the Indian Premier League \u2013 a hugely popular cricket tournament \u2013 starting on 29 March, the government has advised against going ahead with it but left the decision to the organisers. Google confirmed today that one of its employees in Bengaluru is infected. The man had recently returned from Greece. On Thursday, the Indian stock market saw the worst crash since 2008, crashing by 2,919 points. Japan has again insisted that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer, hours after Donald Trump added to speculation that the coronavirus pandemic could force them to be postponed or cancelled. The country\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said Tokyo 2020 organisers would continue to plan for a \u201csafe and secure\u201d Games, due to open on 24 July. Trump had caused consternation among Japanese officials when he told suggested on Thursday that postponing the Olympics for a year was preferable to holding events in empty venues. Trump told reporters in the White House that he \u201cjust can\u2019t see having no people there\u201d. \u201cMaybe they postpone it for a year... if that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, adding that he preferred that idea to \u201chaving empty stadiums all over the place. I think if you cancel it, make it a year later that\u2019s a better alternative than doing it with no crowd.\u201d Trump and Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, discussed the coronavirus and Olympic preparations in a phone call on Friday morning, but did not raise the issue of cancelation or postponement, according to a Japanese government account of the call. Trump later appeared more upbeat about the Olympics\u2019 prospects, tweeting that he had told Abe \u201cthat the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!\u201d Despite the massive disruption the outbreak has caused to sporting competitions around the world, Japanese officials have spent several days trying to quash speculation that the Games could become the sports world\u2019s biggest victim of the virus. Preparations for the Olympic Games continued on Thursday, although on a much smaller scale than usual, due to the coronavirus outbreak. The traditional lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece, was held without spectators present, and with only a small number of delegations, officials and journalists in attendance. After the Greek actress, Xanthi Georgiou, ignited the flame using the sun\u2019s rays and a parabolic mirror at the Temple of Hera, the head of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, said the Games\u2019 organisers were committed to the \u201csuccess\u201d of the games, despite \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d. Bach added: \u201cWe\u2019re strengthened in this commitment by the many authorities and sports organisations around the world who are taking so many significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s opposition leader Simon Bridges has tweeted his approval of the announcement by Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison in the last hour that from Monday all non-essential mass gatherings will be banned. He has urged his country\u2019s government, led by Jacinda Ardern, to do the same. New Zealand has five confirmed cases of Covid-19 and two probable cases. The country has not had any new cases in five days. Singapore will deny from Monday entry or transit to visitors who have been in Italy, France, Spain or Germany in the last 14 days, as part of measures to control the fast-spreading coronavirus, the health ministry said on Friday. The southeast Asian travel hub, which also advised against non-essential travel to the four countries, will immediately halt docking by cruise ships, it added. Singapore has a similar ban in place for travellers from Iran, South Korea and China, where the virus first surfaced late last year. RNZ reports a further two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in French Polynesia, a day after the territory announced its first confirmed case, which was the first confirmed case in the Pacific Islands. President Edouard Fritch announced yesterday that French Polynesian politician Maina Sage had been confirmed with the virus after returning from Paris on 7 March. Sage was resting at home in self-isolation in Tahiti. She is French Polynesia\u2019s representative in the French National Assembly (French Polynesia being an overseas French collectivity). During her time in Paris, Sage served on a National Assembly commission with France\u2019s culture minister Franck Riester, who has also been confined in France after contracting Covid-19. Today, RNZ reports that two more cases have been confirmed \u2013 one of whom was a person close to Sage and the other was a Swiss tourist who fell ill on the atoll of Fakarava. He has been flown to Tahiti. There has been widespread fear across the Pacific region about the coronavirus outbreak. An epidemic of measles across the Pacific last year highlighted the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, adding to existing burdens on public health systems from non-communicable diseases. Here\u2019s our report from yesterday: In short, the position of Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison is, as he has just said: \u201cPeople can go about their normal essential business they do each day.\u201d They should however avoid gatherings over 500 people \u2013 excluding schools and university lectures \u2013 from Monday, and reconsider non-essential travel. Morrison also says Parliament will continue as normal. Australia\u2019s New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian says, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to go to school. When it\u2019s not, we will shut down that particular school and work with the school community to reopen at the appropriate time.\u201d Australian PM Scott Morrison is asked: So you are willingly going to a game this weekend which from Monday - a mass gathering, which you recommend people don\u2019t attend. How is that responsible? I think you misunderstand the point of what we\u2019re doing on Monday. These are stepped responses. We are not of great concern right now in terms of where those gatherings might be today, but in the weeks ahead, this will change. This is a matter of scaling our response. The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks, it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says, \u201cI do have still plans to go to the football on Saturday. This is an arrangement we are putting in place for next week as a precaution. This is an early-stage action that we are undertaking to make sure we get ahead of this. I would be going on on Saturday because I had previously planned to, and these are measures we are putting on from next week, and there are further measures that will come in over time, I would expect.\u201d Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison said that by advising against mass gatherings he was acting on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principals Committee. That committee will also be the principal advisory body to the new national cabinet. The cabinet will be made up of COAG members \u2014 premiers and chief ministers. They will also establish a national coordinating mechanism to ensure the response is consistent across jurisdictions. The members of that cabinet is who you see before you here today, and we will be working very closely together to ensure there is a consistency of response, that there is a coordination of response. We simply say to the Australian people that we will manage this carefully in your interests. What we are announcing today is just another step. It is precautionary. It is getting ahead of this to ensure that we can minimise the impact on your health and we can ensure with confidence the ability for people to be accessing the health services that they and their families will need. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now. \u201cWe are not suggesting people should interrupt their normal daily work. It\u2019s just avoiding those particular circumstances where transmission can be accelerated,\u201d he says. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the government now advises Australians to reconsider non-essential travel. I also want to say that we have also decided through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that we know advise all Australians to reconsider your need to travel overseas at this time, regardless of your destination, age or health - if your travel is not essential, consider carefully whether now is the right time. It is \u201cLevel-Three\u201d travel advice he says. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison says the government will be advising against \u201cnonessential, organised gatherings of persons of 500 or more.\u201d \u201cThat of course does not include schools. It does not include university lectures. It does not mean people getting on public transport or going to airports or things of that nature.\u201d In Australia now, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is speaking at a COAG meeting: The goal here is very straightforward -that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been going about it in a very careful way. There\u2019s been an abundance of caution in our approach - it is simply to slow the rate of transmission of the coronavirus within Australia. That is done through the containment mechanisms that have been already put in place, in New South Wales, Victoria or anywhere else. The containment processes of self-isolation, identifying and tracing of contacts, all of these measures worked to successfully slow the rate of transmission of this virus. The government will be moving to a position from Monday where they advise against mass public gatherings of 500 people or more. But this does NOT include schools and universities, says Morrison. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now from a Council of Australian Governments meeting after it was reported that the government has been advised mass gatherings should be cancelled. Government leaders met in Parramatta on Friday for the COAG meeting, where chief health officers told them urgent social distancing measures were necessary to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Morrison says: In the course of today a number of things became very clear based on the advice received from the Australian Health Protection Principals Committee, which is is the health officers, Chief Medical Officers of each state and territory and the officer from the Commonwealth. There was growing evidence, as we were receiving, particularly over the course of the day, of greater community transmission of the coronavirus throughout Australia. There was has also been as a result of the, what occurred in the United States and across Europe, the disruption of some international supply chain - matters that deal with some medical equipment which we now will be addressing over the course of the next few days. These issues are not constrained toAustralia. They are impacting around the world and they are matters that now need to be addressed here in Australia, like they are in many other countries. As a result of the advice which was pulled together today by the professionals, what we resolved is to form a National Cabinet to deal with the [coronavirus spread throughout Australia] The Australian market has come roaring back in afternoon trade to be less than 2% down for the day. It\u2019s not entirely clear what\u2019s caused the dramatic turnaround, but the most likely answer is that the Reserve Bank has pumped $8.2bn into short-term bank funding this morning. The AFR reports that the funding package was designed to head off a looming credit squeeze caused by market panic over the coronavirus crisis and US president Donald Trump\u2019s cack-handed response to it. Benchmark index the ASX200 fell as much as 8% on Friday but by 3pm was surging upwards to be just 1.78% below Thursday\u2019s closing price. South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since the country\u2019s first patient was confirmed on 20 January, raising hopes that Asia\u2019s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said 110 new cases had been confirmed on Thursday - compared to 114 a day earlier - taking the total to 7,979. But 177 fully recovered patients were released the same day, it added. Officials said the number of new infections in Daegu, the southern city at the centre of the outbreak, and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang had declined \u201cdramatically\u201d, but there were concerns over a spike in cases at a call centre in Seoul, where 102 people have tested positive, and a government office in the administrative capital Sejong. Daegu and North Gyeongsang account for about 90% of cases in South Korea, with 60% of infections linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive religious sect with 210,000 followers. Despite the encouraging news, the country\u2019s prime minister, Chung-Sye-kyun, who is leading efforts to contain the outbreak in Daegu, warned against complacency. \u201cThe battle against the coronavirus has now become a global fight going far beyond Daegu,\u201d he said. The 110 cases detected Thursday, and reported by the KCDC on Friday, was the lowest number of daily infections in more than two weeks, and well below the 500-600 daily increases reported early this month. One death was confirmed on Thursday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 67. Sixty-one of the latest cases were from Daegu, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has just tweeted about his wife Sophie\u2019s confirmed case of Covid-19: Here is the official (2015) guidance video from the World Health Organization on how to wash those hands of yours. The WHO says: \u201cHand hygiene, either with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rub, is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading infections to others. Indeed, hand hygiene is an easy, inexpensive, and effective mean to prevent the spread of germs and keep everyone healthy.\u201d More official WHO tips here. The last of Apple\u2019s 42 stores in China reopened Friday, as the country slowly goes back to work following weeks of quarantine that forced the closure of businesses, AFP reports. The firm announced on February 1 that it would shut all its stores, corporate offices and contact centres across the mainland as the epidemic rapidly spread. Apple\u2019s stores have gradually been reopening over the past few days and a spokeswoman for the company told AFP the remaining few would throw their doors open Friday. The company\u2019s website shows its stores now have \u201cspecial operating hours\u201d. As we report the latest coronavirus news today, please send me any tips or relevant news on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is due to speak speak shortly, following reports that the government has been advised mass gatherings should be cancelled. We\u2019re also hoping for an update on the economy, following a 6% drop on the ASX200. The Guardian is tracking global infections below: Australia\u2019s Central Coast has confirmed its first coronavirus case, the ABC reports: In Australia, Queensland state health says there are now 35 cases in the state, as of Friday 13 March. The statement does not say how many cases are new but out understanding is that this means there are eight new cases, up from 27 yesterday. The statement says: Currently, all cases are in South-East Queensland, excluding one individual in Kingaroy and one individual in Rockhampton. Contact tracing is underway for all new cases, in addition to the previously confirmed cases. We will notify the community if any other public health alerts are required. Queensland Health is urging anyone who has been overseas in the last 14 days and has a fever or any respiratory symptoms to see a doctor immediately. In Australia, expert health advice reportedly given to the prime minister and state premiers says all gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled immediately to halt the spread of coronavirus. Government leaders met in Parramatta on Friday for a Council of Australian Governments meeting, where chief health officers told them urgent social distancing measures were necessary to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The advice is unconfirmed, but, if correct, would appear to mandate the closure of schools and universities, as well as sporting events and concerts. The Guardian has contacted government authorities seeking their response. As the Catholic and Mormon churches close services over coronavirus fears, a Catholic church in Hong Kong has started streaming its mass to worshipers online. Similar arrangements have been made in Singapore and elsewhere at various churches, temples and mosques. With an iPad on a small tripod, Father Thomas Law of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in downtown Hong Kong is broadcasting mass to worshippers to their homes via online streaming as a way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The church was formerly packed during daily morning mass and on Sundays, but the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong has suspended mass and liturgies since Feb. 15 in line with government health guidelines promoting social distancing. Many churches in Hong Kong have taken their services online due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Chinese-ruled city, which has reported 130 cases and three deaths. These are the most recent figures from China, where we are expecting detail soon on new infections and the number of infections that are from Wuhan, specifically. Mainland China reported eight new cases of the virus on March 12, continuing a decline after 15 new cases on March 11th. There were seven new deaths. In the US, Barack Obama has tweeted about the coronavirus: US president Donald Trump also took to Twitter to share a helpful update: Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, is preparing for a lockdown that will be imposed from Sunday in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. All schools will be closed, mass gatherings suspended, and many public sector workers told to stay home, following a spike in cases in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte has also imposed a ban on domestic land and sea travels to and from Manila, which will begin on 15 March and last 30 days. The number of cases in the country has risen from 10 on Sunday to 52 by Thursday evening, and there is concern about the virus spreading rapidly through cramped slum areas. Metro Manila, also known as the National Capital Region, includes 16 cities, including Manila. On Thursday, Duterte was tested for the virus, though he has not experienced symptoms. Five people in the country have now died after becoming infected. Here is what we know so far about Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis and the implications for Chelsea and the Premier League. Chelsea\u2019s full squad have gone into self-isolation after winger Hudson-Odoi tested positive to the coronavirus, the club said in a statement. Hudson-Odoi displayed cold symptoms on Monday morning and has stayed away from the club since then. His test result was returned on Thursday night. The club said despite testing positive, the 19-year-old was \u201cdoing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible\u201d. The Blues have also closed two buildings at their training facility. PA media reports Chelsea are scheduled to play at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon but the match looks unlikely to proceed. The remainder of the Premier League season, in fact, is in doubt with the League to hold a meeting on Friday to determine a course of action in response to the coronavirus. Tom Hanks has tweeted a photograph of himself and Rita Wilson, after the pair confirmed yesterday that they had tested positive for coronavirus. In the image Hanks writes: \u201cHello folks. Rita Wilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us. We have Covid-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one day at a time... Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball. Hanx.\u201d The baseball line is from his 1992 film A League of Their Own: More on Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau\u2019s positive coronavirus diagnosis now from the Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco. The wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has tested positive for Covid-19 following a trip to the United Kingdom. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau announced Thursday evening that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and plans to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms have been described as mild. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBeing in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.\u201d The prime minister remains \u201cin good health with no symptoms\u201d according to his office, but will work in remotely for the next two weeks. He plans to address Canadians on Friday. Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi has tested positive for coronavirus, the club reports. We understand that Hudson-Odoi is first Premier League player to be infected. The club wrote on its website: Chelsea men\u2019s team player Callum Hudson-Odoi had a positive test result for Coronavirus returned this evening. Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men\u2019s team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. These will include initially the full men\u2019s team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff. It is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men\u2019s team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal. While most major sporting events have been canceled, mushers in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race are continuing their 1,000-mile march west across Alaska, AP reports. Officials with the world\u2019s most famous sled dog race announced Thursday they have postponed post-race events in response to the new coronavirus. The Iditarod has postponed both the awards banquet set for 22 March and the meet the mushers event set for 21 March, both in Nome, where the winner is expected some time next week. Gabon and Ghana confirmed their first cases of coronavirus on Thursday, becoming the ninth and tenth countries in sub-Saharan Africa to register positive cases. The region has so far been less badly hit by coronavirus than Europe or China. Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, Togo, South Africa, Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of Congo have also registered cases. In a statement, Gabon\u2019s government said its case was a 27-year-old Gabonese man who had returned from France on 8 March. Ghana\u2019s health ministry said its two cases were people who had returned recently from Norway and Turkey. \u201cThese are imported cases of Covid-19. Both patients are currently being kept in isolation and are stable,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Sub-Saharan Africa did not confirm its first coronavirus infection until Feb. 28 in Nigeria, but experts warn that rising cases could test already fragile health systems. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife Sophie has tested positive for coronavirus, AP reports. This story is breaking. We will have further details soon. We reported earlier that Prime Minister Trudeau was self-isolating after his wife returned from a visit to the UK with flu-like symptoms, including a fever. South Korea reported 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the country\u2019s total infections to 7,979, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The latest numbers are in line with a downward trend in new cases, slightly down from the 114 recorded on Thursday. Theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort will be closing through the end of the month, starting at the close of business Sunday, the Walt Disney Company announced. The company said in a statement Thursday that the decision was made \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d to protect guests and employees amid the global outbreak of the new coronavirus. The decision came hours after the announcement of the planned closure of Disneyland in California, AP reports. Additionally, Disney Cruise Line will suspend all new departures beginning Saturday and continuing through the end of the month, the statement said. The Walt Disney Company will pay its cast members during that closure period, according to the release. The hotels at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris will remain open, along with the shops and restaurants at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World and Disney Village at Disneyland Paris, according to the news release. How Taiwan is containing coronavirus \u2013 despite diplomatic isolation by China Using phone tracking to enforce mandatory quarantine is one example of how Taiwan has managed to contain the spread of coronavirus, with just 48 confirmed cases of infection to date, including one death, reports Michelle Yun from Taipei. That\u2019s despite the island located just 130km (80 miles) from mainland China, the centre of the virus outbreak which has reported more than 80,000 cases and 3,000 deaths. A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, according to a note sent to UN missions, making the woman the first known case at the world body\u2019s New York headquarters. \u201cAs of today, the Philippine Mission is in lockdown, and all personnel are instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms. We are assuming that all of us have been infected,\u201d wrote Philippines acting UN Ambassador Kira Azucena in a message seen by Reuters. According the online UN directory of diplomatic staff, there are about 12 diplomats at the Filipino mission, which is on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The sick diplomat represented the Philippines in the UN General Assembly\u2019s legal affairs committees. Azucena said the diplomat was last at UN headquarters on Monday for about half an hour when she was asymptomatic. She came down with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday and visited her doctor. \u201cShe got the call today that she tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d Azucena wrote on Thursday. The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case. The 193-member world body began implementing coronavirus prevention measures at its Manhattan headquarters this week. A two-week conference on women\u2019s rights was cut to one day, several other planned large conferences canceled, most smaller meetings cut, UN missions asked to limit the number of diplomats they send to meetings, and at least half the several thousand UN staff who normally work in the building will be working from home by next week. From Hong Kong, we have an update on the pet Pomeranian which tested positive for Covid-19 last week: blood tests have returned a negative result. The dog was taken into quarantine after its owner was diagnosed with the illness. Successive tests on samples taken from its nose and mouth showed a \u201cweak positive\u201d result in the dog, leading health experts to declare it was likely a case of human-to-animal transmission. Other epidemiologists were more circumspect, and said blood tests were needed first, to see if it had any virus antibodies in its system. Blood tests taken on 3 March returned yesterday showed there was no measurable antibodies in the dog. But authorities maintained the dog was infected. \u201cThe negative serological test result does not suggest that the dog is not infected with the virus,\u201d the Hong Kong government said. \u201cIt is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop. It is also not uncommon to have a negative result in the earlier stages of infection as it often takes 14 days or more for measurable levels of antibodies to be detected. \u201c Gene sequencing of the virus detected on the dog and in its owner showed them to be very similar, suggesting the virus did likely spread from the person to the animal. \u201cThere currently is no evidence that pet animals can be a source of infection of Covid-19,\u201d the department added.\u201d \u201cPet owners should not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets.\u201d Asian markets opened in freefall on Friday, extending a global rout that saw bourses experience their worst day in decades on fears of a recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tokyo\u2019s benchmark Nikkei index nosedived more than seven percent shortly after the open, with markets around the region plummeting after a historically bad trading day in the US and Europe. The Nikkei average extended its fall and is currently down 10%. New Zealand\u2019s benchmark NZX 50 slumped 7.9 percent. Trading was briefly halted on South Korea\u2019s stock exchange when the benchmark KOSPI index fell 6.8 percent. The falls came after dramatic scenes on other global markets, with the Dow losing 10 percent, or around 2,350 points, to 21,200.62, in its worst session since 1987. London also had its worst day since the 1987 crash and Frankfurt its blackest day since 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Paris suffered its worst one-day loss ever. Analysts said President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a ban on travel to the US from Europe deeply rattled investors, and measures intended to shore up business and markets were proving insufficient, AFP reports. In Australia, travel agency Flight Centre will close 100 stores. AAP reports that Flight Centre has also scrapped its earnings guidance due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company said on Friday that the stores will close before June 30, and sales staff will transfer to other stores, as part of moves to slash costs. Flight Centre shares were down by 17 per cent at $16.26 by 1148 AEDT and have lost 60 per cent of their value since February 20 amid a wider market sell-off. Australian stock market dives more than 7% again The Australian market has dived more than 7% for the second day in a row as coronavirus panic grips traders. At 12.20pm the benchmark ASX200 index was down 7.5%. Trading remains volatile but so far today the market is plumbing depths not seen since early 2016, wiping out almost three years of gains. The Vatican on Thursday closed all Catholic churches across Rome to stem the spread of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1,000 people across Italy, AFP reports. The papal vicar for Rome said the churches would reopen when a broader Italian government crackdown on public gatherings expires on April 3. \u201cThe faithful are consequently exempt from their obligation to fulfil the festive precept,\u201d a statement from Cardinal Angelo De Donatis said. The Vatican had spent days resisting having to take the drastic measure of shuttering places of worship in the overwhelmingly Catholic country. It closed its museums and even the Saint Paul Basilica - parts of its soaring dome designed by Michelangelo - to tourists as the death toll continued to mount. The Vatican also banned mass across the country and called off all weddings and funerals. But the churches themselves stayed open as long as the faithful followed government regulations and remained a metre (three feet) apart while inside. It was not immediately clear when Rome\u2019s churches had last been forced to close en masse. The Nazis and Italian Fascists kept Pope Pius XII confined to the Vatican during World War II. But at least some Rome churches kept their doors open during the war. In an address to the nation on Thursday night, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro has called for nationwide demonstrations in support of his far-right government that have been widely seen as anti-Congress to be postponed because of the coronavirus crisis - which has already infected his press secretary. Brazil has 77 confirmed cases. \u201cThe spontaneous and legitimate movements scheduled for March 15 attend the nation\u2019s interest,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cHowever faced with recent facts they need to be rethought. Our health and our families must be preserved. The moment is unity, serenity and good sense.\u201d Earlier, Bolsonaro suggested postponing the events during a Facebook Live with his health minster Luiz Henrique Mandetta, during which both wore masks. Organisers have decided to cancel the events, local media reported. In New Zealand, Auckland mayor Phil Goff has cancelled the Pasifika festival this weekend due to coronavirus. Auckland is New Zealand\u2019s largest city, home to more than one million people. Goff said at least 40,000 people were expected to attend the festival from all around the Pacific region and the risk of spreading the virus to the Islands was too high. Last year the annual festival was also cancelled as the security threat was raised, coming just days after the March 15 Christchurch terror attacks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to make further announcements on travel restrictions today, after taking advice overnight. New Zealand has five confirmed cases of the virus, and more than 9000 people at home in self-isolation. A number of New Zealand politicians including finance minister Grant Robertson and speaker Trevor Mallard have cancelled upcoming overseas trips due to the virus, saying they will conduct their meetings via skype instead. The number of coronavirus infections globally now stands at 128,343, according to Johns Hopkins University. The virus has claimed the lives of 4,720 people since virus was first detected in China. Now for the latest from China, where a senior Chinese medical adviser said on Thursday that the global coronavirus pandemic could be over by June if countries mobilise to fight it. China declared the peak had passed there as new cases in Hubei fell to single digits for the first time on Thursday. \u201cBroadly speaking, the peak of the epidemic has passed for China,\u201d said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission. \u201cThe increase of new cases is falling.\u201d Zhong Nanshan, the government\u2019s senior medical adviser, told reporters that as long as countries take the outbreak seriously and are prepared to take firm measures, it could be over worldwide in a matter of months. \u201cMy advice is calling for all countries to follow WHO instructions and intervene on a national scale,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all countries could get mobilised, it could be over by June.\u201d Speaking to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President Xi Jinping similarly expressed confidence, state television reported. \u201cMy estimate of June is based on scenarios that all countries take positive measures.\u201d The Fijian Broadcasting Corporation is reporting that production on Survivor\u2019s 41st season has been postponed over coronavirus concerns. Production of the show, which will be filmed in Fiji, has been postponed to mid-May. This is your friendly reminder to wash your hands often and thoroughly. If you\u2019re looking for a new song to take you through the motions, here is Gloria Gaynor with a hand-washing rendition of I Will Survive: Virgin Australia is also reducing its international and domestic routes in response to lowered demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Virgin Australia has confirmed that a cabin crew member has tested positive for coronavirus. The airline company is not confirming the flight or route today. Earlier today, American Airlines announced that a pilot had tested positive. American Airlines Group Inc said on Thursday a pilot based out of Dallas-Fort Worth tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cAmerican\u2019s Chief Medical Officer and leaders from our pilots\u2019 office have been in touch with the pilot,\u201d the company said in a statement. Argentina is going into virtual shutdown with the announced suspension of the arrival of all flights from the US, EU, UK, China, South Korea, Japan and Iran for the next 30 days. The measure goes into force starting tomorrow Friday. It\u2019s not clear yet what will happen with flights already on their way to Argentina today arriving Friday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Argentina jumped Thursday from 21 to 31, authorities announced. For the first time three of these cases were locally contracted, as opposed to all the cases until now, which involved persons arriving from abroad, mostly from Italy. There has been one death so far, a 64-year-old man arriving from France. Argentina is also cancelling all concerts and sports events, among them Argentina\u2019s Lollapalooza where Gun\u2019s N Roses, Travis Scott, The Strokes, Gwen Stefani and Lana del Rey were scheduled to perform. Sports matches will be permitted as long as they are played without public present The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is suspending all of its worship services globally because of the spread of the new coronavirus. The decision was made hours after Utah\u2019s governor recommended limiting group gatherings in the state to no more than 100 people for at least two weeks. The Utah-based faith sent a letter Thursday to members informing them of a decision that also calls on a temporary suspension of all church activities until further notice. The move comes a day after the faith announced it would hold a major conference in early April without attendees. It is first time since a 1957 flu epidemic that the religion has taken the step of barring church members from attending in person. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is temporarily halting his trademark rallies as his campaign bows to the coronavirus outbreak that is rapidly reshaping the nation\u2019s political landscape. The rallies have long been Trump\u2019s most potent political weapon: They energize the candidate, give him a powerful platform from which to attack his adversaries and allow his team to collect a treasure trove of voter data. The two leading Democratic contenders, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, canceled their scheduled rallies earlier this week. New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman has just reported that US President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign staff have been told to work remotely while a \u201cdeep cleaning and sanitation\u201d of campaign offices takes place. While you are securing your home for a period of social distancing or home isolation behind a wall of toilet paper, spare a thought for those who do not have the option of a safe place to hibernate. Australian homeless advocacy organisations have called for more temporary housing to be made available in preparation for widespread community transmission of Covid-19. Here\u2019s Kate Colvin, from Victoria\u2019s Council to Homeless Person\u2019s: People with pre-existing health conditions and the elderly who contract Covid-19 are particularly vulnerable to experiencing severe symptoms. People who are experiencing homelessness are more likely to have poor health due to exposure to extreme heat and cold and living in substandard accommodation, which is poorly ventilated or damp. Having limited finances also makes it hard for people to access healthcare and medication to manage chronic underlying illnesses. Read Jack Banister\u2019s full report on this issue: As we report the latest coronavirus news today, please send me any tips, relevant news or well wishes for Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, who confirmed on Thursday that they have tested positive for Covid-19, on Twitter @helenrsullivan. My DMs are open. Here is New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio speaking earlier about the decision to declare a state of emergency in the city. Princess Cruises, the operator of two ocean liners that were quarantined after they became hotbeds for coronavirus infections, said on Thursday it would suspend voyages of all its 18 ships for two months. The suspension upends an industry already struggling with cancellations following the outbreak, and comes after Finland\u2019s Viking Line temporarily paused operations of its river ships and ocean liners around the world, Reuters reports. \u201cNever ... in the 20 years I have served in this company, have we been tested in ways we have been tested over the past 40 days,\u201d Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, said on the operator\u2019s official YouTube channel, addressing the decision to suspend operations. \u201cThis is perhaps the most difficult decision in our history.\u201d Shares of parent Carnival Corp, which have already lost over half their value since the start of the year, tumbled a further 18%. Rivals Royal Caribbean Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were also down. The Australian market tumbled almost 7% on opening, setting it up for a second day running of heavy losses due to the coronavirus crisis. Blue chip stocks tumbled as they began trading shortly after 10am, with shares in big miners BHP and Rio, both of which fell overnight in London, where they are also listed, tumbling 6.8% and 4.55% respectively. Australia\u2019s biggest bank, CBA, fell 4.33% while rival ANZ was down 7.17% and NAB, which cancelled a capital raising last night due to the volatile market, plunged 8.11%. The Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled after a member of the McLaren team tested positive for coronavirus. Here is everything we know so far: Confusion engulfed the season-opening Australian Grand Prix hours before the cars were due on track before the race was eventually cancelled amid fears over the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cFollowing the confirmation that a member of the McLaren Racing Team has tested positive for Covid-19 and the team\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Australian Grand Prix, the FIA and Formula 1 convened a meeting of the other nine team principals on Thursday evening,\u201d a joint statement from FIA, Formula 1 and the Australian Grand Prix Corporation read. \u201cThose discussions concluded with a majority view of the teams that the race should not go ahead. The FIA and Formula 1, with the full support of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation (AGPC) have therefore taken the decision that all Formula 1 activity for the Australian Grand Prix is cancelled.\u201d On Thursday night, McLaren withdrew after one of its team members returned a positive test for Covid-19, casting a huge shadow over the viability of the weekend\u2019s racing at Albert Park. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio declared a state of emergency Thursday in the city, saying he anticipated that New York could see as many as 1,000 cases next week. He said that the emergency order allows for the city to take certain actions, but that none of them had been activated, including closing down public transportation, AP reports. New York City officials moved swiftly Thursday to address a false text message spreading on social media claiming that the police department was planning to put containment actions in place this weekend to address the spread of the coronavirus, including a shutdown of Metro-North rail lines and limited subway service. De Blasio called the claims \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201coff base\u201d during an afternoon news conference discussing the decision to declare the state of emergency. He speculated the information leaked from scenario planning and said it was not from plans being put in place. De Blasio said a total shutdown would be unrealistic for a variety of reasons, including that it would make it impossible for people like health care workers to get around. Later he tweeted, \u201cNO, there is NO TRUTH to rumors about Manhattan being quarantined. Whoever is spreading this misinformation, PLEASE STOP NOW!\u201d The New York Police Department responded to the message tweeting from NYPD News: Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Aaron Donovan confirmed to The Associated Press that there were no plans to suspend railroad service. The state of New York has reported more than 320 cases of the virus, 95 of them in New York City. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday that New York would ban all gatherings with 500 or more people to battle the coronavirus. The cancellations Thursday rolled in like clockwork as act after act announced changes to their touring schedules. Among them were the Who, Cher, Blake Shelton, Dan + Shay and Billie Eilish, who was set to play New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Broadway theatres announced that they would close immediately and remain dark through April 12. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus live blog. The effect of the virus on major sporting events continues today, as Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta tests positive for Covid-19 and the Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. Markets are expected to suffer further blows after a disastrous day on Thursday. The Australian market fell almost 7% on opening, setting it up for a second day running of heavy losses due to the coronavirus crisis. The Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. A member of the McLaren Racing Team has tested positive for Covid-19. Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement the club said Arsenal employees who have had recent close contact with Arteta will now self isolate. 121 people at Italy\u2019s Juventus F.C. are self isolating after footballer Daniele Rugani tested positive for the virus. There is heightened concern at the White House after a picture emerged of a top Brazilian government aide, who has tested positive for coronavirus, standing right next to Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. French President Emmanuel Macron described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201cthe most serious health crisis France had faced in a century\u201d. This was the first time he has addressed the French on the outbreak. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said that many families \u201care going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, as he indicated a shift in the government\u2019s approach to coronavirus from \u201ccontain\u201d to \u201cdelay\u201d. The EU condemned Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral ban on travel from 26 European countries. The presidents of the European commission and European council defended Europe\u2019s record in managing the pandemic and sharply criticised the White House for its failure to consult its allies. President Trump\u2019s handling of the virus outbreak was also criticised by top federal health official Dr Anthony Fauci who described the US\u2019s lacklustre approach to coronavirus testing \u201ca failing\u201d. Markets continued to plummet today as the US and UK stock exchanges suffered their worst performance since Black Monday in 2008. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares suffered its second worst day ever. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau revealed he is self-isolating after his wife returned from a visit to the UK with flu-like symptoms, including a fever.

      "body": "<p>As Ronald and Eva Weissberger boarded the cruise ship bound for Hawaii, the couple were looking forward to the trip of a lifetime.</p> <p>The Weissbergers, the 74- and 69-year-olds from Florida, had heard stories about the boat\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and ultimately resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">more than 700 </a>confirmed cases of coronavirus. But to them, the Diamond Princess \u201cseemed like a world away\u201d, says the couple\u2019s son-in-law, Jason Chalik.</p> <p>Little did they know, what would start as a 15-night cruise through paradise would turn into a waking nightmare for the 3,500 people on board.</p> <p>As passengers headed up the gangway to the Grand Princess and toward their rooms on 21 February they had no idea that a 75-year-old man from Placer county, California \u2013 who\u2019d stepped off the boat in San Francisco \u2013 was carrying Covid-19, the novel coronavirus that, by Friday afternoon, had infected more than 2,000 Americans and killed more than 40.</p> <p>The cruise ship they boarded has since become the center of a dramatic US crisis that has forced national and state governments to take measures that seemed unimaginable even a week ago. It has also become a potent symbol for everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">America\u2019s woeful lack of test kits</a>, which had to be flown in by helicopter, to the racial politics of who will shoulder the burden of the outbreak.</p> <p>Between the boat\u2019s departure and its return, the nation\u2019s handling of the virus would shift entirely. The World Health Organization declared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">outbreak a pandemic</a>. Markets tumbled. Schools and theme parks shuttered and professional sports halted. And Donald Trump would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">suspend most travel</a> from the European Union, setting off chaos at airports as confused travelers looked for a way home.</p> <p>Health officials expect the number of US cases to multiply exponentially as the government, <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/unprepared\">caught flat-footed</a> by the outbreak, makes tests more readily available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fce3165999ea9ee818df7b01394a97664d6565d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fce3165999ea9ee818df7b01394a97664d6565d3/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Schwartz Dever and Harry Dever, of Moorsetown, New Jersey, were on board the Grand Princess cruise ship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Schwartz Dever and Harry Dever, of Moorsetown, New Jersey, were on board the Grand Princess cruise ship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Miller/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The outbreak begins</h2> <p>The Grand Princess was thrust into the national spotlight after California reported its first death from coronavirus \u2013 an elderly man in northern California\u2019s Placer county, who had been on the ship\u2019s previous voyage to Mexico.</p> <p>The exact point at which he contracted the virus is disputed.</p> <p>Princess Cruises, which operates the Grand Princess and the Diamond Princess, claimed he was infected at some point during the Grand Princess\u2019s trip to Mexico and said he complained of symptoms while still on board.</p> <p>Public health officials in California disagree. More likely, they said, he was already infected when he stepped aboard the ship, indicating the new coronavirus had been spreading onshore for longer than anyone knew.</p> <p>Genetic researchers <a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/national/scientist-links-state-outbreaks-with-genetic-fingerprints/article_796b09fb-2241-50e0-84e5-5712d7081d34.html\">this week</a> traced the virus that infected passengers on the Grand Princess to the same family tree of infections that spread through a cluster of patients in Washington state and likely originated from a patient who had traveled to Wuhan, China. The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship.</p> <p>What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus.</p> <p>About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers.</p> <p>Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea.</p> <p>The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms.</p> <p>Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates.</p> <p>The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/grand-princess-cruise-coronavirus-lawsuit\">in a lawsuit filed</a> on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We asked, \u2018You\u2019re playing bridge with other passengers? And you\u2019re touching the same cards?\u2019 They had no idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af434c1e1c3b414e838f989b22b3b1d59b7d1865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af434c1e1c3b414e838f989b22b3b1d59b7d1865/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Princess cruise ship carrying passengers who have tested positive for coronavirus in the San Francisco Bay area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Princess cruise ship carrying passengers who have tested positive for coronavirus in the San Francisco Bay area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Greaves/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Things get worse</h2> <p>Later that day Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/\">a state of emergency</a> and, citing those on board who had shown symptoms said the Grand Princess, would head back to California early for testing.</p> <p>The toughest moment for Michelle Heckert, a Bay Area woman traveling with her grandparents, came when she learned all passengers would need to stay in their rooms until further notice.</p> <p>\u201cI called my mom in tears, like \u2018I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t stay in this room the whole time.\u2019 I was just really scared about the uncertainty of it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared for myself. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m young. I figured if I got it I would be able to recover. But I was scared for my grandparents, and I felt a lot of pressure to protect them from it.\u201d</p> <p>The ship was delayed off the coast of San Francisco while officials hatched a plan. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMUJ4BkiRvw\">dramatic scene</a>, US coast guard helicopters dropped tests onto the Grand Princess. Of the 45 tested,<strong> </strong>19 crew members and 2 passengers<strong> </strong>would test positive for the virus and about 100 passengers showed symptoms.</p> <p>Crew members, many who shared space for accommodations and meals, would deliver meals to rooms individually \u2014 which health experts said was one of the factors why the quarantine of passengers within a cruise ship\u2019s close quarters is ineffective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6886edd5ac377b9b9fd6747b8f560f5719932657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6886edd5ac377b9b9fd6747b8f560f5719932657/0_523_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on board the Grand Princess watch while a US military helicopter delivers coronavirus tests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on board the Grand Princess watch while a US military helicopter delivers coronavirus tests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Berry/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In reference to the Diamond Princess, where passengers also faced prolonged quarantine, Dr Amesh Adalja, with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-coronavirus-quarantines-have-failed-health-law-ethics-experts-2020-2\">told Business Insider</a> that quarantining passengers on a cruise ship allows \u201cthe virus to literally pick them off one-by-one\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the Grand Princess idled offshore, Donald Trump publicly expressed reluctance to bring the ship home.</p> <p>\u201cI like the numbers where they are,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/07/i-like-the-numbers-being-where-they-are-trump-video\">Trump said</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were in shock,\u201d Chalik said of the Weissbergers\u2019 reaction to comments from the president.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say, and here he\u2019s talking about them like they\u2019re just numbers.

Officials said Oakland\u2019s outer harbor put it at safer remove from tourists and densely populated areas.</p> <p>To many in Oakland, a city that\u2019s long lived in its glitzier neighbor\u2019s shadow, reopened old wounds, fanning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/oakland-coronavirus-grand-princess-san-francisco\">longstanding tensions</a> steeped in racial and environmental discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling, particularly among people of color in this city, that things keep happening to us and not for us,\u201d Oakland activist Cat Brooks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/oakland-coronavirus-grand-princess-san-francisco\">told the Guardian.</a> \u201cWhen something like this [cruise ship] happens, that allows for a breeding ground of hysteria and mistrust.\u201d</p> <p>But the news was more than welcome to those on board the Grand Princess. Cars honked, passengers whooped and cheered as the boat passed underneath San Francisco\u2019s iconic Golden Gate bridge.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we were headed toward shore,\u201d said Rex Lawson, 86, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, 81. \u201cEverybody was very happy when we pulled under the bridge, they were out on their balcony, yelling and clapping\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcd9e888e271537ab561a6dac1cab514fa0ad39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcd9e888e271537ab561a6dac1cab514fa0ad39/0_0_2348_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on the Grand Princess wave as the ship approaches Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on the Grand Princess wave as the ship approaches Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst, it seemed, was over. But still to overcome was was the colossal task of moving thousands of passengers, an untold number of whom had been infected, off the boat and onto buses, where they\u2019d be transported to hospitals, hotels or military bases for 14 days of quarantine.</p> <p>On Monday morning, just before the Grand Princess pulled in, trucks rumbled to and from the docks along the shoreline like any other day. Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers.</p> <p>Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board. Officials said they\u2019d be there at least through the weekend while their home countries arranged transportation.</p> <p>The boat\u2019s 1,000-plus crew is expected to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-infected-crew-members-kept-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-2020-3\">remain on board </a>under quarantine while officials determine a place to dock for good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Quarantine issues emerge</h2> <p>Prince Cruises declined to be interviewed for this story, saying that currently \u201call team members are focused on the situation at hand and the well-being of our guests\u201d.</p> <p>But complaints quickly started mounting from passengers concerned that recommended <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html\">quarantine protocols</a> weren\u2019t being followed.

There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said.</p> <p>On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not testing us. On the ship they gave us a paper that said we would be tested. When we got here (three days ago), they took our temperatures instead,\u201d Morse said.</p> <p>Heckert, also quarantined at Travis air force base, said on Thursday that her family hadn\u2019t been tested, either.</p> <p>Congressman John Garamendi on Thursday filed a complaint with the federal department of Health and Human Services on Morse\u2019s behalf. It was only then, Morse said, that staff began delivering food to passenger\u2019s rooms instead of having them line up to grab plastic boxes from tall stacks.</p> <p>\u201cWe were better off on the ship,\u201d Morse said, adding that cruise ship staff left food outside their door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c/0_0_3836_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eric Olsen, a spokesman for Rep Garamendi, said the congressman sent pictures of the food distribution problems to HHS, which is running the quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to health guidelines, you\u2019re supposed to be separating people in their rooms,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIf someone is Covid-19 positive, this (mingling) is going to spread the disease. These people are supposed to be getting ready to be released to the public.\u201d</p> <p>As spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: \u201cOur number one priority was to screen passengers for symptoms, address any underlining health conditions, make sure they had access to their prescription medication, and get them settled into their rooms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis unprecedented response has raised many significant logistical challenges. We have assigned case managers to each of the guests to individually address their needs. We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can to passengers.\u201d </p> <p>For 86-year-old Rex Lawson, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, the experience hasn\u2019t soured his travel plans forever. His children told him he\u2019s never going on another cruise, but he said it\u2019s hard pass up the free trip Princess Cruises has offered him and his wife.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t say never,\u201d Lawson said.</p> <p>But he might be out a partner. He asked his wife if they might use the free ticket in the future. She\u2019d told him that next time, he\u2019d have to go by himself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Erin McCormick and Vivian Ho contributed reporting</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "As Ronald and Eva Weissberger boarded the cruise ship bound for Hawaii, the couple were looking forward to the trip of a lifetime. The Weissbergers, the 74- and 69-year-olds from Florida, had heard stories about the boat\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and ultimately resulted in more than 700 confirmed cases of coronavirus. But to them, the Diamond Princess \u201cseemed like a world away\u201d, says the couple\u2019s son-in-law, Jason Chalik. Little did they know, what would start as a 15-night cruise through paradise would turn into a waking nightmare for the 3,500 people on board. As passengers headed up the gangway to the Grand Princess and toward their rooms on 21 February they had no idea that a 75-year-old man from Placer county, California \u2013 who\u2019d stepped off the boat in San Francisco \u2013 was carrying Covid-19, the novel coronavirus that, by Friday afternoon, had infected more than 2,000 Americans and killed more than 40. The cruise ship they boarded has since become the center of a dramatic US crisis that has forced national and state governments to take measures that seemed unimaginable even a week ago. It has also become a potent symbol for everything from America\u2019s woeful lack of test kits, which had to be flown in by helicopter, to the racial politics of who will shoulder the burden of the outbreak. Between the boat\u2019s departure and its return, the nation\u2019s handling of the virus would shift entirely. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. Markets tumbled. Schools and theme parks shuttered and professional sports halted. And Donald Trump would suspend most travel from the European Union, setting off chaos at airports as confused travelers looked for a way home. Health officials expect the number of US cases to multiply exponentially as the government, caught flat-footed by the outbreak, makes tests more readily available. The outbreak begins The Grand Princess was thrust into the national spotlight after California reported its first death from coronavirus \u2013 an elderly man in northern California\u2019s Placer county, who had been on the ship\u2019s previous voyage to Mexico. The exact point at which he contracted the virus is disputed. Princess Cruises, which operates the Grand Princess and the Diamond Princess, claimed he was infected at some point during the Grand Princess\u2019s trip to Mexico and said he complained of symptoms while still on board. Public health officials in California disagree. More likely, they said, he was already infected when he stepped aboard the ship, indicating the new coronavirus had been spreading onshore for longer than anyone knew. Genetic researchers this week traced the virus that infected passengers on the Grand Princess to the same family tree of infections that spread through a cluster of patients in Washington state and likely originated from a patient who had traveled to Wuhan, China. The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship. What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus. About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers. Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea. The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms. Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates. The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida. \u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since in a lawsuit filed on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak. \u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We asked, \u2018You\u2019re playing bridge with other passengers? And you\u2019re touching the same cards?\u2019 They had no idea.\u201d Things get worse Later that day Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, announced a state of emergency and, citing those on board who had shown symptoms said the Grand Princess, would head back to California early for testing. The toughest moment for Michelle Heckert, a Bay Area woman traveling with her grandparents, came when she learned all passengers would need to stay in their rooms until further notice. \u201cI called my mom in tears, like \u2018I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t stay in this room the whole time.\u2019 I was just really scared about the uncertainty of it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared for myself. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m young. I figured if I got it I would be able to recover. But I was scared for my grandparents, and I felt a lot of pressure to protect them from it.\u201d The ship was delayed off the coast of San Francisco while officials hatched a plan. In a dramatic scene, US coast guard helicopters dropped tests onto the Grand Princess. Of the 45 tested, 19 crew members and 2 passengers would test positive for the virus and about 100 passengers showed symptoms. Crew members, many who shared space for accommodations and meals, would deliver meals to rooms individually \u2014 which health experts said was one of the factors why the quarantine of passengers within a cruise ship\u2019s close quarters is ineffective. In reference to the Diamond Princess, where passengers also faced prolonged quarantine, Dr Amesh Adalja, with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Business Insider that quarantining passengers on a cruise ship allows \u201cthe virus to literally pick them off one-by-one\u201d. \u201cThe whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, as the Grand Princess idled offshore, Donald Trump publicly expressed reluctance to bring the ship home. \u201cI like the numbers where they are,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d \u201cThey were in shock,\u201d Chalik said of the Weissbergers\u2019 reaction to comments from the president. \u201cThey actually like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say, and here he\u2019s talking about them like they\u2019re just numbers. They\u2019re not numbers, they\u2019re my kids\u2019 grandparents.\u201d Heading for the shore As they waited just off the coast, passengers took to social media to share their quarantine horror stories. One man complained he was going hungry because the ship was rationing food. A family of eight started an Instagram account about the hair-pulling endeavor of trying to occupy six small children for days in a tiny, windowless cabin. Michelle Heckert, who said she did her best to strike a positive tone, playing music with a ukulele and releasing videos on Twitter, tweeted the day\u2019s in-cabin entertainment: an instructional video on how to make paper airplanes. The Grand Princess was finally given the green light to return to shore, but it would dock in Oakland, not San Francisco. Officials said Oakland\u2019s outer harbor put it at safer remove from tourists and densely populated areas. To many in Oakland, a city that\u2019s long lived in its glitzier neighbor\u2019s shadow, reopened old wounds, fanning longstanding tensions steeped in racial and environmental discrimination. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling, particularly among people of color in this city, that things keep happening to us and not for us,\u201d Oakland activist Cat Brooks told the Guardian. \u201cWhen something like this [cruise ship] happens, that allows for a breeding ground of hysteria and mistrust.\u201d But the news was more than welcome to those on board the Grand Princess. Cars honked, passengers whooped and cheered as the boat passed underneath San Francisco\u2019s iconic Golden Gate bridge. \u201cWe knew we were headed toward shore,\u201d said Rex Lawson, 86, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, 81. \u201cEverybody was very happy when we pulled under the bridge, they were out on their balcony, yelling and clapping\u201d. The worst, it seemed, was over. But still to overcome was was the colossal task of moving thousands of passengers, an untold number of whom had been infected, off the boat and onto buses, where they\u2019d be transported to hospitals, hotels or military bases for 14 days of quarantine. On Monday morning, just before the Grand Princess pulled in, trucks rumbled to and from the docks along the shoreline like any other day. Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers. Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board. Officials said they\u2019d be there at least through the weekend while their home countries arranged transportation. The boat\u2019s 1,000-plus crew is expected to remain on board under quarantine while officials determine a place to dock for good. Quarantine issues emerge Prince Cruises declined to be interviewed for this story, saying that currently \u201call team members are focused on the situation at hand and the well-being of our guests\u201d. But complaints quickly started mounting from passengers concerned that recommended quarantine protocols weren\u2019t being followed. Passengers were in close contact with others as they unloaded the ship. They boarded a bus and sat close to others who might be infected. And many have still gone untested even days after arriving at an air force base for quarantine. Denise Morse, a Davis resident, on Thursday filed a complaint through her congressman, John Garamendi, claiming that safety protocols have been disregarded. \u201cWe\u2019re an incubator for Covid-19,\u201d she said from her room on Travis air force base, where she\u2019s surrounded by a containment fence and under guard 24 hours a day. Morse said that when she first arrived at the base she noticed passengers crammed together as they lined up for food and grabbed condiments out of shared bins. There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said. On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available. \u201cThey are not testing us. On the ship they gave us a paper that said we would be tested. When we got here (three days ago), they took our temperatures instead,\u201d Morse said. Heckert, also quarantined at Travis air force base, said on Thursday that her family hadn\u2019t been tested, either. Congressman John Garamendi on Thursday filed a complaint with the federal department of Health and Human Services on Morse\u2019s behalf. It was only then, Morse said, that staff began delivering food to passenger\u2019s rooms instead of having them line up to grab plastic boxes from tall stacks. \u201cWe were better off on the ship,\u201d Morse said, adding that cruise ship staff left food outside their door. Eric Olsen, a spokesman for Rep Garamendi, said the congressman sent pictures of the food distribution problems to HHS, which is running the quarantine. \u201cAccording to health guidelines, you\u2019re supposed to be separating people in their rooms,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIf someone is Covid-19 positive, this (mingling) is going to spread the disease. These people are supposed to be getting ready to be released to the public.\u201d As spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: \u201cOur number one priority was to screen passengers for symptoms, address any underlining health conditions, make sure they had access to their prescription medication, and get them settled into their rooms.\u201d \u201cThis unprecedented response has raised many significant logistical challenges. We have assigned case managers to each of the guests to individually address their needs. We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can to passengers.\u201d For 86-year-old Rex Lawson, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, the experience hasn\u2019t soured his travel plans forever. His children told him he\u2019s never going on another cruise, but he said it\u2019s hard pass up the free trip Princess Cruises has offered him and his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t say never,\u201d Lawson said. But he might be out a partner. He asked his wife if they might use the free ticket in the future. She\u2019d told him that next time, he\u2019d have to go by himself.

The letter, sent to all general practitioners on Friday said: \u201cThere is a particular issue I want to write to you about directly, to ask for your help.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cPathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing.\u201d As Australians rush to get tested, many people are being tested unnecessarily putting pressure on already stretched medical supplies. In the letter Murphy urges doctors to adhere to testing guidelines, and to make sure patients meet both the current epidemiological and clinical criteria for testing. Only people who travelled internationally in the 14 days before illness onset or who had close or casual contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19, and also have a fever or acute respiratory infection need to be tested. People with severe pneumonia with or without recent international travel are also classified as a suspect case requiring testing. The head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone urged Australians to take some personal responsibility and to stop pushing doctors for Covid-19 testing unless they met the criteria or were severely unwell. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is a significant amount of people who are being tested at the moment for no other reason than just fear, anxiety or personal interest,\u201d Bartone told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe criteria that have been clearly outlined in the letter are in the interest of ensuring adequate supply at this crucial time while we\u2019re facing a significant pressure on reagents and kits. \u201cWe are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can\u2019t just be testing to relieve anxiety. We can\u2019t just be relieving anxiety in a population with no contact with a confirmed case.\u201d Bartone said the rush to hospitals and doctor clinics for testing was an extension of panic buying being seen in supermarkets. He urged people to think of vulnerable people including the elderly before asking for tests. \u201cThis is a self-limiting condition. For a small minority it will have significant consequences and unfortunately many Australians will lose their lives. We need to make sure resources are allocated appropriately to minimise risk to communities as a whole. The more irresponsible we are the more likely we are to see an earlier onset and peak.\u201d On Saturday Murphy said during a press conference there had \u201cbeen quite a run on the testing and we had some temporary shortages in testing materials\u201d. \u201cI do want to emphasise that we are still saying, because community transmission is so low at the moment, that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are symptomatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to go and get tested. We need to preserve the testing for those who need it.\u201d The federal health department has published an updated fact sheet for the public about the virus. President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, said countries where the tests originated from, including Italy, \u201care keeping their tests\u201d. \u201cAll the countries are in short supply for their own populations,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yes, we are going to run into problems if we have low-threshold testing.\u201d",

His immediate predecessors rose through the ranks at the bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street offices. Carney \u2013 who holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenship \u2013 was a polished technocrat with an international pedigree, described by the former chancellor George Osborne, who courted him for a year, as \u201cthe outstanding central banker of his generation\u201d. Carney, now 54, arrived on UK soil following a spectacular rise that included a five-and-a-half year stint as governor of Canada\u2019s central bank and 13 years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs before that. He hands back the reins to Andrew Bailey, a Bank of England lifer, who must wield the central bank\u2019s considerable resources to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus. Here we look back at five key moments in Carney\u2019s BoE career: Forward guidance When he took over from Mervyn King in 2013, Carney was determined to give businesses, consumers and financial markets a clear view of the bank\u2019s interest rate policy. Specifically, he wanted to show how the bank\u2019s base rate would move looking two years ahead.

But unemployment quickly tumbled below 7% without any discernible jump in wages \u2013 which would have pushed up inflation and triggered a rate rise.

In an intervention undermining Carney\u2019s authority, Lord King urged MPs to pursue a no-deal Brexit, saying it would have little impact on the British economy in the long run. Brexit vote Carney\u2019s immediate reaction to the leave vote in June 2016 was feted by nervous investors. Dubbed \u201cthe only adult in the room\u201d at the time, he was the first to react when early economic indicators showed business confidence falling through the floor. He stepped in days after the vote on 30 June to say an interest rate cut was needed to steady the ship. Jittery financial markets rallied and stability was restored.

Environment Carney\u2019s drive to push the climate emergency up the world\u2019s agenda stakes his claim for a lasting legacy. The governor first sounded the alarm over the risks to financial markets and the global economy in a speech in 2015, when he warned about the \u201ctragedy of the horizon\u201d. In a landmark speech to the insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London, he said the world was running out of time to deal with global heating as the risks mounted from extreme weather events. Before Carney, central banks had typically kept away from climate issues. However, the Bank\u2019s governor used a letter to the Guardian in 2019 to warn that the financial system faces an existential threat, placing the issue squarely on the agenda for global central banks. Stress tests on banks\u2019 climate risks, proposed and developed on Carney\u2019s watch, will take place next year under Bailey.

Threadneedle Street cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking the key determinant of borrowing costs for households and businesses to the lowest level in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history.

      "bodyText": "The financial world is reeling. After the most dramatic week since the financial crisis, investors are counting their losses while economists fear the world economy risks a painful recession this year. Anxiety that global policymakers are failing to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic wiped trillions of dollars off stocks across the globe. The turmoil was compounded by Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war, which threatens to put some US shale producers out of business, triggering debt defaults. For younger traders in the City, this was their first introduction to true panic on the trading floors. Global markets plunged twice, on Monday and Thursday, with losses exceeding the worst times in the eurozone debt crisis. The FTSE 100 index had already been through two bad weeks, but the last five days inflicted the deepest losses yet on the nation\u2019s pension pots, ISAs, share portfolios and funds. By Friday\u2019s close it had lost 1,096 points, or 17%, shedding \u00a3275bn in a week. Helal Miah, Investment Research Analyst at the Share Centre, said: \u201cIn my 20-plus years in the industry, I find it difficult to remember another week of such momentous moves. Yes, we had some big moves during the financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis and the odd flash crash, yet they never had the extreme one day moves as we have had this week. Following yesterday\u2019s biggest one-day fall since the \u201887 crash, this morning the market opened up by over 6%. Some investors may ask whether this is the bottom. It could be, but seasoned traders and investors will merely see it as a dead-cat bounce. Those of a more nervous disposition may just want to sit tight until the volatility dies down.\u201d Even older City heads hadn\u2019t seen anything like it. Oil suffered its biggest crash since the 1991 Gulf War, after Saudi Arabia dramatically vowed to flood the market with supplies. Saudi ordered its producers to turn the taps up after Russia refused to back an Opec plan to curb output. This shocked the markets, as Covid-19 is already cutting energy demand. Brent crude plunged by a third to $31/barrel, while US crude hit $27. Shares in oil producers across the globe fell too, helping to trigger Monday\u2019s market crash. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic bank SEB, said: \u201cSaudi Arabia is now selling its oil into Europe at about $25 per barrel and inventories are building rapidly. As the coronavirus crisis now accelerates in the US and Europe, there is little that can save Brent from $20/barrel except for a war in the Middle East or a last-minute Opec+ deal. \u201cThe WTI crude oil price has halted just above the $30/barrel line at which virtually all US shale oil wells are rendered unprofitable. \u201cThe global demand side of the equation is now totally insensitive to lower prices in terms of demand right now. It is not so difficult to imagine that global oil demand declines by 10%.\u201d America\u2019s bull market celebrated its 11th birthday this week, and promptly stomped off. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones indices of US stocks plunged over 20% from their record peaks, putting them into a bear market. The end came amid wild swings \u2013 usually downwards \u2013 on Wall Street, as Donald Trump\u2019s shock ban on EU travel to the US spooked investors. But there was a late rally too, as Trump declared a national emergency to help fight the coronavirus threat. The bull market began in March 2009, as the world economy began to recover from the economic shock of the last crisis. The speed of its demise shows the next crisis has arrived. David Kostin, Goldman\u2019s chief US equity strategist, predicted that the earnings of America\u2019s largest companies would fall by 5% this year, as the bull market fizzled out. \u201cBoth the real economy and the financial economy are exhibiting acute signs of stress,\u201d Kostin told clients. But he also believes markets will recover late this year. \u201cA new bull market will likely be born later this year \u2026 By year end, economic and earnings growth will be accelerating, the fed funds rate will be at the zero lower bound, and the impact of any fiscal stimulus will be flowing through to consumers.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s fear index has soared alarmingly, to levels not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The VIX index, which measures volatility, almost doubled during the week, showing serious strains building in the financial world. The VIX surged as shares tumbled, safe-haven government bond yields hit new lows, and riskier corporate debt prices slid. A high VIX is a sign that market will remain volatile for some time, so investors will be buckling up. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said the markets were preparing for the world economy to tumble into recession. He warned CNBC: We are going into a global recession. After what\u2019s been happening the last few days, we are going to see a spread of economic sudden stops.The trouble with economic sudden stops is, it\u2019s not easy to restart an economy.\u201d El-Erian also predicted that the market volatility wouldn\u2019t end soon, telling Fox News: \u201cI wish I could tell you that I see calmer waters in front of us, but I do not. Waters are going to get even choppier.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic is threatening to reignite the eurozone debt crisis. Italy faces a deep recession this year, with shops and offices closing under a nationwide shutdown. Fears that Italy may need a bailout forced Italian borrowing costs up from record lows, which accelerated dramatically after ECB president Christine Lagarde suggested rising bond yield spreads weren\u2019t her responsibility. The European Central Bank rushed out a clarification, but the row distracted from a new stimulus package including ultra-cheap loans for banks. Ana Andrade, Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: Ms Lagarde\u2019s miscommunication both during the press conference and afterwards has lost her political and leadership capital. \u201cThe fallout from Ms Lagarde\u2019s mishandling of the press conference underlines the importance of communication for central banking. The ECB presented a comprehensive, effective package yesterday, but markets didn\u2019t listen because of how poorly it was communicated. \u201cThe package will thus take longer than usual to feed through and have positive effects.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has announced a national publicity blitz aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 as the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the infection rate of the virus may not peak until \u201cwell into the middle of the year\u201d. As Australians brace for the shutdown of major sporting codes, concerts and festivals in a dramatic scaling-back of day-to-day life not seen since the Second World War, the federal government has announced the release of a national advertising campaign to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. Australia now has 200 cases of the virus, as New South Wales reported 20 new cases on Saturday, its biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. The education campaign comes after criticism of the government\u2019s response to the crisis and an acknowledgement by the chief medical officer that the country\u2019s supply of crucial medical equipment including personal protective gear and pathology test kits was \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d. From Sunday, the government will release two separate television advertisements which encourage stringent personal hygiene and warn people who have recently been overseas or in contact with someone who has the virus to \u201cseek medical advice\u201d and self-isolate if they develop symptoms. The campaign, which will also include outdoor advertising on buses, at train stations and in shopping centres, includes the slogan \u201ctogether we can help stop the spread and stay healthy\u201d. It also advises people to only be tested for the virus \u201cif you are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms and have recently returned overseas or have been indirect contact with someone who is known to have contracted coronavirus\u201d. Earlier on Saturday the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the spread of the virus may not peak until \u201cwell into the middle of the year\u201d. \u201cIf we get a large outbreak [it] could go well into the middle of the year before it peaks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are some countries ... which seems to have peaked quite early and controlled the outbreak. One of the things we know about outbreaks and epidemics as they are very hard to predict. \u201cBut it depends how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day.\u201d If the virus were to continue to spread more rapidly into the winter, it could place significant strain on Australia\u2019s medical resources. As the Guardian has reported, a letter sent by Murphy to GPs on Friday warned the country\u2019s supply of personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing kits was already under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d with supplies \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d. \u201cPathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing,\u201d Murphy wrote. Also on Saturday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, spoke publicly for the first time since he was diagnosed with the virus. Speaking to a Sydney radio station from his sickbed at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Dutton said he was feeling \u201cmuch better\u201d and insisted health officials were not concerned about his contact with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, or Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president. \u201cFever has gone this morning, temperature is down, my throat was very mild to start with so probably still a bit sore but very mild in that sense,\u201d he said. Dutton, who said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning, attended a cabinet meeting with senior government ministers including the prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and before that was in the US where he met with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president. Both Trump and Barr worked from home on Friday in the US after Dutton\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed, but the home affairs minister said that he\u2019d spoken to Queensland health authorities who were not concerned about his earlier contacts. \u201cTheir advice to me is they\u2019re concerned with people that I\u2019ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cSo beyond that, it\u2019s not further back, there\u2019s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there\u2019s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That\u2019s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.\u201d In New Zealand, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that anyone entering the country, except for people from Pacific Islander countries, would need to self-isolate for two weeks. That announcement, which comes despite the country recording only six cases of the virus so far, has potentially widespread consequences for the Super Rugby and NRL competitions already beleaguered by the Australian government\u2019s decision to advise against all mass gatherings of more than 500 people. \u201cThis decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,\u201d Ardern said on Saturday. In further developments courts across the state of Victoria in Australia will immediately suspend all future jury trials in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. The drastic measure will apply to the county and supreme courts. Supreme court chief justice Anne Ferguson said all new jury trials would be suspended but that trials in which a jury had already been empanelled would continue. \u201cThis means that the jury empanelment process, in which hundreds of potential jurors gather at court, will not take place until further notice,\u201d Ferguson said. The Northern Territory local court announced on Saturday evening it too would suspend all circuit court services effective immediately.",

The travel restrictions are set to last for 30 days but do not apply to the UK or Ireland.</p> <h2>US House passes coronavirus aid package as Trump declares emergency</h2> <p>The aid package, passed with overwhelming support, provides free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices. The development follows Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-live-updates-uk-us-australia-italy-europe-school-shutdown-share-markets-sport-events-cancelled-latest-update-news?page=with:block-5e6bdfdd8f088d7575593160#block-5e6bdfdd8f088d7575593160\"> a national emergency</a> in response to the pandemic. More than 2,170 cases have been recorded across the US.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia bans all flights into the kingdom</h2> <p>Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA reported. Last month, it took the unprecedented step of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/saudia-arabia-bans-foreign-pilgrims-as-coronavirus-hits-region\">banning foreign pilgrims</a> from entering the country.</p> <h2>New Zealand to quarantine all arrivals</h2> <p>NZ\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said all people arriving in the country, including returning citizens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-live-updates-uk-us-australia-italy-europe-school-shutdown-sport-events-cancelled-latest-update-news\">will be required to isolate themselves for a fortnight</a>.

Ardern also cancelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/new-zealand-cancels-christchurch-attacks-memorial-due-to-coronavirus-fears\">Sunday\u2019s memorial commemorating</a> the first anniversary Christchurch mosque shootings.

The travel restrictions are set to last for 30 days but do not apply to the UK or Ireland. US House passes coronavirus aid package as Trump declares emergency The aid package, passed with overwhelming support, provides free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices. The development follows Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency in response to the pandemic. More than 2,170 cases have been recorded across the US. Saudi Arabia bans all flights into the kingdom Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA reported. Last month, it took the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country.

Only people arriving from the Pacific, were there are virtually no cases, are exempt from the rule. Ardern also cancelled Sunday\u2019s memorial commemorating the first anniversary Christchurch mosque shootings. The country has recorded only six cases so far, and no instances of local transmission.

But it\u2019s just me finding some quiet time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Three days later, on Friday morning, we talk again. The Premier League has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\" title=\"\">just announced a suspension of all matches until 4 April</a>. Our earlier conversation about seclusion seems ironic now Pearson faces the stark possibility one of his players has the virus and that he and many others at the club could be facing a period of self-isolation. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s nicer to choose when and where you are isolated.\u201d Pearson says wryly. \u201cBut for now it\u2019s the right decision and it\u2019s relatively proactive \u2013 even if it was made under duress.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson is still mulling over his disappointment after watching Boris Johnson shuffling around the issue and avoiding any decision in regard to cancelling sporting events. \u201cI was totally underwhelmed by him last night,\u201d Pearson says of the prime minister, \u201cand by the lack of leadership and any clear messages. At times like this we need strong leadership and it\u2019s important people have as much information as possible and that any decisions are made for their well-being. They need to be made for humanitarian rather than financial reasons. Of course, the economy is going to be hit but that can\u2019t be the main priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>I ask Pearson what he and his players will do this weekend now Saturday\u2019s game against Leicester City, his former club, has been suspended. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the report on one player who is being tested for the virus. The players are not expected to report for training until next Thursday at the earliest. But we might have to reassess that. For now we just want them to look after themselves and their families at home \u2013 and also to make sure that if they feel ill they report it straight away. We\u2019ve just got to be vigilant and minimise the risk for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson had told me earlier in the week that the idea of playing games behind closed doors was \u201can absolute nonsense\u201d and that it also put players, coaches and officials at unnecessary risk. In the likely event the pandemic will have escalated by 4 April, should the season be abandoned? \u201cWell, the longer it goes on the more difficult it will be to conclude the season. We have to keep this in perspective, of course, but for Liverpool it would be such a tragedy not to conclude the season. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It could be that when we get to April we may be able to resume and go into the summer months. How it looks for football pales \u2013 not into insignificance \u2013 but we need perspective on real-life issues.

I know I\u2019m good at this job but certain aspects aren\u2019t very good for me. It can be absolutely draining emotionally and mentally. You then can neglect yourself. Those are the dangerous times.\u201d</p> \n<p>How does Pearson replenish himself when there is always some Premier League drama to face? \u201cI have things I enjoy doing on my own. I\u2019ve also got better in talking to friends. One of my strengths is dealing with people but I like to be alone as well. I\u2019ve noticed being back in football that, after some anonymity, people recognise you again. It\u2019s a pain in the neck. My wife said to me yesterday, on a walk: \u2018When you wore glasses that used to be quite a good disguise. But now people recognise you straight away.\u2019 I\u2019m going to have to wear a false beard and moustache.\u201d</p> \n<p>During his last stint at Leicester, when he saved them from relegation the season before they shocked everyone and won the Premier League in 2016, Pearson could be prickly. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/nigel-pearson-leicester-sacked\" title=\"\">losing his job in June 2015</a> broadened his vision. He discovered hiking and painting. He read and worked on his history degree. After a year away Pearson went back into football and soon fell out with Mel Morris, the chairman of Derby County, in October 2017. For the next 11 months he drew breath away from the game before accepting an offer to manage OH Leuven in the Belgian second division. Pearson \u201cloved\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/10/nigel-pearson-interview-leuven-belgium-leicester-ostrich\" title=\"\">his time in Belgium</a>, where he helped design the kit and managed a team in front of average crowds of 4,500 for 17 months.</p> \n<p>His latest break lasted 10 months and three days before, on 6 December 2019, with Watford bottom of the table and having already fired two managers this season, Pearson accepted an unexpected invitation from Vicarage Road. \u201cI was curious and thought: \u2018Let\u2019s give it a real crack.\u2019 People said: \u2018It\u2019s a bit of a risk.\u2019 But where\u2019s the risk? A club that\u2019s got eight points and might score a goal every 400 minutes? You risk a relegation on your CV. The real risk is you regret not having a go.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his first game in charge, away to Liverpool, Watford played well, despite losing 2-0. They then won four and drew one of the next five games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">beating Manchester United </a>and Wolves while looking a different team. Before his arrival they had won one league game out of 13 and their goal difference was -18. How did he rejuvenate a moribund team?</p> \n<p>\u201cBeing positive. Giving direction. Simplifying. Encouraging people to look at what\u2019s possible. I get worn down by people telling you what you can\u2019t do or what the problems are. Go on, give us a solution then. As I say to the players: \u2018I pick you for what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do.\u2019 I make people feel part of a journey to which they can contribute.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401520e405ebae9bf18268145eda07a81f35a4b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401520e405ebae9bf18268145eda07a81f35a4b1/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watford manager Nigel Pearson puts his arm around Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu after the Hornets\u2019 3-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford in February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watford manager Nigel Pearson puts his arm around Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu after the Hornets\u2019 3-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford in February 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pearson was once depicted as a ranting old-school manager \u2013 an English gaffer that gets called \u201ca proper football man\u201d \u2013 but the reality is different. He is a smart tactician who also stresses the importance of emotional intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our success because footballers are people first and foremost. It\u2019s important that you\u2019ve got different types of people and it\u2019s my job to bring the best out of them. But I don\u2019t want to sound as if it\u2019s all touchy-feely stuff. Sometimes it can be blunt and brutal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet Pearson brings a light touch to his work. Before they outran, outworked and simply outplayed Liverpool, Pearson eased off in training that week. Watford did understated sessions, including a day of yoga and swimming. \u201cIt was spontaneous. As we went through the week we thought: \u2018Let\u2019s do something different.\u2019 But it\u2019s got to have authenticity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson gave Watford more solidity when he arrived by changing to 4-2-1-3 \u2013 with the idea that a more structured defence would unleash the team\u2019s attacking potential. Watford are fourth from bottom and, should this campaign recommence, Pearson insists they will keep attacking. This means he often replaces a defensive midfielder with a forward, even if Watford are leading. There have been 3-0 wins over Aston Villa, even after going down to 10 men, and Liverpool but they conceded last-minute winners at Villa Park and at home to Everton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. I have a love-hate relationship with it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe need to win games,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we go gung-ho and take away the importance of solidity. But the way in which you play is dictated by what you have available and the situation you\u2019re in. We have pace and good attacking players but we can\u2019t be negligent. Sometimes we have to recognise that a point is great. But to give belief and hope we have to be positive and aggressive.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a relegation dogfight and we\u2019ve worked exceptionally hard to get back in contact with teams. Now we\u2019ve done that, results like last weekend\u2019s loss against Palace can feel a missed opportunity. But we can\u2019t dwell on disappointments. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t take our chances against Palace </a>but we played OK. I have to detach myself from this emotional rollercoaster that everyone else is on.\u201d</p> \n<p>The more human backdrop is shaped by the fact Pearson lost his mum unexpectedly 10 weeks ago. He highlights the support of his wife, Nicky, and their adult son and daughter, James and Hannah, but he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve found the right way of grieving yet. We\u2019re making sure we all rally around my dad. They were together 64 years. A long, long time. Mum was such an energetic, dynamic 84-year-old. She was the dominant figure in the family and so it\u2019s been difficult. It would\u2019ve been her 85<sup>th</sup> birthday next Wednesday. That\u2019s when we plan to scatter her ashes. So it\u2019s still very, very raw.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt happened on 28 December, the day of the Villa game, and straight after James said: \u2018We need to get ready quickly.\u2019 My mum had had a fall. The next few days were just backwards and forwards on the motorway. She died just a few days later, on the third. It was a huge shock. So now the focal point is my dad. I\u2019ve just lost my mum and I certainly don\u2019t want to lose my dad to [coronavirus]. It\u2019s going to be a further worry because the elderly are more at risk.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pearson visited his father on Monday evening, before the threat that the virus had reached the Watford camp had emerged. Now he knows that a fellow manager, Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta, has coronavirus, is Pearson concerned he may also be affected and have passed it on to his 86-year-old dad? \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to presume that we may all have come into contact with someone who has got it. But it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how many have been exposed to it. That\u2019s not scaremongering. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is Pearson finding a balance between looking after others both inside and outside the club while taking care of himself? \u201cI hope so. But the reality of it is, like a lot of people, I\u2019m good at giving advice, but not so much when taking it. I\u2019m trying to enjoy the job a bit more. But that\u2019s never easy because I have a love-hate relationship with it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"784248dc-94b4-4d26-9b0b-5f952a88b359\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KfRm-YggRH0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond the travails of a pandemic virus and a relegation battle, Pearson relaxes and shares a couple of his many pleasurable diversions. \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying doing the Guardian crossword since I joined Leicester first time around [in 2008]. I try to do the quick ones under 10 minutes. Today\u2019s I did in nine minutes.\u201d Flicking through his Spotify playlist he reads out an eclectic mix stretching from Miles Davis to The Cure, Nick Drake to Chick Corea, Van Morrison to XTC, The Shins to a selection of Icelandic groups, his enjoyment is obvious.</p> \n<p>We drift back to football. If the season does resume will Watford survive the drop and can he possibly enjoy the challenge? \u201cYeah, I believe we will stay up. As for enjoying it I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. But I think the pain of it is also a stimulus. I\u2019d rather be bored sometimes \u2013 but then there would be other things to worry about. I just know we\u2019re in this situation and I\u2019m going to give everything to get us out of it \u2013 so we have to be ready to engage with it again when the opportunity comes along. But, for now, we\u2019ll put relegation worries to one side. The health of all of us is the priority.\u201d</p>",

A club that\u2019s got eight points and might score a goal every 400 minutes? You risk a relegation on your CV. The real risk is you regret not having a go.\u201d In his first game in charge, away to Liverpool, Watford played well, despite losing 2-0. They then won four and drew one of the next five games, beating Manchester United and Wolves while looking a different team. Before his arrival they had won one league game out of 13 and their goal difference was -18. How did he rejuvenate a moribund team? \u201cBeing positive. Giving direction. Simplifying. Encouraging people to look at what\u2019s possible. I get worn down by people telling you what you can\u2019t do or what the problems are. Go on, give us a solution then. As I say to the players: \u2018I pick you for what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do.\u2019 I make people feel part of a journey to which they can contribute.\u201d Pearson was once depicted as a ranting old-school manager \u2013 an English gaffer that gets called \u201ca proper football man\u201d \u2013 but the reality is different. He is a smart tactician who also stresses the importance of emotional intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our success because footballers are people first and foremost. It\u2019s important that you\u2019ve got different types of people and it\u2019s my job to bring the best out of them. But I don\u2019t want to sound as if it\u2019s all touchy-feely stuff. Sometimes it can be blunt and brutal.\u201d Yet Pearson brings a light touch to his work. Before they outran, outworked and simply outplayed Liverpool, Pearson eased off in training that week. Watford did understated sessions, including a day of yoga and swimming. \u201cIt was spontaneous. As we went through the week we thought: \u2018Let\u2019s do something different.\u2019 But it\u2019s got to have authenticity.\u201d Pearson gave Watford more solidity when he arrived by changing to 4-2-1-3 \u2013 with the idea that a more structured defence would unleash the team\u2019s attacking potential. Watford are fourth from bottom and, should this campaign recommence, Pearson insists they will keep attacking. This means he often replaces a defensive midfielder with a forward, even if Watford are leading. There have been 3-0 wins over Aston Villa, even after going down to 10 men, and Liverpool but they conceded last-minute winners at Villa Park and at home to Everton. \u201cWe need to win games,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we go gung-ho and take away the importance of solidity. But the way in which you play is dictated by what you have available and the situation you\u2019re in. We have pace and good attacking players but we can\u2019t be negligent. Sometimes we have to recognise that a point is great. But to give belief and hope we have to be positive and aggressive. \u201cWe\u2019re in a relegation dogfight and we\u2019ve worked exceptionally hard to get back in contact with teams. Now we\u2019ve done that, results like last weekend\u2019s loss against Palace can feel a missed opportunity. But we can\u2019t dwell on disappointments. We didn\u2019t take our chances against Palace but we played OK. I have to detach myself from this emotional rollercoaster that everyone else is on.\u201d The more human backdrop is shaped by the fact Pearson lost his mum unexpectedly 10 weeks ago. He highlights the support of his wife, Nicky, and their adult son and daughter, James and Hannah, but he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve found the right way of grieving yet. We\u2019re making sure we all rally around my dad. They were together 64 years. A long, long time. Mum was such an energetic, dynamic 84-year-old. She was the dominant figure in the family and so it\u2019s been difficult. It would\u2019ve been her 85th birthday next Wednesday. That\u2019s when we plan to scatter her ashes. So it\u2019s still very, very raw. \u201cIt happened on 28 December, the day of the Villa game, and straight after James said: \u2018We need to get ready quickly.\u2019 My mum had had a fall. The next few days were just backwards and forwards on the motorway. She died just a few days later, on the third. It was a huge shock. So now the focal point is my dad. I\u2019ve just lost my mum and I certainly don\u2019t want to lose my dad to [coronavirus]. It\u2019s going to be a further worry because the elderly are more at risk.\u201d Pearson visited his father on Monday evening, before the threat that the virus had reached the Watford camp had emerged. Now he knows that a fellow manager, Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta, has coronavirus, is Pearson concerned he may also be affected and have passed it on to his 86-year-old dad? \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to presume that we may all have come into contact with someone who has got it. But it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how many have been exposed to it. That\u2019s not scaremongering. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d Is Pearson finding a balance between looking after others both inside and outside the club while taking care of himself? \u201cI hope so. But the reality of it is, like a lot of people, I\u2019m good at giving advice, but not so much when taking it. I\u2019m trying to enjoy the job a bit more. But that\u2019s never easy because I have a love-hate relationship with it.\u201d Beyond the travails of a pandemic virus and a relegation battle, Pearson relaxes and shares a couple of his many pleasurable diversions. \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying doing the Guardian crossword since I joined Leicester first time around [in 2008]. I try to do the quick ones under 10 minutes. Today\u2019s I did in nine minutes.\u201d Flicking through his Spotify playlist he reads out an eclectic mix stretching from Miles Davis to The Cure, Nick Drake to Chick Corea, Van Morrison to XTC, The Shins to a selection of Icelandic groups, his enjoyment is obvious. We drift back to football. If the season does resume will Watford survive the drop and can he possibly enjoy the challenge? \u201cYeah, I believe we will stay up. As for enjoying it I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. But I think the pain of it is also a stimulus. I\u2019d rather be bored sometimes \u2013 but then there would be other things to worry about. I just know we\u2019re in this situation and I\u2019m going to give everything to get us out of it \u2013 so we have to be ready to engage with it again when the opportunity comes along. But, for now, we\u2019ll put relegation worries to one side. The health of all of us is the priority.\u201d",

In a supermarket it is impossible \u2013 because everything customers do is about hand contact.</p> <p>\u201cI think the best way is to offer customers free hand gel at the entrance and politely ask them to use it to protect other customers whilst they are in the store. Do the same thing for customers who are leaving to protect themselves against people who refused to comply with the earlier request \u2013 simple but effective.</p> <p>\u201cHands are the last line of defence \u2013 if you don\u2019t touch the mouth, eyes and nose with contaminated hands, you won\u2019t get infected via this route.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ef9d5a016beef1c14d6fd7184034dad606fce94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ef9d5a016beef1c14d6fd7184034dad606fce94/0_182_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign explaining that drinks will not be served in reusable cups in a Starbucks in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starbucks has temporarily banned the use of reusable cups. <br><br>A sign explaining that drinks will not be served in reusable cups is seen inside a Starbucks in London, Britain, March 6, 2020.

Customers still receive a 25p discount for bringing reusable cups with them, but drinks are being served to them in paper cups to avoid the spreading of germs via the mouth.</p> <p>Other chains, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/pret-a-manger\" title=\"\">Pret a Manger</a>, are keeping the situation under review. A spokeswoman said: \u201cAt this stage, there isn\u2019t any evidence that stopping the use of reusable cups will reduce the risk to customers or to our (staff) teams. We\u2019re obviously constantly reviewing guidelines from health officials and should the advice change, then we will of course update our approach.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Does taking the train mean I\u2019m more at risk of infection?</strong></h2> <p>Some rail services into the big cities have been running at half their normal capacity this week as travellers have opted to work at home, or postpone leisure trips into the capital.</p> <p>If you are sitting on a train and within 1-2 metres of an infected person who coughs, you are at risk of infection.</p> <p>But the more likely risk is the virus lingering for 48-72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail.</p> <p>If you have to touch rails, buttons, tickets and so on, try to do it with just one hand. Keep phones in the other \u201cclean\u201d hand and wash both as soon as you can at your destination.</p> <p>The Rail Delivery Group says the train companies are closely monitoring the latest Public Health England advice and planning for a range of different outcomes. \u201cWe are ensuring that rail staff are kept aware of the latest advice to maintain good hand hygiene and keep surfaces clean, particularly in customer facing locations,\u201d it says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e2eba6da78ce946f31b1d66e45b9c4dcfcaaf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e2eba6da78ce946f31b1d66e45b9c4dcfcaaf0/0_190_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pedestrian wears a protective facemask while taking a bus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public transport doesn\u2019t make it easy to remain the recommended 1 metre away from fellow travellers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What about the crammed tubes, buses and trams?</strong></h2> <p>Anyone who has got on the Central line at Oxford Circus at peak time will know that it can be hard to stay more than 10cm away from your fellow passengers \u2013 never mind the recommended 1 metre. In Milan, passengers have been advised to sit opposite an empty seat, something of which passengers in London can usually only dream. Transport for London told Guardian Money that it had unveiled an \u201cenhanced cleaning regime\u201d to improve the hygiene levels on the capital\u2019s public transport.</p> <p>Additional substances that kill viruses and bacteria are being used across the London Underground and bus networks, while the busiest stations will be cleaned more regularly than usual, including during the day, it said. Bus parts that are regularly touched \u2013 such as poles and doors \u2013 will be wiped down with a strong disinfectant every day.</p> <h2><strong>What </strong><strong>about walking or cycling instead?</strong></h2> <p>Last week the German authorities asked people to work from home and to consider walking or cycling if they had to go to work. Walking or cycling alone is clearly less risky than being on a packed tram or tube train.</p> <p>In the UK, Halfords has reported a 30% rise on the sale of commuter-friendly folding bikes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99d21f1df4c42f0ffe7c560a8366556bd5ee0934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99d21f1df4c42f0ffe7c560a8366556bd5ee0934/0_95_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man cleaning his car interiors and dashboard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Car interiors can contain more germs than a kitchen sink \u2013 it\u2019s worth cleaning them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>I drive to work \u2013 what about the car?</strong></h2> <p>Back in 2018, a study found that three of the five cars tested contained more bacteria than the inside of a bin lid. Swabbing the steering wheel, gear stick, dashboard controls and door handle, the car interiors also contained more germs than a kitchen bench top and sink. Covid-19 is a virus not a bacteria, but you get the message. Antibacterial surface cleaning wipes such as those from Dettol claim to kill almost all bacteria and viruses \u2013 including coronaviruses. You should look for products that contain isopropanol \u2013 if there are any left on the shelves. If you are regularly taking passengers in your car, a wipe down at the end of the journey won\u2019t do any harm.</p> <h2><strong>What about at work \u2013 what should I be doing and not doing?</strong></h2> <p>A lot of it is what we all know already: the most effective way to prevent the spread of infection is to wash your hands regularly, plus maybe use an alcohol-based hand rub. Both staff and any visitors need to have access to such facilities.</p> <p>A leaflet from Health Protection Scotland, published this month, also recommends the following:</p> <p>\u2022 Routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces (such as phones, keyboards, door handles, desks and tables). Clearly that will be particularly important if your keyboard or desk phone is used by other people.</p> <p>\u2022 Ensure that any plates, mugs, cutlery and so on in shared kitchen areas are properly washed up and dried thoroughly before being put away in cupboards.</p> <p>\u2022 Avoid the \u201ccommunal sharing\u201d of things such as crisps and sandwiches, unless the items are individually wrapped.</p>",

In a supermarket it is impossible \u2013 because everything customers do is about hand contact. \u201cI think the best way is to offer customers free hand gel at the entrance and politely ask them to use it to protect other customers whilst they are in the store. Do the same thing for customers who are leaving to protect themselves against people who refused to comply with the earlier request \u2013 simple but effective. \u201cHands are the last line of defence \u2013 if you don\u2019t touch the mouth, eyes and nose with contaminated hands, you won\u2019t get infected via this route.\u201d Can I still use my reusable or refillable cup for hot drinks when I am out and about? Many of us have got used to carrying and using refillable cups when out and about \u2013 an eco-conscious move that typically guarantees a discount off the price of the drink to boot. But in the UK coffee chains are having a rethink in response to the coronavirus outbreak, with Starbucks temporarily banning the use of reusable cups \u2013 typically made of plastic, glass or bamboo material \u2013 for the safety of both customers and staff. Customers still receive a 25p discount for bringing reusable cups with them, but drinks are being served to them in paper cups to avoid the spreading of germs via the mouth. Other chains, including Pret a Manger, are keeping the situation under review. A spokeswoman said: \u201cAt this stage, there isn\u2019t any evidence that stopping the use of reusable cups will reduce the risk to customers or to our (staff) teams. We\u2019re obviously constantly reviewing guidelines from health officials and should the advice change, then we will of course update our approach.\u201d Does taking the train mean I\u2019m more at risk of infection? Some rail services into the big cities have been running at half their normal capacity this week as travellers have opted to work at home, or postpone leisure trips into the capital. If you are sitting on a train and within 1-2 metres of an infected person who coughs, you are at risk of infection. But the more likely risk is the virus lingering for 48-72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail. If you have to touch rails, buttons, tickets and so on, try to do it with just one hand. Keep phones in the other \u201cclean\u201d hand and wash both as soon as you can at your destination. The Rail Delivery Group says the train companies are closely monitoring the latest Public Health England advice and planning for a range of different outcomes. \u201cWe are ensuring that rail staff are kept aware of the latest advice to maintain good hand hygiene and keep surfaces clean, particularly in customer facing locations,\u201d it says. What about the crammed tubes, buses and trams? Anyone who has got on the Central line at Oxford Circus at peak time will know that it can be hard to stay more than 10cm away from your fellow passengers \u2013 never mind the recommended 1 metre. In Milan, passengers have been advised to sit opposite an empty seat, something of which passengers in London can usually only dream. Transport for London told Guardian Money that it had unveiled an \u201cenhanced cleaning regime\u201d to improve the hygiene levels on the capital\u2019s public transport. Additional substances that kill viruses and bacteria are being used across the London Underground and bus networks, while the busiest stations will be cleaned more regularly than usual, including during the day, it said. Bus parts that are regularly touched \u2013 such as poles and doors \u2013 will be wiped down with a strong disinfectant every day. What about walking or cycling instead? Last week the German authorities asked people to work from home and to consider walking or cycling if they had to go to work. Walking or cycling alone is clearly less risky than being on a packed tram or tube train. In the UK, Halfords has reported a 30% rise on the sale of commuter-friendly folding bikes. I drive to work \u2013 what about the car? Back in 2018, a study found that three of the five cars tested contained more bacteria than the inside of a bin lid. Swabbing the steering wheel, gear stick, dashboard controls and door handle, the car interiors also contained more germs than a kitchen bench top and sink. Covid-19 is a virus not a bacteria, but you get the message. Antibacterial surface cleaning wipes such as those from Dettol claim to kill almost all bacteria and viruses \u2013 including coronaviruses. You should look for products that contain isopropanol \u2013 if there are any left on the shelves. If you are regularly taking passengers in your car, a wipe down at the end of the journey won\u2019t do any harm. What about at work \u2013 what should I be doing and not doing? A lot of it is what we all know already: the most effective way to prevent the spread of infection is to wash your hands regularly, plus maybe use an alcohol-based hand rub. Both staff and any visitors need to have access to such facilities. A leaflet from Health Protection Scotland, published this month, also recommends the following: \u2022 Routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces (such as phones, keyboards, door handles, desks and tables). Clearly that will be particularly important if your keyboard or desk phone is used by other people. \u2022 Ensure that any plates, mugs, cutlery and so on in shared kitchen areas are properly washed up and dried thoroughly before being put away in cupboards. \u2022 Avoid the \u201ccommunal sharing\u201d of things such as crisps and sandwiches, unless the items are individually wrapped.",

The circus will simply have to fit itself into the margins.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/sport-great-distraction-reluctantly-cancelled-coronavirus\">Sport's role as the great distraction reluctantly cancelled but it will be back | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6c4e398f085c6327bbfb96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T03:26:34.212Z\">3.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>W-League: 20 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - </strong>Since the goal Huerta has enjoyed a couple of half-chances on the break as Sydney consolidate their advantage. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6c4be58f088d757559333e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T03:23:04.162Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Coronavirus</strong>: A reminder that if you are unsure of the state of play of major sporting activity around Australia, you can find out more via the links below.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/australia-sport-afl-nrl-coronavirus\">AFLW, AFL, NRL go behind closed doors as Covid-19 wreaks havoc in Australian sport</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/postponed-cancelled-or-business-as-usual-a-guide-to-australias-sport-events-during-coronavirus\">Postponed, cancelled or business as usual?

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me for today. Lots happened, quite how much of it will matter in the long run remains to be seen. All eyes now on the response to New Zealand\u2019s travel restrictions and the impact they will have on domestic leagues. For more on that, and the rest of the day\u2019s sporting news Megan Maurice will be on deck tomorrow. An absorbing, incident-packed game ends in favour of Souths - just. NRL: 79 mins: Rabbitohs 22-18 Sharks - Cronulla cross in the left corner, but it\u2019s ruled out - correctly - for a forward pass! Morris was needlessly ahead of the ball in acres of space as play was swung from right to left. Huge let-off for Souths. NRL: 73 mins: Rabbitohs 22-18 Sharks - It has been a chaotic end to this match with both teams coughing up the ball unnecessarily and the Rabbitohs looking a shadow of the side that cruised through the opening hour. NRL: 67 mins: Rabbitohs 22-18 Sharks - Game very much on! What a finish from Katoa! His second in as many minutes, leaping like a salmon upstream from about five metres from the line to avoid crossing into touch. More superb play in the build-up from Johnson. NRL: 65 mins: Rabbitohs 22-14 Sharks - Beautiful try from Cronulla. Shaun Johnson flings a wicked pass out to the right wing where Sione Katoa holds on after a juggle to skip over in the corner. Game back on. It ends goalless in Kogarah, but Steve Corica is wondering how, after a second one-on-one in a matter of minutes goes begging. With the final kick of the match Trent Buhagiar was clean through after superb work from Milos Ninkovic, but he rolled his shot wide of the post. For Sydney, it\u2019s a point closer to an inevitable premiership. Perth remain locked in a scrap for a home final but after four games without a win are starting to look over their shoulder at the chasing pack rather than up towards the Asian Champions League qualification places. The Tigers remain winless and bottom of Conference A, but the Saints celebrate their second win of the season and move up to 5th in Conference B - still some way short of the finals. Caitlin Greiser did the damage with 3.1. NRL: 50 mins: Rabbitohs 22-8 Sharks - They can score tries with 12 men so 13 almost seems unfair. The Bunnies are bouncing in the big NSW derby. A-League: 87 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - Clearest chance of the match so far but Reddy repels Ninkovic one-on-one. The Sydney star was clean through following a massive punt upfield from Redmayne but the Glory stopper was equal to the challenge. NRL: 45 mins: Rabbitohs 16-8 Sharks - The Rabbitohs are back to their full complement of players and they\u2019ll be delighted to have escaped Roberts\u2019 sin-bin with their lead intact. A-League: 80 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - Still goalless with around ten minutes remaining at Kogarah. Chances have been at a premium all afternoon. AFLW: 3QT: St Kilda 4.5 (29) v 0.2 (2) Richmond - It\u2019s turning into a joyous occasion for the Saints, on track for just their second victory in AFLW. The lowly Sunwolves matched it with the mighty Crusaders for about an hour but the champions still ran out convincing winners. Who knows how much it matters in the grand scheme of things? NRL: HT: Rabbitohs 16-8 Sharks - Calamity for Cronulla! Despite the man advantage they concede a try in the shadow of half-time. Souths darted down the short-side left from a play-the-ball 10m from the line and it ends with Campbell Graham touching down in the corner. A-League: 56 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - The visitors almost steal a lead but Bruno Fornaroli can\u2019t redirect his header on target after loitering on the six-yard box, feeding off the scraps, following a corner. NRL: 33 mins: Rabbitohs 10-8 Sharks - Souths have been on top for the opening half-hour but they\u2019ve just seen James Roberts sent to the sin-bin and almost immediately Cronulla take advantage, ripping from right to left before Wade Graham bursts over the line. AFLW: HT: St Kilda 2.1 (13) v 0.2 (2) Richmond - The Tigers narrowed the margin in the second quarter but the Saints remain in pole position for a rare victory. A-League: HT: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - The scoreline is goalless but it\u2019s been an entertaining half of A-League football. Luke Brattan has been instrumental and he thought he\u2019d opened the scoring, only for VAR to find a handball and rule out his effort. He later whipped in a superb free-kick that Rhyan Grant clipped over the bar. At the other end Diego Castro should have done better but he stumbled with a clear sight of goal. NRL: 13 mins: Rabbitohs 6-2 Sharks - After Cronulla opened the scoring with a penalty Souths have hit the front courtesy of a converted Adam Reynolds try. NRL: We\u2019re underway in the big NSW blockbuster between Souths and the Sharks. All eyes on any politicians in the stands... AFLW: QT: St Kilda 2.1 (13) v 0.0 (0) Richmond - It\u2019s a match that\u2019s unlikely to trouble the finals but St Kilda won\u2019t mind as they take a handy lead into quarter-time. Super Rugby: HT: Sunwolves 7-14 Crusaders - The Sunwolves levelled matters at 7-7 but it didn\u2019t remain that way for long with the competition heavyweights restoring their advantage shortly before the siren. A-League: 18 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - Best moment of the match so far sees Caceres draw a good save from Reddy after the Sydney midfielder darted down the right-hand side of the box. Le Fondre thought he was in with the follow-up but he had crept offside. Quite how the A-League, NRL, and Super Rugby authorities are going to cope with New Zealand\u2019s recent restrictions on movement is anyone\u2019s guess. A-League: 10 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - A neat opening ten minutes in Kogarah with both sides moving the ball nicely around the pitch without creating much in the way of goalmouth action. Kosta Barbarouses fashioned Sydney\u2019s best opening with a turn that left Alex Grant for dead, while Joel Chianese has offered the most at the other end. A-League: We\u2019re underway in the first A-League fixture of the day with premiers-elect Sydney FC hosting the side they beat in last year\u2019s grand final, Perth Glory. Super Rugby: 30 mins: Sunwolves 0-7 Crusaders - In the day\u2019s second Super Rugby contest the Crusaders are into an early lead, not that it\u2019s likely to matter too much in the long run. The Waratahs continued their perfect start to the Super W season by thrashing last-placed RugbyWA at Sydney University. Maya Stewart dominated, running in four successive tries either side of the interval. Huge win for the Pies on the road in Queensland, weathering Brisbane\u2019s storm in the third quarter and streaking away to a finals-boosting victory. A comfortable start to the season for the Knights at a wet and windy Hunter Stadium. An uncomfortable start, and perhaps finish, to the season for the Warriors. AFLW: 3QT: Brisbane 2.1 (14) v 3.10 (28) Collingwood - The Lions are digging deep and outscored the Pies two goals to nil that quarter but they still have plenty of ground to make up in the final term. 20 tackles to six in favour of Brisbane in that third quarter a clear indication of the increased intensity. NRL: 60 mins: Knights 20-0 Warriors - Newcastle are in cruise control. A thumping bonus point victory for the Blues at home to the Lions, but what it actually means in context of the Super Rugby season remains to be seen given the New Zealand government\u2019s announcement earlier today. NRL: 50 mins: Knights 14-0 Warriors - Newcastle\u2019s lead is out to 14-0 courtesy of a couple of second-half penalties. That early Veronica Latsko goal proved enough for Sydney FC to reach their seventh W-League grand final. The defending champions bounced back from a 3-1 defeat in the same fixture last weekend to hold their nerve despite an onslaught on their goal in the second half. AFLW: HT: Brisbane 0.1 (1) v 3.7 (25) Collingwood - The Magpies are having a day out at Hickey Park. Brisbane, second in Conference A, are staring at only their second defeat of the season, against a rampant Collingwood, fourth in Conference B. Brittany Bonnici leads the way for the Pies with 14 disposals while last week\u2019s star Chloe Molloy is in the goals once again. NRL: HT: Knights 10-0 Warriors - It\u2019s wet and windy in Newcastle and the Warriors are enduring the matchday from hell. 40 minutes left in the match, and perhaps for the NRL season, for the Kiwi visitors. W-League: 68 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - The second half has been all Victory but their dominance of territory and possession has yet to convert into an equaliser. The latest chance falls to Ayres but her curling effort from the edge of the box floats agonisingly wide. NRL: 22 mins: Knights 10-0 Warriors - This really is a day to forget for the Warriors. Their season is likely over just as it\u2019s begun, and in the one match they\u2019re going to complete they\u2019re already two tries behind and have a man in the bin. And, with armageddon creeping over the horizon, a quick whip around the grounds: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - It\u2019s all Victory in the early stages of the second-half but the Sky Blues remain ahead in the W-League semi-final. Blues 22-10 Lions - It\u2019s going according to script in Super Rugby at half-time. Knights 6-0 Warriors - Newcastle are on top in horrendous conditions in the NRL, midway through the firs-half. Coronavirus: The knock-on effects of the New Zealand government restrictions on Australian sport are obvious. Super Rugby is going to be hit hard. The Phoenix in the A-League and Warriors in the NRL are also going to suffer major disruption. Cricket: Breaking news - the Australia v NZ ODI series is now off after just one of the three matches. This coincides with New Zealand announcing a 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers to NZ from all countries bar the Pacific as of midnight Sunday. FFA Cup: Craig Foster continues to demonstrate he is an ornament to Australian football. W-League: HT: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - Victory began brightly but after Latsko put Sydney FC ahead this semi-final has been played largely on the Sky Blues\u2019 terms. Super Rugby: 20 mins: Blues 8-7 Lions - A converted Dan Kriel try briefly put the visitors in the lead but the Blues hit back swiftly with an Otere Black penalty. W-League: 35 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - A stoppage in play after Latsko receives a ball to the mush at close range. The doctor and physio are both on the field conducting a thorough concussion protocol before play continues. The TV broadcast has the benefit of Kate Gill on commentary, the deputy CEO of the players\u2019 union, and involved in helping draw up that policy. Super Rugby: 8 mins: Blues 5-0 Lions - The Blues, second-last in the New Zealand Conference despite a 4-2 win-loss record, are on their way to 5-2 with an early try against the Lions. The Johannesburg outfit are rooted to the foot of the South Africa Conference and look unlikely to improve their status in Auckland. W-League: 28 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - Victory again fail to capitalise on a decent opening but Ayres doesn\u2019t commit to attacking a Beard cross and Bledsoe claims. Coronavirus: Naturally, thoughts are turning to the role of sport in times of crisis and how to put the disruption to making sporting events into some kind of context. This is irrelevant. One benefit of force majeure is a sense of perspective, a reminder that football remains essentially a business of propelling a leather sphere into a netted rectangle. There is nothing to stop games resuming once public health advice allows it. On the other hand it may make better sense simply to dead-head the season. The circus will simply have to fit itself into the margins. W-League: 20 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - Since the goal Huerta has enjoyed a couple of half-chances on the break as Sydney consolidate their advantage. Coronavirus: A reminder that if you are unsure of the state of play of major sporting activity around Australia, you can find out more via the links below. The situation throughout the rest of the world is here: W-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC (Latsko, 14) - Victory have looked the likelier in these early exchanges but they have gone behind after Veronica Latsko stole in at the front post to convert a teasing in-swinging Ally Green cross from the right. W-League: 12 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Sydney FC Victory should be in front but Longo shoots tamely at Bledsoe from just inside the box after terrific hold-up play from Dowie. Victory have the gusty wind at their back this first half so they\u2019ll be keen to make it count. Dowie, incidentally, has just been booked for absolutely nothing. Genuinely mystifying, especially so early in the match. Cricket: In other actual sporting news, Australia rebounded from their ODI humbling in South Africa by defeating New Zealand behind closed doors at the SCG. Adam Zampa once again starred with the ball, dismissing Kane Williamson with a mighty googly. W-League: 5 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Sydney FC Victory have made a tidy start, creating a couple of decent early openings but neither Natasha Dowie nor Haley Hanson forced Aubrey Bledsoe into action. W-League: Victory have timed their season to perfection. They spent the first seven rounds outside the top four and only climbed into the top three in the penultimate week, eventually finishing in a season-high second courtesy of a 3-1 win over - you guessed it - Sydney FC in the last round. That result means Victory, not Sydney host today\u2019s semi at a windswept Epping Stadium. W-League: Here are your line-ups for today\u2019s semi-final. For Victory, Sham Khamis has joined as an injury replacement after Teagan Micah picked up a knock while on international duty. While Ally Green and Natalie Tobin come in for the Sky Blues. Hello everybody and welcome to another action packed edition of Sportwatch. This is comfortably the most surreal session of live-blogging I am ever likely to undertake. As I\u2019m sure you are aware there is plenty happening around the country, and the world, with the Covid-19 situation unfolding by the minute. Improbably, against this backdrop, the show must go on. Despite sporting competitions around the world suspending activity - and sport in Australia facing some restrictions now and further on Monday - we find ourselves in a brief window where leagues that wish to operate can do so relatively unencumbered. So, that means the W-League semi-final between Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC will go ahead at 2pm. There\u2019ll be Super Rugby with the Blues v Lions (2.25pm), Sunwolves v Crusaders (4.35pm), and Reds v Bulls (7.15pm). There\u2019s also Super W action at 3.25pm when the Waratahs take on Rugby WA. The NRL is open for business from 3pm with Knights v Warriors, followed by the blockbuster Souths v Sharks clash at 5.30pm. This evening the Panthers host the Roosters at 7.35pm). The AFLW continues at 3.10pm with Brisbane v Collingwood, followed by St Kilda v Richmond at 5.10pm, then at 7.40pm Melbourne v Carlton. In the A-League there\u2019s a repeat of last year\u2019s grand-final when Sydney take on Perth at 5pm, with the action rounded out by Melbourne City and WSW at 7.30pm. Doubtless there\u2019ll be breaking news throughout the day as well. On with the show!",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn\u2019t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">failing</a>\u201d testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.</p> \n<p>Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3?international=true&amp;r=US\">running into the millions</a> and only about 45,000 ICU beds <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">available</a> in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-donald-trump-presidency-sick-joke\">The sick joke of Donald Trump's presidency isn't funny any more | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won\u2019t be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color.</p> \n<p>At this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/\">extraordinary powers</a>, including the ability to freeze an American\u2019s finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority.</p> \n<p>Most worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \u201ctrue\u201d American, from denying Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \u201cgo back\u201d to where \u201cthey came\u201d from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn\u2019t at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America.</p> \n<p>Already the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\">insisting on labeling it</a> \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hold-accountable-those-who-inflicted-it-on-the-world-tom-cotton-demands-punishment-for-coronavirus-outbreak\">threatened</a> to \u201chold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\u201d. Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results \u2013 both from the misuse of state power, and from privately \u2013 inflicted terrorism and violence \u2013 could be profound.</p> \n<p>It is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election \u2013 instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House.</p> \n<p>In short, nothing in Trump\u2019s record \u2013 or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about \u2013 can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn\u2019t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America\u2019s \u201cfailing\u201d testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening. Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care running into the millions and only about 45,000 ICU beds available in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home. When Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won\u2019t be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color. At this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has extraordinary powers, including the ability to freeze an American\u2019s finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority. Most worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \u201ctrue\u201d American, from denying Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \u201cgo back\u201d to where \u201cthey came\u201d from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn\u2019t at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America. Already the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from insisting on labeling it \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even threatened to \u201chold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\u201d. Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results \u2013 both from the misuse of state power, and from privately \u2013 inflicted terrorism and violence \u2013 could be profound. It is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election \u2013 instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House. In short, nothing in Trump\u2019s record \u2013 or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about \u2013 can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes. Many Americans will have to deal with the reality of a president who is not only incompetent to defend them but doesn\u2019t even regard them as legitimate Americans worthy of protection. This epidemiological crisis is also a political one. We should prepare to defend against both. Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University",

      "bodyText": "Film Boy (2010) Amazon Prime Video Taika Waititi\u2019s semi-autobiographical, wholly magical 2010 comedy has recently become available to stream over here, and it is essential viewing, whichever side of the Jojo Rabbit debate you fall on. Set in 1984, it\u2019s a boy\u2019s-eye-view story of growing up in a New Zealand Maori community, while hero-worshipping Michael Jackson and pining after your absentee father. For Sama (2019) All4 Now is the time to catch up on some Oscar movies \u2013 not to mention news of ongoing world events \u2013 and this 2020 best documentary nominee offers both. Waad al-Kateab addresses her film to her baby daughter Sama, born in the midst of the Syrian conflict. It is a difficult watch, but be witness and you will discover a beautiful testament to hope and humanity. Logan Lucky (2017) Amazon Prime Video Tired: speculating on who will be the next Bond. Wired: speculating on who Bond will be next. Universal\u2019s decision to push back No Time to Die until China\u2019s cinemas re-open provides an opportunity to remember the other Daniel Craig in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 2017 heist. And if OTT accents aren\u2019t your bag, Craig\u2019s five-star performance in 2000\u2019s Some Voices is also available on Prime. Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2020) Curzon Home Cinema, \u00a39.99 rental Are you craving a trip to the local independent cinema, like a 18th century lesbian craves the touch of her lover? Then this is the choice for you. Curzon brings the arthouse into our homes with the great C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s passionate film, a historical romance that asks burning questions about art and representation. A Quiet Place (2018) All4 If being indoors feels like hard work, imagine if you had to stay silent, too. That is the premise of this nerve-jangler, set in a world terrorised by sharp-eared aliens. It also takes credit for turning its married creator-stars, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, into the Richard &amp; Judy of sci-fi horror. EEJ * * * TV Ballers Now TV, five seasons There is never a bad time for an ass-kicking pep talk from Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. That is the core appeal of Ballers, in which the forklift-sized sweetheart plays a sports agent barking motivational advice at his coddled clients against an absurdly well-heeled backdrop. Even the appearance of Russell Brand can\u2019t disrupt the deluxe sheen. Dead Pixels All4, one season Struggling to stay in the same place for hours on end? Gamers have been managing to do it for years. That\u2019s why E4\u2019s byte-size sitcom about online gaming addicts serves as an invaluable primer on their world, as well as offering a concentrated blast of oddball characters and ribald gags. Time to stock up on Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cakes and energy drinks. Lost in Space Netflix, two seasons Crash-landing on an alluring but hostile alien planet with your mum and dad in tow sounds like the worst Center Parcs holiday ever. But Netflix\u2019s handsome reboot of the creaky 1960s serial is an exhilarating and life-affirming marvel, forcing its dysfunctional space family, the Robinsons (starring Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as the parents), through exotic hazards and old-school cliffhangers that require brains, guts and non-snarky communication to overcome. Race Across the World iPlayer, one season This enjoyably back-to-basics BBC Two reality show offers some vicarious street-level travel thrills via orienteering on a continental scale. Pairs of plucky pathfinders are tasked with navigating vast distances with meagre funds and no smartphones. Season one yomped from London to Singapore; the just-launched second season charts a course from Mexico to the tip of South America. Supernatural Amazon Prime Video, 13 seasons This post-Buffy perennial stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as the hunky Winchester brothers, criss-crossing the US in a battered Chevy duffing up demons as they go. Since 2005, it has been beloved by fans and utterly overlooked by everyone else. But with the 14th season about to launch on E4, now seems like the perfect time to go back to the start, watch all 200-odd hours and learn, once and for all, which one is Sam and which one is Dean.

Grimes: Miss Anthropocene (4AD) It\u2019s easy to spiral when worrying about world events. But why not take a leaf out of Grimes\u2019s book and flip the script? On her very good new album, she re-envisages the climate crisis as a vengeful goddess who has fun wreaking hell on Earth. Find creative potential and get world-building. Pop Smoke: Meet the Woo Vol 2 (Republic) Knock boredom away with this bassy, blown-out mixtape. Now, sadly, it stands as the last testament of the Brooklyn drill star-in-the-making Pop Smoke, who died last month on the cusp of becoming a superstar; his 2019 single Welcome to the Party will for ever rattle car windows in tribute to his curtailed genius. Tame Impala: The Slow Rush (Universal) The best albums can transport you to another world.

The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has talked of combating the \u201cinfodemic\u201d alongside the epidemic. The public panic is such that social media is alight with speculation, while newspaper websites run stories with sensational headlines because they attract unprecedented traffic.</p> <p>A fundamental part of my job over the last couple of months has been to sift the emerging information to discard rumour, mistakes, gossip and error. As well as writing my own stories, I am quite often asked to cast an eye over others, to make sure we are not just accurate, but calm and non-sensational. I have made three <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/04/how-to-slow-the-spread-of-coronavirus-video-explainer?CMP=share_btn_tw\">video explainers</a> and written others that have taken off in an unprecedented manner, because we try to be factual and non-scary.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy, because there is contradictory information even from the experts. Tedros recently talked of a death rate of 3.4%. Britain\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, some days later, gave evidence to MPs that it was 1% and, in his opinion, will probably prove to be lower. Both are probably correct.

Misinterpret a scientific paper about how coronavirus spreads and you have more to worry about than angry emails and a battering on Twitter. What is that death rate figure that scientist said? Is it the number of people who have died among the reported cases? Or is it the infection-fatality rate, the chances that an infected person will die? The difference matters.</p> <p>Interviews are less breezy these days, more laborious. You are constantly checking whether a simple phrase has a technical definition you\u2019re unaware of, or whether you have the right source and context for a number recalled over the phone.

But it is doubly important in covering the coronavirus outbreak, because it is the scientists and medical specialists who can best chart a way through this. Even if they don\u2019t always agree.</p> <h2><br>Lorenzo Tondo, Italy correspondent</h2> <p>At 9:46pm on 9 March, 2020, my life as a reporter, husband, father, brother and son radically changed. Just as Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced the entire country would be placed under lockdown in an attempt to stop the coronavirus, for the first time in my career I wasn\u2019t simply covering a crisis, I was living it alongside my family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Readers have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not have been aware of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a reporter, while my hands pecked at the keyboard, I felt the huge responsibility to inform readers in search of balanced news. On one hand I sensed the necessity to express the crude realities of the outbreak, of the thousands infected and hundreds dead; on the other, the need to explain, factually, that it was possible to stop the virus. It was a thin line between the need to inform and the obligation not to cause alarm.</p> <p>But the biggest responsibility, the most challenging task, was the emergency I found myself in as a father. It wasn\u2019t easy to explain the coronavirus outbreak to my six-year-old son, Leoluca, who won\u2019t be able to attend school or leave the house except in extreme cases. Once again I found myself having to explain the seriousness of the situation while remaining level-headed. I reminded my son of his idol, Spider-Man, and what his Uncle Ben said to him: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d \u201cYeah, dad. I know,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t have to jump around skyscrapers. All I have to do is stay home and wash my hands well.\u201d God bless him. It was easier than I thought.</p> <h2>Angela Giuffrida, Rome correspondent</h2> <p>It seems as if a lifetime has passed since that Saturday morning in January, when I was listening to an Irish resident in Wuhan speaking to LBC as news of the coronavirus outbreak in China emerged. He was describing life under quarantine, and how you only left your home to buy essentials \u201csuch as toilet roll\u201d. The situation seemed frightening, but very remote.</p> <p>As events unfolded, I followed the coverage of my colleague, Lily Kuo, in Beijing, all the while wondering how challenging it must have been for her to report the story in China while trying to keep healthy. But again, I never anticipated being in her shoes. Within a few short weeks, I have gone from writing about Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, which was initially confined to 11 northern towns, to living it.</p> <p>Reporting on this story has been among the most challenging of my career, not least because there are still so many unknowns about coronavirus. There is a huge sense of responsibility to tell the story correctly, but with not even the experts agreeing with each other, it has been a challenge to explain at times.</p> <p>We are fortunate that Italy has been transparent with data and swift in its actions. The government took coronavirus seriously from the beginning. Every day, the chief of the civil protection authority gives journalists a regional breakdown of new cases, deaths, those recovered and hospitalised. I also have a couple of trusted scientists to call for verifications as well as a team of colleagues at Rome\u2019s foreign press association, who have been invaluable in sharing their knowledge and experiences.</p> <h2><br>Ben Quinn, reporter</h2> <p>This has been one of the fastest-moving stories for as long as I can remember as a live blogger, demanding an unusual blend of international, political and science reporting as well as crowdsourcing and data analysis.</p> <p>In a story that\u2019s truly global, the Guardian\u2019s international network also really feels like it has come into its own, with our Australian office handing over to London and copy constantly coming in from reporters everywhere.</p> <p>But the very nature of the crisis has presented particular challenges too, such as in finding the right balance between covering the global picture and then knowing when and how much to drill down into localised and personal stories, while keeping them relevant to readers in a different part of the world.</p> <p>Given that our blog has really been global-facing by default, we\u2019ve also tried to take care, for example, to frame and explain specific British developments in a way that are coherent to readers elsewhere while also ensuring that readers in the UK get the depth of detail they expect.</p> <p>Readers themselves have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not otherwise have been aware of, or providing eyewitness accounts.</p> <p>Verification is obviously essential, and we\u2019re grateful to those who\u2019ve helped make this as easy as possible. That has involved, for example, something as simple as providing photos of boarding passes to help indicate that someone really is at an airport in Milan and can speak from experience about the impact of the Italian lockdown.</p> <p>Above all, as people find themselves with an unprecedented choice of information sources, we\u2019re still trying to make sure that we remain a calm and trustworthy source for the facts they need.</p> <p><br></p>",

The caretaker taoiseach and first minister met in Armagh as part of a wider delegation involving Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, who has been acting on Irish as well as EU modelling. The meeting came as the leader of the Catholic church in Ireland called on Northern Irish leaders to close all schools. He told Stormont\u2019s education minister, the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s Peter Weir, that \u201cwe need to fight this virus together\u201d. Also at the meeting were Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney, the health minister, Simon Harris, and his Stormont counterpart, Robin Swann. They met under the framework of the north-south ministerial council set up under the Good Friday agreement to promote consultation and cooperation across the island. The Stormont assembly was holding firm on the UK approach on Thursday when Varadkar announced, in an address to the nation from Washington, that schools would close. Splits emerged, however, between Foster and her deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, on Friday. O\u2019Neill, who is also Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Northern Ireland leader, called for schools to be closed. \u201cNow is the time for action\u201d and Northern Ireland should \u201cerr on the side of caution,\u201d she said. Arriving in Armagh for the meeting Varadkar said the issue was complicated because of the two jurisdictions, but that the virus did not respect borders. O\u2019Neill said the meeting was about people, not politics. Nine new coronavirus cases were recorded in Northern Ireland on Friday, bringing the total to 29. Three were community transmissions, the first recorded. Twenty new cases were reported in the republic, the second highest daily jump bringing the total to 90. Harris said on Friday that he had spoken to the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, before the announcement about the schools closure. More details of Ireland\u2019s contingency planning emerged on Saturday. It is looking for 10,000 beds for its worst-case scenario with the possibility of using hotel rooms, student accommodation halls and military sites. Dublin is also looking at releasing hundreds of prisoners as the Irish Prison Service warned of the significant challenges it faced containing the spread of the virus.",

But where there\u2019s a crisis, there\u2019s also a marketing opportunity. On Thursday Pornhub <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/13/pornhub-offers-free-premium-service-in-italy-to-ease-coronavirus-pains/\">announced</a> that it is giving everyone in Italy free access to its premium service for the rest of the month. The world\u2019s biggest porn site also said it will donate its March proceeds from Modelhub, one of its adult marketplaces, \u201cto support Italy during this unfortunate time\u201d.</p> <p>Pornhub\u2019s philanthropic division (yes, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/pornography-save-the-whales-sex-industry-philanthropist-conservation\">has one</a>) is good at pulling headline-grabbing stunts. It launched a <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/pornhub-bee-movie-aqua-conservation.html\">BeeSexual channel</a> to benefit honeybee conservation efforts; it ran a tree-planting scheme called Pornhub Gives America Wood; it tried to clean up plastic-filled beaches with a campaign called <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/45764/1/pornhub-wants-to-save-the-oceans-with-its-dirtiest-porn-ever-campaign\">Dirtiest Porn Ever</a>.</p> <p>While Pornhub has clearly given a lot of thought to smutty pun-based philanthropy, it doesn\u2019t seem to have put quite as much effort into ensuring its own business practices are ethical. The site is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/worlds-biggest-porn-site-under-fire-over-videos-pornhub\">currently facing serious allegations</a> of profiting from videos of rape and sexual abuse. Almost half a million people have signed <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/shut-down-pornhub-and-hold-its-executives-accountable-for-aiding-trafficking\">an online petition</a>, started by a group called Exodus Cry in the US, demanding that Pornhub be shut down and its executives held accountable for sex trafficking.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a company that is generating millions in advertising and membership revenue and yet they do not have an effective system in place to verify reliably the age or consent of those featured in the pornographic content it hosts,\u201d the Exodus Cry founder said.</p> <p>Pornhub vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement to the Guardian, the company said it \u201chas a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate\u201d.</p> <p>There have been rather a lot of suggestions otherwise. Kate Isaacs, the founder of Not Your Porn campaign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/pornhub-needs-to-change-or-shut-down\">recently wrote a Guardian op-ed</a> detailing how she\u2019d worked with \u201c50 women who were turned into \u2018porn stars\u2019 without their permission\u201d. Isaacs notes that some of these women were under 18 \u201cwhen videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Italy is facing a shortage of pasta \u2013 and a surplus of porn. More than 60 million people are currently under lockdown in Italy, which is dealing with Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of Covid-19. But where there\u2019s a crisis, there\u2019s also a marketing opportunity. On Thursday Pornhub announced that it is giving everyone in Italy free access to its premium service for the rest of the month. The world\u2019s biggest porn site also said it will donate its March proceeds from Modelhub, one of its adult marketplaces, \u201cto support Italy during this unfortunate time\u201d. Pornhub\u2019s philanthropic division (yes, it has one) is good at pulling headline-grabbing stunts. It launched a BeeSexual channel to benefit honeybee conservation efforts; it ran a tree-planting scheme called Pornhub Gives America Wood; it tried to clean up plastic-filled beaches with a campaign called Dirtiest Porn Ever. While Pornhub has clearly given a lot of thought to smutty pun-based philanthropy, it doesn\u2019t seem to have put quite as much effort into ensuring its own business practices are ethical. The site is currently facing serious allegations of profiting from videos of rape and sexual abuse. Almost half a million people have signed an online petition, started by a group called Exodus Cry in the US, demanding that Pornhub be shut down and its executives held accountable for sex trafficking. \u201cThis is a company that is generating millions in advertising and membership revenue and yet they do not have an effective system in place to verify reliably the age or consent of those featured in the pornographic content it hosts,\u201d the Exodus Cry founder said. Pornhub vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement to the Guardian, the company said it \u201chas a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate\u201d. There have been rather a lot of suggestions otherwise. Kate Isaacs, the founder of Not Your Porn campaign, recently wrote a Guardian op-ed detailing how she\u2019d worked with \u201c50 women who were turned into \u2018porn stars\u2019 without their permission\u201d. Isaacs notes that some of these women were under 18 \u201cwhen videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent\u201d. It took Pornhub weeks to get a video of one of Isaacs\u2019 friends removed; \u201cWhen one video had been removed, an identical video with her full name attached would pop back up again.\u201d Pornhub claims that it is simple for victims of non-consensual porn to request that videos be removed from its website; flagged videos are then \u201cfingerprinted\u201d to prevent future uploads. A recent investigation by Motherboard (part of Vice), however, found that this system can be easily circumvented. The investigation notes that Pornhub\u2019s current method for removing non-consensual porn \u201cnot only puts the onus of finding and flagging videos almost entirely on potentially-traumatized victims \u2013 those victims can\u2019t even rely on the system to work\u201d. While Pornhub may argue it has a \u201csteadfast commitment\u201d to eradicating non-consensual content, there\u2019s clearly a lot of room for it to do better. Instead of trying to take on the coronavirus, it would do well to focus on its own pandemic of revenge porn. \u2018The web is not working for women and girls\u2019 The inventor of the world wide web has urged companies and governments to tackle misogynistic online abuse.

Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years The convicted rapist doesn\u2019t seem to understand he did anything wrong. \u201cI\u2019m totally confused,\u201d Weinstein said at his sentencing. \u201cI think men are confused about these issues.\u201d I guess he has time to think about it now. Converse launching a gender-neutral clothes line It\u2019s called Converse Shapes and the clothes are designed for body types rather than gender. Women are (horse)racing ahead Last year female jockeys outperformed their male counterparts. US Soccer Federation president resigns after misogyny row Women just aren\u2019t as good as men, according to court filings by the US Soccer Federation in an ongoing gender discrimination lawsuit. On Thursday, Carlos Cordeiro, the federation\u2019s president, resigned following a backlash from fans, players and sponsors over the misogynistic filings. Former USWNT midfielder Cindy Parlow Cone will become the first female president in the history of the federation. \u2018Setting my Tinder to Wuhan so I can get the real scoop on what\u2019s going on\u2019 Tinder has become a coronavirus news service. As the virus spreads around the world, dating app users are setting their location to Wuhan to learn more about life in the initial focus of the epidemic. Sarah Palin raps Baby Got Back dressed as a furry bear Quite a few jaws dropped on Thursday when the former Republican governor appeared in a purple and pink bear costume on TV show The Masked Singer.

      "bodyText": "Jet2 planes heading to Spain turned back in mid-air on Saturday as the airline cancelled all flights to the country because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision follows a sharp increase in infections in Spain and a rise in the death toll to 120. The government has declared a two-week state of emergency and placed 60,000 people in four towns under mandatory lockdown on Friday. The airline, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, M\u00e1laga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands immediately. Jet2 said in statement: \u201cIn response to local measures introduced throughout Spain to prevent the spread of Covid-19, including the closure of bars, restaurants, shops and activities including any water sports, we have taken the decision to cancel all flights \u2026 with immediate effect. \u201cWe know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 holidays, which is why we have taken this decision.

The health and safety of our customers is our number one priority, and we would like to thank our customers for their understanding.\u201d Jet2\u2019s decision came after LOT Polish Airlines suspended all flights from Poland and Hungary for 10 days from 15 March. The coronavirus outbreak has had a dramatic effect on air travel. British Airways has told its staff that it expects to make job cuts and cancel an unprecedented number of flights. Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral ban to the US from Europe is expected to affect 13,500 flights and 4 million passengers over the next four weeks, according to the aviation analysts OAG.",

While it\u2019s not heaving, New York is definitely not a ghost town. There are people milling around and tourists lining up as usual to take selfies with the Charging Bull, the bronze sculpture which sums up the spirit of nearby Wall Street.</p> <p>The first person I encounter is Tim Lamch, 38, who with a huge bag on his back and pushing a fully loaded drinks trolley, makes a surreal sight. Is this coronavirus related?</p> <p>\u201cI just happen to be moving during coronavirus,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m only moving two blocks.\u201d</p> <p>The account executive, currently working from home because of the virus, says it\u2019s busier than he had anticipated.</p> <p>\u201cPeople need to be out. People don\u2019t want to be cooped up and people still have to work. Not everyone can work from home.\u201d</p> <p>At the bull, tourist Liliana Oropeza, 44, is lining up with her husband and 10-year-old son. The family, from Monterrey, Mexico, are trying to make the best of the situation but so far, she says, their holiday has been \u201cawful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe bought tickets and can\u2019t use them because the museums are closed.

But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus\u2019s impact on small businesses becomes clear.</p> <p>At Thai Street Food, a food truck outside Trinity Church, co-owner Sony Ramirez, 35, from Queens, says business has dropped by 50% because many offices have closed. The truck\u2019s one waiting customer chimes in: \u201cNormally I see a line here. Today I\u2019m the only one.\u201d</p> <p>Ramirez adds: \u201cI\u2019m worried because I have to work. I need to take care of many people.\u201d</p> <p>Further up, there\u2019s a line of food trucks. It\u2019s 12.30pm but none have more than one customer. Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck.</p> <p>\u201cI came at 4.30am and nobody [came] until 6am. Business is no good. No business at all.\u201d</p> <p>Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered \u201chappy new year\u201d headband, sits, his merchandise unbought.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s suffering now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69/0_58_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big \u201cFridays for Future\u201d flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens.</p> <p>As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it\u2019s hand sanitizer people want \u2013 a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: \u201cMasks sold here.\u201d</p> <p>In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she \u201chad a panic attack over a runny nose\u201d. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face.</p> <p>I veer off Broadway for Chinatown, where Kong Wah Bakery\u2019s manager, Sam Chung, says business is down by 50% and staff are working half-days.</p> <p>Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has \u201cdefinitely got a different vibe\u201d.</p> <p>In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they\u2019ve got stocked up.</p> <p>In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal \u2013 people are playing chess at tables, there\u2019s music, the farmers\u2019 market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn\u2019t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not normal times,\u201d he says, in muffled tones.</p> <p>At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun. But the atmosphere is distinctly lacking in Friday buzz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6704454675cfd2054c5e431b0c787f707746421e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6704454675cfd2054c5e431b0c787f707746421e/0_247_7402_4441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk through Times Square on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk through Times Square on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Pendzich/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Times Square I\u2019m greeted by Elmo, Lady Liberty and Spiderman. Unusually, they don\u2019t seem to be able to entice anybody near them. Finally, a man walking into Walgreens agrees, elbow bumping Lady Liberty as Elmo takes a photo, before ambling back in to do his shopping. A solitary man dances to the soundtrack of his AirPods.</p> <p>On the steps, usually packed with tourists, there is plenty of breathing room. British tourists, Dan Hase, 33, and Claire Hase, 30, from Newcastle, are visiting New York for the first time. They are understandably disappointed. After arriving on Wednesday night, they went to see The Lion King only to find all Broadway performances had been cancelled and many of the attractions on the three-day pass they bought are closed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a letdown,\u201d says Dan.</p> <p>It is at West 44th street, where lots of theatres \u2013 including St James\u2019s, currently home to the Frozen musical, and the Shubert, showing To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 that I find the most haunting scene of the day.</p> <p>The road is usually full of people queuing to get in, gathering during intervals, taxis dropping people off, red ropes for premieres. Now, it is almost completely empty.</p> <p>A few people are in the box offices, optimistically booking tickets for brighter times. But on the street it\u2019s so quiet that all I can hear is a plastic food container \u2013 New York tumbleweed \u2013 blowing down the street.</p>",

Other than that, and the presence of a few face masks and latex gloves, everything appears relatively normal. Above ground, it\u2019s grey and mild. While it\u2019s not heaving, New York is definitely not a ghost town. There are people milling around and tourists lining up as usual to take selfies with the Charging Bull, the bronze sculpture which sums up the spirit of nearby Wall Street. The first person I encounter is Tim Lamch, 38, who with a huge bag on his back and pushing a fully loaded drinks trolley, makes a surreal sight. Is this coronavirus related? \u201cI just happen to be moving during coronavirus,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m only moving two blocks.\u201d The account executive, currently working from home because of the virus, says it\u2019s busier than he had anticipated. \u201cPeople need to be out. People don\u2019t want to be cooped up and people still have to work. Not everyone can work from home.\u201d At the bull, tourist Liliana Oropeza, 44, is lining up with her husband and 10-year-old son. The family, from Monterrey, Mexico, are trying to make the best of the situation but so far, she says, their holiday has been \u201cawful\u201d. \u201cWe bought tickets and can\u2019t use them because the museums are closed. We are trying to move our flight home to maybe Monday.\u201d On the streets, people are more polite than usual \u2013 apologising if they bump into each other, avoiding physical contact. A steady trickle of people are coming out of the New York Stock Exchange, to go get their lunch. But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus\u2019s impact on small businesses becomes clear. At Thai Street Food, a food truck outside Trinity Church, co-owner Sony Ramirez, 35, from Queens, says business has dropped by 50% because many offices have closed. The truck\u2019s one waiting customer chimes in: \u201cNormally I see a line here. Today I\u2019m the only one.\u201d Ramirez adds: \u201cI\u2019m worried because I have to work. I need to take care of many people.\u201d Further up, there\u2019s a line of food trucks. It\u2019s 12.30pm but none have more than one customer. Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck. \u201cI came at 4.30am and nobody [came] until 6am. Business is no good. No business at all.\u201d Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered \u201chappy new year\u201d headband, sits, his merchandise unbought. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s suffering now.\u201d By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big \u201cFridays for Future\u201d flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens. As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it\u2019s hand sanitizer people want \u2013 a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: \u201cMasks sold here.\u201d In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she \u201chad a panic attack over a runny nose\u201d. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face. I veer off Broadway for Chinatown, where Kong Wah Bakery\u2019s manager, Sam Chung, says business is down by 50% and staff are working half-days. Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has \u201cdefinitely got a different vibe\u201d. In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they\u2019ve got stocked up. In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal \u2013 people are playing chess at tables, there\u2019s music, the farmers\u2019 market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn\u2019t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health. \u201cThese are not normal times,\u201d he says, in muffled tones. At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun. But the atmosphere is distinctly lacking in Friday buzz. At Times Square I\u2019m greeted by Elmo, Lady Liberty and Spiderman. Unusually, they don\u2019t seem to be able to entice anybody near them. Finally, a man walking into Walgreens agrees, elbow bumping Lady Liberty as Elmo takes a photo, before ambling back in to do his shopping. A solitary man dances to the soundtrack of his AirPods. On the steps, usually packed with tourists, there is plenty of breathing room. British tourists, Dan Hase, 33, and Claire Hase, 30, from Newcastle, are visiting New York for the first time. They are understandably disappointed. After arriving on Wednesday night, they went to see The Lion King only to find all Broadway performances had been cancelled and many of the attractions on the three-day pass they bought are closed. \u201cIt was a bit of a letdown,\u201d says Dan. It is at West 44th street, where lots of theatres \u2013 including St James\u2019s, currently home to the Frozen musical, and the Shubert, showing To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 that I find the most haunting scene of the day. The road is usually full of people queuing to get in, gathering during intervals, taxis dropping people off, red ropes for premieres. Now, it is almost completely empty. A few people are in the box offices, optimistically booking tickets for brighter times. But on the street it\u2019s so quiet that all I can hear is a plastic food container \u2013 New York tumbleweed \u2013 blowing down the street.",

In Cornwall a charity has recruited 50 people to assist those without family or friends to turn to for help. Local support groups are being set up hourly across the UK on Facebook and other social media.</p> <p>Moon\u2019s initiative is wholeheartedly supported by the local authority, Bridgend council. Huw David, the council\u2019s leader, is considering how the group could be replicated elsewhere in the county. \u201cThe outbreak is the biggest public health crisis in generations,\u201d he says. \u201cAt its peak we won\u2019t necessarily have staff available to meet the needs of every vulnerable person or check they are OK, so it will be very helpful to have volunteers available.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8c1742eed8ed4c1a677f37ab1475b047ed46e164\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c1742eed8ed4c1a677f37ab1475b047ed46e164/520_405_2422_3027/800.jpg\" alt=\"Madeleine Moon, former Labour MP for Bridgend.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madeleine Moon, former Labour MP for Bridgend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McAndrew/UK Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A decade of austerity has left councils across the UK with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/25/former-red-wall-areas-could-lose-millions-in-council-funding-review\" title=\"\">fewer staff and resources</a> to deal with emergencies such as coronavirus. In Wales, councils have lost 20% of their funding and at least 28,000 posts since 2010. \u201cIt will be difficult for most authorities because we don\u2019t have as many staff as we had in the past,\u201d says David. \u201cBut given the possible extent of the outbreak, it would still have been challenging.\u201d</p> <p>Other Welsh councils also anticipate having to call on volunteers as hospital wards fill up and doctors\u2019 surgeries find themselves inundated. In Monmouthshire the council is considering launching a major publicity campaign to encourage members of the public to come forward.</p> <p>\u201cWe are really going to have to look at getting people in to help us who are not qualified,\u201d says Penny Jones, Monmouthshire\u2019s cabinet member for social services. \u201cWe are going to use anybody and everybody we can.\u201d</p> <p>The Local Government Association (LGA) is not aware of similar steps being taken by English local authorities but their Welsh counterparts are planning on recruiting large numbers of volunteers. Council leaders and cabinet members discussed the idea with the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, last week.</p> <p>David, who is also the Welsh LGA\u2019s health spokesperson, says: \u201cThe situation is evolving very quickly and we will arrive at a position where we will want to call on an army of volunteers.\u201d But he adds that they will need to be trained to keep themselves and others safe, with deliveries left on doorsteps and conversations carried out over the phone to avoid close personal contact.</p> <p>Moon is still firming up the arrangements in Porthcawl. A local GP has agreed to pass on the group\u2019s contact details to vulnerable people who have to self-isolate. \u201cThe aim is to ensure that the surgery doesn\u2019t get blocked up with people who don\u2019t know how they are going to get their medicine or have run out of food or just need to talk to someone to get some reassurance,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe idea is that we shoulder that as a community.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The aim is to ensure that the surgery doesn\u2019t get blocked up with people</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Moon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many care homes across the UK are meanwhile going far beyond the official advice that healthy older people do not need to self-isolate yet.

      "bodyText": "The former Labour MP Madeleine Moon is on a mission to ensure vulnerable elderly people confined to their homes by coronavirus in Porthcawl are not forgotten. The 69-year-old is pulling together a team volunteers in her former south Wales constituency to drop off essentials and offer emotional support over the phone to people in isolation, relieving some of the pressure on local GPs and the NHS. \u201cThere is a growing sense of panic,\u201d Moon says. \u201cFor the older demographic, certainty there is a feeling that nobody is worrying about them \u2013 that they can be discarded. We are not going to let that happen in this small town.\u201d She is not alone in making preparations. Across the country, groups of volunteers are starting to come together ahead of the virus peaking, which is likely to lead to many thousands of people falling ill; others are likely to be fearful of leaving their homes for long periods. In Shropshire a medical centre has organised volunteers to collect groceries for its most vulnerable patients during the outbreak, which could last months. In Cornwall a charity has recruited 50 people to assist those without family or friends to turn to for help. Local support groups are being set up hourly across the UK on Facebook and other social media. Moon\u2019s initiative is wholeheartedly supported by the local authority, Bridgend council. Huw David, the council\u2019s leader, is considering how the group could be replicated elsewhere in the county. \u201cThe outbreak is the biggest public health crisis in generations,\u201d he says. \u201cAt its peak we won\u2019t necessarily have staff available to meet the needs of every vulnerable person or check they are OK, so it will be very helpful to have volunteers available.\u201d A decade of austerity has left councils across the UK with fewer staff and resources to deal with emergencies such as coronavirus. In Wales, councils have lost 20% of their funding and at least 28,000 posts since 2010. \u201cIt will be difficult for most authorities because we don\u2019t have as many staff as we had in the past,\u201d says David. \u201cBut given the possible extent of the outbreak, it would still have been challenging.\u201d Other Welsh councils also anticipate having to call on volunteers as hospital wards fill up and doctors\u2019 surgeries find themselves inundated. In Monmouthshire the council is considering launching a major publicity campaign to encourage members of the public to come forward. \u201cWe are really going to have to look at getting people in to help us who are not qualified,\u201d says Penny Jones, Monmouthshire\u2019s cabinet member for social services. \u201cWe are going to use anybody and everybody we can.\u201d The Local Government Association (LGA) is not aware of similar steps being taken by English local authorities but their Welsh counterparts are planning on recruiting large numbers of volunteers. Council leaders and cabinet members discussed the idea with the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, last week. David, who is also the Welsh LGA\u2019s health spokesperson, says: \u201cThe situation is evolving very quickly and we will arrive at a position where we will want to call on an army of volunteers.\u201d But he adds that they will need to be trained to keep themselves and others safe, with deliveries left on doorsteps and conversations carried out over the phone to avoid close personal contact. Moon is still firming up the arrangements in Porthcawl. A local GP has agreed to pass on the group\u2019s contact details to vulnerable people who have to self-isolate. \u201cThe aim is to ensure that the surgery doesn\u2019t get blocked up with people who don\u2019t know how they are going to get their medicine or have run out of food or just need to talk to someone to get some reassurance,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe idea is that we shoulder that as a community.\u201d Many care homes across the UK are meanwhile going far beyond the official advice that healthy older people do not need to self-isolate yet. Some are closing their doors to all visits from family and friends; others are allowing only essential visits for people near the end of their lives. \u201cProviders will do what they think is right for their businesses and for the people they look after,\u201d says Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents the majority of care homes in the UK. Stonehaven Care Group is banning all visitors apart from medical professionals from its 10 care homes in the south-west. \u201cWe are desperate for some government guidance,\u201d says Nick Connors, the group\u2019s managing director. \u201cUltimately we are putting the safety of our staff and residents first and foremost.\u201d He added that Skype would be made available to ensure residents could stay in touch with relatives and friends where possible. In the north-west, Borough Care put all its 11 homes into indefinite isolation on Friday, so family and friends cannot visit. Tracey Halstead from the company says it took the decision to keep residents safe: \u201cIt is a precautionary measure. It has the support of families. We have not had any negative feedback.\u201d Emergency measures due to be announced this week by the government are reported to include allowing councils to lower standards in care homes to deal with staff shortages, so long as these do not lead to \u201cserious neglect or harm\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. Speaking after a seven-hour cabinet meeting on Saturday evening, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d needed to be taken as Spain grappled with a \u201chealth, social and economic crisis\u201d. Spain is the country most affected by the coronavirus in Europe after Italy, and has so far confirmed 6,251 cases and 193 deaths. Italy has already taken similar measures. S\u00e1nchez said the central government would direct the response and that all the local, national and regional police forces would come under the command of the interior ministry. He also said that the army was standing by and ready to help with the emergency response. The prime minister confirmed that people would be required to stay home and that all non-essential shops would close, along with bars, restaurants, cafes and cinemas. Supermarkets, small food shops, pharmacies, petrols stations and pet supply shops are among those businesses that will remain open. He said: \u201cDuring the state of emergency, people will only be allowed out on to public streets for the following reasons: to buy food, basic or pharmaceutical items; to attend medical centres; to go to and from work; to look after children, older people or those with disabilities or who are especially vulnerable; and to attend financial or insurance offices on force majeure grounds.\u201d S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that the measures needed to tackle the coronavirus would have a \u201cbig economic impact\u201d but said the government was committed to mitigating its effects. The emergency powers, set out in article 116 of the constitution, have not been used since 2010, when the article was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\u2019 strike. The state of emergency will initially apply for a fortnight, but can be extended with parliamentary approval. Opponents have criticised S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialist-led coalition government for its delay in rolling out robust measures to fight the virus and for allowing huge rallies across the country last Sunday to mark International Women\u2019s Day. As news of the decree leaked out on Saturday afternoon, the regional governments of Catalonia and the Basque country claimed the central government\u2019s use of the drastic powers could undermine their autonomy, while the Andaluc\u00edan premier accused S\u00e1nchez and his partners in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance of squabbling when they should have been tackling the crisis. The prime minister addressed the criticisms in Saturday night\u2019s speech, in which he pointedly called on the leaders of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions to work together for the health and safety of all Spaniards. \u201cEach and every one of the regional presidents needs to put aside their differences, get behind the Spanish government and focus on our only mission \u2013 which is working together to beat the virus,\u201d he said. Schools and universities are already shut across Spain, and the measures contained in the emergency decree come after the regional governments of Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias had already ordered the closure of all non-essential shops. Bars, cafes, restaurants and cinemas in and around the capital closed on Saturday morning, while Madrid\u2019s city council announced that all public parks and gardens would close from Saturday afternoon to prevent large concentrations of people. Meanwhile, the Andaluc\u00edan cities of Seville, Granada and C\u00f3rdoba abandoned their famous Holy Week celebrations after consultation with religious authorities. The cancellation of the spectacular but sombre Holy Week parades, which draw huge crowds of foreign visitors, comes as tourist bookings plummet. Jet2, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, M\u00e1laga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.",

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland schools will be closed for at least 16 weeks, but they will not be shutting immediately, the region\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, has said after a meeting with Ireland\u2019s caretaker taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. The disclosure gives a glimpse of the scale of coronavirus crisis to come and will lead to questions about whether a four-month schools closure is being planned for the rest of the UK. Foster confirmed that schools in Northern Ireland would close at some point in an effort to stem the spread of the virus, but said it was a matter of timing. \u201cI am taking my advice from the Northern Ireland chief medical officer. He is advising schools should not close yet\u201d but schools and parents should prepare for closure, she said. \u201cI think they will be closed for at least 16 weeks.\u201d Foster was under pressure to close schools in line with the republic of Ireland\u2019s decision last week but said she was taking the continued advice of the Northern Ireland chief medical officer, Michael McBride. A four-month closure will impose a huge burden on the economy with parents forced to find a way to work at home and schools suddenly trying to launch a whole term of remote learning. It will also raise questions about the viability of exams in May and June. Foster was speaking after a meeting with Varadkar to discuss a cross-border approach to combating coronavirus. Also at the meeting were their deputies, Michelle O\u2019Neill and Simon Coveney, and the two executives\u2019 health ministers and chief medical officers. At a press conference, she said the cooperation between the two sides \u201ccould not be any better\u201d. Varakdar said Covid-19 was an illness that knows no borders, as administrations on either side of the border follow different strategies. \u201cThere is very good cooperation already between the chief medical officers and the government and the executive. There will be differences of approach over the next few weeks and months; we are different jurisdictions \u2026 but the differences that exist are mostly around timing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what isn\u2019t different is our common objective, which is to slow down the virus in its tracks, push it back.\u201d The two leaders discussed school closures, travel and supply chains at the meeting, which was convened under the north-south ministerial council framework mandated by the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. Both Simon Harris, the Irish health minister, and his counterpart in the Northern Ireland executive, Robin Swann, said it would be wrong for the public to think that governments could make big or bold decisions to protect the public against coronavirus. The most effective measure was for the public to be compliant and change their behaviour, said Swann. Coveney said he had issued advice to Irish nationals on Friday night to be cautious about travelling to the rest of the EU, but that this did not include the UK. In a joint statement after the meeting, the Irish governments said: \u201cIt was agreed that everything possible will be done in coordination and cooperation between the Irish government and the Northern Ireland executive and with the active involvement of the health administrations in both jurisdictions to tackle the outbreak. Protection of the lives and welfare of everyone on the island is paramount, and no effort will be spared in that regard.\u201d Nine new coronavirus cases were recorded in Northern Ireland on Friday, bringing the total to 29. Three were community transmissions, the first recorded. Twenty new cases were reported in the republic, the second highest daily jump, bringing the total to 90.",

      "body": "<p>On 15 February the director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, addressed <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/munich-security-conference\" title=\"\">the Munich Security conference.</a> At that moment, there were 66,000 cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> in China, and only 505 in the rest of the world. So most of us were probably still assuming that this was predominately a Chinese problem. This view was not shared by the WHO director-general. He was also concerned about: the lack of urgency in the international community; the severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment, which was putting health workers at risk; the levels of rumours and misinformation that were hampering the response; and the havoc the virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.</p> <p>The part of his speech that made me sit up, though, was this: \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.\u201d And if we don\u2019t tackle this, he went on, \u201cwe are headed down a dark path that leads nowhere but division and disharmony\u201d.</p> <p>As if to underscore that point, up popped two stories this week. The first was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/coronavirus-riots-social-media-ukraine\" title=\"\">a Buzzfeed report</a> of what mis- and disinformation did to a small Ukrainian village. Two days of chaos and riots illustrated what can happen when people don\u2019t trust their government but instead believe rumours and misinformation spread on social media. On 18 February a plane from Wuhan, China, had arrived in the country, and rumours started circulating that several of the 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals on board were infected with Covid-19. Upon landing, they were to be immediately bused to an undisclosed medical facility. A government announcement said that the evacuees had all been tested and none of them were infected. So there was nothing to worry about.</p> <p>But, Buzzfeed reports, in the small town of Novi Sanzhary, residents went beserk when they discovered that the evacuees were going to be housed in their local sanatorium. Barricades were erected and fires set to try to keep the buses carrying the evacuees out of town. Protesters were met by phalanxes of police in riot gear who arrived with armoured vehicles to push them back. Tensions escalated, violent clashes broke out.

      "bodyText": "On 15 February the director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, addressed the Munich Security conference. At that moment, there were 66,000 cases of Covid-19 in China, and only 505 in the rest of the world. So most of us were probably still assuming that this was predominately a Chinese problem. This view was not shared by the WHO director-general. He was also concerned about: the lack of urgency in the international community; the severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment, which was putting health workers at risk; the levels of rumours and misinformation that were hampering the response; and the havoc the virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems. The part of his speech that made me sit up, though, was this: \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.\u201d And if we don\u2019t tackle this, he went on, \u201cwe are headed down a dark path that leads nowhere but division and disharmony\u201d. As if to underscore that point, up popped two stories this week. The first was a Buzzfeed report of what mis- and disinformation did to a small Ukrainian village. Two days of chaos and riots illustrated what can happen when people don\u2019t trust their government but instead believe rumours and misinformation spread on social media. On 18 February a plane from Wuhan, China, had arrived in the country, and rumours started circulating that several of the 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals on board were infected with Covid-19. Upon landing, they were to be immediately bused to an undisclosed medical facility. A government announcement said that the evacuees had all been tested and none of them were infected. So there was nothing to worry about. But, Buzzfeed reports, in the small town of Novi Sanzhary, residents went beserk when they discovered that the evacuees were going to be housed in their local sanatorium. Barricades were erected and fires set to try to keep the buses carrying the evacuees out of town. Protesters were met by phalanxes of police in riot gear who arrived with armoured vehicles to push them back. Tensions escalated, violent clashes broke out. And when the buses carrying people from China finally arrived, residents shouted at them to \u201cget out\u201d and hurled stones that shattered the windows. The second story concerned polarisation. Some polling research in the US last week showed that Democrats and Republicans have starkly divergent views on the danger that the virus poses, and on how the Trump administration is handling it: 43% of respondents approve of Trump\u2019s response to Covid-19, while 49% disapprove. But the divide falls largely along party lines \u2013 83% of Democrats disapprove of Trump\u2019s response, while 87% of Republicans approve, and two-thirds of Democrats are \u201cvery or somewhat concerned\u201d about the virus, compared with just 35% of Republicans. Clearly Republicans don\u2019t yet realise that the Covid-19 is no respecter of party affiliations.

      "body": "<p>The other night, in a restaurant, two friends of mine confessed, in the face of growing alarm over the coronavirus, to having indulged in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/02/uk-supermarkets-braced-for-stockpiling-if-coronavirus-escalates-panic-buying\" title=\"\">a little light stockpiling</a>. Bright-eyed, if not absolutely zealous, they spoke of tinned haricot beans as the future, and of fresh orange juice as (RIP) the past. After this, someone made a joke about scurvy, at which everyone laughed rather too loudly. But the moment swiftly passed. Our dinner \u2013 beef with roast potatoes and hispi cabbage \u2013 had begun arriving at our table in quantities generous enough that our talk had suddenly started to seem a bit ludicrous.</p> <p>On the way home, I laughed about this: how we love a drama. If I could have remembered it, I would have hummed the theme to <em>Survivors</em>, the 70s TV show about a plague that has spread across the world thanks to air travel. But the next day, it was my turn to start worrying about vitamin tablets and shelf lives. At Ocado, Britain\u2019s biggest online supermarket, shares had apparently jumped thanks to the fact that so many customers were placing <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-ocado-group/british-online-supermarket-ocado-sees-orders-leap-as-coronavirus-spreads-idUKKBN20P2E3\" title=\"\">\u201cparticularly large\u201d</a> orders. Delivery slots were selling out. Suddenly, I was receiving the message with zero distortion: basically, only a fool would risk having to go into a 14-day quarantine without ready supplies of \u2013 we\u2019re talking about Ocado here! \u2013 organic couscous and those new-fangled bags of frozen avocado I\u2019ve seen advertised.</p> <p>Ever since, I\u2019ve found myself wondering whether, whatever else it achieves, Covid-19 will come to have a permanent effect on shopping habits. I think it will certainly lead to an increased interest in vegetarianism. But might it also succeed where Ocado, Tesco and others have seemingly failed, by getting more people to try online shopping, and thus to convince them that it isn\u2019t, after all, such a bad idea? For this \u2013 that it\u2019s a bad idea \u2013 is what a lot of people do indeed seem to think. A decade ago, it was thought that 40% of the grocery market would have moved online by 2025. Last month, however, one industry body revised this figure downwards to just 7.7% by 2024. Unlike the rest of the high street, growth at supermarkets lies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/12/morrisons-cheapest-supermarket-for-online-shopping-says-which\" title=\"\">not in online shopping</a>, but in convenience stores, and discounters such as Lidl and Aldi, which do not deliver.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one could be a pickier shopper than me. But buying online gives me the gift of time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To be honest, I was much more amazed by this fact than I was by the revelation that people I know are hoarding fusilli. No one could be a pickier shopper than me: I\u2019ve only to see a melon to sniff it. And yet, I always shop online now. There are still things I only buy in my local shops \u2013 croissants, cheese, salad, herbs \u2013 and our milk is delivered in glass bottles. For everything else, however, I get out my laptop. This saves me money \u2013 I make fewer impulse buys online \u2013 and it means, too, that I don\u2019t use my car for a short journey (to be as green as possible, I only book a delivery if the van is already in my area). Above all, it gives me the gift of time. I can order my shopping in hotel rooms when I\u2019m working away, or at home late at night, and this has changed my life to the point where bricks and mortar supermarkets have become almost alien to me. I can\u2019t seem to navigate them any more.</p> <p>Earlier this year, I walked around a Co-op, dazed and slightly confused, wondering where the nutmeg was, and longing all the while for my virtual basket. At the till, I kept having to run back for things \u2013 items my online account would have reminded me I needed, and which I was going to struggle to carry anyway. I was in Yorkshire, and the woman serving me was patient and lovely. But for all that I\u2019m a deracinated northerner, I found to my surprise that her accent was not much more comforting to me at this point in my life than another all-too-familiar sound: that of plastic boxes being humped from van to pavement. Thunk, thunk they go \u2013 a noise that turns my thoughts inevitably to supper and, just lately, to my own (I admit it) nascent stockpile. It is rather teabag heavy at the moment. Nevertheless, it grows exponentially, with every other unsettling headline.</p> <p><em>rachel.cooke@observer.co.uk</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The other night, in a restaurant, two friends of mine confessed, in the face of growing alarm over the coronavirus, to having indulged in a little light stockpiling. Bright-eyed, if not absolutely zealous, they spoke of tinned haricot beans as the future, and of fresh orange juice as (RIP) the past. After this, someone made a joke about scurvy, at which everyone laughed rather too loudly. But the moment swiftly passed. Our dinner \u2013 beef with roast potatoes and hispi cabbage \u2013 had begun arriving at our table in quantities generous enough that our talk had suddenly started to seem a bit ludicrous. On the way home, I laughed about this: how we love a drama. If I could have remembered it, I would have hummed the theme to Survivors, the 70s TV show about a plague that has spread across the world thanks to air travel. But the next day, it was my turn to start worrying about vitamin tablets and shelf lives. At Ocado, Britain\u2019s biggest online supermarket, shares had apparently jumped thanks to the fact that so many customers were placing \u201cparticularly large\u201d orders. Delivery slots were selling out. Suddenly, I was receiving the message with zero distortion: basically, only a fool would risk having to go into a 14-day quarantine without ready supplies of \u2013 we\u2019re talking about Ocado here! \u2013 organic couscous and those new-fangled bags of frozen avocado I\u2019ve seen advertised. Ever since, I\u2019ve found myself wondering whether, whatever else it achieves, Covid-19 will come to have a permanent effect on shopping habits. I think it will certainly lead to an increased interest in vegetarianism. But might it also succeed where Ocado, Tesco and others have seemingly failed, by getting more people to try online shopping, and thus to convince them that it isn\u2019t, after all, such a bad idea? For this \u2013 that it\u2019s a bad idea \u2013 is what a lot of people do indeed seem to think. A decade ago, it was thought that 40% of the grocery market would have moved online by 2025. Last month, however, one industry body revised this figure downwards to just 7.7% by 2024. Unlike the rest of the high street, growth at supermarkets lies not in online shopping, but in convenience stores, and discounters such as Lidl and Aldi, which do not deliver. To be honest, I was much more amazed by this fact than I was by the revelation that people I know are hoarding fusilli. No one could be a pickier shopper than me: I\u2019ve only to see a melon to sniff it. And yet, I always shop online now. There are still things I only buy in my local shops \u2013 croissants, cheese, salad, herbs \u2013 and our milk is delivered in glass bottles. For everything else, however, I get out my laptop. This saves me money \u2013 I make fewer impulse buys online \u2013 and it means, too, that I don\u2019t use my car for a short journey (to be as green as possible, I only book a delivery if the van is already in my area). Above all, it gives me the gift of time. I can order my shopping in hotel rooms when I\u2019m working away, or at home late at night, and this has changed my life to the point where bricks and mortar supermarkets have become almost alien to me. I can\u2019t seem to navigate them any more. Earlier this year, I walked around a Co-op, dazed and slightly confused, wondering where the nutmeg was, and longing all the while for my virtual basket. At the till, I kept having to run back for things \u2013 items my online account would have reminded me I needed, and which I was going to struggle to carry anyway. I was in Yorkshire, and the woman serving me was patient and lovely. But for all that I\u2019m a deracinated northerner, I found to my surprise that her accent was not much more comforting to me at this point in my life than another all-too-familiar sound: that of plastic boxes being humped from van to pavement. Thunk, thunk they go \u2013 a noise that turns my thoughts inevitably to supper and, just lately, to my own (I admit it) nascent stockpile. It is rather teabag heavy at the moment. Nevertheless, it grows exponentially, with every other unsettling headline. rachel.cooke@observer.co.uk",

Or bed. \u201cOne time I had a woman on the call in a spaghetti strap tank top,\u201d says technology executive Amy Bailey. She manages a team of 10 remote workers from her home in California. Video conferencing technology is integral to her job: her team could not function without their daily morning video call. \u201cI said: \u2018I know you\u2019re at home, but we can see a bit too much. Put a blouse on!\u2019\u201d As the coronavirus epidemic continues, more of us will be working from home.

But evidence suggests that the restrictions only work if used strategically, in conjunction with other containment measures.</p> <p>But \u201cour response to this pandemic has been late, and our response has been inconsistent,\u201d Ompad said. Notably, the US isn\u2019t able to test most people who enter the country, let alone those living within its borders due to ongoing shortages of test kits. Although the administration announced plans to screen many passengers arriving at American airports, some infected patients show no signs of illness, so checking symptoms won\u2019t stop citizens or visitors from passing on the infection.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure a travel ban is the best use of resources right now,\u201d Ompad said. \u201cRegardless of travel restrictions, the number of cases is going to increase, probably dramatically, in the next week or two.\u201d</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">reported</a> more than 1,500 cases in the US as of Friday evening. But Congress\u2019 in-house physician reportedly told staffers to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/congressional-physician-predicts-75-150-million-us-coronavirus-cases-fec69e77-1515-4fbc-8340-c53b65c22c53.html\">eventually expect</a> 70m to 150m.</p> <p>Both Italy and China have adopted stringent travel restrictions, but to little avail, multiple epidemiologists pointed out. Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China, but it remains amongst the worst affected.</p> <p>In China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/05/science.aba9757/tab-figures-data\">published</a> in Science.</p> <p>Researchers used computer simulations to capture the impact of restricting movement, found that the ban delayed the progression of the outbreak in China by only three to five days. The coronavirus had already made its way to other major Chinese cities by the time the restrictions were put in place.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the travel ban there certainly didn\u2019t stop the spread of disease from China to all over the planet,\u201d said Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, Gainesville and a co-author of the study.</p> <p>Longini\u2019s team is the process of calculating the effect of the US\u2019s travel restrictions. \u201cBut we think we already know what the results will be,\u201d he said.</p> <p>From a historical perspective, there\u2019s little evidence that travel restrictions have been effective in stemming previous epidemics.</p> <p>\u201cIn ancient Rome when they would have epidemics just burning through the city, they would often lock the gates to not allow anybody else to come in,\u201d said John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cBut the problem was it was already inside and spreading in the city.\u201d</p> <p>Gates and walls didn\u2019t spare the Romans from a plague, and locked borders don\u2019t seem to have helped much since. Closed borders during the Spanish flu <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181023-the-places-that-escaped-the-spanish-flu\">outbreak</a> in 1918 and 1919, did protect some areas, but also blocked supplies from reaching others.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jem/article/view/2688\">study</a> published last month in the Journal of Emergency Management<em>, </em>researchers attempted to review the effectiveness of travel bans in decreasing the spread of Ebola, Sars, Mers and the Zika virus \u2013 and found that they were only effective in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, modes and routes of transmission are different for different diseases,\u201d said Nicole Errett, an expert on public health emergency preparedness at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health who led the study. \u201cBut there\u2019s just not a lot of evidence that travel bans will eliminate risk of disease.\u201d</p> <p>If at best a travel ban may be futile, at worst - it could be harmful. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea the problem is out there, not here,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea that somehow, we might dodge this.\u201d</p> <p>Travel bans can and have cause huge disruptions to people\u2019s personal and family lives, and they also fuel racism. There are economic consequences, too, affecting not only those who work for airlines and airports but also those who depend on travel for their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cTravel bans are generally more unhelpful than helpful, and there are so many more important things that could be being done,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cAnd yet, instead we\u2019re talking about this. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p> <p><em>Susie Cagle contributed reporting</em></p>",

Although the administration announced plans to screen many passengers arriving at American airports, some infected patients show no signs of illness, so checking symptoms won\u2019t stop citizens or visitors from passing on the infection. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure a travel ban is the best use of resources right now,\u201d Ompad said. \u201cRegardless of travel restrictions, the number of cases is going to increase, probably dramatically, in the next week or two.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported more than 1,500 cases in the US as of Friday evening. But Congress\u2019 in-house physician reportedly told staffers to eventually expect 70m to 150m. Both Italy and China have adopted stringent travel restrictions, but to little avail, multiple epidemiologists pointed out. Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China, but it remains amongst the worst affected. In China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science. Researchers used computer simulations to capture the impact of restricting movement, found that the ban delayed the progression of the outbreak in China by only three to five days. The coronavirus had already made its way to other major Chinese cities by the time the restrictions were put in place. \u201cAnd the travel ban there certainly didn\u2019t stop the spread of disease from China to all over the planet,\u201d said Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, Gainesville and a co-author of the study. Longini\u2019s team is the process of calculating the effect of the US\u2019s travel restrictions. \u201cBut we think we already know what the results will be,\u201d he said. From a historical perspective, there\u2019s little evidence that travel restrictions have been effective in stemming previous epidemics. \u201cIn ancient Rome when they would have epidemics just burning through the city, they would often lock the gates to not allow anybody else to come in,\u201d said John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cBut the problem was it was already inside and spreading in the city.\u201d Gates and walls didn\u2019t spare the Romans from a plague, and locked borders don\u2019t seem to have helped much since. Closed borders during the Spanish flu outbreak in 1918 and 1919, did protect some areas, but also blocked supplies from reaching others. In a study published last month in the Journal of Emergency Management, researchers attempted to review the effectiveness of travel bans in decreasing the spread of Ebola, Sars, Mers and the Zika virus \u2013 and found that they were only effective in the short term. \u201cOf course, modes and routes of transmission are different for different diseases,\u201d said Nicole Errett, an expert on public health emergency preparedness at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health who led the study. \u201cBut there\u2019s just not a lot of evidence that travel bans will eliminate risk of disease.\u201d If at best a travel ban may be futile, at worst - it could be harmful. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea the problem is out there, not here,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea that somehow, we might dodge this.\u201d Travel bans can and have cause huge disruptions to people\u2019s personal and family lives, and they also fuel racism. There are economic consequences, too, affecting not only those who work for airlines and airports but also those who depend on travel for their jobs. \u201cTravel bans are generally more unhelpful than helpful, and there are so many more important things that could be being done,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cAnd yet, instead we\u2019re talking about this. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d Susie Cagle contributed reporting",

      "body": "<p>Speaking to parliament in 1855 as the carnage of the Crimean war grew, the radical MP John Bright produced an <a href=\"https://www.cobdencentre.org/2010/08/the-angel-of-death-has-been-abroad/\" title=\"\">imperishable image</a>. \u201cThe angel of death has been abroad throughout the land, you may almost hear the beating of his wings.\u201d</p> <p>Death\u2019s wings are beating countless millions towards the world of the sick today. You may enter full of confidence. You may think good health is like a car, and a hospital is a garage where you can park your malfunctioning body for the professionals to fix. Your confidence comes from the luck of living in an advanced scientific society with history\u2019s longest life expectancy and highest living standards. The world of the sick teaches you to dispense with certainties. You discover that your condition, or in my case the condition of someone you love, which seemed a temporary malfunction, is incurable or is possibly incurable, for no one really knows.</p> <p>Only the unlucky think about luck. Lucky people can fail to realise that luck exists. They think they have succeeded on merit, or they have thrived because of their good character or lovable personality. As comfortable people, they revolt against the thought that their comfort can ever end and their lives are contingent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wonder if our leaders realise how frightened people look to the state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You saw them out in force at the start of this crisis, although their number is falling by the hour. Bluff voices boomed that coronavirus was no worse than winter flu. We had any number of scare stories about BSE, the millennium bug and Sars in the past. They turned out to be nonsense, didn\u2019t they? Keep calm and carry on. Go to races, go to the pub. It\u2019s just politicians trying to frighten us into giving them more power. Like the global heating deniers they resemble, they live so unthinkingly with the material benefits science and technology have brought that they have come to believe they can ignore science that inconveniences them.</p> <p>At a subconscious level, I suspect they make the calculation that it will not matter if they\u2019re wrong. The experts they disparage will find a way through with some clever technology or invention. They have yet to learn that the greatest divide is not between rich and poor, but between the healthy and the sick. They will learn one day for this is the divide everyone crosses in the end.</p> <p>Luck obsesses the world of the sick, which is just another way of saying that death obsesses us. Our doctors talk of probabilities. They don\u2019t know why a treatment helps one person live a reasonable life but not another. There\u2019s X chance you will get through this. There is Y chance that you will have Z more years of life. What you assumed to be the precise discipline of medicine blurs on close inspection into educated guesses. Just as victims of violent crime wonder what would have happened if they had not passed that pub, or the children of a parent who died young wonders how they would have turned out if their family had not fallen apart, so the world of the sick is a world of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d.</p> <p>Everyone is asking what if now. A virus without a vaccine, which proliferates undetected, and, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war\" title=\"\">experience of northern Italy</a> shows, can overwhelm the health services of even prosperous countries, makes it the only question to ask. Maybe infection will feel no worse than a cold. Maybe you will find that only the old will die, and you won\u2019t pass it on to kill an innocent stranger or someone you love. And if you are old, maybe it won\u2019t kill you. I don\u2019t often say this, but I feel sorry for a government having to deal with so many maybes.</p> <p>Having lived on the edge of the world of the sick for a decade, however, I wonder if our leaders realise how frightened people look to the state. Every crisis of the 21st century has proved the state\u2019s centrality. After the 9/11 attacks, dealers ran away from danger, fire officers ran towards it. Central banks and governments were the only institutions that could bail out the world economy after the banking crisis of 2008. Today, the state\u2019s strategies are our obsession. I am not saying the private sector and charities are irrelevant; tech firms and supermarkets may play a sizeable role in getting us through. I\u2019m simply saying that if you are sick and facing the prospect of death, the state is the only institution with the means and responsibility to help you.</p> <p>What else is there? Alternative health quacks are <a href=\"https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/march-2020/misinformation-alternative-medicine-and-the-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">exploiting public fears</a>, but only the desperate rely on them \u2013 and they will soon realise their mistake. Religion may comfort a few. But in Europe most agree with Philip Larkin\u2019s dismissal of faith in <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48422/aubade-56d229a6e2f07\" title=\"\">Aubade</a>, his great poem on the fear of death:</p> <p><em>No trick dispels. Religion used to try,</em></p> <p><em>That vast moth-eaten musical brocade </em></p> <p><em>Created to pretend we never die\u2026 </em></p> <p>The deaths of thousands may bring down administrations but they will not change the reliance on state institutions. Indeed, the crisis is showing that we need greater state action. Givingemployment rights and generous sick pay to insecure workers too frightened and too poor to take time off is more than common decency now. It is a matter of national security. My Italian friends say that, even in a country where suspicion of government is imbibed from childhood, 80% back the government\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/italy-covid19-coronavirus-death-toll-1000-lockdown-12533702\" title=\"\">lock down the country</a>. They support it because \u201cwe\u2019re so frightened\u201d.</p> <p>The British government believes we are still the country of last month\u2019s booming bluffers. It fears that, if it orders lockdowns now, fatigue will set in and the public will be breaking the curfews as the illness peaks. Perhaps it has more freedom than it imagines. Last month is another age, and the first thing everyone in the world of the sick learns is to put up with anything that might help them.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Speaking to parliament in 1855 as the carnage of the Crimean war grew, the radical MP John Bright produced an imperishable image. \u201cThe angel of death has been abroad throughout the land, you may almost hear the beating of his wings.\u201d Death\u2019s wings are beating countless millions towards the world of the sick today. You may enter full of confidence. You may think good health is like a car, and a hospital is a garage where you can park your malfunctioning body for the professionals to fix. Your confidence comes from the luck of living in an advanced scientific society with history\u2019s longest life expectancy and highest living standards. The world of the sick teaches you to dispense with certainties. You discover that your condition, or in my case the condition of someone you love, which seemed a temporary malfunction, is incurable or is possibly incurable, for no one really knows. Only the unlucky think about luck. Lucky people can fail to realise that luck exists. They think they have succeeded on merit, or they have thrived because of their good character or lovable personality. As comfortable people, they revolt against the thought that their comfort can ever end and their lives are contingent. You saw them out in force at the start of this crisis, although their number is falling by the hour. Bluff voices boomed that coronavirus was no worse than winter flu. We had any number of scare stories about BSE, the millennium bug and Sars in the past. They turned out to be nonsense, didn\u2019t they? Keep calm and carry on. Go to races, go to the pub. It\u2019s just politicians trying to frighten us into giving them more power. Like the global heating deniers they resemble, they live so unthinkingly with the material benefits science and technology have brought that they have come to believe they can ignore science that inconveniences them. At a subconscious level, I suspect they make the calculation that it will not matter if they\u2019re wrong. The experts they disparage will find a way through with some clever technology or invention. They have yet to learn that the greatest divide is not between rich and poor, but between the healthy and the sick. They will learn one day for this is the divide everyone crosses in the end. Luck obsesses the world of the sick, which is just another way of saying that death obsesses us. Our doctors talk of probabilities. They don\u2019t know why a treatment helps one person live a reasonable life but not another. There\u2019s X chance you will get through this. There is Y chance that you will have Z more years of life. What you assumed to be the precise discipline of medicine blurs on close inspection into educated guesses. Just as victims of violent crime wonder what would have happened if they had not passed that pub, or the children of a parent who died young wonders how they would have turned out if their family had not fallen apart, so the world of the sick is a world of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. Everyone is asking what if now. A virus without a vaccine, which proliferates undetected, and, as the experience of northern Italy shows, can overwhelm the health services of even prosperous countries, makes it the only question to ask. Maybe infection will feel no worse than a cold. Maybe you will find that only the old will die, and you won\u2019t pass it on to kill an innocent stranger or someone you love. And if you are old, maybe it won\u2019t kill you. I don\u2019t often say this, but I feel sorry for a government having to deal with so many maybes. Having lived on the edge of the world of the sick for a decade, however, I wonder if our leaders realise how frightened people look to the state. Every crisis of the 21st century has proved the state\u2019s centrality. After the 9/11 attacks, dealers ran away from danger, fire officers ran towards it. Central banks and governments were the only institutions that could bail out the world economy after the banking crisis of 2008. Today, the state\u2019s strategies are our obsession. I am not saying the private sector and charities are irrelevant; tech firms and supermarkets may play a sizeable role in getting us through. I\u2019m simply saying that if you are sick and facing the prospect of death, the state is the only institution with the means and responsibility to help you. What else is there? Alternative health quacks are exploiting public fears, but only the desperate rely on them \u2013 and they will soon realise their mistake. Religion may comfort a few. But in Europe most agree with Philip Larkin\u2019s dismissal of faith in Aubade, his great poem on the fear of death: No trick dispels. Religion used to try, That vast moth-eaten musical brocade Created to pretend we never die\u2026 The deaths of thousands may bring down administrations but they will not change the reliance on state institutions. Indeed, the crisis is showing that we need greater state action. Givingemployment rights and generous sick pay to insecure workers too frightened and too poor to take time off is more than common decency now. It is a matter of national security. My Italian friends say that, even in a country where suspicion of government is imbibed from childhood, 80% back the government\u2019s decision to lock down the country. They support it because \u201cwe\u2019re so frightened\u201d. The British government believes we are still the country of last month\u2019s booming bluffers. It fears that, if it orders lockdowns now, fatigue will set in and the public will be breaking the curfews as the illness peaks. Perhaps it has more freedom than it imagines. Last month is another age, and the first thing everyone in the world of the sick learns is to put up with anything that might help them. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "\u201cKeep calm and kick on\u201d is the maxim racing appears to have adopted in the face of the threat posed by coronavirus, judging by the views expressed on a busy day here as trainers seized the chance to win some decent prize money without competition from the unbeatable Irish. This was almost certainly one of the last fixtures for some time to be staged in front of a paying audience but the professionals can deal with empty grandstands so long as they are allowed to keep racing their horses for the benefit of TV cameras and off-course betting. While the formal advice from the government has not yet changed, Downing Street signalled on Friday that mass gatherings are about to be banned, perhaps by next weekend. Only close friends of Kempton would describe Saturday\u2019s attendance as a mass gathering but a larger number attended Uttoxeter for the Midlands Grand National, won by Truckers Lodge for the Paul Nicholls stable. Nicholls was 150 miles to the south, saddling his runners here, and watched the Uttoxeter race on a big screen by the paddock, cheering: \u201cGo on, Lorc!\u201d as Lorcan Williams drove Truckers Lodge 18 lengths clear. It was a big day for Nicholls, who also had two winners here and reckoned he had cut in half the \u00a3300,000 lead in the trainer\u2019s title race which Nicky Henderson had held in the morning. But will the jumps season be allowed to reach its conclusion next month? \u201cTo be honest, you\u2019re asking the wrong person,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI\u2019m an expert at training racehorses, I haven\u2019t got a clue about the rest of it.

French racing adopted that approach on Friday night, announcing that attendance would be limited to trainers, jockeys, one groom per horse and no more than five media representatives; owners and breeders are specifically forbidden to attend.

The market is around 23% below the peak of the past 12 months, which is much less a fall than in the October 1987 crash, and also the global financial crisis. In both cases the stock market lost about half of its value. So that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is, oh boy, it can fall a lot more yet. Yes, the long-term performance of the stock market is good \u2013 a 6.2% annual return over 35 years. But these hits take time to recover from. It took around eight years to return to the pre-1987 crash peaks, and 11 years after the GFC. That does not mean all our super is gone. This year will be carnage, but over the past 10 years the median annual rate of return for industry super funds has been 8% (for retail funds it is 6.3%).

Home from work. Cooped up. Crisis mentality. We need to let steam off. Shared experience. But stop that. All the bars and restaurants are closed now across Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Tweets by Slavitt on Friday highlighted some experts\u2019 expectations that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1238303395448008704\">more than </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1238303395448008704\">1 million could die</a> in the US from coronavirus, and that early inaction by the Trump administration had fueled \u201ca major preventable public health disaster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe original sin is Trump\u2019s months-long denial and his dismantling of public health and response infrastructure,\u201d Slavitt said.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t all, but it led to other fatal mistakes. The public health infrastructure could have been prepared. What does that mean: nasal swabs, respirators, ventilators, RNA kits to read tests, machines, gloves\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Slavitt\u2019s renewed warning on Saturday came as Trump appeared at the White House to outline the latest steps his administration was taking to try to contain coronavirus, including extending a European travel ban to the UK and Ireland and allocating $50bn in federal funding freed up on Friday by the declaration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">of a national emergency</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBy 23 March many of our largest cities and hospitals are on course to be overrun with cases,\u201d Slavitt wrote, adding that he was preparing an advisory memo for state and local officials around the US to whom he had been speaking.</p> <p>\u201cThey are highly dependent on the public response so I will start there.

      "bodyText": "Hospitals in the US could be overrun by coronavirus cases in little more than a week, a former Obama administration senior health official has warned, fearing a \u201ctsunami-like\u201d escalation that would leave tens of thousands in need of inpatient medical care but unlikely to receive it. Andy Slavitt, who was Obama\u2019s acting administrator of Medicare and Medicaid, said the trajectory of the spread of the virus in the US could follow that of Italy, which has seen cases soar to almost 20,000 and deaths exceed 1,300 in short order. The only way for the US to avoid such an explosion, Slavitt said in a series of tweets on Saturday, was for the entire population to follow a strict policy of social isolation and hospitals to reorganise and prioritise resources to fight the outbreak. \u201cExpanding medical capacity has to be done but will only make a tiny difference if we don\u2019t self-isolate,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cI get it. Home from work. Cooped up. Crisis mentality. We need to let steam off. Shared experience. But stop that. All the bars and restaurants are closed now across Europe.\u201d Tweets by Slavitt on Friday highlighted some experts\u2019 expectations that more than 1 million could die in the US from coronavirus, and that early inaction by the Trump administration had fueled \u201ca major preventable public health disaster\u201d. \u201cThe original sin is Trump\u2019s months-long denial and his dismantling of public health and response infrastructure,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t all, but it led to other fatal mistakes. The public health infrastructure could have been prepared. What does that mean: nasal swabs, respirators, ventilators, RNA kits to read tests, machines, gloves\u2026\u201d Slavitt\u2019s renewed warning on Saturday came as Trump appeared at the White House to outline the latest steps his administration was taking to try to contain coronavirus, including extending a European travel ban to the UK and Ireland and allocating $50bn in federal funding freed up on Friday by the declaration of a national emergency. \u201cBy 23 March many of our largest cities and hospitals are on course to be overrun with cases,\u201d Slavitt wrote, adding that he was preparing an advisory memo for state and local officials around the US to whom he had been speaking. \u201cThey are highly dependent on the public response so I will start there. We have no immunity to Covid-19, people who get it don\u2019t know it for a while, and each person that gets it, they infect 2+ people,\u201d he wrote alongside a \u201clag tracker\u201d graph showing the existing and predicted escalation rate of coronavirus in countries including the US, and photographs from hospitals in Italy. \u201cEvery report describes this as a tsunami. And if it happens like a tsunami, in major cities we will have tens of thousands more cases than we have beds and we will have one ventilator for every eight people who need one.\u201d Other medical experts have also warned the public to brace for an overwhelming number of coronavirus cases. \u201cWe\u2019re about to experience the worst public health disaster since polio,\u201d said Dr Martin Makary, professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School of Public Health, speaking to Yahoo Finance. \u201cDon\u2019t believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus.

They didn\u2019t think about the well-being of the spectators, and it\u2019s not only the supporters: we\u2019ve got a kitman who is an old boy, and there\u2019s stewards who are older. They\u2019re the ones that are most at risk. There\u2019s no way whatsoever these games should have been played.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Strevens\u2019s comments, the National League chief executive, Michael Tattersall, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not really a time for having an argument, it\u2019s a time for reflecting on what\u2019s happening in our society ... The National League is keeping the continuation of the season under constant review.\u201d</p> <p>Fans not following the non-league action experienced the eerie sensation of a Saturday largely without sport.

      "bodyText": "The Eastleigh manager, Ben Strevens, has accused the National League of greed, saying there was \u201cno way whatsoever\u201d matches should have gone ahead given the coronavirus pandemic. The non-league competition announced on Friday that games in their three divisions would proceed as planned \u2013 meaning that, with the Premier League, EFL and leagues across the continent suspended, yesterday\u2019s game between Notts County and Eastleigh inadvertently became the biggest in England. There were 4,942 in attendance as the hosts won 4-0. \u201cThe reason it went ahead is because whoever sits on the board of the National League just cared about the money,\u201d said Strevens. \u201cSimple as that. They didn\u2019t think about the well-being of the spectators, and it\u2019s not only the supporters: we\u2019ve got a kitman who is an old boy, and there\u2019s stewards who are older. They\u2019re the ones that are most at risk. There\u2019s no way whatsoever these games should have been played.\u201d Responding to Strevens\u2019s comments, the National League chief executive, Michael Tattersall, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not really a time for having an argument, it\u2019s a time for reflecting on what\u2019s happening in our society ... The National League is keeping the continuation of the season under constant review.\u201d Fans not following the non-league action experienced the eerie sensation of a Saturday largely without sport. With Six Nations and Premiership rugby union suspended, England\u2019s cricket tour of Sri Lanka abandoned and this weekend\u2019s Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne also called off, it was left to horse racing and an Olympic boxing qualifier to fill the British calendar. But while supporters sought to entertain themselves in new ways, debate continued inside sport as to what direction to take in the face of a pandemic that could yet last for months. First and foremost on the list of concerns is the Olympic Games. With football\u2019s Euro 2020 expected to be postponed for a year at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, the biggest event of all is the last one standing. This past week the Olympic torch relay was aborted in Greece and the US president, Donald Trump, said the Games \u2013 due to take place in Tokyo in July \u2013 should be moved back a year.

      "body": "<p>It was a scene that could have been directed by Cecil B DeMille. On the stillest of Thursday mornings in Olympia, on the site of the ancient Games in Greece, a woman in traditional dress asked the gods for sacred silence. Then she bowed down and used the sun\u2019s rays to light the Olympic flame for the Tokyo 2020 Games.</p> <p>The ceremony at the Temple of Hera, which is conducted before every Olympics, marks the start of the torch relay. But whether the flame will reach its final destination, Tokyo\u2019s National Stadium, on 24 July is increasingly in doubt.</p> <p>For now the message from the International Olympic Committee is clear: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/11/tokyo-olympics-coronavirus-postponement-denied-yoshiro-mori\" title=\"\">the show will go on.</a> As the IOC\u2019s president, Thomas Bach, puts it: \u201cWe remain absolutely in line with our Japanese hosts in our commitment to delivering a safe Olympic Games in July this year. There is no plan B.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/shinzo-abe-insists-japan-olympics-will-go-ahead-as-planned-despite-covid-19\">Abe insists Olympics to go ahead as planned despite Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Bach is increasingly swimming against a raging tide. Sport after sport is in lockdown. Governments are restricting mass gatherings. And never in our lifetime have we had a virus quite like Covid-19.</p> <p>Rifts about whether to stage the Games are also opening up in Japan, where Shigeru Ishiba, a senior MP tipped as the successor to Shinzo Abe as prime minister, has warned the government to prepare for a worst-case scenario. Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the organising committee\u2019s executive board, suggested a postponement of one or two years would be the \u201cmost feasible\u201d way of ensuring the Games\u2019 survival, adding that a decision would have to be made by the end of April.</p> <p>To many it seems preposterous that the Games will take place in the current climate. However, Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the IOC, insists that with the Games 19 weeks away there is no need to make a quick decision. \u201cIt\u2019s way too early to assume that the Games are going to be cancelled because of the panic today,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next few weeks are going to be difficult. And I am not downplaying the seriousness of the virus. But in two months\u2019 time the situation may look very different, especially given Japan and China appear to be over the worst of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee3bec786d1ad793b8fb3d75f3224ea7ea698d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee3bec786d1ad793b8fb3d75f3224ea7ea698d2/0_46_3000_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actress Xanthi Georgiou lit the Olympic torch in Greece on Thursday \u2013 but will it ever reach Tokyo?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actress Xanthi Georgiou lit the Olympic torch in Greece on Thursday \u2013 but will it ever reach Tokyo?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chine Nouvelle/Sipa/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Payne, who worked for nearly two decades inside the Olympic movement and helped negotiate the IOC\u2019s \u00a31bn deal with the Chinese firm Alibaba, points out there are often problems before a Games that can suddenly resolve themselves.</p> <p>\u201cIn November 2017, when Kim Jong-un and President Trump were going at it, many people questioned whether the IOC should be sending athletes to what looked like the most dangerous spot on the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cBut three months later the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics went ahead without any problems.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2016 there were concerns with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/rio-olympics-zika-amir-attaran-public-health-threat\" title=\"\">Zika virus </a>and problems with the organising committee before Rio. While three years before the Athens Olympics there were discussions about what it would take to leave because the Greek government had its head in the sand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's unfair to ask athletes to peak in July, then stand down until October</p> <footer> <cite>Nick Varley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe IOC is used to dealing with such big decisions and has a team of very highly qualified experts who will weigh up the risks, speak to the medical experts, and make the right choice.\u201d</p> <p>However, another senior figure, who helped run the London 2012 Olympics, believes it will be hard for the Games to go ahead. \u201cThe IOC and the Japanese government have a very difficult decision,\u201d says the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cFor instance, how is the Japanese health care system going to cope with perhaps a million fans turning up, some of whom may be from countries where the virus is at its peak? Or what happens if an athlete gets it during the Games? Remember most rooms in the Olympic Village rooms have between two and four athletes in them so it could easily spread.\u201d</p> <p>In London there were contingency plans for all sorts of potential incidents \u2013 including a chemical attack, a fake bomb and a high-profile death of a royal family member that would have meant switching coverage to other TV channels. However, sources caution that a pandemic presents far trickier challenges to overcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">Coronavirus and sport \u2013 a list of the major cancellations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you look at the groups of people you need for a Games to function, it includes athletes, officials, volunteers, fans and the media,\u201d says one informed voice. \u201cAnd with all these groups \u2013 who will be coming from all over the world \u2013 the virus is nondiscriminatory. So then the contingency planning scales back to who are the central people for the Olympics to go ahead and the first big decision the IOC has to make is, can the Games take place without any of these groups? I think it is unlikely.\u201d</p> <p>Some athletes are starting to worry about how they are going to qualify for the Games given so many tournaments have been cancelled, postponed or moved to new locations. The eerie sight of 300 elite runners and wheelchair athletes taking part in this month\u2019s Tokyo marathon must also have given even the most optimistic Japanese officials pause for thought. Plans for Olympic torches journey around Greece have been scrapped, and restrictions on spectators will almost certainly apply when the flame begins its journey around Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures six days later, starting in Fukushima.</p> <p>Nick Varley, who has worked on four successful bids, including Tokyo\u2019s, believes the Games will go ahead. However, he predicts that if there is a postponement it will be for a year rather than a couple of months. \u201cIt is unfair to ask athletes to try to peak in July and then tell them to stand down and wait until October,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7c399990a2c4af44ea03226418fecb8aaaacb3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c399990a2c4af44ea03226418fecb8aaaacb3f/0_214_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two men in face masks walk alongside water in Tokyo, with Olympic rings behind them.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One senior source has said organisers face \u2018a very difficult decision\u2019 in the coming weeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stoyan Nenov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRemember that most of them are not stars but amateurs who are carving out time from their other careers. The other thing to bear in mind is that the US network NBC won\u2019t want the Olympics to be held at the same time as the start of the NFL or NBA seasons. So while I still expect the Games to go ahead, I think any delay would be for 12 months.\u201d</p> <p>Another source warns that rescheduling an Olympics will not necessarily be straightforward. \u201cThe Games are effectively block-booked seven years in advance. In London we started to book the hotel rooms very soon after winning the bid. It is quite difficult to postpone the Games.</p> <p>\u201cThe other thing is not to forget about the Paralympics. You have some more vulnerable people competing and it is, in theory, the fourth-biggest world sporting event.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, it was left to Japan\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, to repeat the official line \u2013 that the event, which has cost at least $12bn in preparations and attracted more than $3bn in domestic sponsorships, would not be delayed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Recap.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the Recap.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sources in the IOC insist that as long as there is a chance of holding the Games, they should try to stage them for the sake of the athletes.

      "bodyText": "It was a scene that could have been directed by Cecil B DeMille. On the stillest of Thursday mornings in Olympia, on the site of the ancient Games in Greece, a woman in traditional dress asked the gods for sacred silence. Then she bowed down and used the sun\u2019s rays to light the Olympic flame for the Tokyo 2020 Games. The ceremony at the Temple of Hera, which is conducted before every Olympics, marks the start of the torch relay. But whether the flame will reach its final destination, Tokyo\u2019s National Stadium, on 24 July is increasingly in doubt. For now the message from the International Olympic Committee is clear: the show will go on. As the IOC\u2019s president, Thomas Bach, puts it: \u201cWe remain absolutely in line with our Japanese hosts in our commitment to delivering a safe Olympic Games in July this year. There is no plan B.\u201d But Bach is increasingly swimming against a raging tide. Sport after sport is in lockdown. Governments are restricting mass gatherings. And never in our lifetime have we had a virus quite like Covid-19. Rifts about whether to stage the Games are also opening up in Japan, where Shigeru Ishiba, a senior MP tipped as the successor to Shinzo Abe as prime minister, has warned the government to prepare for a worst-case scenario. Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the organising committee\u2019s executive board, suggested a postponement of one or two years would be the \u201cmost feasible\u201d way of ensuring the Games\u2019 survival, adding that a decision would have to be made by the end of April. To many it seems preposterous that the Games will take place in the current climate. However, Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the IOC, insists that with the Games 19 weeks away there is no need to make a quick decision. \u201cIt\u2019s way too early to assume that the Games are going to be cancelled because of the panic today,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next few weeks are going to be difficult. And I am not downplaying the seriousness of the virus. But in two months\u2019 time the situation may look very different, especially given Japan and China appear to be over the worst of it.\u201d Payne, who worked for nearly two decades inside the Olympic movement and helped negotiate the IOC\u2019s \u00a31bn deal with the Chinese firm Alibaba, points out there are often problems before a Games that can suddenly resolve themselves. \u201cIn November 2017, when Kim Jong-un and President Trump were going at it, many people questioned whether the IOC should be sending athletes to what looked like the most dangerous spot on the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cBut three months later the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics went ahead without any problems. \u201cIn 2016 there were concerns with the Zika virus and problems with the organising committee before Rio. While three years before the Athens Olympics there were discussions about what it would take to leave because the Greek government had its head in the sand. \u201cThe IOC is used to dealing with such big decisions and has a team of very highly qualified experts who will weigh up the risks, speak to the medical experts, and make the right choice.\u201d However, another senior figure, who helped run the London 2012 Olympics, believes it will be hard for the Games to go ahead. \u201cThe IOC and the Japanese government have a very difficult decision,\u201d says the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cFor instance, how is the Japanese health care system going to cope with perhaps a million fans turning up, some of whom may be from countries where the virus is at its peak? Or what happens if an athlete gets it during the Games? Remember most rooms in the Olympic Village rooms have between two and four athletes in them so it could easily spread.\u201d In London there were contingency plans for all sorts of potential incidents \u2013 including a chemical attack, a fake bomb and a high-profile death of a royal family member that would have meant switching coverage to other TV channels. However, sources caution that a pandemic presents far trickier challenges to overcome. \u201cIf you look at the groups of people you need for a Games to function, it includes athletes, officials, volunteers, fans and the media,\u201d says one informed voice. \u201cAnd with all these groups \u2013 who will be coming from all over the world \u2013 the virus is nondiscriminatory. So then the contingency planning scales back to who are the central people for the Olympics to go ahead and the first big decision the IOC has to make is, can the Games take place without any of these groups? I think it is unlikely.\u201d Some athletes are starting to worry about how they are going to qualify for the Games given so many tournaments have been cancelled, postponed or moved to new locations. The eerie sight of 300 elite runners and wheelchair athletes taking part in this month\u2019s Tokyo marathon must also have given even the most optimistic Japanese officials pause for thought. Plans for Olympic torches journey around Greece have been scrapped, and restrictions on spectators will almost certainly apply when the flame begins its journey around Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures six days later, starting in Fukushima. Nick Varley, who has worked on four successful bids, including Tokyo\u2019s, believes the Games will go ahead. However, he predicts that if there is a postponement it will be for a year rather than a couple of months. \u201cIt is unfair to ask athletes to try to peak in July and then tell them to stand down and wait until October,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember that most of them are not stars but amateurs who are carving out time from their other careers. The other thing to bear in mind is that the US network NBC won\u2019t want the Olympics to be held at the same time as the start of the NFL or NBA seasons. So while I still expect the Games to go ahead, I think any delay would be for 12 months.\u201d Another source warns that rescheduling an Olympics will not necessarily be straightforward. \u201cThe Games are effectively block-booked seven years in advance. In London we started to book the hotel rooms very soon after winning the bid. It is quite difficult to postpone the Games. \u201cThe other thing is not to forget about the Paralympics. You have some more vulnerable people competing and it is, in theory, the fourth-biggest world sporting event.\u201d On Saturday, it was left to Japan\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, to repeat the official line \u2013 that the event, which has cost at least $12bn in preparations and attracted more than $3bn in domestic sponsorships, would not be delayed. Sources in the IOC insist that as long as there is a chance of holding the Games, they should try to stage them for the sake of the athletes. It probably will not be until late May that a decision is made. Some of Tokyo\u2019s residents, though, are increasingly more concerned about the virus\u2019s spread than the Games. \u201cIf you think about the safety of athletes, I don\u2019t think we should have the Olympics,\u201d Yoshio Yoshimoto, a 70-year-old contract worker, said. \u201cWho would take responsibility if you force it and the coronavirus outbreak turns worse?\u201d",

Say no to visitors. Contact friends and family online or by phone. If you use online shopping for deliveries of food, medicine or other necessities, make sure delivery instructions say that items should be left outside, not handed over in person. If you ask friends or family for help bringing you supplies, get them to do the same.</p> <h2><strong>2 Separate yourself from others</strong></h2> <p>Stay in one room, with the door closed \u2013 ideally a room that has a window to the outside that you can open. Don\u2019t share crockery, cutlery, glasses, bedding or towels with anyone in your home when you have used them. Dishwashers can be used to clean crockery and cutlery. If that isn\u2019t possible, wash by hand and dry using a separate tea towel. Laundry, bedding and towels should be placed in a plastic bag and washed only when tests for Covid-19 are negative or self-isolation is over, if possible. Do not take anything to a launderette. If you have to wash at home, use temperatures of at least 60C.</p> <h2><strong>3 Food and bathrooms</strong></h2> <p>Have meals left outside your door. If you cook for yourself, do so, if possible, when others are not in the kitchen \u2013 and take food back to your room to eat. If you have more than one bathroom in your home, use a separate one.

      "bodyText": "1 Stay at home This may sound obvious, but don\u2019t leave home except to get medical care (and if you do, make sure you have called ahead). Say no to visitors. Contact friends and family online or by phone. If you use online shopping for deliveries of food, medicine or other necessities, make sure delivery instructions say that items should be left outside, not handed over in person. If you ask friends or family for help bringing you supplies, get them to do the same. 2 Separate yourself from others Stay in one room, with the door closed \u2013 ideally a room that has a window to the outside that you can open. Don\u2019t share crockery, cutlery, glasses, bedding or towels with anyone in your home when you have used them. Dishwashers can be used to clean crockery and cutlery. If that isn\u2019t possible, wash by hand and dry using a separate tea towel. Laundry, bedding and towels should be placed in a plastic bag and washed only when tests for Covid-19 are negative or self-isolation is over, if possible. Do not take anything to a launderette. If you have to wash at home, use temperatures of at least 60C. 3 Food and bathrooms Have meals left outside your door. If you cook for yourself, do so, if possible, when others are not in the kitchen \u2013 and take food back to your room to eat. If you have more than one bathroom in your home, use a separate one. If you have to share, ensure you clean it thoroughly and regularly. If you live in shared accommodation (such as university halls of residence), leave your room only when necessary, ideally wearing a mask, if you have one. Try to avoid using the kitchen or bathroom while others are there. 4 Keep away from pets if possible Wash your hands before and after contact as a precautionary measure. 5 Safely dispose of tissues after you cough or sneeze Dispose of them into a plastic bag and immediately wash your hands with soap and water, and dry thoroughly. If you have one, wear a mask when you are in the same room as others, or if you go out for medical treatment. 6 Hand washing The rules are similar to those for all people \u2013 wash your hands often and thoroughly, using soap and water, for 20 seconds Then rinse and dry thoroughly. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. 7 Waste disposal All waste that you have been in contact with, including used tissues and masks, should be put in a plastic rubbish bag and tied when full. The plastic bag should then be placed in a second bin bag and tied. Do not dispose of it or put it out for collection until you have test results, or until quarantine is over. If you test positive, you will get instructions on how to dispose of the waste. 8 If symptoms worsen Seek medical help quickly if you develop new symptoms or if your symptoms worsen (for example, if you have problems breathing).

Their loyal workers turned up to work today to clean the hospital and make sure the patients are safe. But what they are getting back from ISS is threats and broken promises. The behaviour of the ISS top brass is incredible given these jobs are vital to the hospital in normal circumstances, but in the present climate the work they do is utterly fundamental.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Ash, managing director of healthcare from ISS, said: \u201cThe issue has not affected the service we provide: we continue to maintain high standards of hygiene at the hospital, with cleaning, portering and catering services provided as normal to patients, staff and visitors.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe error with pay affected a limited number of the staff who moved to a new pay system, after we took over the contract for these services from the previous provider last month.

      "bodyText": "Cleaning staff at the first London hospital to treat a coronavirus patient have walked out after an outsourcing firm repeatedly failed to pay them properly. Dozens of hospital cleaners \u2013 who are on the frontline of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 walked out of Lewisham hospital on Thursday but returned to work the following day after being promised that their pay would be corrected. This has been an ongoing issue since some employees were underpaid at the end of February. Catering and portering staff joined them in staging a protest outside the south London hospital on Friday when they realised the money was still not in their bank accounts. Despite reassurance from private contractor ISS that the dispute has not affected the hospital service, Helen O\u2019Connor, an organiser for GMB, said that no cleaning took place at the hospital on Thursday. Issues with the firm\u2019s payroll system have resulted in some employees not being properly paid in weeks. Representatives from their union, GMB, met with ISS director Nick Clarke, who suggested it may take up to another week to resolve the pay dispute. \u201cIt has been disgusting the way they treat us,\u201d one housekeeping staff member told the South London Press. \u201cWe are working with coronavirus in the hospital and not getting paid for it. If we don\u2019t clean the ward it is a state and we have a chance of catching coronavirus here.\u201d ISS has denied workers compensation for the crisis, according to GMB. The union also said the contractor had threatened to withhold the promise of the London living wage being paid with back pay in April if workers protested. O\u2019Connor said: \u201cOur members are in dire financial straights as ISS continue to drag their heels to sort out the pay crisis in Lewisham hospital. Their loyal workers turned up to work today to clean the hospital and make sure the patients are safe. But what they are getting back from ISS is threats and broken promises. The behaviour of the ISS top brass is incredible given these jobs are vital to the hospital in normal circumstances, but in the present climate the work they do is utterly fundamental.\u201d Chris Ash, managing director of healthcare from ISS, said: \u201cThe issue has not affected the service we provide: we continue to maintain high standards of hygiene at the hospital, with cleaning, portering and catering services provided as normal to patients, staff and visitors. \u201cThe error with pay affected a limited number of the staff who moved to a new pay system, after we took over the contract for these services from the previous provider last month. We are extremely sorry that this happened and are reaching out to those staff to apologise in person, and to quickly sort out any pay issues they have.\u201d",

But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice. \u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home when the WHO recommends continued testing, for example?\u201d Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the prime minister urging him to allow mortgage payment holidays and rent deferrals, and demanded sight of emergency legislation that would give the government powers to detain virus victims, keep schools open and allow people to keep their jobs while volunteering for the NHS. But other health experts backed the government. \u201cThe UK approach is driven by evidence that is appropriate for the local context,\u201d said Michael Head, senior research fellow at Southampton University. \u201cWhat other countries are doing with their populations, with subtle or markedly different cultural and social expectations and habits, does not mean the UK is doing the wrong thing.\u201d",
