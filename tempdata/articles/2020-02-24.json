      "bodyText": "An inquiry into allegations of money laundering at Crown Resorts Melbourne casino has heard that other jurisdictions have far more stringent controls on junkets which bring high rollers to casinos. On the first day of evidence in a NSW inquiry, a gaming expert, Paul Bromberg from Spectrum Asia, said that other countries such as Singapore \u2013 and US gaming states such as New Jersey \u2013 required junket operators to be licensed. Japan had decided to ban them operating in casinos entirely. The inquiryis being chaired by the former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin and is examining allegations of money laundering and links to organised crime in Crown. She is also considering whether there are probity issues raised by Lawrence Ho\u2019s Melco Resorts\u2019 purchase of 10% of Crown\u2019s shares. Reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age last year alleged that Crown Resorts, part-owned by one of Australia\u2019s richest men, James Packer, was using junkets backed by Asia\u2019s most powerful organised crime syndicates as part of its program to attract Chinese high rollers to its casinos. Reports also alleged that Crown\u2019s casinos were used to launder money. Bromberg told the inquiry there was substantial work by academics which linked Macau\u2019s junkets \u2013 organisations which bring high rollers to overseas casinos \u2013 to the triads. Bromberg said that as well as organising travel, junket operators arranged prostitutes and narcotics for their clientele and also provided cross-border finance and enforced debts. The enforcement of gaming debts is illegal in China. \u201cFor all these reasons, organised crime has been involved in junkets for many years,\u201d he said. He said there had been reports in the Hong Kong media about the organised crime connections of Suncity, including the CEO, Alvin Chau. The allegations drew a sharp response from Crown, which ran advertisements in newspapers calling the reports a \u201cdeceitful campaign\u201d. Crown pointed to registration of junkets by the gaming authorities in Macau and the fact that the largest junket Crown was involved with, Suncity, is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. But Bromberg, a veteran of the Asian gaming scene, said the fact that Macau registered junket operators offered \u201clittle comfort\u201d. He said until recently Macau had failed to enforce its own gaming legislation and that registration was very different from enforcement. Macau merely required junket operators to certify that they had no foreign criminal connections, without doing its own checks, he said. Asked what comfort could be gained by a junket like Suncity being listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Bromberg replied: \u201cI would say very little.\u201d He said that apart from limited financial scrutiny, the HK stock exchange did not have the resources for probity checks of any companies listed on its bourse, and that applied equally to companies not in the gaming industry. On the other hand, Singapore, which opened its first two casinos in 2010, required junkets to be licensed, he said. Its regulator, which has the powers of a law enforcement body, had rejected several junket operators because they did not meet probity checks, he said. Bromberg said Japan had gone further and taken the decision not to allow junkets to operate in its gaming industry. Australian casinos are required to notify the state casino authorities if they are using junkets to promote their casino or allowing them to operate within the casino. But the authorities do not run probity checks on the junkets, leaving that function to the casino itself. Bromberg said this clearly gave rise to a potential conflict of interest, as the casino was wanting to bring as many wealthy VIPs to its casino as possible. Also he pointed out that casinos did not have access to information gathered by other law enforcement agencies. The regulation of Macau\u2019s gaming scene is particularly relevant to Crown because Macau\u2019s Melco Resorts, chaired by Lawrence Ho, has bought a 10% stake in Crown. However, Ho recently announced he would not proceed to buy a further 10% from Packer due to the downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Packer is expected to give evidence in the second part of the inquiry in March.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start the week.</p> \n<p>Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-china-wuhan-lockdown-economy-south-korea-npc-annual-parliament\">has eased the lockdown that has been in place since 23 January</a> by announcing that non-symptomatic people requiring medical operations will be allowed to leave the city. In another possible sign of improving conditions, Chinese media said that<strong> </strong>six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, while 24 out of 31 other Chinese provinces also recorded no rise. However, the situation appeared to be deteriorating in other parts of the world as South Korea reported another 161 cases overnight. Flights into the locked down city of Daegu have been suspended while Air New Zealand said it was putting its service to Seoul on hold.</p> \n<p>Stock markets, meanwhile, have taken a battering in the wake of Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s comments that the outbreak would have a \u201cbig impact\u201d on the country\u2019s economy. Shares in Seoul plunged more than 3% and heavy losses are expected when trading gets under way in Europe and the US later. The jittery mood was not helped after experts warned earlier that the tipping point where the world would not be able to stop a pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/world-is-approaching-coronavirus-tipping-point-experts-say\">was getting closer</a> because of the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/turkey-and-pakistan-close-borders-with-iran-over-coronavirus-deaths\">Turkey and Pakistan have closed borders with Iran</a>, where eight people have died after contracting the virus. In Italy, authorities have imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread\">draconian measures</a> to try to contain the spread of the virus in 11 towns in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto as the country notched up its third fatality.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Patel denials \u2013 </strong>An informed security source has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/mi5-rejects-claims-withhold-intelligence-priti-patel\">denied reports </a>that intelligence chiefs have lost confidence in the home secretary, Priti Patel. The source said Sunday Times reports at the weekend were \u201csimply untrue\u201d and that she was getting the same information from the agency as any other home secretary. It comes in the wake of a series of stories claiming that Patel has had difficult relationships with officials during her ministerial career. Her allies believe she is being targeted because officials do not like being challenged.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Malaysia drama \u2013 </strong>Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/anwar-ibrahim-decries-traitors-amid-cracks-in-deal-to-make-him-malaysias-next-pm\">has resigned</a> on a day of political drama.

Speaking at a hustings event in Durham, Starmer said they were both excellent candidates and suggested that all three represented the future of the party. \u201cWhichever one of us actually wins this, what you are seeing on display here is the leadership of the Labour party,\u201d he said. Most members will be able to vote via email, but paper ballots will be available as well. The vote closes on 2 April with the result to be announced two days later.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bin death warning \u2013 </strong>At least seven people are known to have died in the last five years as a result of sleeping in bins and being crushed when the rubbish is emptied,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/deaths-homeless-people-sleeping-bins-calls-action-uk\"> the waste industry says</a>, as it highlights a deadly consequence of Britain\u2019s growing homelessness problem.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Stocks fall sharply after Xi warning on economy Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start the week. Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, has eased the lockdown that has been in place since 23 January by announcing that non-symptomatic people requiring medical operations will be allowed to leave the city. In another possible sign of improving conditions, Chinese media said that six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, while 24 out of 31 other Chinese provinces also recorded no rise. However, the situation appeared to be deteriorating in other parts of the world as South Korea reported another 161 cases overnight. Flights into the locked down city of Daegu have been suspended while Air New Zealand said it was putting its service to Seoul on hold. Stock markets, meanwhile, have taken a battering in the wake of Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s comments that the outbreak would have a \u201cbig impact\u201d on the country\u2019s economy. Shares in Seoul plunged more than 3% and heavy losses are expected when trading gets under way in Europe and the US later. The jittery mood was not helped after experts warned earlier that the tipping point where the world would not be able to stop a pandemic was getting closer because of the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe. Turkey and Pakistan have closed borders with Iran, where eight people have died after contracting the virus. In Italy, authorities have imposed draconian measures to try to contain the spread of the virus in 11 towns in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto as the country notched up its third fatality. * * * Patel denials \u2013 An informed security source has denied reports that intelligence chiefs have lost confidence in the home secretary, Priti Patel. The source said Sunday Times reports at the weekend were \u201csimply untrue\u201d and that she was getting the same information from the agency as any other home secretary. It comes in the wake of a series of stories claiming that Patel has had difficult relationships with officials during her ministerial career. Her allies believe she is being targeted because officials do not like being challenged. * * * Malaysia drama \u2013 Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has resigned on a day of political drama. Mahathir, who is 94, took office in May 2018 when he defeated Najib Razak. Would-be leader Anwar Ibrahim earlier accused Mahathir of plotting to bring down the ruling coalition. * * * Labour vote \u2013 As Labour party members begin receiving ballot papers for the leadership election today, the frontrunner, Sir Keir Starmer, has pledged to give leading shadow cabinet posts to his rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Speaking at a hustings event in Durham, Starmer said they were both excellent candidates and suggested that all three represented the future of the party. \u201cWhichever one of us actually wins this, what you are seeing on display here is the leadership of the Labour party,\u201d he said. Most members will be able to vote via email, but paper ballots will be available as well. The vote closes on 2 April with the result to be announced two days later. * * * Bin death warning \u2013 At least seven people are known to have died in the last five years as a result of sleeping in bins and being crushed when the rubbish is emptied, the waste industry says, as it highlights a deadly consequence of Britain\u2019s growing homelessness problem. Bosses also say there were 109 near misses between April and December last year as destitute people increasingly seek shelter in large, enclosed rubbish containers. * * * Diabetes risk \u2013 A growing obesity crisis means a record number of people are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and with it an increased chance of a heart attack or stroke. To tackle the problem, the NHS is going to make a radical new liquid diet available to patients which will put type 2 diabetes into remission. A pilot scheme will see 5,000 patients restricted to 800 calories per day for three months. They will then have another nine months of support to help them maintain weight loss. * * * Caught in a storm \u2013 Hundreds of British holidaymakers stranded in the Canary Islands after a sandstorm may be able to return home today after airports reopened. The storm coated the islands in yellow dust and reduced visibility to zero on Sunday leaving tourists stuck. Flights from Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, North and South Tenerife airports were grounded but airports were beginning to reopen this morning. Today in Focus podcast Manchester City\u2019s fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi. But after years of success, Europe\u2019s governing body has banned the club from its most prestigious tournament, the Champions League. David Conn explains why. Plus: Alok Jha on the ethics of gene editing. Lunchtime read: Ioan Gruffudd on Weinstein and Hollywood Ioan Gruffudd is about to return to our small screens as the serial rapist in ITV\u2019s The Liar. He talks to Emine Saner about how playing the part sometimes reduces him to tears (\u201cyou have to numb yourself\u201d), his pride in his wife for outing an allegedly predatory Harvey Weinstein (\u201cshe wanted to say \u2018This is definitely his modus operandi\u2019\u201d), and how he wears make-up so that selfies with fans don\u2019t end up making him \u201clooking like shit\u201d. Sport Tyson Fury is \u201calmost sure\u201d he will face Deontay Wilder for a third time rather than Anthony Joshua in an all-British four-belt unification fight, after Fury earned the world\u2019s respect with his WBC heavyweight win over the American in Las Vegas. Manu Tuilagi\u2019s barnstorming performance helped soften up Ireland in their Six Nations clash at the weekend, as Eddie Jones\u2019s team give a glimpse of what they are capable of. Defending Women\u2019s Six Nations champions England made it three wins from three against previously unbeaten Ireland with a clinical 27-0 victory in Doncaster. Antonio R\u00fcdiger has said racism won when no one was punished for allegedly racially abusing him at Tottenham in December. Mikel Arteta believes the in-form Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is leaning towards staying at Arsenal after playing a significant role in the team\u2019s improvement. Bruno Fernandes vowed to help Manchester United \u201cconquer\u201d the race for a Champions League place following his impressive display in Sunday\u2019s victory over Watford. Manchester City and Chelsea, the Women\u2019s Super League top two, drew 3-3 in an enthralling, fluctuating game from which Chelsea emerged with their unbeaten run intact. And Patrick Reed of the US won the World Golf Championship in Mexico, finishing one shot ahead of fellow American Bryson DeChambeau.

Everyone wants paedophiles and terrorists stopped. But suddenly, it becomes anyone suspected of a crime that brings more than two to three years imprisonment, if convicted. And then a whole heap of other people are having their personal affairs opened up to spy agencies. You don\u2019t have to be convicted.

Being Tuesday, that means it\u2019s party-room time, and there ain\u2019t no party like a bunch-of-people-pretending-they-are-all-under-the-one-policy-umbrella party. We\u2019ll bring you that, as well as everything else ghost-of-climate-wars past. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin, as well as everyone else in the Guardian brains trust. And thank you to you for following along, and all the messages. Apologies if I didn\u2019t get back to you, it gets a bit hectic, but I do try to at least read them all. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Until then \u2013 take care of you. Barnaby Joyce is explaining why some, including the Liberal-National NSW state government, are living in a \u201cfairytale nirvana\u201d by having a target of net zero emissions by 2050. He\u2019s on Sky News. Narrator: they did not. Asked about the criticism the government has levelled at her climate bill \u2013 which includes establishing a statutory body to monitor Australia\u2019s emissions reduction action, which government MPs have claimed would amount to an \u201cunelected tsar\u201d making policy decisions on behalf of Australia \u2013 Zali Steggall says: That is rubbish, that is like saying the RBA is an unelected tsar of the Australian economy; it is a very good, expert base arbiter of what needs to be done. At the end of the day the RBA doesn\u2019t take what the treasurer does in the way of policy but ... raises concerns when there are issues that need to be addressed. The commission would do the same. An expert-based commission, it would still appoint people to the commission, with appointments approved by the joint parliamentary committee \u2013 again, trying to take the partisan politics out of this and make this bipartisan approach to climate policy, the way the UK has. I can only assume that those comments from Jason [Falinski] and Tim [Wilson] are really just trying, they are scrambling, because they know everybody needs to get to a net zero by 2050. The business community knows this, state Coalition governments know this; for some reason, they can\u2019t seem to get their head around it. Zali Steggall does say, though, that Bettina Arndt being awarded an Australia Day honour \u201ccheapened\u201d the award: I was dumbfounded by that. Having received that medal myself I prize that in recognition of service to Australia and the community. I felt that cheapened the award and brought it into disrepute. I can certainly sympathise with the victims out there that that award, in light of her comments, is really hard to comprehend. Zali Steggall shaking her head, as Patricia Karvelas lays out Pauline Hanson\u2019s comments on the Queensland man who murdered his wife and children, is all of us. But she doesn\u2019t say whether or not Hanson should be removed from the family law court inquiry, as the Greens are calling for. Anthony Albanese has been on Sky News, talking to Kieran Gilbert. He is asked if Labor has learned the lesson of the last election and is prepared to put a cost-and-detail to its policy. He says, as he has all day, that yes, of course Labor has taken on that lesson, and it will consult with all the different sectors before it lands on its final roadmap. I say this to you here, Kieran, and when did Scott Morrison go on your program or on Insiders and be prepared to subject himself to a debate about the costs of inaction? Because I tell you what, we saw a bit of the cost of inaction over the bushfire season, when we lost 33 lives, when we lost over 3,000 homes, when we lost 12m hectares of land \u2013 when we have, who knows what the cost is. What we know is that the cost of that season certainly won\u2019t be $2bn that the government talks about. We know that more extreme weather events, we know the predictions are an increase in droughts. We know the consequences of dangerous climate change are catastrophic for our economy. Global economists predict that the cost of a greater-than-2C increase in global temperatures will be between 15 and 25% lower economic growth \u2013 a greater cost than we saw during the Great Depression. And one of the things that your job has to be, if I can be so bold, is to hold the government to account, that have Treasury, that have Finance, that won\u2019t meet its 2030 target. That\u2019s why they went to Madrid and argued for an accounting trick rather than actually lowering their emissions. And on the public spat he and Barnaby Joyce engaged in this morning, Joel Fitzgibbon tells Patricia Karvelas: Barnaby Joyce and I having a spat in Parliament House is nothing unusual. There are some things we agree on but plenty we disagree on, and of course he was out there spinning like he usually does, misrepresenting Labor\u2019s position and really dancing the dance of distress because he knows that with the support of the BCA, the farmers\u2019 federation, Meat and Livestock Australia, premier Berejiklian and other state premiers and territory leaders, Santos, BHP, they have a job ahead of them now that we\u2019ve embraced such a sensible policy proposal to give the majority of Australians what they are looking for, and that is meaningful action on climate change. Joel Fitzgibbon on why he doesn\u2019t think coal jobs will be impacted by Labor\u2019s 2050 policy: What we are striving to do is meet the commitment made in Paris by Malcolm Turnbull and the commitment requires us to take account of the emissions here in Australia, not the emissions emitted by other countries when, for example, they buy our coal ... There is no need to do any harm to the coalmining industry and we will not do any harm, exporting our coal to markets in Asia, earning foreign exchange, the foreign exchange which enables us to pay for the imports and cars. Joel Fitzgibbon just had a chat to Patricia Karvelas about the problems he has with a 2030 target for Labor: The problem with the 2030 target is that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to inherit from Scott Morrison. He says he has this aspirational goal target to get to 26-28% by 2030 and it\u2019s very clear that is not going to come anywhere near close to meeting the target. He wants to cheat by fiddling the books and using Kyoto credits. They don\u2019t count and should not count. Let\u2019s see where Scott Morrison is and we are two years from the election. We\u2019ve made the commitment on zero net emissions and we\u2019ve got plenty of time now to consult. Question time, as seen by Mike Bowers: Right, here is what the National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s position on carbon neutrality is: The current NFF climate policy does not include a reference to net zero emissions by 2050. We have committed in the roadmap for a $100bn industry by 2030 that we want to be on a trajectory to carbon neutrality by 2030, and to do so want to work with the major commodities to develop sector plans by 2025. Given our commitment to growth towards a $100bn sector, that has been signed on to by both major political parties, the industry would have real difficulty in supporting any target/proposal that would put the competitiveness or ongoing growth of major agricultural sectors at risk. This is a complex issue for agriculture and we continue to seek sufficient detail on any commitments, including net zero by 2050, to inform the best policy outcome for the sector. Before question time, the government\u2019s bill for an amnesty for employers who failed to pay superannuation passed the Senate, despite Labor\u2019s attempt to amend it to include an enforceable right for unions and workers to pursue unpaid super in the Fair Work Commission. Rex Patrick told the Senate Centre Alliance he decided to support the bill after the assistant minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, made a commitment to consider Labor\u2019s amendment separately. Hume confirmed the government would \u201cconsider the options outlined in Labor\u2019s amendment\u201d in the next six months, because it believed it needed \u201cconsiderable time and scrutiny\u201d before the plan could be approved. Hume said in a statement: This policy is all about reuniting hardworking Australians with their super. We anticipate at least $160m of super will be paid to Australian workers who would otherwise miss out. Since the one-off amnesty was originally announced back in 2018, over 7,000 employers have already come forward to voluntarily disclose historical unpaid super. We estimate an additional 7,000 employers will come forward in the next six months before the amnesty ends. Employers will not be off the hook. To use the amnesty, they must still pay all that is owing to their employees, including the high rate of interest. However, the amnesty will make it easier for workers to secure the super they are owed by not hitting employers with the penalties usually associated with late payment. Labor believes that the amount the government is claiming will be paid back pales in comparison to the $5.9bn a year that Industry Super Australia has estimated is ripped off by employers from workers. The good news is this problem should be a thing of the past because Australian Tax Office oversight is much improved, with single touch payroll giving them real-time information when employers fail to pay super. The last moment the House actually achieved anything: Scott Morrison keeps question time going for one last lickspittle on just how incredible the government\u2019s climate policy is, and he responds with just how terrible Labor is. Question time ends. Christian Porter announces changes to a bunch of committees, removing Llew O\u2019Brien from their membership. Nick Champion to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: can he confirm 42% of the urban congestion fund for South Australia is allocated to the marginal state of Boothby? Is there no traffic congestion on the seats of Hindmarsh, Spence and Kingston? Morrison: I refer the member to my early response when I listed quite a lot of South Australian seats which have benefited from the investment of this government, but I have to say the member for Boothby does a fantastic job. You can find no better advocate for dealing with the issues and challenges in Boothby than the member for Boothby, that is why the member for Boothby was re-elected, because she understands what\u2019s going on in her community and she fights for her community. And she has the ear of the government, who can deliver for the people ... that\u2019s why the people of Boothby made the right decision to re-elect the member for Boothby, and all the other members, Mr Speaker, who sat on this side of the House, because they know when the government makes a promise to Australians, we keep it, and that is what our government is doing. The member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, nods along with this assessment. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation assures me it will be sending through a statement on what its carbon neutrality position actually is. Question time is still going for some reason. There has been way, way too much Michael McCormack for anyone\u2019s liking. Including his own side of the chamber, if their faces are any indication. He\u2019s back again. I read in one of Sharri Markson\u2019s columns that he doesn\u2019t believe he deserves to be called boring because he brings the house down when he does speeches, and dresses as Elvis. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve given a speech in the last couple of years where I haven\u2019t had the crowds roaring with laughter. Ring Paul Nicolau or James Pearson from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and they will tell you I\u2019m certainly not boring, and as an after-dinner speaker I\u2019m the funniest they\u2019ve had. Journalists who just sit behind their computers or television studios who don\u2019t know me from a bar of soap pile on and it\u2019s just not true. I\u2019m quite a gregarious person who likes self-deprecating humour. If you can\u2019t laugh at yourself there\u2019s something wrong and I\u2019m more than happy to do that. I think anybody who goes out in his electorate and dresses up as Elvis to help tourism for one of the towns or dresses up as ABBA, I don\u2019t think you can accuse them of being boring. I even sang Suspicious Minds in front of 11,000 people. Wow. I take it all back. He can make people who buy tickets to see him and want to court his influence laugh, and dresses up as Elvis. What. A. Great. Leader. John Anderson wasn\u2019t showy. Tim Fischer wasn\u2019t either. Warren Truss was also pretty solid and staid. You know what they did, though? They did their job. They represented their constituents. Spot the difference? Stop with the ridiculous slogans and culture wars, the pitting of city and country voters against each other, the bullshit about looking steers in the eyes, and country people never telling lies and just be better. Oh god. Now Labor is summoning Michael McCormack: Why did 94% of the central coast package from the urban congestion fund go to one seat, the marginal Liberal seat of Robertson? Is traffic congestion in the rest of the central coast not a problem? McCormack: Here by popular demand, obviously, from those opposite. The urban congestion fund ... I\u2019ll speak slowly so they\u2019ll understand it ... The urban congestion fund is busting congestio,n ensuring vital roadworks are being filled. This is bringing together 266 crucial projects, 70 will start construction this year, all are under way with geo-technical investigations, and other work under way on many more. We took these projects to the Australian people on May 18, remember that date? And, guess what, we got elected, in the same way that Labor, to our understanding, I\u2019m not quite sure of all the policies and promises, 66 election commitments and small-scale urban projects, 100%, that means every single one of them in Labor or target seats. He keeps going, but I just hear Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream. Tony Burke is not playing with his point of orders after Catherine King was kicked out, and he brings up that McCormack has not raised anything to do with the central coast. Then Anthony Albanese pops up to say these weren\u2019t election commitments, they were in the budget. McCormack has another go at speaking: These are decisions of governments, not competitive grants; we took into account other spending from the infrastructure program, thanks to the Liberal and Nationals\u2019 government, the fact we get our books balanced, unlike those opposite, when was the last time there was a surplus, 1989 ... We take into account demand and population growth. The central coast is a growing population, and this is important, is not a joke, it\u2019s the truth \u2013 nearly all railroad projects are decisions of government under Coalition and Labor governments. How do you stop livestock from passing wind? The CSIRO is working on that. These are the same people who helped give us Twisties (among, you know, some other pretty important things) so I think they know what they are doing. I am now rocking under my desk, so to discover just how awe-smackingly stupid this latest \u201cdebate\u201d is, read this. Catherine King is booted from question time for making a \u201cpolitical point during a point of order\u201d. Greens senator Larissa Waters has asked the minister for women, Marise Payne, about Pauline Hanson\u2019s comments on domestic violence that \u201cthese things happen\u201d in relation to the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children by her former partner. Payne replied: We have to speak right, report more accurately and empathetically about domestic violence ... [and] think more carefully about our expectations of healthy, respectful relationships ... Language does matter. We cannot tolerate public language that trivialises or distorts domestic violence. Each act of domestic violence is an individual atrocity. Payne avoided Waters\u2019 question about whether the government would seek to remove Hanson as deputy chair of the family law inquiry. Asked about funding for domestic violence services, Payne had a shot at the Greens by noting that the Coalition and Labor \u201cwill not be politicising the events of last week\u201d, then spruiked the benefits of the $340m fourth action plan on domestic violence. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: So far in this parliament the prime minister has used his numbers to shut down debate with me on 42 occasions. If the prime minister is so confident of his position, will he agree to a climate change debate at the National Press Club before the climate change conference in Glasgow this year? Morrison: It\u2019s all about you, Albo, isn\u2019t it? When we come in here and all the leader of the opposition can complain about is that he can\u2019t get his 15 minutes of fame \u2013 what an indulgent leader of theopposition. I tell you what, if you want to sit in this chair, you\u2019ve got to put the Australian people first, not yourself first, and worry about how much airtime you are getting. The problem with the leader of the opposition is he is so focused on the bubble politics of Canberra and all of this, he even forgets his own record. This is how many closures he moved when sitting on the government\u2019s side: 44 in 2008, 33 in 2009, 18 in 2010, 11 \u2013 they didn\u2019t even have the numbers then \u2013 33 in 2012, 13 in 2016. That\u2019s 152, Mr Speaker. There will be debates before the next election, and if you can last long enough to see me there, I\u2019ll see you there. Just for the record, here is what Morrison said when he returned from Hawaii during the bushfire crisis: I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. Oops, spoke too soon. David Littleproud: The Federal Government has put it around our farmers and that with the infrastructure, roads, rail, airports to make sure that our produce gets to these supermarkets as quickly as it possibly can to ensure that our Australian consumers get that produce as quickly as possible, but there is a real threat to that and that came only on the weekend with a reckless policy of zero emissions because it\u2019s not just farmers going up, they put a gun to the Australian agricultural sector\u2019s head and said we believe in supporting you but we\u2019re going to take you out but now they are going, now they are going after a checkout tax because every consumer will pay for this, not just at the farm gate, they will also pay for it at.... He\u2019s told to pull his head in when it comes to his analogies. And rightly so. Ugh. David Littleproud has settled on yelling at people as a political persona, but at least his sentences make some sort of sense. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Why is the government\u2019s climate change policy still being driven by extreme climate sceptics, where net zero emissions by 2050 is supported by 73 countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany, every state and territory in Australia, the Business Council, our largest airline and bank and mining company and telecommunications company? Morrison: More slogans, but no answer. The new favourite: The bill you couldn\u2019t afford at the last election, Mr Speaker, is repeated by this Labor policy. It\u2019s a reheat of the bill they couldn\u2019t afford before and they still can\u2019t afford it. What\u2019s that? Oh, I think it\u2019s the ghost of Tony Abbott. Michael McCormack is now watching David Littleproud do his job. Angus Taylor answers a lickspittle on how amazing the government is on climate, because it is not worried at all, nope, no need to talk about this, because it is totally across it all. He is called back by Jim Chalmers with this question: I refer to the prime minister\u2019s earlier failure to answer the question. Has the government modelled the economic impact of failing to make its Paris agreement commitment of net zero emissions by 2050? Taylor: That is not what is in the Paris agreement. Article 4.1 is clear it\u2019s about global agreement to reach net zero in the second half of the century \u2013 and our commitment, the commitment that is more pressing and that we are focused on achieving, our 2030 target, is a 26 per cent reduction, Mr Speaker. We have a strong plan and an enviable track record and that enviable track record does not involve imposing a carbon tax. It\u2019s about technology, not taxes. It\u2019s not just me. Joel Fitzgibbon to Michael McCormack (yet another of his sins): Is the government aware that both the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and Meat and Livestock Australia have plans for their sectors to be carbon neutral by 2030? Only McCormack can make this three minutes stretch to four years. The election has come and gone. No one noticed because the climate wars have become so serious, Australian society is now divided by tribes, only recognisable by the shibboleth of how they pronounce \u201cideological\u201d. Oh \u2013 McCormack didn\u2019t answer the question, because he is seemingly incapable of answering anything, unless it includes some made-up country homily that played well in front of his shaving mirror. Accidentally letting out his secrets on how he makes policy decisions, Michael McCormack advises Labor to \u201clook a steer in the eye\u201d and ask it how it will stop its methane. I tell you what, methane emissions could drop right now if the deputy prime minister shut his mouth. For the record, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and Meat and Livestock Australia are both aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030. Michael McCormack has been summoned. It\u2019s something that happens when you place white bread in a toaster and hit the lever three times. Zali Steggall asks Scott Morrison about the cost of climate inaction. She receives a bunch of slogans for her troubles. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister agree with the liberal premier of New South Wales that her government\u2019s target of net zero emissions by 2050 is consistent with both the Paris agreement and the federal government\u2019s own commitment to the Paris agreement? Morrison: I refer the member to the answer by the minister for energy and emissions reduction which spells out clearly what the government has signed up to in terms of the Paris agreement, and I must say about the Paris agreement our commitment is a 26 per cent reduction in emissions over 2005, and I\u2019m pleased to tell the House that is ... now down by 13.1%, which means we are halfway there, and we have a plan to meet the 2030 commitment. The only problem is when I look at what those opposite are talking about, they have no idea what they want to commit to for 2030. They say: I don\u2019t know if I will tell you before the election or not. They want to talk about 30 years from now and can\u2019t even agree on what they want in 10 years. It continues in this vein. Another \u201chow amazing are we when it comes to climate\u201d dixer (so far, it has been Jason Falinski and Dave Sharma asking the questions \u2013 two of the self-declared \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d \u2013 so you know the government is *serious* about this, because here are two people who can say the words \u201cclimate change action\u201d without choking). Anthony Albanese to Angus Taylor: Isn\u2019t it the case cabinet committed to net zero emissions by 2050 when it signed up to the Paris agreement? Taylor: Mr Speaker, thank you. That\u2019s incorrect. We signed up to the Paris agreement ... which involves the world achieving net zero in the second half of the next century. That was our commitment, and of course we have strong targets, a clear plan and an enviable track record, as we\u2019ve just heard from the prime minister. Taylor to Sky News this morning: Well, there is that targeting built into the Paris agreement, where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century. That\u2019s already there. We\u2019ve got to do our bit. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology. The first dixer is on how amazing the government\u2019s climate policy is. SO, SO amazing. It\u2019s basically as if Blue Ivy grew up to take her rightful place as the ruler of us all, it is that amazing and special. And it\u2019s all been achieved without a carbon price, says Scott Morrison. Except ... it counts emissions reductions from when Labor was in power and had a carbon price, so that\u2019s not entirely right. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm he suggested to the New South Wales premier that the scope of the bushfire recovery cleanup funding proposal by NSW was not consistent with the black Saturday framework, in a bid to reduce the costs to the federal government? Morrison: As I confirmed to the journalist who put the same matter to us on the weekend, the proposal I put to the NSW premier was the proposal that was adopted in the proposal that was announced, the proposal that was arranged between the treasurer and the treasurer of NSW and the head of the national bushfire recovery agency and their counterparts in NSW. What we proposed is what was announced. There is a moment of silence for Hannah Clarke and her family. Then the questions begin. Anthony Albanese: I do want to say that I think we need to repel some of the attacks as well. We need to speak up when people make the sort of comments, including in the aftermath of this tragedy, that were entirely inappropriate. The existence of a standalone, specialist family court is a Labor legacy that we will defend. Whatever problems there are with the family law system, the existence of a standalone, specialist family court is not one of them. It\u2019s a necessary part of the solution. The government and opposition can work on this. All of us as members of parliament have a role to play. The memory of Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful children must galvanise a soul in further action to galvanise against violence against women and children. We can\u2019t accept this is normal. We have it in us to be so much better. Lives depend on it, as we see all too often. No one is saying Baxter represents all men. That Pauline Hanson pulls out that card, at this time, is abhorrent. Pauline Hanson\u2019s statement in the Senate is long on condemnation on Rowan Baxter but its ultimate conclusion was simply this: not all men. Hanson described the murders as the \u201cultimate act of betrayal\u201d and a \u201ccalculated, cowardly and evil act\u201d. The incident has \u201cfurther added fuel to an already twisted and difficult family law debate\u201d, she said, adding that \u201cmany decent men are deprived of their parental rights\u201d. She concluded: I am so angry at the selfish motivation [Rowan Baxter] has shown. Please do not let this bastard\u2019s actions reflect on all men. In the Senate, the MPs are also taking time to honour Hannah Clarke and her children. Anthony Albanese: Yet again a woman has lost her life to a former male partner. Yet again children have been robbed of their futures by a father who betrayed what should have been the most powerful bond of all \u2013 between a parent and their child. We cannot let their shocking and horrific deaths be the whole story. We must hold on to their names, hold on to the image of those four faces, so happy because they were with each other. The courage that Hannah showed, as the prime minister said, she left. That takes courage. She took her kids to what she thought was safety, only to find that that wasn\u2019t the case. That a man who had a record \u2013 a record \u2013 of crime, because it is a crime, against his own family conducted the ultimate crime, and in a manner which quite frankly is just beyond comprehension, really. It is just difficult to understand how that could possibly occur. Scott Morrison: There are never any excuses, there are none, or justifications for the evil that Hannah and her children experienced \u2013 never, not under any circumstances. With the states and territories and together as a parliament we will continue to work together to translate these words \u2013 that I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition will also state with the same passion \u2013 into actions and changes that make a real difference for women and children ... Let me read one of Hannah\u2019s last Instagram posts. It expressed the hope. She wrote: \u201cI am a strong woman\u201d \u2013 no doubt she was \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t sit around feeling sorry for myself, nor will I let anyone mistreat me again. I am a survivor, not a victim. I am in control of my life, and there is nothing I can\u2019t achieve. My girls will grow up being strong women who understand their worth.\u201d This hope was crushed when Hannah and her children were murdered. We must work together, as we have been, for as long as it takes to restore that hope to those we know right now, today in this country, who are living in exactly the same danger as Hannah and her children. Scott Morrison: Murder \u2013 that\u2019s what it is. Murder. Again last Thursday it shocked our country. When Jenny and I spoke about it, we just couldn\u2019t get our heads around it, as I\u2019m sure is the case for every single parent, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a parent or not \u2013 you can\u2019t imagine it. It is just too horrible to contemplate \u2013 the act itself and that somebody could perpetrate that act, particularly as a father. It is incomprehensible. And such depravity, that only makes you ask: how does such evil happen in our land? To the Clarke family, all of us here extend our sympathies and our love, but I must wonder if that could ever be enough to cover the profound grief. They have shown incredible resilience and character in the worst of all possible circumstances. As best we can, we also send the country\u2019s love to you. In your grief you have every right to be angry \u2013 furious \u2013 because everything we have done across this country to protect women and children didn\u2019t protect Hannah and her children from this evil. I believe state, territory and national governments, all of us, and importantly the judiciary, must all reflect again on these terrible murders. We must reflect on how and where the system failed Hannah and her children, as it has failed so many others. It is so frustrating. It is so devastating. While this was the action of the depraved and evil man, we know enough of the circumstances leading up to the murders to know this should not have happened, and there will rightly be an inquest in Queensland \u2013 and I commend the Queensland government for taking that action as they should. It will speak the truth, I have no doubt, as so many others have spoken the truth. And we already know this: Hannah deserved to feel safe and be safe, and to watch her joyous and wonderful children grow up. It starts with statements of indulgence about what happened to Hannah Clarke and her three children. And the murders Australia just can\u2019t seem to come to terms with. He\u2019s also not a fan of freedom of information requests. Centre Alliance wants an inquiry into domestic and family violence: Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick today announced that he will seek to establish an urgent Senate inquiry to pressure all levels of Australian government to take further action and commit greater resources to prevent violence against women and their children. \u201cThe shocking murder last week of Hannah Clarke and her three children is the latest tragedy in an all-too-repeated horror across our nation,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cAs a father of two daughters, my heartfelt desire is that they are able to contribute and thrive in a society that values their opinion and provides them the opportunity to live free from harm and fear. I want my daughters, and all our daughters, and Australian women, to always be safe in their homes and as they go about their lives.\u201d Queensland did this in 2015. The time for inquiries is probably done. The time for action is well past. One thing we could stop doing, though, is allowing Pauline Hanson and her ilk to lead the conversation. Hannah and all the women who came before her \u2013 and the ones who are being failed as we speak \u2013 deserve so much more than what we\u2019ve done. It was inevitable the \u201cdebate\u201d would end up here. Everything is great. From Adam Morton: Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have dipped slightly on the back of new clean energy and a sharp fall from agriculture due to the drought, but the decline was almost entirely wiped out by surging industrial pollution. Official data released on Monday revealed national emissions were down 0.3% in the year to September. Emissions from electricity generation fell 2% (3.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide) as the now-filled renewable energy target boosted invested in solar and wind power. Pollution from agriculture fell even further \u2013 4.1m tonnes, or 5.8% \u2013 due to the impact on livestock of the historic eastern seaboard drought and north Queensland floods. But fugitive emissions, released during coal and gas extraction, were estimated to have jumped 6% (3.3m tonnes). Pollution from stationary energy \u2013 which includes the manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors \u2013 was up 2.6% (2.6m tonnes). Greg Hunt has given a short update on the coronavirus (Covid-19) situation: All of those passengers have left the Howard Springs temporary quarantine facility and, as a consequence of that, they are now free to go about day-to-day activities. No passengers in that group were diagnosed or confirmed with coronavirus. So I think that is a very, very important operation which has shown the importance of quarantine, and the results of the seven passengers \u2013 who came from the Diamond Princess \u2013 reaffirm absolutely not just the reason why we sought to airlift them back to Australia, but the reason why on medical advice we imposed a supervised quarantine arrangement, and I think that was strong but very clear medical advice. He has to leave because the division bells are ringing in the House. It is the downhill run to question time. There is not a lot happening in the chambers at the moment. That just gives more time for the stupid to spill into the hallways After a letter from Anthony Albanese (which we are told was hand-delivered), speaker Tony Smith has agreed to allow the House to stand in a moment of silence for Hannah Clarke and her children, Laianah, 4, Aaliyah, 6, and Trey, 3. And then every single MP needs to get very, very loud indeed about domestic and family violence \u2013 and those who attempt to excuse it with the abhorrent and deliberately outrageous \u201cdriven to it\u201d lie. Pauline Hanson was just on her feet in the Senate, arguing against Larissa Waters\u2019 bill to close the Galilee basin, because it\u2019s Australia and a day ending in y. She doesn\u2019t think we have had an \u201cactual debate on hearing from the scientists about what global warming is about\u201d. Which I take to mean she either wants us to: a) debate on whether we should hear from scientists on climate change or b) listen to the scientists\u2019 debate about what global warming is about. Hanson is paid $211,250 as a base salary for these gems. She also gets $44,100 in super contributions a year and $32,000 in electorate allowance. Plus a car. As a base. She did manage one truth bomb, though, as she spoke about climate policy: That\u2019s the problem within Australia, that we have listened to the fear mongers. The poster child for Australian Rhodes scholars. Pauline Hanson is helping to lead the latest family law court inquiry, which was set up by the government as a salve for her, despite the government having multiple reports into how the family court system could be improved \u2013 the most latest recommendations of which have not been implemented. She also gets paid more to be the deputy chair of that committee, and gets to comment on family court issues, because the government gave her that legitimacy with the inquiry. Great work by all involved, really. Just brilliant. I don\u2019t have enough evens to can\u2019t today. I just don\u2019t. Go back to bed, everyone. Wake me up when the apocalypse is half done. Larissa Waters introduced a bill in the Senate to keep the Galilee basin closed to coal mining, saying: The Galilee basin is a carbon bomb and in reality the science demands we don\u2019t open up a single new coal mine. We need to keep that Galilee coal in the ground and today I have a bill that will do just that. If the Galilee basin were to be mined and it was a country, it would be the seventh-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Australia\u2019s emissions continue to rise and millions of hectares of the country were burnt over summer due to climate-fuelled bushfires. We desperately need a climate plan and that climate plan means getting out of thermal coal. The numbers are not there for it to pass the Senate \u2013 and there is zero chance of it passing the House. Just a reminder that Pauline Hanson is paid to say things like this on the Nine Network\u2019s Today show: Let\u2019s just make it quite clear: I made a very strong comment on my Facebook page. It was a horrendous act, what he did to his children. It was a tragedy and I feel very deeply sorry for everyone, family and friends involved in this treacherous \u2013 what he did to his former wife and his children. But Bettina Arndt should not be stripped of her Order of Australia. She is clearly stating what she thinks and what a police officer said. This is why I have pushed for the family law inquiry to get behind what is happening on this. You know, this has been for a week we have been in the news nearly every day about this horrific tragedy. But we don\u2019t hear much about it when a woman has murdered her children by driving a car into a tree \u2013 she threw out a suicide note. Or the woman who doused her husband with fuel and set him alight and said she was possibly driven to it. A lot of people are driven to this, to do these acts for one reason or another. Hopefully the family law inquiry will get to the bottom of it. But don\u2019t bastardise all men out there, or women for that matter, because these things happen. Let\u2019s get to the bottom of it, why it is happening, and hopefully find the answers so it never happens again. Don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2013 the Today show also highlighted it in a tweet: AAP has looked at Barnaby Joyce\u2019s latest brain spurt, so we don\u2019t have to: Barnaby Joyce is sick of most senators being from capital cities and has a plan to change that. The Nationals backbencher has introduced a private member\u2019s bill to parliament which would split each state into six regions \u2013 like mega-electorates \u2013 that each vote for two senators. \u201cThis is something that is so important,\u201d he told the lower house on Monday. \u201cWe need for our Senate to have a constituency and to have the capacity to represent a geographic area.\u201d Joyce said that in most instances, 11-out-of-12 senators came from capital cities. He also pointed out that New York had two senators, while Adelaide had 11. \u201cWe need to make sure that as the seats get bigger and bigger and bigger in the House of Representatives in regional areas, that this is offset by the capacity to get more Senate representation.\u201d Under the plan \u2013 which was seconded by independent MP Bob Katter \u2013 no region could be bigger than 30 per cent of the state\u2019s landmass and the capital city would be confined to a single region. Joyce said this would also help to improve indigenous representation in parliament. The backbencher, who recently launched a failed bid to reclaim the Nationals leadership, said the proposal would not warrant a change to the Constitution. It was up to the parliament to change how senators were elected. Senate president Scott Ryan was quick to shoot down Mr Joyce\u2019s idea after he floated it last year. \u201cThe current Senate is actually very reflective of the national vote despite the differences in state populations,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut this proposal would destroy that.\u201d Father Frank Brennan, one of the Ruddock review panel members who conducted the inquiry on religious freedom, has had some interesting thoughts on the government\u2019s religious discrimination bill and the way the debate has gone. Brennan told the Australian Catholic University on Thursday: \u201cThe Morrison government has decided not to pursue the Ruddock recommendation of a clean, lean religious discrimination act. Rather, in response to those who have long advocated a religious freedom act, the Morrison government is attempting to formulate what we might call a Religious Discrimination PLUS Bill which will include some bells and whistles you would not expect to find in a standard piece of anti-discrimination legislation.\u201d Brennan agreed with the Australian Human Rights Commission that legislating for individual cases - such as Israel Folau and Archbishop Porteous- \u201cis not good legislative practice\u201d and said that he is \u201cnot convinced\u201d that the commonwealth overriding Victorian rules requiring doctors to refer patients for abortions is the best way to go. Brennan predicted the bill will not pass, and hopes the states will fix issues with their laws without commonwealth intervention: \u201cI think there is little prospect of any Religious Discrimination PLUS Bill passing the Senate. When such a bill is ultimately rejected by the Senate, I do hope that our federal politicians will have the good sense to legislate a neat and clean Religious Discrimination Act, and our politicians in the NSW and South Australian parliaments will have the good sense to bring their legislation up to an appropriate standard honouring our commitments and undertakings under the ICCPR.\u201d Brennan noted that the Coalition and Labor had agreed that schools should not be able to discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, but said he \u201c[despaired] at our parliament\u2019s protracted delay and incapacity to deliver on this commitment\u201d. A friend of the blog has also pointed me in the direction of this handy website, which, with the help of Monash university resources, is helping to track those looking at net zero emissions by 2050 I have just been reminded by a reader of the Montreal protocol, which was signed in the late 1980s and was designed to phase out the chemicals that were harming the ozone layer. It\u2019s working. Practically the whole world signed up. And guess what? The world hasn\u2019t ended. The science outlining what was happening to the ozone layer was published in 1973. Less than 15 years later, an international agreement was created and signed. Imagine having that \u201cdebate\u201d now. At the same time: Just some of those driving the energy policy in this country at the moment, being completely normal humans. One of the reasons Barnaby Joyce wants this bill is because he believes the regions don\u2019t receive good enough representation. The same regions which are represented by his party. At the UN conference of parties (Cop), Chile\u2019s environment minister Carolina Schmidt laid out the alliance of \u201csilly\u201d countries, cities, businesses and investors who have signed up to \u201cfollow the recommendations of science as regards climate change\u201d (as in, working towards net-zero emissions by 2050). There are 73 parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors. So. Far. For the record, the list of countries who have committed to a \u201csilly\u201d zero net emissions target by 2050, include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Beliz, Benin, Cape Verde, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Ethiopia, European Union, Federated Stated of Micronesia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Grenada, Guyana, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Kiribat, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Maldives, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Namibia, Nauru Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niue, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Portugal, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Spain, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu. It\u2019s silly to have a target without a plan. But apparently you can have a \u201cstrategy\u201d without a target. Or a plan. This is the level of stupid we have reached today. Compounding that stupid, is the fact we have signed up to the Paris agreement. We keep hearing about how we are meeting our obligations. A big part of the Paris agreement is to work out how to become carbon neutral by the second half of the century. Which is just another way of saying \u2013 ZERO NET EMISSIONS BY 2050. And what did Angus Taylor say this morning, in between talking about how silly Labor\u2019s \u201cuncocked\u201d policy was? Well, there is that targeting built into the Paris agreement where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century. That\u2019s already there. We\u2019ve got to do our bit. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology. I swear I have become dumber today just following this \u201cdebate\u201d. I have actually lost brain cells. We are literally at \u201cYOUR FACE IS\u201d phase of this debate. *packs bags, moves to Mars* The bells are ringing, and with it, my ears. In the midst of all of this, the government is looking at expanding the powers of the Australian Signals Directorate \u2013 a story first broken by Annika Smethurst in 2018 \u2013 who not only got a bunch of quite personal denials for her trouble, but now lives with the threat of prosecution over her head, after the AFP raided her home and office. The government wants ASD to be able to spy on Australians, suspected of serious crimes, within Australia. Currently, it can only focus on overseas servers. The moment an investigation reaches Australian shores, it has to stop. The ABC reported last week the government was advancing the proposal, although it is yet to confirm it. The argument is that Australia\u2019s crime-fighting and intelligence agencies should have the powers they need to follow investigations into child abuse and terrorism in Australia. No one debates that. The problem is, this government has a habit of expanding national security powers without actually laying out how broad those powers are. Everyone wants paedophiles and terrorists stopped. But suddenly, it becomes anyone suspected of a crime that brings more than two to three years imprisonment, if convicted. And then a whole heap of other people are having their personal affairs opened up to spy agencies. You don\u2019t have to be convicted. Just suspected. This government has not been shy with the national security brush. There have been 19 tranches of national security legislation since the government came into power. Do you know what they all do? Chances are, you don\u2019t. From AAP: Opposition frontbencher Jenny McAllister is introducing legislation to enhance oversight of the increasingly powerful agencies, as recommended by a Coalition government review three years ago. \u201cUnfortunately, like its approach on so many matters of accountability, the Morrison government has dragged the chain on implementing important recommendations from its own review,\u201d she said on Monday. \u201cStrong and effective oversight mechanisms do not stand in opposition to our national security arrangements \u2013 they are best understood as an essential part of them.\u201d Liberal senator Sarah Henderson has said she believes She Who Should Never Be Named Because She Feeds Off The Outrage should have her Order of Australia award revoked, given her comments following the Camp Hill tragedy. Samantha Maiden at the New Daily reported the governor general has received complaints about the award, which have been forwarded to the council, with the honour now up for review. No one knows who nominated her. Or who supported that nomination. And yet, here we are. The not-actually-a-psychologist has made some pretty abhorrent comments before this. We all know them. And she was still given the honour. It seems almost anything is forgivable in this country, if you claim your right to free speech is under attack. Unless of course, you are standing up for a minority, pointing out an inconvenient truth or trying to point out the facts about climate change. The government\u2019s big argument against Labor\u2019s zero emissions by 2050 policy, which is something that every single state and territory has taken up, including Liberal governments, and is something the resources industry and farmers are in support of, is that New Zealand has quarantined its agriculture industry from its target. So suddenly, after years and years of rhetoric over how we don\u2019t need to look to other countries for our policies, including New Zealand, in the wake of its (repeated) offer to take additional refugees from Nauru, New Zealand is the gold standard of policy. Parliament starts at 10am. Tellingly, Joel Fitzgibbon is on board with Labor\u2019s plan. Here he is writing for his local paper, the Newcastle Herald over the weekend: The aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050 (zero net emissions) offers a conservative and low-risk path to satisfying the commitment Malcolm Turnbull made in Paris on our behalf back in 2015. First, it provides plenty of time to think and act, including the time needed to embrace existing and future technologies. Second, it stands a chance of securing bipartisanship and therefore, broader community support. Third, it turns the focus to efforts to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and away from an almost singular focus on reducing emissions. In other words, building on existing methods for drawing carbon from the atmosphere and finding innovative new ways of doing so. This is what \u201cnet\u201d means: working towards a time when we are putting no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than we are taking out. For a reminder on what Labor\u2019s policy is, here is where Katharine Murphy broke the story on Thursday: Labor has locked in behind a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and will oppose taxpayer funding of new coal-fired power plants, in the party\u2019s first major decisions about climate policy for the next federal election. As well as adopting the clear 2050 target that Scott Morrison appears reluctant to sign up to, in part because of rolling combat within the Coalition, Guardian Australia understands shadow cabinet has also decided to oppose using carryover credits from the Kyoto period to meet future emissions reduction targets. The Morrison government plans to use carryover credits to meet about half of Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction target, and departmental officials have confirmed they are not aware of any countries other than Australia planning to use controversial accounting methods to meet international climate commitments. No target without a plan, says Angus Taylor, which you would think is actually part of the government\u2019s job \u2013 developing plans. Given it is actually in government. \u201cWhat we\u2019re not open to, is a target, any target, which has got no plan, is uncocked and unfunded,\u201d he says. Why would anyone invest if they don\u2019t know what the target is, Sky News asks Taylor. People invest in all sorts of industries without government targets, I mean there are a lot of frustrated central planners out there. They want to target it in every industry, but the airline industry doesn\u2019t need one, farmers don\u2019t need one. Look, businesses set their own targets and get on with it. We do have a target for 2030 for emissions reduction. So does the government have a long-term strategy or a long-term target? Well, there is that targeting built into the Paris agreement where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century. That\u2019s already there. We\u2019ve got to do our bit. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology. This debate is all happening while the market is actively moving away from thermal coal. BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest fund managers, if not the largest, is moving away from coal investments. India has announced it will phase out thermal coal import from the 2023-2024. The change is coming no matter how much Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack and Angus Taylor shake their fists at clouds. The bigger question is whether Australia\u2019s workforce is being prepared for the inevitable market change. Based on history, it doesn\u2019t look like it. Is there a single voter who finds any of this productive? Who wants this? Who thinks, yes, that is what I want in my politicians? \u201cIdeological path.\u201d As expected, the government has lost its mind over Labor\u2019s zero emissions by 2050 policy, despite major private interests, including BHP, the Business Council of Australia, as well as the UK conservatives, and practically every single state and territory in Australia already on board. Angus Taylor says we don\u2019t need targets. Except for the 2030 target. That\u2019s fine. But 2050 \u2013 pffft. What the government has is a long-term strategy. See the difference? People will just get on with it, he says. It has to be \u201ctechnology not taxes which lead the way\u201d, Taylor says. Labor has ruled out a carbon tax. Stunningly though, Taylor hasn\u2019t been the headline act today, because Barnaby Joyce is feelingly stunningly unleashed, and decided to bring his particular brand of discourse \u2013 yelling over people in hallways \u2013 to a press conference with Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon. Here\u2019s a taster from the Barnaby Joyce school of debate: What a load of rubbish. What a load of pig manure. He\u2019s going to reach out to you. He\u2019s going to reach out to the coalmines. Don\u2019t worry, fellas, we\u2019re reaching out to you. We\u2019re reaching out and saying you\u2019re going to lose your job. Reaching out, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to do it. You\u2019re going to make the equation work by putting trees back on people\u2019s properties whether they like it or not. We\u2019re going to let the shrubs grow back on the country. It\u2019s not just mercury which is in retrograde \u2013 Australia\u2019s political discourse is so backwards on this topic, it\u2019s like watching your neighbours take up the wheel and pretending you\u2019re fine just pushing your rocks around with your back. Oh, and emissions in Australia dropped by just 0.3% in the year to September last year. NAILING IT. We\u2019ll bring you all of the latest meltdowns, as well as everything else \u2013 hey, maybe we\u2019ll get some legislation to talk about this fortnight \u2013 with Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin at your service. I\u2019ve had about a third of a coffee. Blessed be. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "The world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the coronavirus, according to experts, who warn that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it, after major outbreaks forced Italy and Iran to introduce stringent internal travel restrictions and South Korea\u2019s president placed the country on red alert. Some of the countries most affected by the virus are scrambling to halt its progress two days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said the international community needed to act quickly before the narrowing \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d closed completely. With almost 78,000 cases of Covid-19 now confirmed across the globe, experts say the situation will soon reach a critical threshold. In 11 north Italian towns, 50,000 people have been in lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. In Iran, the authorities have ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces as \u201ca preventative measure\u201d. On Sunday, South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on \u201cred alert\u201d after it reported its sixth death and more than 600 infections. And four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers flown to the UK on Saturday have tested positive for Covid-19, the Chief Medical Officer for England said on Sunday. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13. While the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and an authority on the new coronavirus infection, echoed Tedros\u2019s warning and said the time for containing the disease was running out. \u201cThe director general of the WHO has recently spoken of a narrowing of the window of opportunity to control the current epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tipping point after which our ability to prevent a global pandemic ends seems a lot closer after the past 24 hours.\u201d Hunter said that while cases were declining in China, where the outbreak began, the weekend had seen some \u201cextremely concerning developments elsewhere\u201d. He said the surge in South Korean cases had been unprecedented so far in the epidemic, adding: \u201cThe identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to be quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.\u201d Hunter also said the situation in Iran could have major implications for the Middle East. \u201cA further problem with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region,\u201d he said. Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, pointed out that case numbers in Italy had doubled between Friday and Saturday. \u201cThis is an important stage of the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cFast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.\u201d Two people have died from the virus in Italy since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 40 miles south-east of Milan. Those living in the affected areas now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival were cancelled and Milan fashion week was also affected. Iran has recorded eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital, Tehran, seven in the city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said. Pakistan responded by closing its land border with Iran, while Afghanistan said it was suspending travel to Iran \u201cto prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public\u201d. Turkey also closed its borders and said it would halt incoming flights, adding that all motorways and railways at the border would be shut on Sunday afternoon. Jordan, meanwhile, will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly outbreak. Announcing his decision to raise South Korea\u2019s alert level on Sunday, Moon said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take \u201cunprecedented, powerful\u201d measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by \u201cregulations\u201d. As his country struggled to contain theoutbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as \u201ca very important moment\u201d, the news agency Yonhap said. Of the 123 new cases, 75 were related to the Shincheonji church in Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, and a neighbouring hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers had been screened for the virus. The raising of the alert level came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country\u2019s management of the outbreak. Warning that China\u2019s virus epidemic was \u201cstill grim and complex,\u201d the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called on Sunday for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting the spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist party\u2019s response as \u201ctimely and effective\u201d in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the Xinhua news agency. \u201cThe current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,\u201d Xinhua cited Xi as saying. \u201cPrevention and control are at the most critical stage.\u201d AFP and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "An online flight booking company with links to collapsed budget airfare company Bestjet has left travellers thousands of dollars out of pocket after it entered voluntary administration just days after customers say they handed over money to the firm. Sydney-based Fly365 appointed a voluntary administrator on Friday, wiping both its website and Facebook page and leaving customers who believed they had secured flight bookings through the company with little information about how to recoup their money. The company is just one of a number of online flight-booking agencies to collapse in recent months, and its demise raises questions about the adequacy of self-regulation in the industry. Among the hundreds of Fly365 customers to have potentially lost money from the company\u2019s collapse are James Price and Steven Somers, who spent $11,000 booking flights to Europe for themselves and family members on Friday, 14 February. The couple booked the trip after Somers was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in January. \u201cWe decided that with a host of potential travel issues in the future we\u2019d go while we still could, we wanted to travel with our family to Europe,\u201d Price said. The money was withdrawn from their account five days later, but when Somers attempted to choose seats on the flight he discovered the booking reference number didn\u2019t work. The couple attempted to contact Fly365 on Friday, only to receive a one-line response stating the company was \u201cno longer trading\u201d. \u201cPlease be advised that Fly365 Pty Ltd is no longer trading. Please contact your airline directly regarding bookings you have made,\u201d the email seen by the Guardian read. After finding out the name of the liquidator and being added to a list of creditors, Somers set up a Facebook group to see whether others had also lost money making bookings with the company. 24 hours later the group now has more than 250 members, with some saying they made bookings with the company only the day before it entered voluntary liquidation while others have been unable to receive refunds on flights cancelled due to the spread of the coronavirus. But Fly365 is just the latest in a string of online booking companies to go belly-up. In January last year the collapse of online booking site Bestjetleft travellers who booked flights through the company thousands of dollars out of pocket and searching for answers. Bestjet was founded by Rachel James, the wife of former Air Australia owner Michael James, just weeks after the budget airline\u2019s high-profile collapse in 2012. The company\u2019s former general manager, Scott Mayne, is also a director of Fly365, according to documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. Unlike Bestjet, however, Fly365 was accredited with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, the organisation charged with the self-regulation of travel agencies in Australia. On Monday Afta\u2019s chief executive, Jayson Westbury, said in a statement that the organisation would give \u201cserious consideration\u201d to reviewing the way it applies its travel accreditation scheme, known as Atas, to online travel agents. \u201cThis is a very regrettable situation and Afta strongly believes that contributing circumstances beyond the control of Afta and the Atas scheme have resulted in this outcome,\u201d Westbury said. \u201cAfta does all that it can to monitor and review travel businesses who hold Atas accreditation and for the most part this has enabled Afta to predict certain outcomes \u2013 but on this occasion, unfortunately, Afta was not in a position to either provide advance support to the business prior to its failure or predict this outcome. \u201cWhile the liquidation process will need to run its course, a much deeper review of the situation is being undertaken by Afta and a further review of the Atas scheme will be given serious consideration as it applies to online travel agents in Australia.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For someone who was raised in Italy, came of age in Philadelphia, and ultimately established himself as a star in southern California, it is telling that Kobe Bryant once referred to China as his \u201chome away from home.\u201d Bryant first visited the country in 1998 to host a basketball camp, a year after he entered the NBA straight out of high school. The trips would become a fixture of Bryant\u2019s offseason during his 20-year career. There he was, wowing fans with slam dunks on the Great Wall. And there he was, getting mobbed at airports in scenes reminiscent of Beatlemania. \u201cI thought I was famous,\u201d remarked LeBron James at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, \u201cuntil I got here with Kobe.\u201d</p> <p>Bryant had the best-selling sports jersey in China for years, and by the time he retired in 2016, he was far and away <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15833269/nba-kobe-bryant-remains-no-1-athlete-china-ahead-messi-ronaldo-lebron-james\">the country\u2019s most popular athlete.</a> A reported 110 million people tuned in to Tencent, the NBA\u2019s digital streaming partner in China, to watch Bryant\u2019s last game for the Lakers. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for me to walk around here than in the States,\u201d Bryant said during a 2013 visit. \u201cIn the States, you get a lot of recognition. They say, \u2018Hi.\u2019 They want autographs and pictures. But here, it\u2019s uncontrollable. They rush you and surround you to the point where you can\u2019t go out.\u201d Bryant\u2019s shocking death last month<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/27/asia/asia-mourns-kobe-bryant-intl-hnk/index.html\"> prompted a similar mass outpouring</a> on Weibo, essentially China\u2019s version of Twitter, where he had posted a video message commemorating Chinese New Year to his nine million followers just two days before his helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California.</p> <p>Bryant\u2019s status in China serves as a powerful symbol of the NBA\u2019s successful global outreach; his rise in popularity dovetailed with basketball\u2019s own precipitous growth in the country. But the league that Bryant helped popularize there remains off the air on Chinese state television, the fallout from a months-long standoff over a top NBA executive\u2019s expression of solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As the NBA commences the second half of its season, and continues to mourn the untimely loss of a legend, there is a sense of hope that the league is close to repairing its relationship with China \u2013 even if there are questions over whether it will ever be the same.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/23/nba-travails-china-caution-premier-league\">NBA\u2019s travails in China a cautionary tale for the Premier League | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have indeed been signals in recent weeks of a potential thawing of tensions between the two sides. Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador to the United States, offered a tribute to Bryant on Twitter last month, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbCuiTiankai/status/1221869773828567040?s=20\">praising</a> the Lakers great \u201cfor his contribution to the world of sport and to #ChinaUS people-to-people exchanges.\u201d Chinese consul general Huang Ping <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3049014/coronavirus-chinese-consul-general-new-york-thanks-nba-its\">offered gratitude</a> earlier this month for the NBA\u2019s $1.4m donation to Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak originated. At a press conference held during the league\u2019s all-star festivities in Chicago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said his sense is that the games will return to China Central Television (CCTV), Chinese state-run television, \u201cat some point in the future.\u201d The NBA has not been broadcast on CCTV since October, when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey caused a furor by tweeting, and quickly deleting, a message urging his followers to \u201cstand with Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>At the league\u2019s midseason celebration in Chicago, Silver made it clear that the ball is in China\u2019s court. Silver added that \u201cthere continues to be enormous interest for the NBA in China,\u201d and that his \u201csense is that there will be a return to normalcy fairly soon.\u201d The All-Star events in Chicago were distributed on Tencent, with which the NBA inked a five-year, $1.5bn deal last summer to continue as the league\u2019s exclusive Chinese digital streaming partner. Despite the ongoing blackout on CCTV, Tencent resumed showing a few NBA games every night not long after the Morey dispute, and has continued to do so since. <a href=\"https://marketcast.com/november-fair-pay-to-play-act-could-have-a-negative-effect-on-college-sports/\">A recent survey</a> of sports business executives found that more than 60% believe that the firestorm surrounding Morey\u2019s tweet will have a \u201cnon-existent\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d effect on the league\u2019s business in China five years from now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c2ae5e3b6a2cb872bac6e578918068ff312dfb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2ae5e3b6a2cb872bac6e578918068ff312dfb3/0_0_4800_3112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Chinese Communist Party activists protest outside Staples Center, home of the LA Lakers and Clippers, in the wake of the NBA\u2019s confrontation with China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Chinese Communist Party activists protest outside Staples Center, home of the LA Lakers and Clippers, in the wake of the NBA\u2019s confrontation with China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cThe question is: what does normalcy mean?\u201d Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown University who served as director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council from 2004-2007, told the Guardian. \u201cWhen Adam Silver talks about a return to normalcy, I assume he\u2019s talking about NBA access to Chinese viewers and the Chinese market, but the real question is: is that the only way to measure normal? Is the new normal that there\u2019s essentially a de facto muzzle on players saying anything related to political issues in China?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf tanks roll through Hong Kong,\u201d Cha added, \u201care they just not going to say anything?\u201d</p> <p>Although Silver rebuffed China\u2019s purported demands to sack Morey, and defended <a href=\"https://pr.nba.com/adam-silvers-statement-on-the-nba-and-china/\">his right to freedom of expression</a>, the NBA and its players were not exactly hailed as profiles in courage in the wake of the controversy. A spokesperson for the NBA responded initially by saying that the league recognized the \u201cviews expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d LeBron James, who has personified the league\u2019s embrace of political activism perhaps more than any other player, said Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on the matter. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/disgusting-u-s-politicians-call-out-nba-cowing-china-amid-n1063161\">Lawmakers in Washington chastised</a> the league for that response. Republican senator Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, commended Morey for calling out \u201cthe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong,\u201d and pilloried the NBA for \u201cshamefully retreating\u201d out of financial concerns.</p> <p>The fiscal implications have loomed large over this saga. Speaking in Chicago this month, Silver said he expected the NBA to lose \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d over the standoff with China due to the TV blackout and the severed business relationships that resulted from the dispute. That, he noted, was much less than some of the doomsday forecasts that projected the controversy to cost the league billions.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly, probably less than $400m, maybe even less than that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s substantial. I don\u2019t want to run from that. We were taken off the air in China for a period of time, and it caused our many business partners in China to feel it was, therefore, inappropriate to have ongoing relationships with us.\u201d But Silver once again stressed that he doesn\u2019t \u201chave any sense that there\u2019s any permanent damage to our business there.\u201d It\u2019s a business relationship rooted in the NBA\u2019s emergence as China\u2019s most popular sports league, the fruits of the league\u2019s decades-long push into the Asian market.</p> <p>In 1992 under the late David Stern, Silver\u2019s predecessor as commissioner, the NBA opened its first Asian office in Hong Kong. Stern, who served as commissioner from 1984 until 2014, is widely credited for exporting the league to China. In 1987, Stern went to Beijing with a demo tape in hand in the hopes of brokering a historic deal. There, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/magazine/NBA-in-China.html?ref=jimyardley\">he forged a relationship between the NBA and CCTV</a>, offering the state broadcaster videotapes of league footage each week in exchange for advertising revenue. Stern often recalled trips to the country in the 1990s, when locals would ask about the \u201cteam of the red oxen,\u201d better known in the English speaking world as the Chicago Bulls.</p> <p>But the watershed moment came in 2002, when Yao Ming was drafted by the Rockets. In Yao, China could finally claim its own first bona fide star playing in its most beloved sporting league. Powered by ballots cast back home, Yao was twice the leader of NBA All-Star game fan voting. He was named an All-Star in each of his eight seasons for the Rockets, a career that coincided with the NBA staging more events in China. In 2004, the Rockets played a pair of preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing, marking the first time the NBA tipped off on Chinese soil in 25 years.</p> <p>Since 2007, the NBA has held preseason games in China every year except one. About 800 million viewers in China watched the NBA last season, and modest estimates of the amount of revenue the league generates there are generally pegged at about $500m annually. NBA China, which launched in 2008 and handles the league\u2019s business ventures in the country, is worth more than $4bn, according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/10/09/the-nbas-soaring-franchise-value-growth-at-stake-with-china-feud/\">Forbes</a>.</p> <p>The Rockets also loom large over all of this, of course.

      "bodyText": "For someone who was raised in Italy, came of age in Philadelphia, and ultimately established himself as a star in southern California, it is telling that Kobe Bryant once referred to China as his \u201chome away from home.\u201d Bryant first visited the country in 1998 to host a basketball camp, a year after he entered the NBA straight out of high school. The trips would become a fixture of Bryant\u2019s offseason during his 20-year career. There he was, wowing fans with slam dunks on the Great Wall. And there he was, getting mobbed at airports in scenes reminiscent of Beatlemania. \u201cI thought I was famous,\u201d remarked LeBron James at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, \u201cuntil I got here with Kobe.\u201d Bryant had the best-selling sports jersey in China for years, and by the time he retired in 2016, he was far and away the country\u2019s most popular athlete. A reported 110 million people tuned in to Tencent, the NBA\u2019s digital streaming partner in China, to watch Bryant\u2019s last game for the Lakers. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for me to walk around here than in the States,\u201d Bryant said during a 2013 visit. \u201cIn the States, you get a lot of recognition. They say, \u2018Hi.\u2019 They want autographs and pictures. But here, it\u2019s uncontrollable. They rush you and surround you to the point where you can\u2019t go out.\u201d Bryant\u2019s shocking death last month prompted a similar mass outpouring on Weibo, essentially China\u2019s version of Twitter, where he had posted a video message commemorating Chinese New Year to his nine million followers just two days before his helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California. Bryant\u2019s status in China serves as a powerful symbol of the NBA\u2019s successful global outreach; his rise in popularity dovetailed with basketball\u2019s own precipitous growth in the country. But the league that Bryant helped popularize there remains off the air on Chinese state television, the fallout from a months-long standoff over a top NBA executive\u2019s expression of solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As the NBA commences the second half of its season, and continues to mourn the untimely loss of a legend, there is a sense of hope that the league is close to repairing its relationship with China \u2013 even if there are questions over whether it will ever be the same. There have indeed been signals in recent weeks of a potential thawing of tensions between the two sides. Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador to the United States, offered a tribute to Bryant on Twitter last month, praising the Lakers great \u201cfor his contribution to the world of sport and to #ChinaUS people-to-people exchanges.\u201d Chinese consul general Huang Ping offered gratitude earlier this month for the NBA\u2019s $1.4m donation to Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak originated. At a press conference held during the league\u2019s all-star festivities in Chicago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said his sense is that the games will return to China Central Television (CCTV), Chinese state-run television, \u201cat some point in the future.\u201d The NBA has not been broadcast on CCTV since October, when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey caused a furor by tweeting, and quickly deleting, a message urging his followers to \u201cstand with Hong Kong.\u201d At the league\u2019s midseason celebration in Chicago, Silver made it clear that the ball is in China\u2019s court. Silver added that \u201cthere continues to be enormous interest for the NBA in China,\u201d and that his \u201csense is that there will be a return to normalcy fairly soon.\u201d The All-Star events in Chicago were distributed on Tencent, with which the NBA inked a five-year, $1.5bn deal last summer to continue as the league\u2019s exclusive Chinese digital streaming partner. Despite the ongoing blackout on CCTV, Tencent resumed showing a few NBA games every night not long after the Morey dispute, and has continued to do so since. A recent survey of sports business executives found that more than 60% believe that the firestorm surrounding Morey\u2019s tweet will have a \u201cnon-existent\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d effect on the league\u2019s business in China five years from now. Others aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cThe question is: what does normalcy mean?\u201d Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown University who served as director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council from 2004-2007, told the Guardian. \u201cWhen Adam Silver talks about a return to normalcy, I assume he\u2019s talking about NBA access to Chinese viewers and the Chinese market, but the real question is: is that the only way to measure normal? Is the new normal that there\u2019s essentially a de facto muzzle on players saying anything related to political issues in China?\u201d \u201cIf tanks roll through Hong Kong,\u201d Cha added, \u201care they just not going to say anything?\u201d Although Silver rebuffed China\u2019s purported demands to sack Morey, and defended his right to freedom of expression, the NBA and its players were not exactly hailed as profiles in courage in the wake of the controversy. A spokesperson for the NBA responded initially by saying that the league recognized the \u201cviews expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d LeBron James, who has personified the league\u2019s embrace of political activism perhaps more than any other player, said Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on the matter. Lawmakers in Washington chastised the league for that response. Republican senator Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, commended Morey for calling out \u201cthe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong,\u201d and pilloried the NBA for \u201cshamefully retreating\u201d out of financial concerns. The fiscal implications have loomed large over this saga. Speaking in Chicago this month, Silver said he expected the NBA to lose \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d over the standoff with China due to the TV blackout and the severed business relationships that resulted from the dispute. That, he noted, was much less than some of the doomsday forecasts that projected the controversy to cost the league billions. \u201cCertainly, probably less than $400m, maybe even less than that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s substantial. I don\u2019t want to run from that. We were taken off the air in China for a period of time, and it caused our many business partners in China to feel it was, therefore, inappropriate to have ongoing relationships with us.\u201d But Silver once again stressed that he doesn\u2019t \u201chave any sense that there\u2019s any permanent damage to our business there.\u201d It\u2019s a business relationship rooted in the NBA\u2019s emergence as China\u2019s most popular sports league, the fruits of the league\u2019s decades-long push into the Asian market. In 1992 under the late David Stern, Silver\u2019s predecessor as commissioner, the NBA opened its first Asian office in Hong Kong. Stern, who served as commissioner from 1984 until 2014, is widely credited for exporting the league to China. In 1987, Stern went to Beijing with a demo tape in hand in the hopes of brokering a historic deal. There, he forged a relationship between the NBA and CCTV, offering the state broadcaster videotapes of league footage each week in exchange for advertising revenue. Stern often recalled trips to the country in the 1990s, when locals would ask about the \u201cteam of the red oxen,\u201d better known in the English speaking world as the Chicago Bulls. But the watershed moment came in 2002, when Yao Ming was drafted by the Rockets. In Yao, China could finally claim its own first bona fide star playing in its most beloved sporting league. Powered by ballots cast back home, Yao was twice the leader of NBA All-Star game fan voting. He was named an All-Star in each of his eight seasons for the Rockets, a career that coincided with the NBA staging more events in China. In 2004, the Rockets played a pair of preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing, marking the first time the NBA tipped off on Chinese soil in 25 years. Since 2007, the NBA has held preseason games in China every year except one. About 800 million viewers in China watched the NBA last season, and modest estimates of the amount of revenue the league generates there are generally pegged at about $500m annually. NBA China, which launched in 2008 and handles the league\u2019s business ventures in the country, is worth more than $4bn, according to Forbes. The Rockets also loom large over all of this, of course. They are, by virtue of Yao\u2019s connection, the NBA\u2019s most popular team in China, bringing the league\u2019s success story in conflict with the crisis over Morey\u2019s tweet. Since then, Rockets games have been banned, forcing the team\u2019s fans in China to resort to illicit web streams. Cha wonders if the team will return to CCTV or Tencent even when the rest of the league is back on Chinese airwaves. He pointed to the frayed relationship between China and Norway, which stemmed from the late human rights activist Liu Xiaobo winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, as a potentially useful precedent. Liu was incarcerated in a Chinese prison at the time, and the price was placed on an empty chair during the ceremony in Oslo. In the years that followed, Norway\u2019s salmon exports to China plunged. \u201cI\u2019d imagine the longer this goes on, the more unhappy the people are going to be. Basketball is extremely popular in China. The Rockets are a very popular team,\u201d Cha said. \u201cYou can substitute Norwegian salmon. There is really no substitute for the NBA.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>James Blake, the owner of Europe\u2019s largest emergency food supplier, is one of the few people to be doing good business out of coronavirus. Are you planning to hole up indoors while a pandemic, natural disaster or terrorist attack runs its course? Blake\u2019s company \u2013 Emergency Food Storage UK \u2013 has got you covered, but it\u2019s not cheap: \u00a3385 will buy you one month of food, as long as you like freeze-dried macaroni cheese and chicken-fried rice.</p> <p>The prices aren\u2019t putting Blake\u2019s customers off. Since coronavirus emerged in China in December, he has been swamped with orders. In the last two weeks alone, Emergency Food has done as much business as it normally would in six months. Which is bad news for anyone thinking now might be a good time to stock up on some of its powdered custard apple crunch, because it\u2019s all gone.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all we have left,\u201d says Blake, gesturing around his half-empty warehouse. (He has insisted I keep the location secret, for security reasons. He has also refused to tell me his age, for reasons that are unclear.) The shelves are mostly bare, save for some tins of spaghetti bolognese, chilli and three-bean stew. In the corner are water filtration devices: a jerrycan with built-in antibacterial filter, and smaller, more portable bottles.</p> <p>We are actually in the smaller warehouse Blake uses to house his personal supplies, and orders that have yet to be filled. There was no point in showing me his main warehouse, because it\u2019s empty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2d3a0a90cf2bce46c4d91ce404dbff9d37dfd60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2d3a0a90cf2bce46c4d91ce404dbff9d37dfd60/618_819_6102_3661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For a rainy day?

The \u00a3375 Brexit Box \u2013 featuring 60 main meals, a water filter and firestarter \u2013 flew off the shelves last year. Blake sources his food from a factory in Lancashire, which is working 24/7 to replenish his stock. In addition to shipping Brexit Boxes direct to consumers, Blake says that Emergency Food also supplies government departments, although he won\u2019t reveal which. And you\u2019ll find his freeze-dried emergency food on the <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/rrs-sir-david-attenborough/\">RRS Sir David Attenborough</a>, commonly known as Boaty McBoatface.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at a zombie apocalypse situation,\u201d Blake admits. \u201cMost short-term issues can be resolved in time.\u201d Still, \u201cWe should all just be a little more self-reliant.\u201d</p> <p>Self-reliance is the organising principle of Blake\u2019s life: he grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, and food preparation is an integral part of Mormon life. As a child, Blake would watch his mother store and preserve food. \u201cWheat was a big thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would always have a few containers.\u201d Although he left the Mormons in his 20s, some habits are hard to shake: opening a ceiling hatch, Blake reveals a secret stash of foil-lined bags of wheat.</p> <p>He argues that the people buying from him are the opposite of selfish. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting the food in the supermarket, by purchasing your supplies from a different point.\u201d He doesn\u2019t like the word stockpiling \u2013 but<em> </em>prepping won\u2019t work either. \u201cPrepping has a negative connotation perpetuated by the media,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they see preppers as often quite crazy.\u201d He favours the term \u201cfood storage\u201d, which he sees as more neutral.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think about what\u2019s in your kitchen cupboard today,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s a few tins of beans, some manky rice. You might be able to cobble together food for a few days. Imagine a disaster lasting weeks before infrastructure is back up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe13e3a4744f5f957c1ce2abcf1188dbf11b5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe13e3a4744f5f957c1ce2abcf1188dbf11b5c8/0_0_2780_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selection of homemade pickles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pickled and preserved \u2026 not so long ago people routinely laid down food supplies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inna Klim/Eyeem/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just Blake\u2019s tills that are ringing. Purveyors of antibacterial hand gel, dust masks and even facial respirators are doing brisk business. Inevitably, prices have rocketed as a result of coronavirus fears. \u201cI\u2019m panicked like crazy because I want to protect the people I love,\u201d says Andrew (not his real name), a 30-year-old property developer from Essex. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I want to spend \u00a350 on a full face mask.\u201d Perhaps he should have a word with 49-year-old Kerry Collinson, from Somerset, who already has a large box of face masks, which she purchased earlier this month. </p> <p>What Andrew has stockpiled is \u00a3100 worth of food and water. And he is planning to buy more. \u201cI know it sounds crazy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019d sooner spend the money now and have it and not need it.\u201d And he is planning to buy more.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not at the point of panic,\u201d says Prof Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University. Public Health England agrees. But who listens to experts?.</p> <p>Stockpiling is an understandable psychological response in times of stress. \u201cIf you are told your neighbours are stockpiling, and you perceive that the goods in question are of a finite nature, then it\u2019s not irrational to stockpile,\u201d says Prof John Drury, an expert in crowd psychology and disasters at the University of Sussex. \u201cFor you as an individual, it makes sense to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>We have been here before. After 9/11, Claudia (not her real name), a 60-year-old homemaker from London, slept with a radio beside her bed. She had read articles about al-Qaida planning a chemical attack on London, and wanted to be ready to take it down to her cellar, which she had stocked with tinned food and bottled water. \u201cI wanted to make sure that if there was an attack, we\u2019d be OK,\u201d she says. Of course, the attack never happened. \u201cThe food gradually came out,\u201d Claudia says. \u201cThe water stayed there for a long time, and then we used it to water the garden.\u201d</p> <p>When Paddy Tipping was the government minister responsible for getting the UK ready for the year 2000, he had to contend with a general public anxious about the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/Y2K/Story/0,,196860,00.html\" title=\"\">millennium bug</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f9c17ee32becc227a3bd636b2b750b6b0245899\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f9c17ee32becc227a3bd636b2b750b6b0245899/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinned food \u2026 just the thing when times get hard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinned food \u2026 just the thing when times get hard. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria ?/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAeroplanes were going to drop out of the sky,\u201d is one of the doomsday scenarios Tipping remembers. \u201cThe food chain would dry up and collapse. Power stations would short and not be able to provide electricity.\u201d Some people stockpiled, worried about what would happen.</p> <p>Daytime TV stalwarts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan were rapped on the knuckles by the government for an episode of This Morning that was accused of encouraging viewers to stockpile 10 weeks\u2019 worth of food. But for the most part, the press played ball, and Tipping was able to prevent the spread of misinformation. But that was before social media. Tipping questions whether his job would be possible nowadays. \u201cWe\u2019re not as effective at getting the message out and taking false stuff on.\u201d</p> <p>Collinson started stockpiling after seeing videos purporting to be from inside China on social media. \u201cI kept seeing videos of dead bodies and people falling over in the street,\u201d she says. \u201cI think realistically 50% of them are absolute rubbish,\u201d she adds. And yet she\u2019s still putting emergency supplies aside. \u201cI\u2019m an army brat. I\u2019ve always been brought up with that mindset of being prepared. It just seems common sense to have things on hand, just in case.\u201d</p> <p>So what should the rest of us be doing? There\u2019s no need to hoard, Katz stresses. Instead, \u201chave a basic preparedness plan\u201d. That means having a month\u2019s supply of any essential medicines, and a few days\u2019 worth of food. It\u2019s best to buy tinned foods that you would normally eat, rather than expensive freeze-dried meals that will only ever seem like an attractive proposition in a nuclear winter. I sampled Emergency Food\u2019s vegetable chipotle chilli, and the texture can best be described as mulchy.</p> <p>All this talk of \u201cpreparedness\u201d sounds extreme. And yet it is true that the UK\u2019s food situation is more insecure than many people realise. \u201cThe food sector today runs on a \u2018just-in-time\u2019 logistics system,\u201d says Prof Tim Lang, an expert in food policy at City, University of London. \u201cThe whole idea is to not have storage.\u201d In addition to this vulnerable supply chain, domestic food production has steadily dropped in the last three decades. Between 40-50% of our food is produced abroad. Were disaster to affect food-producing regions of Spain and north Africa, for example, our food supply would be hit. \u201cBritain is catastrophically dependent on external sources,\u201d Lang says.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just food supplies that are vulnerable. Last week the British press reported that the likes of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8023793/Primark-Asos-Halfords-fear-supply-shortages-coronavirus-crisis-triggers-factory-closures.html\">Halfords, Primark and Asos</a> were \u201cbracing themselves\u201d for stock shortages as the coronavirus outbreak closed Chinese factories.</p> <p>Earlier generations routinely laid down food supplies in times of plenty, to stave off future want. During the second world war, the British government advised citizens to develop their own food stores \u2013 around a week\u2019s supply was deemed adequate. Leaflets were issued with advice on which tinned foods to buy, and how best to store essentials such as flour, sugar and cereals.</p> <p>Our grandmothers strained boiled fruit through muslin; they pickled vegetables and salted fish. But modern life has made us complacent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a wonderful time of plenty,\u201d says Blake. \u201cWe can just nip in the car, pop to the supermarket, and buy whatever we want. It\u2019s a fantastic way to live. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAs long as something doesn\u2019t go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>How did we become so relaxed about where our next-but-one meal might come from? In the UK, Blake lays some of the blame on the 90s and New Labour, which he says \u201cbred a culture of hope back into a society that had become hopeless. There was this feeling of ahhh \u2013 things will be different.\u201d It was a comforting lie. \u201cThe reality is that government is government, and there is only so much you can do.\u201d</p> <p>If the 90s were one long exhale of contentment, with the end of the cold war and the apparent triumph of liberal democracy, the 2000s and 2010s were a collective intake of breath. Successive terrorist attacks and a global recession undermined our faith in a safer, more prosperous future.</p> <p>All of this was brilliant news for Emergency Food Storage UK. After all, when your business model depends on people\u2019s darkest fears, there\u2019s nothing like a bit of global tumult to get the orders coming in. Blake founded the company in 2009 \u2013 when Twitter was in its infancy \u2013 and its growth has mirrored the rise of social media, and our concomitant loss of faith in government and the media to keep us safe and tell us the truth.</p> <p>Given everything that has happened in recent years, the desire to stockpile food is understandable. When you feel like events are slipping into the abyss, stockpiling is a way to regain a sense of control. \u201cIt\u2019s like, all of a sudden, bushfires, coronavirus, world war three with Iran,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst few months I can remember as an adult \u2026 It just feels like enough is enough, and something is going to give.\u201d</p> <p>Stockpiling may not be the answer. And freeze-dried food doesn\u2019t taste great. But if you can afford it and have the space, a few extra tins in your cupboard is never a bad idea.</p>",

      "bodyText": "James Blake, the owner of Europe\u2019s largest emergency food supplier, is one of the few people to be doing good business out of coronavirus. Are you planning to hole up indoors while a pandemic, natural disaster or terrorist attack runs its course? Blake\u2019s company \u2013 Emergency Food Storage UK \u2013 has got you covered, but it\u2019s not cheap: \u00a3385 will buy you one month of food, as long as you like freeze-dried macaroni cheese and chicken-fried rice. The prices aren\u2019t putting Blake\u2019s customers off. Since coronavirus emerged in China in December, he has been swamped with orders. In the last two weeks alone, Emergency Food has done as much business as it normally would in six months. Which is bad news for anyone thinking now might be a good time to stock up on some of its powdered custard apple crunch, because it\u2019s all gone. \u201cThis is all we have left,\u201d says Blake, gesturing around his half-empty warehouse. (He has insisted I keep the location secret, for security reasons. He has also refused to tell me his age, for reasons that are unclear.) The shelves are mostly bare, save for some tins of spaghetti bolognese, chilli and three-bean stew. In the corner are water filtration devices: a jerrycan with built-in antibacterial filter, and smaller, more portable bottles. We are actually in the smaller warehouse Blake uses to house his personal supplies, and orders that have yet to be filled. There was no point in showing me his main warehouse, because it\u2019s empty. These are busy times for his company, which has also had to contend with public fears about Brexit affecting the food supply. The \u00a3375 Brexit Box \u2013 featuring 60 main meals, a water filter and firestarter \u2013 flew off the shelves last year. Blake sources his food from a factory in Lancashire, which is working 24/7 to replenish his stock. In addition to shipping Brexit Boxes direct to consumers, Blake says that Emergency Food also supplies government departments, although he won\u2019t reveal which. And you\u2019ll find his freeze-dried emergency food on the RRS Sir David Attenborough, commonly known as Boaty McBoatface. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at a zombie apocalypse situation,\u201d Blake admits. \u201cMost short-term issues can be resolved in time.\u201d Still, \u201cWe should all just be a little more self-reliant.\u201d Self-reliance is the organising principle of Blake\u2019s life: he grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, and food preparation is an integral part of Mormon life. As a child, Blake would watch his mother store and preserve food. \u201cWheat was a big thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would always have a few containers.\u201d Although he left the Mormons in his 20s, some habits are hard to shake: opening a ceiling hatch, Blake reveals a secret stash of foil-lined bags of wheat. He argues that the people buying from him are the opposite of selfish. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting the food in the supermarket, by purchasing your supplies from a different point.\u201d He doesn\u2019t like the word stockpiling \u2013 but prepping won\u2019t work either. \u201cPrepping has a negative connotation perpetuated by the media,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they see preppers as often quite crazy.\u201d He favours the term \u201cfood storage\u201d, which he sees as more neutral. \u201cIf you think about what\u2019s in your kitchen cupboard today,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s a few tins of beans, some manky rice. You might be able to cobble together food for a few days. Imagine a disaster lasting weeks before infrastructure is back up.\u201d It\u2019s not just Blake\u2019s tills that are ringing. Purveyors of antibacterial hand gel, dust masks and even facial respirators are doing brisk business. Inevitably, prices have rocketed as a result of coronavirus fears. \u201cI\u2019m panicked like crazy because I want to protect the people I love,\u201d says Andrew (not his real name), a 30-year-old property developer from Essex. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I want to spend \u00a350 on a full face mask.\u201d Perhaps he should have a word with 49-year-old Kerry Collinson, from Somerset, who already has a large box of face masks, which she purchased earlier this month. What Andrew has stockpiled is \u00a3100 worth of food and water. And he is planning to buy more. \u201cI know it sounds crazy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019d sooner spend the money now and have it and not need it.\u201d And he is planning to buy more. \u201cWe are not at the point of panic,\u201d says Prof Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University. Public Health England agrees. But who listens to experts?. Stockpiling is an understandable psychological response in times of stress. \u201cIf you are told your neighbours are stockpiling, and you perceive that the goods in question are of a finite nature, then it\u2019s not irrational to stockpile,\u201d says Prof John Drury, an expert in crowd psychology and disasters at the University of Sussex. \u201cFor you as an individual, it makes sense to do the same.\u201d We have been here before. After 9/11, Claudia (not her real name), a 60-year-old homemaker from London, slept with a radio beside her bed. She had read articles about al-Qaida planning a chemical attack on London, and wanted to be ready to take it down to her cellar, which she had stocked with tinned food and bottled water. \u201cI wanted to make sure that if there was an attack, we\u2019d be OK,\u201d she says. Of course, the attack never happened. \u201cThe food gradually came out,\u201d Claudia says. \u201cThe water stayed there for a long time, and then we used it to water the garden.\u201d When Paddy Tipping was the government minister responsible for getting the UK ready for the year 2000, he had to contend with a general public anxious about the so-called millennium bug. \u201cAeroplanes were going to drop out of the sky,\u201d is one of the doomsday scenarios Tipping remembers. \u201cThe food chain would dry up and collapse. Power stations would short and not be able to provide electricity.\u201d Some people stockpiled, worried about what would happen. Daytime TV stalwarts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan were rapped on the knuckles by the government for an episode of This Morning that was accused of encouraging viewers to stockpile 10 weeks\u2019 worth of food. But for the most part, the press played ball, and Tipping was able to prevent the spread of misinformation. But that was before social media. Tipping questions whether his job would be possible nowadays. \u201cWe\u2019re not as effective at getting the message out and taking false stuff on.\u201d Collinson started stockpiling after seeing videos purporting to be from inside China on social media. \u201cI kept seeing videos of dead bodies and people falling over in the street,\u201d she says. \u201cI think realistically 50% of them are absolute rubbish,\u201d she adds. And yet she\u2019s still putting emergency supplies aside. \u201cI\u2019m an army brat. I\u2019ve always been brought up with that mindset of being prepared. It just seems common sense to have things on hand, just in case.\u201d So what should the rest of us be doing? There\u2019s no need to hoard, Katz stresses. Instead, \u201chave a basic preparedness plan\u201d. That means having a month\u2019s supply of any essential medicines, and a few days\u2019 worth of food. It\u2019s best to buy tinned foods that you would normally eat, rather than expensive freeze-dried meals that will only ever seem like an attractive proposition in a nuclear winter. I sampled Emergency Food\u2019s vegetable chipotle chilli, and the texture can best be described as mulchy. All this talk of \u201cpreparedness\u201d sounds extreme. And yet it is true that the UK\u2019s food situation is more insecure than many people realise. \u201cThe food sector today runs on a \u2018just-in-time\u2019 logistics system,\u201d says Prof Tim Lang, an expert in food policy at City, University of London. \u201cThe whole idea is to not have storage.\u201d In addition to this vulnerable supply chain, domestic food production has steadily dropped in the last three decades. Between 40-50% of our food is produced abroad. Were disaster to affect food-producing regions of Spain and north Africa, for example, our food supply would be hit. \u201cBritain is catastrophically dependent on external sources,\u201d Lang says. It\u2019s not just food supplies that are vulnerable. Last week the British press reported that the likes of Halfords, Primark and Asos were \u201cbracing themselves\u201d for stock shortages as the coronavirus outbreak closed Chinese factories. Earlier generations routinely laid down food supplies in times of plenty, to stave off future want. During the second world war, the British government advised citizens to develop their own food stores \u2013 around a week\u2019s supply was deemed adequate. Leaflets were issued with advice on which tinned foods to buy, and how best to store essentials such as flour, sugar and cereals. Our grandmothers strained boiled fruit through muslin; they pickled vegetables and salted fish. But modern life has made us complacent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a wonderful time of plenty,\u201d says Blake. \u201cWe can just nip in the car, pop to the supermarket, and buy whatever we want. It\u2019s a fantastic way to live. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAs long as something doesn\u2019t go wrong.\u201d How did we become so relaxed about where our next-but-one meal might come from? In the UK, Blake lays some of the blame on the 90s and New Labour, which he says \u201cbred a culture of hope back into a society that had become hopeless. There was this feeling of ahhh \u2013 things will be different.\u201d It was a comforting lie. \u201cThe reality is that government is government, and there is only so much you can do.\u201d If the 90s were one long exhale of contentment, with the end of the cold war and the apparent triumph of liberal democracy, the 2000s and 2010s were a collective intake of breath. Successive terrorist attacks and a global recession undermined our faith in a safer, more prosperous future. All of this was brilliant news for Emergency Food Storage UK. After all, when your business model depends on people\u2019s darkest fears, there\u2019s nothing like a bit of global tumult to get the orders coming in. Blake founded the company in 2009 \u2013 when Twitter was in its infancy \u2013 and its growth has mirrored the rise of social media, and our concomitant loss of faith in government and the media to keep us safe and tell us the truth. Given everything that has happened in recent years, the desire to stockpile food is understandable. When you feel like events are slipping into the abyss, stockpiling is a way to regain a sense of control. \u201cIt\u2019s like, all of a sudden, bushfires, coronavirus, world war three with Iran,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst few months I can remember as an adult \u2026 It just feels like enough is enough, and something is going to give.\u201d Stockpiling may not be the answer. And freeze-dried food doesn\u2019t taste great. But if you can afford it and have the space, a few extra tins in your cupboard is never a bad idea.",

      "bodyText": "How does a device \u2013 running one word backwards to find another, say \u2013 become part of the cryptic toolkit? There\u2019s seldom a definitive record of which setter first tried out some device. And these things tend to evolve as other setters get in on the act: we\u2019re not like the French language, with an Academy laying down the rules. But what if we pretended that we were? In our cluing competition for SNEEZE, Peter Moore Fuller proposes this wordplay: \u2026 \u2018a sniff and a wheeze\u2019 wrote Carroll In other words, we are acting as if an answer in the puzzle was created by Lewis Carroll, who was fond of inventing words by bolting together bits of existing ones: if something is miserable as well as flimsy, we can now, thanks to Carroll, describe it as \u201cmimsy\u201d. As Peter points out, this is not unlike the spoonerism (which we take a look at here): not only is the answer produced by mangling other words, but the device is indicated by the name of the author. How should the Crossword Council rule on this? Well, this imaginary body values kindness to the solver above all else. So the carrollism gets marks immediately for making itself obvious to the solver through the presence of the word \u201cCarroll\u201d (although it seems likely that setters will be tempted to use \u201cwrote the deacon\u201d in the same way that some disguise their spoonerisms with \u201cthe reverend\u2019s\u201d and the like). And the words that need to be carrollised? In some cryptic devices, the setter must give the exact word that needs to be played with: for the answer CARNIVOROUS, he or she can put \u201coutbreak of coronavirus\u201d, but not \u201cnasty disease\u201d. Other times, the fodder can be hinted at \u2026 14d So long to Spooner\u2019s dog-end? (6-3) \u2026 such as when Qaos asks you to dream up \u201cpoodle-tip\u201d en route to TOODLE-PIP. How should it be for the carrollism? Peter\u2019s sample clue gives you exactly the words needed (\u201csniff\u201d and \u201cwheeze\u201d): fairer, but too constricting?

      "body": "<p>Most players were already tucked up in bed by the time the decisions were taken. It was the early hours of Sunday morning but in Milan, Turin, Bergamo and Verona the directors of Serie A teams were still awake, working the phones, trying to find out whether that day\u2019s matches would go ahead.</p> \n<p>On Saturday evening, the government had passed legislation placing 11 northern towns in lockdown, prohibiting travel in or out as they attempted to contain outbreaks of coronavirus in Lombardy and Veneto. The same decree granted government ministers powers to suspend public gatherings. A decision was taken to delay all sporting events, right down to the amateur level, across the affected regions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/three-serie-a-matches-coronavirus-outbreak-inter-milan\">Four Serie A matches called off due to coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Four out of six top-flight games scheduled for Sunday ended up being postponed: Atalanta-Sassuolo, Verona-Cagliari, Internazionale\u2011Sampdoria and Torino-Parma. The last of those decisions was not confirmed until almost lunchtime. Two fresh cases of the virus had been identified in Piedmont, the region in which Turin is located, that morning.</p> \n<p>As supermarket shelves were emptied of food, football wrestled with its own response to an unfolding national crisis. The need to prioritise public safety was grinding up against the necessities of an overbooked sporting calendar.</p> \n<p>With Euro 2020 coming in the summer, there is no option to extend this season, and teams are running out of viable dates to reschedule games. If Inter were to reach the finals of the Europa League and Coppa Italia, their only open Wednesday would be 20 May \u2013 four days before the end of this campaign.</p> \n<p>The club\u2019s chief executive, Beppe Marotta, spent Sunday lobbying to reschedule the domestic cup final for that date instead, a scenario that would allow his team to push back the second leg of their semi-final against Napoli as well. He would like to use the date assigned to that fixture, 5 March, to fit in the game against Sampdoria instead.</p> \n<p>His sense of urgency is understandable. For Inter, not playing last weekend meant falling six points behind the leaders Juventus, who beat Spal on Saturday. Although the <em>Nerazzurri</em> retain their game in hand, the psychological impact of having to play catch-up for the next three months could be significant.</p> \n<p>Yet even Marotta\u2019s plan contained a degree of presumption. We do not know yet whether further games will be suspended. The initial ban on sporting events will last until the end of Sunday 1 March. Yet how confidently can anyone plan in what is plainly a fluid situation, with the fourth, fifth and sixth deaths from coronavirus in Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-live-updates-china-wuhan-hubei-latest-news-italy-lombardy-south-korea-iran-japan-cases-infections-death-toll-outbreak-xi-jinping-update\" title=\"\">reported on Monday morning</a>?</p> \n<p>Any games played in the meantime, in the affected regions, will have to take place behind closed doors. The suggestion evoked a passionate response from Lazio\u2019s Simone Inzaghi, who argued that football should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d be played without fans, the \u201clifeblood of the sport\u201d, yet this is not a situation that he or any other manager can hope to control. As the front page of Monday morning\u2019s Gazzetta dello Sport put it, what we have right now is a <em>Scudetto in Quarantine</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00d1cc4632d0e7c97bfc575b449528ed7149cc2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00d1cc4632d0e7c97bfc575b449528ed7149cc2b/0_40_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juventus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Ramsey scores the second goal for Juventus against Spal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The timing could not be worse, with Juventus scheduled to host Inter on Sunday in the highest-stakes Derby d\u2019Italia for years. Playing it in a different part of the country has been mooted as an alternative to going behind closed doors, but that would be a tough decision for the <em>Bianconeri</em>, who have dropped only two points all season at their Allianz Stadium.</p> \n<p>They did win away from home last weekend against opponents who sit bottom of the table. Spal were dogged but outmatched. Cristiano Ronaldo, making the 1,000th appearance of his professional career, marked the occasion by scoring for the 11th consecutive league game \u2013 matching the Serie A record held by Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella.</p> \n<p>Aaron Ramsey also found the net for the first time since November. His has been a frustrating first term in Turin, complicated by injuries and inconsistency. Maurizio Sarri still has not settled on a fixed starting XI, however, leaving at least a possibility for the Welshman to claim a more prominent role for the final part of the campaign.</p> \n<p>Juventus will need more than just Ronaldo chipping in if they are to stay ahead of a Lazio side that has goals in abundance. Ciro Immobile extended his tally to 27 as they won 3-2 win at Genoa on Sunday, joining Antonio Angelillo (at Inter, in 1958-59) as the only players ever to reach that number after 25 games of a Serie A campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1231923052864311296\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goal 2\ufe0f\u20e37\ufe0f\u20e3 of this Serie A season for Ciro Immobile<br><br>\u26a0\ufe0f He has equaled Antonio Angelilli\u2019s record of most goals scored by matchday 25, set in 1958/59 \ud83e\udd1d<br><br>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptaPaolo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OptaPaolo</a> <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/vvZg9dQ765\">pic.twitter.com/vvZg9dQ765</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1231923052864311296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Immobile is now just nine shy of the single-season record set by Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, but this was another weekend to remind us that Lazio are no one-man team. Adam Marusic\u2019s opener, in which he kept his feet after being buffeted from either side by Andrea Masiello and Adama Soumaoro, both of whom wound up on the floor, was the pick of their goals, but Danilo Cataldi\u2019s opportunistic free-kick for the third was also well taken.</p> \n<p>For a Sunday with only two matches, there were quite a few strikes to enjoy. Even in defeat, the first-time finish that Francesco Cassata dispatched into the top corner for Genoa was perfection. Roma put four past Lecce, ending their run of three straight league defeats.</p> \n<p>Still, it was not enough to fill the void. Endless televised analysis and post-game interviews are the backing track to Italy\u2019s Sunday afternoons. Short of action to discuss, the long-time pundit Massimo De Luca instead turned his ire on Rai 2\u2019s A Tutta Rete toward the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of a 20-team top-flight, arguing that this situation showed again why having fewer teams would benefit Serie A, leaving more flexibility in the calendar.</p> \n<p>His words drew applause from a small studio audience. Other broadcasts had already closed their doors in response to the outbreak. At times the silence felt weighty on shows where audience reaction is a familiar part of the experience. It was nothing compared to that which might await Serie A\u2019s players this weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3aa97539-d81b-40f2-9859-40b7d96d4aeb\"

      "bodyText": "Most players were already tucked up in bed by the time the decisions were taken. It was the early hours of Sunday morning but in Milan, Turin, Bergamo and Verona the directors of Serie A teams were still awake, working the phones, trying to find out whether that day\u2019s matches would go ahead. On Saturday evening, the government had passed legislation placing 11 northern towns in lockdown, prohibiting travel in or out as they attempted to contain outbreaks of coronavirus in Lombardy and Veneto. The same decree granted government ministers powers to suspend public gatherings. A decision was taken to delay all sporting events, right down to the amateur level, across the affected regions. Four out of six top-flight games scheduled for Sunday ended up being postponed: Atalanta-Sassuolo, Verona-Cagliari, Internazionale\u2011Sampdoria and Torino-Parma. The last of those decisions was not confirmed until almost lunchtime. Two fresh cases of the virus had been identified in Piedmont, the region in which Turin is located, that morning. As supermarket shelves were emptied of food, football wrestled with its own response to an unfolding national crisis. The need to prioritise public safety was grinding up against the necessities of an overbooked sporting calendar. With Euro 2020 coming in the summer, there is no option to extend this season, and teams are running out of viable dates to reschedule games. If Inter were to reach the finals of the Europa League and Coppa Italia, their only open Wednesday would be 20 May \u2013 four days before the end of this campaign. The club\u2019s chief executive, Beppe Marotta, spent Sunday lobbying to reschedule the domestic cup final for that date instead, a scenario that would allow his team to push back the second leg of their semi-final against Napoli as well. He would like to use the date assigned to that fixture, 5 March, to fit in the game against Sampdoria instead. His sense of urgency is understandable. For Inter, not playing last weekend meant falling six points behind the leaders Juventus, who beat Spal on Saturday. Although the Nerazzurri retain their game in hand, the psychological impact of having to play catch-up for the next three months could be significant. Yet even Marotta\u2019s plan contained a degree of presumption. We do not know yet whether further games will be suspended. The initial ban on sporting events will last until the end of Sunday 1 March. Yet how confidently can anyone plan in what is plainly a fluid situation, with the fourth, fifth and sixth deaths from coronavirus in Italy reported on Monday morning? Any games played in the meantime, in the affected regions, will have to take place behind closed doors. The suggestion evoked a passionate response from Lazio\u2019s Simone Inzaghi, who argued that football should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d be played without fans, the \u201clifeblood of the sport\u201d, yet this is not a situation that he or any other manager can hope to control. As the front page of Monday morning\u2019s Gazzetta dello Sport put it, what we have right now is a Scudetto in Quarantine. The timing could not be worse, with Juventus scheduled to host Inter on Sunday in the highest-stakes Derby d\u2019Italia for years. Playing it in a different part of the country has been mooted as an alternative to going behind closed doors, but that would be a tough decision for the Bianconeri, who have dropped only two points all season at their Allianz Stadium. They did win away from home last weekend against opponents who sit bottom of the table. Spal were dogged but outmatched. Cristiano Ronaldo, making the 1,000th appearance of his professional career, marked the occasion by scoring for the 11th consecutive league game \u2013 matching the Serie A record held by Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella. Aaron Ramsey also found the net for the first time since November. His has been a frustrating first term in Turin, complicated by injuries and inconsistency. Maurizio Sarri still has not settled on a fixed starting XI, however, leaving at least a possibility for the Welshman to claim a more prominent role for the final part of the campaign. Juventus will need more than just Ronaldo chipping in if they are to stay ahead of a Lazio side that has goals in abundance. Ciro Immobile extended his tally to 27 as they won 3-2 win at Genoa on Sunday, joining Antonio Angelillo (at Inter, in 1958-59) as the only players ever to reach that number after 25 games of a Serie A campaign. Immobile is now just nine shy of the single-season record set by Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, but this was another weekend to remind us that Lazio are no one-man team. Adam Marusic\u2019s opener, in which he kept his feet after being buffeted from either side by Andrea Masiello and Adama Soumaoro, both of whom wound up on the floor, was the pick of their goals, but Danilo Cataldi\u2019s opportunistic free-kick for the third was also well taken. For a Sunday with only two matches, there were quite a few strikes to enjoy. Even in defeat, the first-time finish that Francesco Cassata dispatched into the top corner for Genoa was perfection. Roma put four past Lecce, ending their run of three straight league defeats. Still, it was not enough to fill the void. Endless televised analysis and post-game interviews are the backing track to Italy\u2019s Sunday afternoons. Short of action to discuss, the long-time pundit Massimo De Luca instead turned his ire on Rai 2\u2019s A Tutta Rete toward the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of a 20-team top-flight, arguing that this situation showed again why having fewer teams would benefit Serie A, leaving more flexibility in the calendar. His words drew applause from a small studio audience. Other broadcasts had already closed their doors in response to the outbreak. At times the silence felt weighty on shows where audience reaction is a familiar part of the experience. It was nothing compared to that which might await Serie A\u2019s players this weekend.",

      "bodyText": "China has delayed its annual parliamentary meeting as authorities struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread to more countries and prompted fears of a global pandemic. For the first time in decades, Beijing on Monday postponed the key political event, the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), where hundreds of delegates gather in Beijing every March. The standing committee for the NPC said a new date for the meeting would be announced separately, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. China\u2019s national health commission reported its highest number of deaths in 11 days, with a further 150 victims. All but one of the fatalities and 11 of the new infections were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. The commission reported 409 new coronavirus cases, down from 648 a day earlier and, bringing the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China to 77,150. The provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Shanxi lowered their alert levels , following Gansu and Liaoning over the weekend. At a joint briefing in Beijing by the World Health Organization and China\u2019s national health commission, Bruce Aylward, the head of a team of WHO experts visiting China, said there had been a \u201csteep decline\u201d in the number of infections, despite statistical issues. Last week, China twice changed how it counts confirmed cases of infection, causing confusion. \u201cI know people look at the numbers and say what\u2019s really happening,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cmultiple sources of data\u201d point to declines. \u201cThis is falling and it is falling because of the actions that are being taken.\u201d Elsewhere, Iran\u2019s semi-official news agency reported that 50 people had died from the virus in the city of Qom this month, although a minister denied it. Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan reported their first cases as infections outside of China jumped. South Korea reported 70 more cases of the virus, bringing its total to 833. In Italy, authorities have implemented draconian measures to try to halt an outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas, as a fourth person was confirmed to have died there. Starting on Tuesday, Hong Kong will begin barring travellers from South Korea if they are not Hong Kong residents. The increase in the number of cases outside China comes a day after the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, gave a major speech on the crisis, seeking to assure the public that the virus would soon be contained. The reversal of a previous announcement that a lockdown would be loosened in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, has cast further doubt on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. Authorities in Wuhan had said residents not under quarantine or observation could begin to leave the city, which has been subjected to strict traffic restrictions since 23 January. But later on Monday afternoon, a new statement declared the previous notice \u201cinvalid\u201d and said all relevant personnel had been \u201cseverely criticised and dealt with\u201d. The later notice called on Wuhan to \u201cfirmly implement\u201d Xi\u2019s \u201cimportant instructions\u201d on preventing the export of the virus to other parts of the country. Beijing has begun to hit back against travel restrictions imposed on Chinese nationals. China\u2019s ministry of culture and tourism advised its citizens against travelling to the US, citing the country\u2019s \u201coverreaction\u201d to the virus, which had caused Chinese nationals to be \u201ctreated unfairly\u201d. Wuhan\u2019s government said it would continue to impose strict controls over its borders in order to prevent the virus from spreading further. On Sunday, Xi said Covid-19 was \u201cboth a crisis and a big test\u201d for the country, describing the virus as a major public health emergency and one of the country\u2019s biggest challenges since the founding of the people\u2019s republic. \u201cThe outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,\u201d Xi said, but added that the impact would be temporary and generally manageable. Some observers greeted Monday\u2019s figures with scepticism, believing they are part of efforts to project a sense of control over the crisis. Chinese officials have twice changed the criteria for confirmed infections, making the data harder to parse. China has allocated 99.5bn yuan (\u00a311bn) to curb the outbreak, China\u2019s assistant finance minister, Ou Wenhan, said in a Beijing press briefing on Monday. Officials from WHO visited Wuhan at the weekend for the first time since the outbreak, inspecting two hospitals and meeting officials at the centre for disease control in the province. There is growing alarm among economists and investors that the impact on global growth is going to be much worse than previously estimated. There is no official data about how the Chinese economy has fared in the past three weeks, but trackers of coal consumption and traffic congestion show that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy is still paralysed despite claims that many manufacturing areas are back to work. \u201cThe presumption was that we would see intermediate supply chains quickly reconnected and I think the market has had to go through a period of questioning that logic,\u201d said Ray Attrill, the head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. The spike in the number of cases in South Korea on Monday, which brought the national total to 763, prompted shares to fall in Australia and Hong Kong. One of the nation\u2019s largest cities, Daegu, has been placed under semi-lockdown, its national assembly session has been cancelled, and the start of school postponed. Other nations have also begun to suspend flights into the country. South Korea\u2019s K-league postponed the start of the new football season in the face of the growing outbreak.",

Gauke, who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire, said the government\u2019s plans to raise spending could result in the UK\u2019s national debt rising as a proportion of GDP. Saying this was a \u201cvery strange position to find ourselves in\u201d, particularly for a Tory government, he added that there were fundamental constraints for the government and risks that debt could be rising as the economy falters. He warned that Brexit or the coronavirus outbreak could damage growth and the public purse. He said: \u201cIf we had a downturn in the economy, are we saying that debt to GDP grows slowly and then grows very quickly, before reverting to growing slowly again? That strikes me as an unsustainable position.\u201d The former Treasury minister, who was second-in-command under Philip Hammond and served under George Osborne, said the department with overarching control over tax and spending decisions needed to be \u201cpretty tight with public spending, and making sure we do prioritise\u201d. He said the alternative would be tax increases, which the Tory party was unwilling to contemplate. In recognition of the bind facing the chancellor, Gauke said the ministry of justice had faced an \u201cessentially unsustainable\u201d funding settlement during his time in charge of the department. Warning that the government\u2019s planned tough approach to prison sentencing would mean higher prisoner numbers in future \u2013 requiring more prison officers and greater funding \u2013 he said: \u201cThose pressures are going to increase yet further.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic \u201cis very likely, if not inevitable\u201d. Some say the world is already in the early stages of a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as a disease spreading across two continents. Clusters of Covid-19 \u2013 the illness caused by the novel coronavirus (officially known as Sars-CoV-2) \u2013 are emerging all over the world, with some showing no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started and how they have spread. Globally, there have been 78,973 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 2,466 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths have been in mainland China, centred around central Hubei province. How does a country like Australia, geographically remote and with a limited number of mild cases \u2013 all of which have been traced back to their origin \u2013 counter a pandemic? Early stages: health screenings and travel bans Under the Australian government\u2019s Emergency Response Plan for Covid-19, the \u201cinitial action\u201d response when cases are first identified in Australia is focused on \u201cminimising transmission\u201d and \u201cmanaging initial cases\u201d. It involves border measures such as health screenings at airports and ports, escalating to travel bans, which are currently in place for travellers from mainland China. Confirmed cases are tracked backwards to find points of infection, and potential contacts \u2013 such as fellow passengers on flights \u2013 alerted to the potential that they have been exposed to the disease. Those who have been exposed to suspected cases are asked to self-isolate at home. Citizens and permanent residents returning from known hotspots face periods of enforced quarantine. Escalation: surge staffing and \u2018fever clinics\u2019 If, and as, cases escalate, hospitals can be advised to consider bringing in additional \u201csurge staff\u201d and state governments asked to consider establishing \u201cfever clinics\u201d or other alternative models of care \u201cto minimise the burden on the health system\u201d. Places where outbreaks could spread especially rapidly, or could impact upon vulnerable populations \u2013 residential aged care facilities, schools and prisons \u2013 can be given extra support and staff to investigate and manage outbreaks. Australia\u2019s Covid-19 plan draws from the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, which contemplates a novel coronavirus from which the Australian population would have little immunity. \u201cCurrently, there are no effective anti-virals available and there is no vaccine. Availability of a customised novel coronavirus vaccine would be the greatest tool in reducing the impact. It is still not known if or when this might be available,\u201d the emergency response plan reads, noting that there is still no vaccine available for the other major coronaviruses Sars and Mers. Increasing \u2018social distancing\u2019 measures Government-directed social distancing measures may increase from reactively \u2013 or, if necessary, preemptively \u2013 closing schools if it appears children are particularly susceptible; encouraging, or potentially mandating, workplace closures and working from home; and cancelling large public events. And Australia will also attempt to insulate itself from any growing pandemic with increasing travel advisories for countries that are experiencing significant outbreaks. Already, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised the travel advisory for China to the highest level: \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d, and told its citizens already in the country they should leave the country as soon as they are able. On Monday, the Australian government raised its travel advice for both South Korea and Japan. \u201cBased on advice from Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, we now recommend you \u2018exercise a high degree of caution\u2019... due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19),\u201d Dfat said of both countries. What individuals can do Risk communication experts Jody Lanard and Peter Sandman have argued that with the rise in cases globally, \u201cit\u2019s a good time to think about how to use the \u2018P-word\u2019 (pandemic) in talking about Covid-19\u201d. \u201cThe most crucial (and overdue) risk communication task for the next few days is to help people visualise their communities when \u2018keeping it out\u2019 \u2013 containment \u2013 is no longer relevant. The P word is a good way to launch this message.\u201d Lanard and Sandman say there are measures individuals can take to prepare for and deal with a potential global outbreak. They advise people with medical conditions to \u201cget ahead\u201d on prescriptions if possible \u201cin case of very predictable supply chain disruptions, and so they won\u2019t have to go out to the pharmacy at a time when there may be long lines of sick people\u201d. Lanard and Sandman also recommend people slowly starting to stock up on non-perishable food \u201cto last their households through several weeks of social distancing at home during an intense wave of transmission in their community\u201d. \u201cAnd the example we like the best, because it gives every single person an immediate action that they can take over and over: right now, today, start practicing not touching your face when you are out and about! \u201cYou probably won\u2019t be able to do it perfectly, but you can greatly reduce the frequency of potential self-inoculation. You can even institute a buddy system, where friends and colleagues are asked to remind each other when someone scratches her eyelid or rubs his nose.\u201d Preparing for a pandemic The government\u2019s emergency response plan says Australia is well placed globally to respond to any widespread outbreak, but that the risks should not be under-estimated. \u201cThe novel coronavirus outbreak represents a significant risk to Australia. It has the potential to cause high levels of morbidity and mortality and to disrupt our community socially and economically.\u201d This month, the Australian government updated its Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). The plan outlines a staged response to a worsening pandemic: Australia is currently in the \u201cinitial action\u201d stage. The emergency response plans says impact of the outbreak will be determined by: the clinical severity of the outbreak (how severe cases are, and many people need to be hospitalised) its transmissibility (how easily it is spread, currently it has a preliminary reproduction number of 1.4 to 2.5) the capacity of the health system to treat infected patients the effectiveness of interventions to treat the illness or stop it spreading Victoria\u2019s chief health minister, Dr Brett Sutton, said all Australian states, along with the commonwealth government, have been working on pandemic preparedness for weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that with local transmission in several countries a pandemic is very likely, if not inevitable. We are working rapidly on planning and surge with our health sector. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided guidance to practitioners and many communications materials but are now focused on the models of care that will need to be in place \u2013 clinics, phone triage, home care, right through to ICU and aged care.\u201d \u201cVictoria and Australia nonetheless remain completely in containment mode,\u201d Sutton said, \u201cidentifying any possible case; isolating those who are infectious; and quarantining contacts. Regardless of developments internationally, this gives all of us time and space to plan and prepare.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A clear and growing majority of Coalition voters support the Morrison government adopting a net zero target for 2050, with support for that proposition climbing 12 points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest fortnightly survey shows a majority of Australian voters support net zero either strongly or somewhat (75%, up four points in a month), and 68% of Coalition voters in the sample hold that positive view. Last month, the proportion of supportive Coalition voters was 56%. The decisive shift in positive sentiment from Coalition voters follows calls from within the government to consider the 2050 target, and Labor\u2019s decision late last week to sign on to net zero \u2013 confirmation that has reignited the climate wars in Canberra. While the Morrison government is leaving its options open on a 2050 target, its current messaging is suggestive of substituting a technology roadmap for a target. The debate about net zero dominated parliament on Monday. The Coalition is blasting Labor for adopting the target in the absence of a fleshed-out plan to get there, while Labor and the Sydney independent MP Zali Steggall are pressuring the government to detail the impact of failing to act to prevent dangerous global heating. More than 70 countries and 398 cities say they have adopted a net zero position. Every Australian state has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals. Net zero is also supported by large companies and by their lobby group, the Business Council of Australia. Given the resumption of partisan brawling about climate policy and tensions within both of the major parties about the future of coal, voters in the Guardian Essential survey were asked a number of questions about their attitudes to a transition to low emissions. A majority of voters in the survey (75%) believe improvements in renewable energy means it will become less necessary to burn coal for electricity, and 65% say both advances in technology and global agreements on emissions reduction will result in coal becoming uneconomical to extract in the future. A majority (64%) says if Australia is serious about climate action, we will need to get out of coal as soon as possible. All of those propositions attract majority support amongst Coalition voters (70%, 60%, 54%). But a majority in the sample (61%, and 72% of Coalition voters) also say Australia should continue to export coal for steel production, even if we stop exporting coal for use in power plants. The survey also points to divided sentiment between the city and regional areas. For example, city dwellers are more likely to agree with a statement that if Australia is serious about the climate emergency we need to exit coal (67%) than people in the regions (56%). Voters were also asked about the future of coal-fired power plants, given the Morrison government has allocated $4m for a feasibility study examining a new facility at Collinsville. Also in prospect is taxpayer underwriting of coal \u2013 a development championed by Nationals but criticised by some moderate Liberals. Just under half the sample (47%) say coal plants should continue to operate as long as they are profitable, but the industry should not be subsidised or expanded. Coalition voters are more comfortable than other voting cohorts with subsidies. Greens voters are the most supportive of moves to shut down the coal industry (62%) with that position endorsed by 36% of Labor voters and 21% of Coalition voters in the sample. As well as the climate questions, voters were asked about the coronavirus, with experts saying the world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the illness. Just under one-third of survey respondents have changed their behaviour in some way to try to avoid contracting the virus \u2013 either avoiding restaurants and shopping centres, or cancelling an overseas trip. While 70% of people in the survey say their personal behaviour has been business as usual, four out of five respondents agree that because of global movements in people, humanity is more vulnerable to the spread of viruses (81%). There is also strong support (80%) for the travel ban that prevents Chinese visitors entering Australia, and only 20% say the border with China should remain open to protect revenue from tourism and overseas students. Both the Morrison government and the media get the thumbs up from the sample for managing the risks and reporting the latest developments. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory last May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%. The sample size this fortnight is 1,090 respondents.",

The Italian index is down more than 5.3% following news that the local death toll due to coronavirus rose to seven this afternoon. More than \u00a363bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 so far today, though we still have about 20 minutes of trading to go. Oil prices have taken another tumble, with Brent crude now down 4.8% or $2.86 per barrel at $55.64. The FTSE 100 continues to lose ground and is now at its lowest level since early October 2019. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, explains that London\u2019s blue chip index is suffering due in part to the slump in oil and mining stocks, which rely on Chinese demand for a good chunk of their growth. He says: For the UK, the FTSE100 has been a particular target for investors and stands down over 5% in the year to date, given its particular exposure to oil and mining as well as the obviously affected areas of tourism and travel. By the same token, and perhaps of some consolation to longer-term investors looking for an entry point, is the reminder that mark downs such as this can be indiscriminate as sentiment deteriorates, and that there will be certain sectors which will be less affected by the outbreak. Even so, the fact that the gold price is hitting multi-year highs is reflective of the current penchant of investors towards havens. Until there is some clarity on whether the virus has been sufficiently contained, the market will likely remain on tenterhooks. This is the biggest slump in European shares since the middle of 2016, according to Reuters. But in what looks like an attempt to avoid panic, the World Health Organisation has issued fresh statements clarifying that they\u2019re still not categorising the coronavirus outbreak as a \u201cpandemic\u201d just yet. According to Reuters news wire, the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that at the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of the virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths. He adds: Using the word pandemic does not fit the facts We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic Shares on Wall Street have plummeted at the opening bell and European markets are also a sea of red, with the Italian market the worst hit, amid reports of rising deaths from the coronavirus in the country. Dow Jones down 848 points, or 2.93%, at 28,143 S&amp;P 500 down 91 points, or 2.75%, at 3,245 Nasdaq down 334 points, or 3.49%, at 9,242 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 262 points, or 3.56%, at 7,140 Germany\u2019s Dax down 544 points, or 4%, at 13,035 France\u2019s CAC down 243 points, or 4%, at 5,786 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 1,407, or 5.68%, at 23,368 Crude oil has also sold off, and is now trading $2.71 a barrel lower at $55.79, a 4.63% drop. The turmoil in financial markets comes as there are reports of more deaths in Italy, which is at the centre of the coronavirus crisis in Europe. A seventh person has died in the country, according to the Ansa news agency. The falls on Wall Street have dragged the MSCI world stock index into negative territory for the year so far. It\u2019s down 2.7% on the day. Wall Street has opened sharply lower \u2013 even worse than expected. The declines come after US indices hit record highs last week. Dow Jones down 988 points, or 3.41%, at 28,004 S&amp;P 500 down 104 points, or 3.14%, at 3232 Nasdaq down 407 points, or 4.25%, at 9169 A quick look at the markets before Wall Street opens. Stocks and oil have tumbled further. FTSE 100 in London down 280 points, or 3.78%, at 7123 Germany\u2019s Dax in Frankfurt down 556 points, or 4.1%, at 13022 France\u2019s CAC 40 in Paris down 248 points, or 4.1%, at 5781 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 1,454 points, or 5.81%, at 23,328 Crude oil has also plunged, by 4.85%, or $2.61 a barrel, to $50.77 a barrel. As the virus spreads in Europe, investors are dumping stocks and rushing into safe-haven assets such as gold (at a seven-year high today). Futures are pointing to sharp declines on Wall Street when it opens for trading in less than half an hour. The Dow Jones is expected to open 800 points lower. Last week, Wall Street\u2019s main indices rose to record highs as optimism spread among investors that the global economy would bounce back from the coronavirus hit. There has been a sixth death from the coronavirus in northern Italy, according to the state broadcaster RAI. Economists at ING have looked at the impact of the virus outbreak on economies in Asia, in a note entitled: \u201cHolidays in hell: slumping tourism will cost Asia $105bn-$115bn in 2020\u201d. Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific, at ING says: The impact of the coronavirus on economies in Asia is potentially huge, as tourism in the region takes a beating... If we assume that tourism to and from China basically grinds to a halt in 2020, and extra- regional tourism also diminishes, then the cost to the region from lost tourism revenues alone is approximately US$105bn-$115bn. The World Health Organization has praised China for the measures it\u2019s taken to stop the coronavirus spreading. Bruce Aylward, the head of a visiting WHO delegation, said the \u201cincredibly difficult measures\u201d probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases in the country. He also said several data sources suggested there is a general downward trend in the number of of infections being reported by China\u2019s National Health Commission, despite some statistical problems. The commission reported 409 new coronavirus cases today, down from 648 the day before. Chinese authorities have begun to unwind some of the transport and travel restrictions that were put in place last month. The virus has killed nearly 2,600 people in mainland China and infected nearly 80,000. However, a spike in cases in Italy and south Korea has caused alarm \u2013 and world stock markets have tumbled as a result. A fifth person infected with the coronavirus has died in Italy. The German business association BDI says several manufacturing sectors are expecting a shortage of supplies from the Far East in coming weeks due to the coronavirus. Affected sectors include engineering, cars, pharmaceuticals and paper. BDI says: The more than 5,000 German companies in China are currently severely restricted in procurement, production and sales. HSBC\u2019s search for a permanent chief executive may have suffered a setback today, after one of the reported candidates pulled out. Jean Pierre Mustier, boss of Italy\u2019s Unicredit, will stay there, Unicredit said. Unicredit said it \u201cnormally never comments on rumours and speculations\u201d \u2013 a rule it will apparently break if the story is strong enough: [T]he Group would like to state that Jean Pierre Mustier confirms he will remain with the bank. UniCredit would also like to remind everyone that it has just launched a new strategic plan, Team 23, and that the whole management team, including Jean Pierre Mustier, is fully focused on its successful execution. HSBC is currently being led by Noel Quinn on an interim basis. He could still get the nod permanently, to carry out his plan to cut 35,000 jobs across the world, including significant cuts in the UK. An interesting point from influential economist Mohamed El-Erian, who serves as chief economic adviser at Allianz, the insurer. Stock markets have been on a tear in recent months even as economic fundamentals have appeared weaker. The coronavirus outbreak could test that divergence \u2013 particularly given central banks\u2019 limited arsenal. Interest rates are still at historically low levels, suggesting that any further support can only be limited relative to the response after the financial crisis a decade ago. A quick Brexit update via the politics live blog: don\u2019t bet on everything being finished by the new year. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, the French Europe minister, on Monday said that France will not sign up to a bad trade deal with the UK just to meet Boris Johnson\u2019s December 2020 deadline. Johnson has set this deadline by ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition. The Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, translates: \u201cJust because Boris Johnson wants an agreement at any cost doesn\u2019t mean we will sign a bad deal for the French, under pressure of blackmail or the timetable.\u201d You can follow today\u2019s Brexit developments with Andrew Sparrow on the politics live blog: Investors are pricing in an increased chance of the European Central Bank cutting interest rates in the coming months. A rate cut would aim to support growth at a time when the coronavirus outbreak adds to risks to the eurozone economy. Reuters reported: Eonia money market futures dated to the ECB\u2019s July 2020 meeting show about 5 basis points [0.05 percentage points] of rate cuts are now priced in, up from 3.5 bps a week ago. That equates to roughly a 50% chance of a 10-bps cut versus 35% last week. It marks a turnaround from the start of 2020, when a stabilisation in data had led to a view that the ECB might be encouraged to start raising rates from next year. The ECB\u2019s next interest rate decision is due on 12 March. Bird of prey update: reader Michael Nelson suggests Christine Lagarde was holding a peregrine falcon, the world\u2019s fastest animal when it dives for prey. The picture was \u201cmaybe a subtle reference to aggressive bird brains needing to be held in check\u201d, he said. The Encyclopedia Britannica suggests that hawks are members of a different genus to falcons \u2013 although the terms are often used interchangeably. And just to complicate matters, the peregrine falcon is sometimes known as the duck hawk. The implications on monetary policy remain unclear. What does the most successful investor in modern history think about the coronavirus outbreak, amid market turmoil? Ignore the headlines. Warren Buffett, known as the sage of Omaha, has made billions of dollars from buying shares in companies and holding them for years \u2013 a strategy that seems remarkably unpopular in light of markets\u2019 response to news. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said: If you\u2019re buying a business you\u2019re going to own it for 10 years, or 20 years, or 30 years. The real question is has the 10-year or 20-year outlook for American businesses changed in the last 24 hours or 48 hours? You don\u2019t buy or sell your business based on today\u2019s headlines. If it gives you a chance to buy something that you like and you can buy it even cheaper it\u2019s your good luck, basically. Coronavirus fears are pushing European shares on the Stoxx 600 towards their worst day since 2016 \u2013 the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. The falls suggest that investors are starting to price in a direct hit to European economic growth that could hurt company profits. Central banks are already watching carefully. Fitting with that theme, here\u2019s a picture that central bank watchers will see again and again: European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde holding a bird of prey at the meeting of central bankers and finance ministers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Asked about her monetary policy stance in December, Lagarde said she would aim to be a \u201cwise owl\u201d, rather than fitting in the classic dichotomy of hawk (tighter monetary policy to stop inflation)/dove (looser monetary policy to support growth). Nevertheless, the coronavirus outbreak could tip the ECB back towards the dovish end of the scale. (We are hesitating to say it\u2019s a hawk definitively \u2013 please do tag me on Twitter/comment below if you can identify it.) The renewed concerns on the spread of the coronavirus have pushed oil prices back down \u2013 ending a relief rally over the middle of February. The price of futures for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, have fallen by $2 per barrel to $56.40 \u2013 a steep 3.6% decline. Futures prices for its North American counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, also declined by 3.5%. Warren Patterson, head of commodity strategy at ING, an investment bank, said: Travel restrictions and factory shutdowns caused by Covid-19 are already leading to big problems for oil-producing countries. We believe the virus\u2019 effect on oil demand will shave some 400,000 barrels a day from global consumption growth, taking us to the lowest level in nearly a decade. Another aspect of the flight to safe havens is visible on currency markets, with the demand ascent of the US dollar. Sterling has lost 0.5% against the dollar on Monday. One pound bought $1.2909 at the time of writing. The euro lost 0.26%, trading at 1.082 against the greenback at the time of writing. The relative strength of the US economy, and its distance from the coronavirus outbreak\u2019s epicentre in China, had helped it become a haven for investors (although it fell back slightly on Friday). Smoking kills half of all people who take it up, but Philip Morris International (PMI) wants to be seen as part of the solution even though the company continues to make and market cigarettes around the world. PMI, one of the world\u2019s biggest tobacco companies, drew up plans for a \u00a31bn tobacco transition fund in the UK to be spent by local authorities and Public Health England on persuading smokers to give up cigarettes in favour of alternatives such as its \u201cheat not burn\u201d smokeless tobacco product, IQOS, leaked documents reveal, writes the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley. The documents, obtained by the Guardian and Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches programme, show PMI had discussions with a leading anti-tobacco MP about presenting a smoke-free bill proposing the fund to the House of Commons. If passed, the bill would have ended an advertising and marketing ban on IQOS and e-cigarettes. You can read the full story here: A large dose of scepticism on that fairly positive reading from Germany on the business climate: economists are essentially saying that the worst is yet to come. Better expectations from industry are usually bullish sign, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, but it\u2019s difficult to interpret these data at the moment. As we type, global\u2014and in particular EZ\u2014equities finally have woken up to the fact that what has been very draconian measure in China to curb the spread of the virus\u2014at least from the point of view of the economy\u2014are now spreading to the rest of the world. News over the weekend that several towns in Northern Italy have been effectively shut down \u2013 and air and rail traffic suspended between Italy and Austria \u2013 seems to have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. In short, financial markets are now starting to price in an increasingly nasty economic shock at the start of 2020. Daniela Ordonez, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics, agreed. The data are positive, but given recent events they illustrate that the economic effects will take longer to really hit home. With the virus now at the gates of Europe, with the the spate of new cases reported in Italy, survey data are very likely to deteriorate rapidly in coming months. A worsening of hard eurozone data is likely to follow since the fragility of global supply chains means even small disruptions in China\u2019s output could still have large repercussions for Europe down the line. For now, we continue to believe that the epidemic will be contained to the first half of 2020, so the German and eurozone industrial recovery will not be derailed but only delayed until the second half of the year. Of course, this outlook could deteriorate rapidly should the virus, now spreading to developed countries, fails to be contained. It\u2019s now a 3.3% fall for the FTSE 100. It is down by 244 points, to 7,158 points. As you can see from the following chart of daily performances over the past year, it\u2019s quite a striking fall. But it also helps to put the fall in context: shares on London\u2019s blue-chip index have only been knocked back to their levels ahead of the general election in December. We mentioned earlier that investors were seeking safe-haven assets. It appears to be a full-on pivot away from riskier assets this morning, with money flowing to bonds. The yield on the UK\u2019s 10-year gilt has fallen by 7 basis points (0.07 percentage points) to hit three-week lows of 0.508%. Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen as more investors look for less risky assets like government debt. The US 10-year Treasury yield has dropped by 8 basis points, and the yield on the longest US government bond, the 30-year, has fallen to a record low. An interesting reading from the Ifo Institute in Germany: its widely followed business climate indicator has actually beaten expectations \u2013 a reminder, perhaps, that the much of the coronavirus\u2019s financial effects so far are down to fear, uncertainty and doubt. The Ifo\u2019s business climate reading came in at 96.1 points, compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 95.3. The institute is sticking to its first-quarter growth forecast of 0.2%. Ifo president Clemens Fuest said in a statement: The German economy seems unaffected by developments surrounding the coronavirus. That FTSE 100 selloff has deepened: it\u2019s now down by 2.8%, more than 200 points. Germany\u2019s Dax is down by 3.4%, France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 3.5%, and the FTSE MIB in Italy has dropped by 4%. Here\u2019s a handy heat map from Hargreaves Lansdown showing which stocks have fallen: it\u2019s almost all of them. Some 96 of the FTSE 100 were down at the time of writing. Those tourism stocks are the worst performers, but some of the miners are also in the crosshairs (likely amid expectations of slumping demand) and it\u2019s also worth noting the 5.4% fall from Barclays, which is reportedly searching for a new chief executive. Here\u2019s what the FT said in its report (\u00a3) from this morning: Mr Staley, 63, who has led the bank since December 2015, has told colleagues he expects to leave the group by the end of next year, according to two people briefed on the bank\u2019s plans. He could stand down at the annual meeting in May 2021, they added. A rough timetable for Mr Staley\u2019s departure was in place before Britain\u2019s top financial regulators recently launched an investigation into his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier. But one of the people said the probe had \u201cfocused minds\u201d on the bank\u2019s board of directors and injected a sense of urgency into the process. Of those few that eked out a gain, packaging company Bunzl beat expectations on annual profits and announced new acquisitions. Take a look at the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: it\u2019s companies exposed to European tourism that are most affected. Budget airline Easyjet is the biggest faller, down by 11%. Package holiday provider Tui has lost 9% and British Airways owner IAG has lost 7.8%. And Carnival, the cruise ship operator, has lost another 5%. The company (the only one which is a member of both the S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 indices) has fallen steeply during 2020 after an outbreak of the virus on its Diamond Princess cruise ship. The flight to safety for investors fearful of the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak has pushed gold prices to their highest since February 2013. Spot gold prices rose by 2.1% on Monday to hit highs above $1,679 per troy ounce. Investors traditionally buy gold as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. Slower growth usually translates to lower interest rates, making the yellow metal more attractive. A quick diversion from coronavirus: a shakeup in the UK\u2019s struggling estate agency sector. Two of Britain\u2019s biggest estate agency groups are in talks over a possible \u00a3470m merger that will bring together well-known brands such as Hamptons International and Your Move and could also mean job losses, writes the Guardian\u2019s Julia Kollewe. In a brief statement to the stock market, Countrywide said that \u201cit is in discussions with LSL Property Services regarding a possible all-share combination\u201d. Countrywide is the UK\u2019s largest listed property services group and owns about 60 high street brands including Hamptons International, Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne-Pees. It has more than 850 branches across the country and employs more than 10,000 people. You can read more here: If you need an indication of why Italy is bearing the brunt of stock market losses this morning, here\u2019s why Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco has warned that the outbreak could wipe a quarter of a percentage point from Italy\u2019s economic growth this year. Early calculations suggest the outbreak could knock by 0.1 percentage point off global growth this year, Visco said yesterday, according to a report (\u00a3) by Bloomberg at the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Riyadh. Here\u2019s more from the report: \u201cI\u2019m already worried now but if we don\u2019t see a material improvement by September, I\u2019d be really worried,\u201d Visco said. \u201cYou need two quarters to realize and understand.\u201d Visco lent weight to his argument by warning there\u2019s a risk of a \u201cmini de-globalization\u201d if pessimism and fears about further supply-chain interruptions leave the economy suffering for a protracted period. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\u201d Renewed fears over the coronavirus outbreak have prompted steep falls on European stock markets \u2013 most notably in Italy, which has suffered the most serious outbreak outside Asia. In Milan the FTSE MIB fell by 3.4% in early trading. The FTSE 100 fell by 1.8% at the time of writing, or 131 points, to about 7,267 points \u2013 a two-month low. The FTSE 250 fell by 1.5%. France\u2019s Cac 40 lost 2.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax lost 2.5%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of economics, business, the eurozone and international markets. The coronavirus outbreak has gained pace outside of China, and stock markets in Europe are expected to react heavily. The World Health Organisation on Sunday reported 78,811 confirmed cases, but 367 new cases came outside China, a larger proportion than previously. Italy has imposed strict travel conditions, including fines for people leaving certain areas in the north of the country. Health experts have suggested that the pace of the outbreak outside of China is concerning \u2013 although in China some restrictions have been eased. European stock market futures prices indicate that heavy losses are expected at the opening bell as efforts to contain the virus spread. In London the FTSE 100 is likely to fall by 1.3%. The blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 is pegged to fall by 1.8%, as are Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40. That followed heavy falls during Asian trading hours. South Korea has suffered a spike in cases, with the knock-on effect of plunging stocks: the country\u2019s Kospi index slumped by 3.9%. Losses were more contained in China, where the outbreak has already taken its toll. Primark owner AB Foods indicated that its factories have been affected by the outbreak, with reduced capacity at its Ovaltine plant \u2013 baked goods and animal feed have also been affected. It does not expect Primark to be affected in the short term, but warned that could change if there is prolonged disruption. We typically build inventories in advance of Chinese New Year and, as a consequence, are well stocked with cover for several months and do not expect any short-term impact If delays to factory production are prolonged, the risk of supply shortages on some lines later this financial year increases. We are assessing mitigating strategies, including a step up in production from existing suppliers in other regions.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The EU executive also announced a \u20ac232m (\u00a3195m) package to deal with the virus, although some of the funds have yet to be signed off.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday the commission said that any suspension of free movement within the 26-country EU free-travel zone should be based on a credible risk assessment and scientific evidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are facing \u2026 an unfolding situation, a complex situation and any decisions made need to be based on risk assessment and scientific advice, and need to be proportionate,\u201d said Stella Kyriakides, EU commissioner for health and food safety. \u201cWe stress that for the moment WHO has not advised changing or imposing restrictions on either travel or trade.\u201d</p> \n<p>A commission spokesman said: \u201cRight now, our advice does not include border controls.\u201d</p> \n<p>Governments in the passport-free Schengen zone can reintroduce border controls if there is \u201ca serious threat to public policy or internal security\u201d.

In it Sedwill says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Candour, confidentiality and courtesy between ministers, special advisers and civil servants are crucial to the trust and confidence on which good governance depends. Civil servants should at all times be confident that they can give the honest, impartial and objective advice on which ministers can rely.

Croatia currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the EU.</p> <p>Normally these Downing Street read-outs are epically uninformative - \u201cthe prime minister and President Trump spoke this evening and discussed a range of bilateral and international issues,\u201d they told us last week \u2013 but this one contains some fresh words on the forthcoming UK-EU trade talks that are interesting, because they reaffirm Johnson\u2019s determination for the UK not to be \u201csubordinate\u201d to EU rules.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leaders spoke about the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The prime minister set out the UK\u2019s vision based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade.</p> <p>The prime minister highlighted that we are not seeking a special or bespoke agreement, but rather one like those the EU has already struck with other friendly countries like Canada. He emphasised that the UK will not extend the transition period or accept any arrangements which subordinate us to EU rules. </p> </blockquote> <p>During the 2016, and afterwards, Brexiters used to argue that the UK would get a special trade deal with the EU. \u201cThe day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want,\u201d Michael Gove, who is now Cabinet Office minister, said during the campaign. And when Theresa May (not a Brexiter) was PM, she said she wanted an ambitious, bespoke deal with the EU.</p> <p>Now the goal is quite different - not a special deal, but an off-the-shelf Canada-style one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5719bce9c742cb18baa757fafa85ba919ed6af3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5719bce9c742cb18baa757fafa85ba919ed6af3f/0_54_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson meets Croatia\u2019s prime minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 in Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson meets Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, in Downing Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T16:18:25.505Z\">at 4.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e53eb9e8f0811db2fafd828\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T15:31:59.756Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour tells its members they may have to wait few days before getting leadership ballot paper</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Voting in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership contest opens today.

Insiders say she was appointed because her predecessor Geoffrey Cox was not willing to countenance action that will be seen in Brussels as a breach of the exit agreement.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f70954eb5d3e381ccad2092e521d40862191fae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f70954eb5d3e381ccad2092e521d40862191fae/770_30_1545_927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reinhard Krause/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e53b28f8f0811db2fafd5e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T11:32:54.665Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Is the UK trying to blackmail France into accepting a trade deal, as the French Europe minister implied this morning? </em>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/24/labour-leadership-starmer-refuses-to-commit-to-offering-corbyn-shadow-cabinet-post-live-news?page=with:block-5e53a6788f0811db2fafd58a#block-5e53a6788f0811db2fafd58a\">10.39am.)</a></p> <p>No, says the spokesman.</p> <p><em>Q: Is the PM concerned about suggestions that the UK is trying to wriggle out of the commitments it made in the Northern Ireland protocol on checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.</em></p> <p>The spokesman says there will be unfettered access from Northern Ireland to Britain.</p> <p>He says the UK will comply with its obligations.</p> <p><em>Q: Can people trust the UK to keep its word?</em></p> <p>The spokesman says the UK will comply with its obligations.</p> <p><em>Q: Can the UK comply with its obligations without having to impose checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland</em>?<br></p> <p>The spokesman says the PM set out during the election campaign his understanding of the terms of the protocol.</p> <p>He says the government has not asked ports to impose new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it.

Here are the main points from all three interviews.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer refused to commit to offering Jeremy Corbyn a post in the shadow cabinet if he won.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/24/labour-leadership-starmer-refuses-to-commit-to-offering-corbyn-shadow-cabinet-post-live-news?page=with:block-5e538ac68f08e13324748f5b#block-5e538ac68f08e13324748f5b\">9.21am.) </a>He insisted that he had not had any discussions about possible shadow cabinet appointments, and he refused to comment on claims that there might be jobs for people like Ed Miliband or Yvette Cooper.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was opposed to the government\u2019s plan to use salary thresholds to determine if migrants should be allowed to come to the UK to work.</strong> Asked about the Home Office proposals announced last week, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The position the government has just taken is completely wrong - where they are equating the worth of an individual coming to this country by how much money they earn. I think that\u2019s profoundly the wrong approach ... I think the idea that if you don\u2019t earn a certain salary you\u2019re not bringing anything of any worth to this country is offensive.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if that meant he would do away with salary thresholds, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would - I do not think they are the right measure for the worth of an individual coming to this country.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He did not rule out campaigning for the UK to move towards a Norway-style relationship with the EU at the next general election. </strong>He said he expected the next election to be in 2024. Asked if at that point he might be advocating a closer relationship with the EU, akin to Norway\u2019s, he said: \u201cWe will have to see what the situation is in 2024.\u201d But he also said that it was in the UK\u2019s interests to be economically close to the EU.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he disagreed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/20/tony-blair-only-a-complete-renewal-of-labour-will-do\">what Tony Blair said last week </a>about how Labour should not let its support for trans rights lead to it getting involved in a culture war with conservatives.</strong> Blair said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019ve got to distinguish between the advocacy of certain things that are right, whether it\u2019s about gay rights, transgender rights, whatever it is - you\u2019ve got to distinguish between that and launching yourself politically into a kind of culture war with the right. If you go: \u2018Transgender rights is our big thing\u2019, and the right goes: \u2018Immigration control is our big thing\u2019, you\u2019re going to lose that war.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about this, Starmer said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I actually think that the way that a potential leader of the Labour party deals with the LGBT community matters hugely, and it is about the values we bring to this. So I disagree with Tony Blair about that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But Starmer also praised the record of the last Labour government, saying \u201ca lot of good stuff\u201d happened when it was in power. </strong>He said that it was wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of previous Labour governments, but that it was also wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of what had done in opposition over the last five years. He praised Jeremy Corbyn for turning the party into an anti-austerity party.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer claimed that \u201coutriders\u201d from other campaigns were floating allegations that his campaign was funded by wealthy donors.</strong> He said that he had received contributions from trade unions, from crowdfunding and from individuals, as other candidates had, and he said that donations would all be declared. He implied the accusations were unfair.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think this is one of those things that is swirling around. So far the candidates themselves have avoided taking lumps out of each other. I think some of the outriders are trying to stir things up a bit now.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that it had been a mistake for him to abstain on the second reading of the welfare reform bill in 2015.</strong> He said that he was a new MP at the time and he was abstaining in line with the party whip.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He struggled to refute a suggestion that he was boring.</strong> On LBC Ferrari said a Financial Times profile of him today is headlined: \u2018Boring\u2019 Starmer seeks to heal wounded party.\u2019 Asked to name the most exciting thing he had done, to prove he was not boring, Starmer replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve done lots of exciting things. You know, well, with playing football, going to football with my kids. </p> </blockquote> <p>He eventually came up with a story about how, when he got stranded in Newcastle one day during the campaign, on Valentine\u2019s night, he checked into a hotel and went to his room to find someone sleeping in the bed. Asked if it was a man or a woman, Starmer said he did not stay long enough to find out.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer rejected claims that he tried to bring down Corbyn in 2016. </strong>Asked about a Twitter video released by the leftwing Fire Brigades Union, and whether he had tried to bring down Corbyn at the time, Starmer denied this. But he confirmed that he did resign from the shadow cabinet. Starmer said that, when Corbyn won the subsequent leadership election, he agreed to serve again in shadow cabinet. He said that he viewed Corbyn as a friend and that, when he disagreed with him, he kept that private.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fbunational/status/1231667607889207298\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The 2016 coup was a carefully coordinated attack on the democratic decision of Labour Party members - and it&#39;s right to look at the record of Labour Leadership contenders at the time<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLB4Leader?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RLB4Leader</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3riVvaLU1y\">pic.twitter.com/3riVvaLU1y</a></p>&mdash; Fire Brigades Union (@fbunational) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbunational/status/1231667607889207298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476f463a657ac949202f44b094e046cbc8b4fa06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476f463a657ac949202f44b094e046cbc8b4fa06/0_0_3154_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Keir Starmer at the Labour hustings in Durham yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Keir Starmer at the Labour hustings in Durham yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T11:29:20.047Z\">at 11.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5399a08f08e13324748fc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:39:26.782Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of Priti Patel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office\">Home Office</a> ministerial colleagues has dismissed claims that she is bullying officials, as the home secretary pushed for an inquiry into a series of damaging leaks about her approach in the department, my colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong> reports.

On the Today programme he was asked if there would be space for Jeremy Corbyn in his shadow cabinet if he won and, although he dodged the question, listeners might have concluded that the answer was no. When <strong>Mishal Husain</strong> asked Starmer if he would give Corbyn a job, Starmer replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, there\u2019s been so much speculation. I have not discussed that team with anybody. I\u2019m totally focused ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Husain then pressed him again, saying he must have a view on this. But Starmer stuck to the same line.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you can believe it, given that we have been at this for weeks, the ballot is only dropping today, no votes have been cast yet, I\u2019m focused on winning this race and getting as many votes as I possibly can through my argument about unity, effective opposition and focusing on winning the next general election. I have not discussed the shadow cabinet with anybody. And therefore whatever is swirling around, because there are names everywhere, it is all rumour, I can tell you. </p> </blockquote> <p>Although Starmer may not have discussed specific shadow cabinet jobs with anybody, at a Labour hustings yesterday he did say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/keir-starmer-commits-to-shadow-cabinet-posts-for-long-bailey-and-nandy\">there would be top jobs for both Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy if he won.</a> Previously he had declined to make that commitment.</p> <p>In truth, most Labour members would probably expect Corbyn to leave the frontbench whoever wins \u2013 not least because that is normally what outgoing leaders do (although some do later return to cabinet or shadow cabinet roles, like William Hague).

      "bodyText": "Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has said that unattributable briefings are damaging to government in a message to civil servants that will be seen as a rebuke to Tories who have been denouncing the work of officials anonymously to the media. (See 4.51pm.) Boris Johnson has been warned that the French government will not be blackmailed into a trade deal that risks its long-term economic interests, as the EU prepared to further harden its negotiating position. Britain\u2019s main goal in trade talks with the EU will be to \u201crestore economic and political independence from 1 January\u201d, No 10 has said, as the government prepares to publish its negotiating aims on Thursday Johnson has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the ability of Priti Patel, the home secretary, his official spokesman has said. Patel has told MPs that the new post-Brexit immigration rules announced last week, introducing income thresholds for people coming to the UK to work, could be revised over time. In a statement to MPs she said: We will continue to refine our immigration system and build on flexibility where it is needed. Over time more attributes for which points can be earned may be added, such as previous experience and additional qualifications, allowing us to respond effectively to the needs of the labour market and the economy. But to be effective it must be simple so there will not be the endless exemptions for low paid, lower-skilled workers. And we are not going to end free movement only to recreate through other routes in name only. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. According to the Financial Times\u2019 Mehreen Khan, EU ambassadors have approved the text of the EU\u2019s negotiating mandate for the trade talks with the UK. It is due to be approved by ministers at the general affairs council tomorrow. Here is the draft version (pdf) published at the start of February. According to Khan, a key change is in what was paragraph 89 in the draft, but what is now paragraph 92. This may be the most important sentence. To that end, the envisaged agreement should uphold the common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with union standards as a reference point, in the areas of State aid, competition, state-owned enterprises, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters and other regulatory measures and practices in these areas. As you can see from the changes (new material in bold, omitted material crossed out ), the changes tighten the level playing field provisions a bit in the direction of dynamic alignment (ie, the principle that standards must remain aligned over time) and away from non-regression (ie, the principle that standards just have to avoid getting weaker than they are now.) But they are quite subtle changes. \u201cOver time\u201d strengthens \u201cuphold\u201d, but arguably that is what uphold meant anyway. And having EU standards \u201cas a reference point\u201d implies some sort of alignment, while allowing an element of divergence. The addition of \u201cother regulatory measures and practices\u201d also reads like a catch-all addition designed to close any possible loopholes. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has written a message for civil servants deprecating \u201cunattributable briefings and leaks to the media\u201d. This practice \u201cbesmirches this country\u2019s hard-won reputation for good governance\u201d, he says. It has been posted on a civil service website. In it Sedwill says: Candour, confidentiality and courtesy between ministers, special advisers and civil servants are crucial to the trust and confidence on which good governance depends. Civil servants should at all times be confident that they can give the honest, impartial and objective advice on which ministers can rely. Both should be confident that this advice, and any debate that surrounds it, will remain private. Ministers may read this as a reprimand to officials briefing against them, such as those who appeared to be responsible for the Sunday Times story yesterday claiming that MI5 don\u2019t rate Priti Patel, the home secretary. But it also reads like a rebuke to those Tory sources who have been briefing against civil servants, such as those who told the Sunday Telegraph yesterday that three permanent secretaries were on a government hitlist of officials destined for the chop. No doubt Sedwill has given some thought as to where these hostile anti-civil service briefings are coming from. That might make for an awkward conversation with some of the advisers he will bump into in the corridors of No 10 ... Here is another picture from the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival. At a street carnival in D\u00fcsseldorf Germans have been joking about the way Boris Johnson has divided the UK. These carnivals are an annual tradition, and today, Rosenmontag (Rose Monday - the Monday before Lent), is the highlight, apparently. Boris Johnson met Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, prime minister of Croatia, in Downing Street earlier today and No 10 has just sent out the read-out of their conversation. Croatia currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the EU. Normally these Downing Street read-outs are epically uninformative - \u201cthe prime minister and President Trump spoke this evening and discussed a range of bilateral and international issues,\u201d they told us last week \u2013 but this one contains some fresh words on the forthcoming UK-EU trade talks that are interesting, because they reaffirm Johnson\u2019s determination for the UK not to be \u201csubordinate\u201d to EU rules. A No 10 spokesperson said: The leaders spoke about the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The prime minister set out the UK\u2019s vision based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade. The prime minister highlighted that we are not seeking a special or bespoke agreement, but rather one like those the EU has already struck with other friendly countries like Canada. He emphasised that the UK will not extend the transition period or accept any arrangements which subordinate us to EU rules. During the 2016, and afterwards, Brexiters used to argue that the UK would get a special trade deal with the EU. \u201cThe day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want,\u201d Michael Gove, who is now Cabinet Office minister, said during the campaign. And when Theresa May (not a Brexiter) was PM, she said she wanted an ambitious, bespoke deal with the EU. Now the goal is quite different - not a special deal, but an off-the-shelf Canada-style one. Voting in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership contest opens today. But the party is advising members that they may not receive their ballot paper, or ballot email, immediately. It has circulated this note to journalists. Ballot papers are being issued to hundreds of thousands of Labour members and supporters \u2013 by email, or post if we don\u2019t hold an email address. Members and supporters are being advised that they should not be concerned if they don\u2019t receive their ballot papers today, or even on Tuesday. Emails are being issued in batches due to the size of the electorate, and we expect it will take most of this week to send them all. Requests for ballot papers to be reissued will only be processed from Monday 2 March. We are asking members and supporters not to request a reissue before this date. We are naturally expecting a high volume of enquiries by phone and email from members and supporters in the coming days. We are asking the media to help limit this to genuine enquiries, by not publishing scare stories about the process or giving credence to exaggerated or misleading claims. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, has been campaigning in Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd today. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. The government has moved to ban membership of more rightwing terrorism groups, the Press Association reports. A proscription order has been put before parliament which would make joining the organisation Sonnenkrieg Division illegal in the UK, the Home Office said. The proposal has to be debated and is subject to parliament backing it. Laws coming into force on Tuesday will also recognise System Resistance Network as an alias of the already-proscribed group National Action. Anyone found to be a member of, or offering support to, the groups could now face up to 10 years in jail. On a visit to Derry, Brandon Lewis, the new Northern Ireland secretary, has said that the government will not impose a customs border down the Irish Sea. Asked about the issue, he said: I think it\u2019s safest not to get too caught up in rumours and stuff in the press over the weekends. We are focusing on our main job. We have always said we want to make sure there is unfettered access between GB and Northern Ireland, we\u2019ve always as a government obviously gone by the rule of law and we will continue to do that. We want to make sure that the United Kingdom is one whole union, and one that is good for business across the United Kingdom. We\u2019ve always said there will not be a border down the Irish Sea, there will be unfettered access for business. There were cases last year of people threatening to leave the country if Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister. But David Graeber, the anthropologist, radical author and anarchism advocate, may be the first person to threaten to leave the country if Keir Starmer becomes leader of the opposition. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been advised to avoid becoming a \u201ccreature of No 10\u201d at next month\u2019s budget by steering clear of raising government spending to satisfy Boris Johnson\u2019s demands. David Gauke, the former justice secretary and Treasury minister who was expelled from the Conservatives for defying Johnson over Brexit, said Sunak was in danger of putting the public finances on an unsustainable path should he pump up government borrowing by too much to meet the prime minister\u2019s spending demands. Gauke said: You have got a new chancellor who will want to establish that he is not a creature of No 10. [Sunak], I would imagine, would want to assert that independence, if not necessarily on 11 March, sooner rather than later. Speaking at an event at the Resolution Foundation thinktank in London, Gauke said that the government\u2019s plans to increase spending could result in the national debt as a proportion of GDP increasing, which could be dangerous before a potential economic downturn. Now that is a very strange position to find ourselves in. It\u2019s a very strange position for a Conservative government to find itself in in particular. [There are] fundamental constraints here. The Treasury is going to have to continue to do the job the Treasury has done in the last 10 years, of being pretty tight with public spending, and making sure we do prioritise. Gauke also said that the Ministry of Justice had faced a funding settlement that was \u201cessentially unsustainable\u201d. He said prisoner numbers would increase as Boris Johnson\u2019s government toughened up sentencing criteria, meaning more prison officers would be needed. \u201cThose pressures are going to increase yet further,\u201d he added. The European Union has warned Boris Johnson against trying to water down the new customs rules for Northern Ireland that will apply under the withdrawal agreement from 2021. Speaking at the European commission\u2019s regular briefing, Dana Spinant, deputy chief spokeswoman of the commission, said this issue was \u201cvery important\u201d in maintaining trust between the two sides. She said: The withdrawal agreement has been signed and ratified by both sides and as such it must be effectively implemented. That includes, of course, the protocol on Northern Ireland and all its constituent parts. Of course, in this context as in all others, we would expect our partners to respect their international obligations under their national law and under international law - that includes, of course, the withdrawal agreement which has legal force. Obviously, with respect to the future and how this plays in the negotiation, of course respecting our legal obligations is very important for establishing trust between two partners in a negotiation. Spinant was responding to reports claiming Johnson does want to \u201cget around\u201d the rules he has promised to apply. (See 12.08pm.) Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, has also said there must be no \u201cbacksliding\u201d from the UK. (See 12.08pm.) Downing Street this morning rejected claims that the PM is planning to ignore the commitments he had made relating to the Northern Ireland border. But the spokesman also said that British ports had not been asked to prepare for any new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland \u2013 even though these would be required under the EU\u2019s interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 1.07pm.) Here are the main points from the No 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street rejected a suggestion from the French Europe minister (see 10.39am) that the UK is trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d the EU into agreeing a trade deal by the end of 2020. When this notion was put to the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, he rejected it firmly. But he confirmed that the government remained determined not to extend the post-Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020. The spokesman said that restoring independence would be the main goal for the UK in the trade talks with the EU. He said: The UK\u2019s primary objective in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021. This firms up the message given by David Frost, the PM\u2019s Brexit negotiator, in his speech in Brussels last week. But it will also be seen as fresh evidence that a \u201cno-deal\u201d outcome at the end of 2020 is a real possibility. The spokesman dismissed claims that the government was exploring ways of evading the commitments it has made for a customs border down the Irish Sea. (See 12.08pm.) Asked about this, the spokesman said: The [Northern Ireland] protocol specifically allows the UK to ensure unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to GB. The UK signed the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol, last month. We will comply with our obligations. The spokesman said British ports have not been asked to prepare for any new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. Asked for details of the UK\u2019s obligations under the protocol, the spokesman said: The prime minister set out during the election campaign what he understood to be the obligations of the protocol ... He has been clear that beyond the limited changes that are introduced by the protocol, there will be no changes to GB/NI trade, and we have not asked any ports to prepare for new checks or controls between GB/NI. As Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, explained in a Twitter thread yesterday, the EU believes that the protocol does oblige the UK to impose checks and controls. Here are two of his tweets. And here are two slides from a European commission document (pdf) explaining how the withdrawal agreement works setting out the checks that will apply for GB/NI and NI/GB trade. The spokesman said the government will publish its negotiating mandate for the trade talks with the EU on Thursday. The mandate for trade talks with the US will then be published next week. The spokesman defended the PM\u2019s decision to stay away from flooded areas last week, saying any such visits would have been a distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to distract from that ongoing effort,\u201d the spokesman said. The spokesman did not have a clear explanation as to why the PM took a different approach when flooding happened during the election campaign. The spokesman said there will be no inquiry into the leak of a claim that MI5 is withholding information from Priti Patel, the home secretary. But the claim was \u201cbaseless\u201d, the spokesman said. The spokesman declined to say the PM had full confidence in Sir Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary at the Home Office. Asked if he did, the spokesman replied: The prime minister has full confidence in the civil service which is working very hard to deliver on the government\u2019s priorities. Yesterday it was reported that Rutnam is one of three permanent secretaries on a Downing Street hitlist of officials whom the PM wants to remove. The spokesman rejected claims that the PM was on holiday last week. The suggestion that Boris Johnson was on holiday was prompted by the fact that he was staying at Chevening, and that he was not doing public engagements. The spokesman revealed that the UK has sent medical supplies to China to help it deal with the coronavirus. The UK has supplied 1,800 goggles, 43,000 disposable gloves, 194,000 sanitising wipes, 37,500 medical gowns and 2,500 face masks, the spokesman said. There are two government statements in the Commons this afternoon. This morning Leo Varadkar, who remains Ireland\u2019s caretaker prime minister after the inconclusive general election, said there must be no \u201cbacksliding\u201d from the UK on the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, the deal that will keep Northern Ireland in the single market after Brexit, effectively putting a customs border down the Irish Sea. Responding to a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) saying Boris Johnson intends to \u201cget round\u201d those requirements, Varadkar said: We totally understand why they may want to minimise any checks at the ports and airports in Northern Ireland, we want to do that too, but the agreement clearly says if there have to be checks anywhere, they would happen at the ports and airports in Northern Ireland rather than on the land border between north and south. So I am saying to the British government, there can be no backsliding on the withdrawal agreement, let\u2019s not even go there and let\u2019s focus instead on what should be the next phase, which is negotiating a free trade agreement between the European Union and Ireland and the UK so we can protect jobs and our economy. According to Tim Shipman\u2019s report in the Sunday Times, No 10 is determined to interpret the protocol differently. Shipman said: Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit team has been ordered to draw up plans to \u201cget around\u201d the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement so the prime minister can play hardball with Brussels over trade. Officials in Taskforce Europe, run by Johnson\u2019s EU negotiator David Frost, are working in secret on proposals to ensure that there do not need to be checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland. They believe the new attorney-general, Suella Braverman, might have to give new legal advice to justify the move. Insiders say she was appointed because her predecessor Geoffrey Cox was not willing to countenance action that will be seen in Brussels as a breach of the exit agreement. Q: Is the UK trying to blackmail France into accepting a trade deal, as the French Europe minister implied this morning? (See 10.39am.) No, says the spokesman. Q: Is the PM concerned about suggestions that the UK is trying to wriggle out of the commitments it made in the Northern Ireland protocol on checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. The spokesman says there will be unfettered access from Northern Ireland to Britain. He says the UK will comply with its obligations. Q: Can people trust the UK to keep its word? The spokesman says the UK will comply with its obligations. Q: Can the UK comply with its obligations without having to impose checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland? The spokesman says the PM set out during the election campaign his understanding of the terms of the protocol. He says the government has not asked ports to impose new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. I will post a full summary soon. Q: If the threat is low, why is the government buying millions of face masks? The spokesman says the UK government has been sending supplies to China, including 43,000 gloves, 37,000 medical gowns and 2,500 face masks. Q: How many Britons are affected by the coronavirus quarantine in Italy? The spokesman says he has no updates on this. He says there was a ministerial meeting of the Cobra emergency committee last week, and an officials\u2019 meeting too. Q: Has the UK contingency plans for sealing off areas, in the way the Italians have done? The spokesman says the government will follow the advice of public health experts. The chief medical officer says the risks to people in the UK are low, the spokesman says. And he says the NHS is extremely well prepared. Q: Will travel advice to Italy be changed? The spokesman says the advice on the Foreign Office\u2019s website was changed at the weekend to reflect the situation in some parts of Italy. Q: Can you explain the background to the appointment of someone to review the conditions of work for special advisers? The spokesman says the government decided to review this at the end of last year. This appointment is part of that process, he says. On Priti Patel, the spokesman says the home secretary and her permanent secretary issued a statement last night. He says the PM has full confidence in Patel. Q: Does the PM have confidence in Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary at the Home Office? The spokesman says the PM has confidence in the whole of the civil service. Q: Does he think MI5 have been withholding information from Patel? No, says the spokesman. Q: Does the PM want to move Rutnam? The spokesman says the PM has confidence in the whole of the civil service. He says permanent secretary appointments are for the cabinet secretary. Q: Is there an inquiry going on into the leak of information critical of Patel? No, says the spokesman. And he says no inquiry was requested. The PM\u2019s spokesman is here. He starts by announcing what is happening today. He says the PM is working from Downing Street. Later he is meeting the Croatian PM. James Brokenshire, the Home Office minister, has announced plans for a \u201cprotect duty\u201d on people who own open spaces. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the DWP secretary, is publishing a report on auto-enrolment in pensions schemes. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is attending a climate change conference. Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, is doing a visit in Northern Ireland. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is announcing the final local government settlement. MPs will vote on it later today. The spokesman is now taking questions. Q: Does the PM intend to make a statement on plans for new Trident warheads? The spokesman says he does not have anything to announce on this. Q: Was the PM annoyed that this news came out in the US? The spokesman does not have anything to add. Q: Was the PM on holiday last week? The spokesman says the PM was working last week. He had calls with the Chinese and US presidents. He was kept updated on the flooding. And he was working on his domestic agenda and on the budget. Q: Why did the PM not visit any of the flooded areas? The spokesman says the government is very grateful to all the emergency services who were called out. He says the environment secretary has been in the lead on this. It is important not to distract from the relief effort. Q: He was happy to do that last year, when there was an election on. The spokesman repeats the point about being grateful to the emergency services. No 10 defends PM\u2019s decision to stay away from flooded areas, saying such visits would be a distraction. I\u2019m at 9 Downing Street for the morning lobby briefing. It will be the first we\u2019ve had for a week (No 10 don\u2019t hold daily briefings during recess) and so there is quite a lot to cover. The embargo arrangements for these briefings are a bit hit and miss, but I\u2019m expecting the embargo to be lifted, and so I should be able to cover the proceedings live. We\u2019re waiting for the prime minister\u2019s spokesman to arrive. This is from Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, the French Europe minister. She is saying that France will not sign up to a bad trade deal with the UK just to meet Boris Johnson\u2019s December 2020 deadline. (Johnson has set this deadline by ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition.) And here is a translation from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. Jennifer says EU diplomats are meeting again this afternoon to have another go at finalising the EU\u2019s mandate for the trade negotiation with the UK. On the subject of who might get appointed to Keir Starmer\u2019s shadow cabinet, if he wins the Labour leadership, the Economist\u2019s Duncan Weldon has a Twitter thread on who might be appointed shadow chancellor. It starts here. And here is his conclusion. He thinks Jonathan Reynolds or Anneliese Dodds, both shadow Treasury ministers, could get the job. Sir Keir Starmer was interviewed this morning by Kay Burley on Sky News, by Mishal Husain on Today and by Nick Ferrari on LBC. Here are the main points from all three interviews. Starmer refused to commit to offering Jeremy Corbyn a post in the shadow cabinet if he won. (See 9.21am.) He insisted that he had not had any discussions about possible shadow cabinet appointments, and he refused to comment on claims that there might be jobs for people like Ed Miliband or Yvette Cooper. He said he was opposed to the government\u2019s plan to use salary thresholds to determine if migrants should be allowed to come to the UK to work. Asked about the Home Office proposals announced last week, he said: The position the government has just taken is completely wrong - where they are equating the worth of an individual coming to this country by how much money they earn. I think that\u2019s profoundly the wrong approach ... I think the idea that if you don\u2019t earn a certain salary you\u2019re not bringing anything of any worth to this country is offensive. When asked if that meant he would do away with salary thresholds, he replied: I would - I do not think they are the right measure for the worth of an individual coming to this country. He did not rule out campaigning for the UK to move towards a Norway-style relationship with the EU at the next general election. He said he expected the next election to be in 2024. Asked if at that point he might be advocating a closer relationship with the EU, akin to Norway\u2019s, he said: \u201cWe will have to see what the situation is in 2024.\u201d But he also said that it was in the UK\u2019s interests to be economically close to the EU. He said he disagreed with what Tony Blair said last week about how Labour should not let its support for trans rights lead to it getting involved in a culture war with conservatives. Blair said: You\u2019ve got to distinguish between the advocacy of certain things that are right, whether it\u2019s about gay rights, transgender rights, whatever it is - you\u2019ve got to distinguish between that and launching yourself politically into a kind of culture war with the right. If you go: \u2018Transgender rights is our big thing\u2019, and the right goes: \u2018Immigration control is our big thing\u2019, you\u2019re going to lose that war. Asked about this, Starmer said: I actually think that the way that a potential leader of the Labour party deals with the LGBT community matters hugely, and it is about the values we bring to this. So I disagree with Tony Blair about that. But Starmer also praised the record of the last Labour government, saying \u201ca lot of good stuff\u201d happened when it was in power. He said that it was wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of previous Labour governments, but that it was also wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of what had done in opposition over the last five years. He praised Jeremy Corbyn for turning the party into an anti-austerity party. Starmer claimed that \u201coutriders\u201d from other campaigns were floating allegations that his campaign was funded by wealthy donors. He said that he had received contributions from trade unions, from crowdfunding and from individuals, as other candidates had, and he said that donations would all be declared. He implied the accusations were unfair. I think this is one of those things that is swirling around. So far the candidates themselves have avoided taking lumps out of each other. I think some of the outriders are trying to stir things up a bit now. He said that it had been a mistake for him to abstain on the second reading of the welfare reform bill in 2015. He said that he was a new MP at the time and he was abstaining in line with the party whip. He struggled to refute a suggestion that he was boring. On LBC Ferrari said a Financial Times profile of him today is headlined: \u2018Boring\u2019 Starmer seeks to heal wounded party.\u2019 Asked to name the most exciting thing he had done, to prove he was not boring, Starmer replied: I\u2019ve done lots of exciting things. You know, well, with playing football, going to football with my kids. He eventually came up with a story about how, when he got stranded in Newcastle one day during the campaign, on Valentine\u2019s night, he checked into a hotel and went to his room to find someone sleeping in the bed. Asked if it was a man or a woman, Starmer said he did not stay long enough to find out. Starmer rejected claims that he tried to bring down Corbyn in 2016. Asked about a Twitter video released by the leftwing Fire Brigades Union, and whether he had tried to bring down Corbyn at the time, Starmer denied this. But he confirmed that he did resign from the shadow cabinet. Starmer said that, when Corbyn won the subsequent leadership election, he agreed to serve again in shadow cabinet. He said that he viewed Corbyn as a friend and that, when he disagreed with him, he kept that private. One of Priti Patel\u2019s Home Office ministerial colleagues has dismissed claims that she is bullying officials, as the home secretary pushed for an inquiry into a series of damaging leaks about her approach in the department, my colleague Peter Walker reports. After the Home Office released a statement denying a rift between Patel and her most senior civil servant, and MI5 rejected reports it is witholding intelligence from her, James Brokenshire called the reports \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. Today ballot papers start going out in the Labour leadership contest (or, in most cases, emails - people are generally expected to vote electronically) and this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and the clear favourite in the contest, has doing a round of interviews. On the Today programme he was asked if there would be space for Jeremy Corbyn in his shadow cabinet if he won and, although he dodged the question, listeners might have concluded that the answer was no. When Mishal Husain asked Starmer if he would give Corbyn a job, Starmer replied: Look, there\u2019s been so much speculation. I have not discussed that team with anybody. I\u2019m totally focused ... Husain then pressed him again, saying he must have a view on this. But Starmer stuck to the same line. If you can believe it, given that we have been at this for weeks, the ballot is only dropping today, no votes have been cast yet, I\u2019m focused on winning this race and getting as many votes as I possibly can through my argument about unity, effective opposition and focusing on winning the next general election. I have not discussed the shadow cabinet with anybody. And therefore whatever is swirling around, because there are names everywhere, it is all rumour, I can tell you. Although Starmer may not have discussed specific shadow cabinet jobs with anybody, at a Labour hustings yesterday he did say that there would be top jobs for both Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy if he won. Previously he had declined to make that commitment. In truth, most Labour members would probably expect Corbyn to leave the frontbench whoever wins \u2013 not least because that is normally what outgoing leaders do (although some do later return to cabinet or shadow cabinet roles, like William Hague). Long-Bailey herself said less than two weeks ago that Corbyn had done his bit and that it was time for a new generation. But she has also said separately that she would offer Corbyn a job because she likes him so much, and the leftwing deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has said the \u201cideal\u201d outcome would be for Corbyn to stay on as shadow foreign secretary. Last week Corbyn did not rule out taking a shadow cabinet post if offered one. I will post more from the Starmer interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Prof Sir Michael Marmot publishes a report on health inequalities across England. 9.30am: David Gauke, the former Tory cabinet minister, speaks at the launch of a Resolution Foundation report on the outlook for next month\u2019s budget. As Richard Partington reports, it says the government is set to increase borrowing to spend more than \u00a31tn a year, increasing the size of the British state to make it bigger than at any point under the 10-year premiership of Labour\u2019s Tony Blair. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: The Commons starts sitting again after the half-term recess. After housing questions, there are likely to be urgent questions or government statements. After 3pm: Peers start debating the emergency terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill. It is due to clear all its Lords stages by the end of the day. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Schools and universities have been closed across the regions and people have been advised to work from home.

We are not there yet, said Tedros. \u201cWhat we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways.\u201d The word pandemic is used to describe a serious disease that is spreading in an uncontrolled way around the world. China, he pointed out, appeared to have contained it. The international team sent in by the WHO, which is about to report its findings, has said the virus probably peaked between 23 January and 2 February. Tedros added, however, that \u201cthe sudden increase in new cases is certainly very concerning\u201d.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s number two diplomat in Australia, Wang Xining, has defended shocking footage showing people suspected of having coronavirus being forcibly pushed into vans as justified, and described the detention camps used to hold an estimated one million people, mostly Uighurs, as \u201ctraining centres\u201d whose residents are \u201cmostly\u201d there voluntarily. In a rare public appearance on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A on Monday night, Wang grimly held to party lines even as he was laughed at by audience members for his defence of the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of Uighurs and challenged by other panellists over the country\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The deputy ambassador also walked back his previous criticism of the Australian government\u2019s decision to impose travel bans on people coming from China as \u201cpanic and overreaction\u201d, saying he commended the response of Australian medical authorities to the coronavirus outbreak. Wang\u2019s appearance on the revamped Q&amp;A program was a coup for the ABC, but the diplomat did not get an easy run. He was repeatedly challenged by panellist Stan Grant, host Hamish MacDonald and another panellist, the journalist Vicky Xu, on his attempts to label China a democracy and on his defence of the country\u2019s response to the outbreak of the coronavirus. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a cover-up,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt is a very sophisticated issue. It involved a lot of agencies and expertise. It takes time to make precise judgment on how to deal with.\u201d Xu challenged Wang\u2019s denials the country had attempted to cover up the outbreak of the coronavirus by pointing to the treatment of doctor Li Wenliang, who was punished for trying to raise the alarm about the spread of the virus before his death earlier this month. Wang called Li \u201cvery respectable\u201d, saying \u201cpeople will remember him for what he [has] done\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s one of thousands of doctors and nurses who dedicated their life sometimes for the sake of this epidemic,\u201d he said. Wang also defended footage shown on the program of people believed to have the virus being manhandled on the street by authorities, saying it was justified if they were confirmed cases. \u201cIf they\u2019re confirmed, they are the host,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of their neighbours. And think of now millions of people are staying home. \u201cIf we let these people out \u2013 and there are several cases recently of not communal outbreak, but people-to-people transmission \u2013 those people who were infected, what do you say to that?\u201d China\u2019s response to the outbreak of the virus in the city of Wuhan early this year was also defended by global biosecurity expert Raina MacIntyre, who said the lockdown of the city was an \u201caccepted public health measure\u201d which had \u201cprevented cases from occurring in other countries and the rest of China\u201d. MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales, also pointed out Australia had laws allowing for the forcible isolation of people seen to be at risk of spreading an infectious disease. \u201cIt has been used very infrequently but it has been used in Australia to essentially isolate people who are infectious with diseases such as TB or other [diseases],\u201d she said. Wang also sought to stick to the Chinese government\u2019s line over its treatment of the ethnic minority Muslim Uighur population, but was laughed at by audience members when he sought to correct MacDonald\u2019s description of the detention camps used to imprison the population by calling them \u201ctraining centres\u201d. Wang also claimed, incorrectly, that \u201cmany\u201d people are held in the camps voluntarily, and said Australian defence minister Marise Payne had been \u201cmisinformed\u201d when she described China\u2019s treatment of the Uighur as being \u201cdisturbing\u201d. \u201cMadam Payne was misinformed,\u201d he said. \u201cHer views are sometimes [based] on the western media\u2019s portrayal about the issue.

      "bodyText": "Emergency planners would consider temporarily shutting schools in affected areas if there was a sudden surge in coronavirus cases in any part of the UK, as part of contingency plans being drawn up by the government. Department of Health sources pointed to official advisory documents, which suggest that school closures could not only potentially protect children from infection but reduce the overall transmission of the virus across the population. The government\u2019s Influenza Pandemic Strategy says \u201cusing a precautionary approach\u201d, directors of public health \u201cmay advise localised closures\u201d of schools \u201cto reduce the initial spread of infection locally\u201d. However, more dramatic measures such as cutting off local populations \u2013 as the Italian government has done in northern Lombardy and Veneto \u2013 or closing down travel routes will only be considered as an unlikely last resort, sources added. Questions about the British government\u2019s readiness were given extra urgency after events in Italy in recent days. The country reported an unexpected upsurge in cases. It has, at 219, the most in recorded in Europe. The Italian authorities have decided to introduce stringent restrictions, including a curfew in 11 affected towns in the north of the country, as well as wider travel restrictions. Schools, museums and cinemas have been closed. No 10 said at lunchtime it was planning for \u201call eventualities\u201d if the number of coronavirus cases were to lift off similarly in the UK \u2013 although the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the risk to the British public remained low at present. \u201cWe are well prepared for UK cases. We are using tried and tested procedures to prevent further spread and the NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections,\u201d the spokesman said. The Department of Health believes it will be not until about May that it will be clearer what impact the virus is having on the UK, the rough estimated timescale between any initial arrival of the disease and its fullest extent. So far, however, there have been only a handful of British cases. There have been 13 positive tests for coronavirus during the current outbreak in the country so far, while some Britons returning from China were quarantined for a fortnight in a hospital in the Wirral, near Liverpool. Shutting down movement within the UK is seen as counterproductive, according to the official plan being followed by the department. There is \u201ca lack of scientific evidence on the impact of internal travel restrictions on transmission\u201d and it concludes that \u201cfor these reasons, the working presumption will be that government will not impose any such restrictions\u201d on travel in a pandemic situation. Public gatherings are also unlikely to be restricted because there is \u201cvery limited evidence that restrictions on mass gatherings will have any significant effect on influenza virus transmission\u201d. Crowded places \u201care an important indicator of \u2018normality\u2019 and may help maintain public morale during a pandemic\u201d. A pandemic virus could kill about 2.5% of the people it infects, a total of 750,000 people in the UK, according to the Department of Health. But emergency planners around the country are supposed to have drawn up contingency plans for a realistic worst-case scenario, which involves managing an illness that kills between 210,000 and 315,000 Britons. Expert estimates, cited by the World Health Organization on Monday, indicate the death rate in Wuhan, the the Chinese city at the centre of the virus, is between 2% and 4% \u2013 but more widely across China the figure is at 0.7%. Similar responses and planning mechanisms are used to deal with civil unrest, chemical and nuclear incidents, all relying on the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, which staffs the emergency planning Cobra system. If necessary, ministers could deploy emergency martial law style powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, although few think it will come close to being necessary.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 25 February.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>A New York jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty. </strong>The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court found Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The count <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-guilty-trial-charges-verdict\">carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years</a>. The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/weinstein-accusers-what-they-said-accusations\">raping a woman in a New York hotel in 2013</a>. Weinstein was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-charges-what-were-they-criminal-trial\">acquitted of three further charges</a>, including the count of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-rape-trial-brought-down\">guilty verdict</a> could have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted. The New York district attorney\u2019s office took an enormous gamble in how they set up the trial. Prosecutors chose as main accusers two women, both of whom continued to have close \u2013 and at times sexual \u2013 contact with Weinstein after they were attacked. \u2019</p> \n<p><strong>Evangelical churches with strong links to Western Australian Liberals have won almost $40,000 in grants</strong> in the past four months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/wa-churches-with-liberal-links-win-grants-of-almost-40000-in-four-months\">through a federal scheme</a>. The churches won funding through the Stronger Communities program, which allocates grants only to organisations that have been formally invited by the local federal MP. The True North church in Perth\u2019s northern suburbs was awarded $11,000 in November to upgrade its kitchen. The church sits in the federal division of Moore, held for the Liberals by Ian Goodenough. A grant for $5,500 went to the evangelical One church, also in Perth\u2019s outer northern suburbs, for new carpets.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 25 February. Top stories A New York jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty. The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court found Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The count carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years. The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him raping a woman in a New York hotel in 2013. Weinstein was acquitted of three further charges, including the count of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The guilty verdict could have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted. The New York district attorney\u2019s office took an enormous gamble in how they set up the trial. Prosecutors chose as main accusers two women, both of whom continued to have close \u2013 and at times sexual \u2013 contact with Weinstein after they were attacked. \u2019 Evangelical churches with strong links to Western Australian Liberals have won almost $40,000 in grants in the past four months through a federal scheme. The churches won funding through the Stronger Communities program, which allocates grants only to organisations that have been formally invited by the local federal MP. The True North church in Perth\u2019s northern suburbs was awarded $11,000 in November to upgrade its kitchen. The church sits in the federal division of Moore, held for the Liberals by Ian Goodenough. A grant for $5,500 went to the evangelical One church, also in Perth\u2019s outer northern suburbs, for new carpets. One of the church\u2019s founding pastors is Trish Botha, who worked in Goodenough\u2019s office until she left to run as a Senate candidate for the Liberals at last year\u2019s federal election. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of an outbreak of the coronavirus, as Italy reported six deaths and officials across the Middle East and Europe scrambled to limit its spread. On Monday, an Iranian lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 120km south of the capital, Tehran \u2013 accused the health minister of lying about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. The country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report. Australia More than 20% of Australia\u2019s forests burned during the summer\u2019s bushfire catastrophe, a proportion scientists believe is unprecedented globally, according to new research. China\u2019s number two diplomat in Australia made an appearance on last night\u2019s Q&amp;A program on the ABC, where he described China\u2019s Uighur detention camps as \u201ctraining centres\u201d whose residents are \u201cmostly\u201d there voluntarily, and defended footage showing people suspected of having coronavirus being forcibly pushed into vans as justified. A growing majority of Coalition voters support the Morrison government adopting a net zero target for 2050, with support for that proposition climbing 12 points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Being Aboriginal with a disability is a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d, the royal disability commission has heard. One witness said the system should be accountable for institutional prejudice \u201cin which highly qualified healthcare practitioners can just pass people off with need as being drunk or faking it\u201d. Online flight booking company Fly365 has left travellers thousands of dollars out of pocket after it entered voluntary administration just days after customers say they handed over money to the firm. Fly365 has links to collapsed budget airfare company Bestjet. The world Dozens of people have been injured in Germany, some of them children, after a local man appeared to deliberately drive a car into a carnival parade procession in the central German town of Volkmarsen, police have said. The driver was arrested but police could not immediately provide details about the man\u2019s motives. The US Democratic party is grappling with Bernie Sanders being its likely nominee for president. In the aftermath of Sanders\u2019 victory in Nevada, and as the South Carolina primary looms, the party establishment continues to contend with the increasing possibility that the Vermont senator, a self-proclaimed socialist, will win the nomination. Informants named in WikiLeaks files disappeared, the Julian Assange hearing has heard. Secret sources who had supplied information to the US government allegedly \u201cdisappeared\u201d after they were put at risk of death or torture by WikiLeaks\u2019s release of classified documents. Lesotho\u2019s prime minister has requested immunity from the charge of murdering his wife. Thomas Thabane made a surprise appearance in court, where his lawyer argued that his office grant him immunity from prosecution for allegedly murdering his estranged wife shortly before he took power.

      "body": "<p>There goes \u00a31bn from easyJet\u2019s stock market value. At the close of trading last Friday, the airline was valued at roughly \u00a36bn. After Monday\u2019s 16.7% fall amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/24/stock-markets-coronavirus-italy-airlines\">investors\u2019 alarm about coronavirus</a> \u2013 and, in particular, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread\">Italy\u2019s extreme measures</a> to contain the spread \u2013 easyJet is now worth \u00a35bn.</p> <p>EasyJet\u2019s tumble is just an illustration of how, until Monday, investors had been extraordinarily unconcerned about the potential economic impact of coronavirus. At the start of this month, City analysts were proclaiming confidently that, since world stock markets recovered quickly from the Sars crisis of 2002-03, there was little need to adjust portfolios. The disruption, the theory ran, would be temporary and economic activity would merely be deferred.</p> <p>That thesis felt woefully superficial for several reasons. First, stock market pundits tend to have no expertise in epidemiology. Second, unlike in 2003, stock market valuations are already high by traditional yardsticks. Third, China, where the effect on economic activity will clearly be severe in the first quarter of this year, now accounts for almost a fifth of global GDP, versus about 6% at the time of Sars.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s market wobble, then, marks the moment when investors collided with reality and had to start to price specific risks. While it is possible to believe that Apple, for example, will recover from the \u201ciPhone supply shortages\u201d in its Chinese factories that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/17/apple-warns-of-coronavirus-causing-iphone-shortages\">warned about last week</a>, a drop-off in travel within Europe would clearly hurt almost every tourism-related venture. Journeys wouldn\u2019t be deferred; some just wouldn\u2019t happen. And the effect on profits could be exaggerated since ticket prices tend to be set by the level of marginal demand.</p> <p>We have yet to see hard evidence of that impact, but the City is now braced for profit warnings from European travel firms unless the news on containment improves rapidly. The unknowns are piling up; what matters is not simply the rate of infection, it\u2019s also the behaviour of fearful consumers, which is even harder to predict. Stock markets were too complacent.</p> <h2>Countrywide fightback comes a decade too late</h2> <p>Reinvigorating Countrywide, the debt-laden estate agency group that owns Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, would take three years, declared executive chairman Peter Long in 2018. After completing half the allotted span, Long seems to have decided the task is near impossible, at least in standalone form.</p> <p>That\u2019s the message implied by the decision to enter merger talks with LSL Property Services. Countrywide, which in its heyday used to be described as the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent, will be the junior partner if the \u00a3460m-ish tie-up proceeds.</p> <p>The move will feel desperate to those investors who backed a \u00a3140m rescue refinancing in August 2018. They paid the equivalent (after a share consolidation) of 500p a pop, but the share price is still a miserable 340p.</p> <p>Maybe Long can discover some deal-making magic during the talks, but his negotiating hand looks weak. Countrywide was carrying \u00a390m of debt at last count, or more than three times top-line earnings \u2013 too much for an estate agency.</p> <p>One can blame a sluggish property market or the rise of online-only rivals, but the basic problem is simple: there are too many estate agents in the UK and most are obliged to pass vast chunks of their marketing budgets to Rightmove and its imitators.</p> <p>A Countrywide/LSL merger would allow hefty cost-cutting within a combined entity with 14,000 employees and 1,000 branches, but the Rightmove obstacle looks large and immovable. The FTSE 100 website is worth \u00a36bn these days and has transformed the house-hunting game. If Countrywide et al wanted to mount a serious fightback, their best opportunity was a decade ago.</p> <h2>That\u2019s the problem with demergers: once you\u2019ve done one, the activist brigade will want another</h2> <p>Prudential, having spun off UK-based fund manager M&amp;G last year, probably suspected this moment would arrive, and now it has: Third Point, an aggressive US hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, wants a full break-up, meaning a split between the fast-growing PruAsia business and the plodding Jackson National Life operation in the US. Loeb\u2019s crew has bought a 5%, or $2bn stake, to lobby its case.</p> <p>Pru will need to provide a full answer, but one defence of the current set-up is obvious: if nobody wants to buy Jackson for a fat price, which is probably the case, there isn\u2019t much hidden value to be released.</p> <p>Still, it will be fun to hear Pru\u2019s top brass explain why they still deserve to earn their big bucks in pleasant surroundings in London to run operations on two different continents.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There goes \u00a31bn from easyJet\u2019s stock market value. At the close of trading last Friday, the airline was valued at roughly \u00a36bn. After Monday\u2019s 16.7% fall amid investors\u2019 alarm about coronavirus \u2013 and, in particular, Italy\u2019s extreme measures to contain the spread \u2013 easyJet is now worth \u00a35bn. EasyJet\u2019s tumble is just an illustration of how, until Monday, investors had been extraordinarily unconcerned about the potential economic impact of coronavirus. At the start of this month, City analysts were proclaiming confidently that, since world stock markets recovered quickly from the Sars crisis of 2002-03, there was little need to adjust portfolios. The disruption, the theory ran, would be temporary and economic activity would merely be deferred. That thesis felt woefully superficial for several reasons. First, stock market pundits tend to have no expertise in epidemiology. Second, unlike in 2003, stock market valuations are already high by traditional yardsticks. Third, China, where the effect on economic activity will clearly be severe in the first quarter of this year, now accounts for almost a fifth of global GDP, versus about 6% at the time of Sars. Monday\u2019s market wobble, then, marks the moment when investors collided with reality and had to start to price specific risks. While it is possible to believe that Apple, for example, will recover from the \u201ciPhone supply shortages\u201d in its Chinese factories that it warned about last week, a drop-off in travel within Europe would clearly hurt almost every tourism-related venture. Journeys wouldn\u2019t be deferred; some just wouldn\u2019t happen. And the effect on profits could be exaggerated since ticket prices tend to be set by the level of marginal demand. We have yet to see hard evidence of that impact, but the City is now braced for profit warnings from European travel firms unless the news on containment improves rapidly. The unknowns are piling up; what matters is not simply the rate of infection, it\u2019s also the behaviour of fearful consumers, which is even harder to predict. Stock markets were too complacent. Countrywide fightback comes a decade too late Reinvigorating Countrywide, the debt-laden estate agency group that owns Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, would take three years, declared executive chairman Peter Long in 2018. After completing half the allotted span, Long seems to have decided the task is near impossible, at least in standalone form. That\u2019s the message implied by the decision to enter merger talks with LSL Property Services. Countrywide, which in its heyday used to be described as the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent, will be the junior partner if the \u00a3460m-ish tie-up proceeds. The move will feel desperate to those investors who backed a \u00a3140m rescue refinancing in August 2018. They paid the equivalent (after a share consolidation) of 500p a pop, but the share price is still a miserable 340p. Maybe Long can discover some deal-making magic during the talks, but his negotiating hand looks weak. Countrywide was carrying \u00a390m of debt at last count, or more than three times top-line earnings \u2013 too much for an estate agency. One can blame a sluggish property market or the rise of online-only rivals, but the basic problem is simple: there are too many estate agents in the UK and most are obliged to pass vast chunks of their marketing budgets to Rightmove and its imitators. A Countrywide/LSL merger would allow hefty cost-cutting within a combined entity with 14,000 employees and 1,000 branches, but the Rightmove obstacle looks large and immovable. The FTSE 100 website is worth \u00a36bn these days and has transformed the house-hunting game. If Countrywide et al wanted to mount a serious fightback, their best opportunity was a decade ago. That\u2019s the problem with demergers: once you\u2019ve done one, the activist brigade will want another Prudential, having spun off UK-based fund manager M&amp;G last year, probably suspected this moment would arrive, and now it has: Third Point, an aggressive US hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, wants a full break-up, meaning a split between the fast-growing PruAsia business and the plodding Jackson National Life operation in the US. Loeb\u2019s crew has bought a 5%, or $2bn stake, to lobby its case. Pru will need to provide a full answer, but one defence of the current set-up is obvious: if nobody wants to buy Jackson for a fat price, which is probably the case, there isn\u2019t much hidden value to be released. Still, it will be fun to hear Pru\u2019s top brass explain why they still deserve to earn their big bucks in pleasant surroundings in London to run operations on two different continents.",

Francesca, a student at the Brera Academy of Fine Art, in Milan, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cA lot of people in towns that are on lockdown work in Lodi, so everyone here has probably had contact with an infected person.</p> <p>\u201cPanic is spreading everywhere.

Everyone here is constantly looking for updates about the situation and you never know if tomorrow you will be still allowed to go outside your house. </p> <p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m waiting to know if a colleague of my father and brother is positive or not.

Deaths per reported infections were much higher in Iran compared with other countries, and that data reflected concerns that the extent of the virus had been significantly under-reported.

Schools were closed across the country for a second day. While Qom appears to be the focal point of the cluster, there are also fears that nationwide polling for parliamentary elections over the weekend could have been another conduit to spread the virus. WHO said on Monday it had serious concerns about the situation in Iran.</p> <p>One Lebanese pilgrim who tested positive for coronavirus after returning from Iran is in hospital in Beirut. Turkey has closed its borders to Iranian travellers. </p> <p>Overriding these concerns though is the fate of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees in Iraq and Syria, many of whom have already impaired immunities, less access to state healthcare and live in highly concentrated population groups.

The effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the Italian economy could be \u201cvery strong, the country\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte warns. The economic impact could be very strong. At this moment, we can calculate that there will be a negative economic impact, we are not yet in a position to forecast what will happen. Italy is struggling to contain the Europe\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak, whose epicentre is in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartlands of the country. The US department of homeland security\u2019s top official on the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force has sought help on social media accessing a map about the virus. Ken Cuccinelli, the DHS acting deputy secretary, first asked on Twitter if a link to the map stopped working for other people (it worked for the Guardian). In a second post, he said it looked like he couldn\u2019t access it because it was behind a paywall. \u201cSeems like bad timing to stop helping the world with this (previously) useful resource,\u201d tweeted the senior member of the Trump administration. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping it goes back up soon.\u201d The death toll in Europe\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak has risen to seven on Monday and new cases climbed above 220 as Italy shut down much of its wealthy north to curb the disease\u2019s spread. Italian shares tumbled more than 5%, the biggest daily drop in almost four years, on worries the flare-up could cause a recession, while worried residents emptied supermarket shelves to stock up on essentials. Authorities in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartlands of Italy, shut schools, universities, museums and cinemas for at least a week, and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival. In Lombardy, close to Italy\u2019s business capital Milan, nearly 50,000 people have been placed under effective quarantine, as measures were adopted for 10 towns, as well as a further one in neighbouring Veneto. \u201cTo be honest, nobody thought the spread would be so aggressive,\u201d Lombardy regional governor Attilio Fontana told 102.5 RTL radio, predicting, however that the virus would regress in days due to the emergency measures. Local authorities announced four new deaths on Monday \u2013 three men in their 80s and a 62-year-old. Three previous fatalities recorded since Friday were also elderly people. All those who have died had underlying health problems. Lombardy remained the worst hit region with 172 confirmed cases, while neighbouring Veneto had 33 infections, including four in Venice, which had been packed with tourists before its carnival was curtailed two days ahead of schedule. At national level, 27 people were in intensive care, 101 hospitalised and 94 being monitored at home, officials said. Earlier reports from Ansa incorrectly put the death toll at seven and were corrected to six later on Monday. Local authorities have now clarified that the toll has since risen to seven people. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there were 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the country, Reuters reported. These did not include the 39 cases who were among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the city of Wuhan. The agency said the 14 confirmed cases included two new cases reported from Humboldt and Sacramento counties, in California. On Friday, the CDC reported 13 cases among those within the country and 21 cases from among the repatriated Americans and said they were preparing for the possibility of the spread of the virus through US communities that would force the closure of schools and businesses. American public health officials have also warned that cases among the repatriated citizens will likely increase. All nations must work together to fight the spread of the coronavirus and prevent a crisis with \u201cdramatic consequences\u201d for global health and the world economy, the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said. Guterres, speaking to reporters during a visit to the World Health Organisation (WHO) centre for managing emergencies, called for full funding of the body\u2019s appeal for $675m (\u00a3522m) to cover its overall response for three months. Following a briefing with the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and other senior officials, Guterres said: All countries \u2013 and this is now a problem that is affecting many countries in the world \u2013 all countries must do everything to be prepared. The disease it\u2019s still possible to contain but if some fail, if some do not do everything that is needed, this can still become out of control with dramatic consequences in global health and the global economy. He said the decline in new cases of coronavirus in China was a good trend which he hoped could be maintained. The World Health Organization has played down fears of a coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world, despite sudden serious outbreaks in Italy and Iran, but some experts said they believed it was now inevitable. \u201cUsing the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at a briefing. We are not there yet, said Tedros. \u201cWhat we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways.\u201d Other experts said it was hard to believe that COVID-19 would not now spread worldwide. \u201cWe now consider this to be a pandemic in all but name, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the World Health Organization starts to use the term in its communications,\u201d said Dr Bharat Pankhania, from the University of Exeter Medical School. Austria has said it will stop people suspected of carrying the coronavirus from crossing its border, after parts of northern Italy were put into lockdown over the weekend following a surge in cases. The Austrian government released a travel warning for affected areas of Lombardy and Veneto, following a meeting of the government\u2019s coronavirus taskforce that included the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. \u201cAs far as the borders and cross-border traffic are concerned, we will proceed as follows: we will further tighten warning systems with our neighbours, we will immediately order a stop in the event of suspected cases, as happened last night,\u201d Kurz said on Monday. The Trump administration is considering asking Congress for emergency funding to ramp up the US response to coronavirus, Reuters reports. \u201cWe need some funding here to make sure that we ... protect all Americans, that we keep us safe,\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Fox News. Asked how much funding the administration might ask Congress to approve, Gidley later said that there was no announcement yet on the amount. Politico and the Washington Post, citing unnamed individuals familiar with the planning, had reported the administration may request $1bn funding from Congress. An administration official told Reuters the amount was still being finalised, and the request could go to lawmakers this week. There have been 13 cases of people diagnosed with the virus in the US and 21 cases among Americans repatriated on evacuation flights from Wuhan Here\u2019s a summary of Monday\u2019s events: Six people are now confirmed to have died from coronavirus in Italy, which has had the worst outbreak in Europe with 219 confirmed cases. The Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Several European countries including Croatia, Hungary, Ireland and Serbia have advised their citizens against travelling to the affected areas in Italy. Austria is considering reintroducing border controls with Italy. Stock markets in Europe closed the day more than 3.5% down amid virus fears. Iran has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the outbreak after a reformist website reported 50 deaths from the virus. The deputy health minister said 12 people had died from the virus. South Korean cases spiked to over 760, as several countries imposed travel bans, and some airlines cancelled routes to Seoul. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq reported their first cases \u2013 all involving people who had come from Iran. A team from the World Health Organization was due to visit Iran on Tuesday. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. China reported 150 new deaths from the virus, with one outside Hubei province. Infections rose by 409 (398 in Hubei) to 77,150. Four Chinese provinces lowered their alert levels on the virus, including Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi and Guizhou. The WHO said it was encouraged by the decline in new cases in China. The death toll for the coronavirus in Italy stands at six, rather than seven as was initially reported. The Lombardy regional government has denied reports that a person with the coronavirus had died at Brescia\u2019s Civili hospital. Austria is considering reintroducing border controls with Italy, in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has led to a dozen northern Italian towns being put into lockdown. Italian authorities have said they will impose fines on anyone entering or leaving restricted areas. More than 200 people have contracted the virus and six people have died. The European commission announced on Monday that it would send experts to Italy from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, in a joint mission with the World Health Organization. The EU executive also announced a \u20ac232m (\u00a3195m) package to deal with the virus, although some of the funds have yet to be signed off. European markets have closed for trading, with all major indices having lost 3.5% or more amid fears about coronavirus spreading to Europe. Our business blog has more. Officials are now saying there have been six coronavirus deaths in Italy, not seven. We\u2019ll have more details soon. Japanese health officials and experts on a government panel have acknowledged that the quarantine of the virus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess was not perfect, AP reports. The officials said Japanese health authorities faced tough challenges in dealing with a foreign-operated ship that required international negotiations, in the absence of established rules to deal with such a crisis. \u201cThe ship was not designed to be a hospital. The ship was a ship,\u201d said Shigeru Omi, a former regional director for the World Health Organization. He added: \u201cOf course isolation was not ideal as would be expected from a hospital, so in my view although the isolation was somehow effective, to a large extent it was not perfect.\u201d The UK remains \u201cprepared for all eventualities\u201d over coronavirus, Downing Street has said, PA reports. Thirteen people in the UK have so far been diagnosed with Covid-19, including four over the weekend who had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was held in quarantine in Japan. On Monday, Downing Street insisted the UK was \u201cwell-prepared\u201d and said the risk to individuals in the UK remained low. Asked whether the UK could put in place restrictive measures such as those seen in Italy to combat the spread of the disease, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe will be led by the advice from public health and medical experts and will take steps which they feel are required to best protect the British public. \u201cWe are well prepared for UK cases, we are using tried and tested procedures to prevent further spread and the NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections. \u201cWe continue to work closely with the World Health Organization and international partners as the situation develops and we remain prepared for all eventualities.\u201d The Foreign Office has not advised Britons against travel to Italy, but has updated its website with factual information about the situation there. There are no figures as yet as to whether any Britons are stuck in Italy and affected by the lockdown. Four Britons rescued from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship are being treated at specialist centres in the north of England after testing positive for the illness. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital, in Merseyside, on Saturday. Two of the patients are in the Royal Hallamshire hospital, in Sheffield, one is in the Royal Liverpool University hospital and a fourth was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. British couple David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary, are still in a Japanese hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus and pneumonia. China has delayed its annual parliamentary meeting as authorities struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread to more countries and prompted fears of a global pandemic. For the first time in decades, the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), where hundreds of delegates gather in Beijing every March, was postponed on Monday. The standing committee for the NPC said a new date for the meeting would be announced separately, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. People in northern Italy have been in touch with the Guardian to say they have noticed empty shelves in local supermarkets. Francesco Sole, a trade union regional secretary from Milan, said prices for face masks and antibacterial gel had skyrocketed. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a shock for us in northern Italy. My wife and I rushed to do some grocery shopping in fear of being stuck at home. \u201cEmpty shelves for basic products such as flour, oil and bottled water were easily noticeable,\u201d he said. \u201cFinding a mask or antibacterial gel has become as challenging as finding water on the moon. \u201cSome companies have organised their workers to switch to smart working while many others are still seeking to find solutions to manage the situation. People in Milan are trying to figure out what life will be like in the days to come. For a city that is always on the move, this is an eerie pause.\u201d Francesca, 26, from Lodi, said though the city was not under quarantine the rest of the region had closed schools, universities, theatres, and libraries. Francesca, a student at the Brera Academy of Fine Art, in Milan, said: \u201cA lot of people in towns that are on lockdown work in Lodi, so everyone here has probably had contact with an infected person. \u201cPanic is spreading everywhere. Many hospitals\u2019 emergency rooms (where not closed as a precautionary measure) are stormed unnecessarily. It has led people to literally empty supermarkets of long conservation products. Everyone here is constantly looking for updates about the situation and you never know if tomorrow you will be still allowed to go outside your house. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m waiting to know if a colleague of my father and brother is positive or not. He is now hospitalised and is suspected of having it. If so, my family will probably have to be tested too.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of what we know about the coronavirus outbreak so far on Monday: Seven people are now confirmed to have died from coronavirus in Italy which has seen the worst outbreak in Europe with 219 confirmed cases. The Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Iran has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the outbreak after a reformist website reported 50 deaths from the virus. The deputy health minister said 12 people had died from the virus. South Korean cases spiked to over 760, as several countries imposed travel bans, and some airlines cancelled routes to Seoul. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq reported their first cases \u2013 all involving people who had come from Iran. A team from the World Health Organization is due to visit Iran on Tuesday. The WHO director general described the sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. China reported 150 new deaths from the virus, with one outside Hubei province. Infections rose by 409 (398 in Hubei) to 77,150. Four Chinese provinces lowered their alert levels on the virus, including Yunnanm Guangdong, Shznxi and Guizhou. The WHO said it was encouraged by the decline in new cases in China. Serbia\u2019s foreign ministry has advised Serbs against travelling to the parts of Italy hit by the virus. Spain currently has no plans to close its borders in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the country\u2019s health minister has said. Salvador Illa said the authorities were focusing on reinforcing existing precautions throughout the health system and on raising awareness at ports and airports. He said: \u201cFor the moment, experts are advising us not to take other measures that may not be effective - although we\u2019re ready if they need to be taken,\u201d the minister said. \u201cPeople can trust the national health system and its professionals. \u201cThus far, everything has been handled with the utmost competence but people should also be assured that we\u2019re constantly monitoring the situation to adapt measures to the reality of the situation.\u201d Spain currently has two confirmed cases of the coronavirus: one on the Balearic island of Mallorca and another on the remote Canary island of La Gomera. Nine people have tested negative for the virus in recent hours and the authorities are waiting on test results from a further three. Italy\u2019s former far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has attempted to politicise the coronavirus outbreak in the country, attacking the Italian government for not defending the country\u2019s borders. On Sunday, Salvini, who is also the leader of the League party, called on prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to resign \u201cif he isn\u2019t able to defend Italy and Italians.\u201d In particular, Salvini cited the docking, on Sunday, of the NGO Ocean Viking rescue ship with 276 African migrants onboard in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo, to say Italy needs \u201cto make our borders armour-plated.\u201d On the bright side, the WHO team in China has concluded the virus can be contained. It peaked between the end of January and the beginning of February. Dr Ghebreyesus said he was encouraged by the continued decline of new cases in China. Dr Ghebreyesus defended the WHO\u2019s decision not to declare the outbreak a pandemic. \u201cUsing the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,\u201d he said. A team from the World Health Organization is due to arrive in Tehran on Tuesday after the sharp rise in cases in Iran. Speaking at a news conference, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, said the sudden increase in cases Iran, Italy and South Korea was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. A seventh person has died in the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, the Ansa news agency has reported. Ansa said the latest person to die was an 80-year-old man who had been taken to hospital last week in Lodi after having a heart attack, Reuters reports. Doctors believe he caught the virus there from another patient. Italy reported its first death from the coronavirus outbreak on Friday. The UK remains \u201cprepared for all eventualities\u201d and the risk to individuals remains low, Downing Street said on Monday. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: We will be led by the advice from public health and medical experts and will take steps which they feel are required to best protect the British public. We are well prepared for UK cases, we are using tried and tested procedures to prevent further spread and the NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections. We continue to work closely with the World Health Organization and international partners as the situation develops and we remain prepared for all eventualities.\u201d A sixth person has died in the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, the state broadcaster RAI reported on Monday. The person was a cancer patient in the northern town of Brescia. The World Health Organization confirmed \u201csteep declines\u201d in coronavirus cases in China even after taking into account statistical issues. China caused confusion last week about the figures after twice changing how it counted confirmed cases. At a joint briefing in Beijing between the WHO and China\u2019s national health commission, Bruce Aylward, the head of a team of WHO experts visiting China, acknowledged the confusion. He said: \u201cI know people look at the numbers and say what\u2019s really happening.\u201d But he added that \u201cmultiple sources of data\u201d pointed to declines. \u201cThis is falling and it is falling because of the actions that are being taken,\u201d Aylward said. While he applauded the dramatic measures taken by Beijing to quarantine entire cities, he said anything that went beyond WHO recommendations in terms of travel and trade restrictions should be reassessed. Liang Wannian, of the health commission, also said at the briefing that more than 3,000 medical staff in China had been infected by the coronavirus, mostly because of lack of protective gear and fatigue. Ireland has said its citizens should not travel to parts of Italy affected by an outbreak of coronavirus. Italy\u2019s government has moved to close off the worst-hit areas, in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, as the death toll in the country from the disease rose to five on Monday. \u201cThere has been an increase in the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy ... Citizens are advised not to travel to affected areas,\u201d the foreign ministry said in updated travel advice. Coronavirus deaths in Italy have risen to five people, with 209 confirmed cases. An 84-year-old woman died overnight in Bergamo, in the Lombardy region, and an 88-year-old from Caselle Landi, also in Lombardy, died on Monday. Hong Kong, home to at least 79 confirmed coronavirus cases, has issued a travel alert for South Korea, advising resident to avoid non-essential travel to the country and cautioning those already there to avoid crowded places and healthcare facilities. Secretary for security John Lee said that starting from 6am on Tuesday, the city will bar all non-Hong Kong residents coming from South Korea. Hong Kong citizens returning from South Korea will have to be in quarantine for 14 days. A government spokesman said: \u201cIn view of the persistent and rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Korea and the close contacts between Hong Kong and Korea, the government has decided to issue the Red Outbound Travel Alert (OTA) on Korea based on public health considerations. Red OTA urges the public planning to travel to Korea to adjust travel plans and avoid non-essential travel.\u201d The catering staff onboard the previously quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have recorded a dance video to celebrate them being allowed home to the Philippines. A translator from northern Italy has told the Guardian that the closure of schools and universities has left an eerie silence. \u201cIt\u2019s nice not having to deal with the morning traffic when I walk my dogs but the silence from the local primary school is eerie,\u201d said Susanna, from Treviso. \u201cI did a spot of shopping for my elderly mum last night and the supermarket was busy, but the shelves were not as empty as others in the region.\u201d She is studying to become a nature guide but her classes have been cancelled until at least 1 March. \u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t seem to pose more of a threat than seasonal flu, but it is forbidden to attend meetings and sports or cultural events. Defying the government\u2019s lockdown measures might mean facing arrest or a hefty fine. \u201cI\u2019m a member of the local cycling association and we were supposed to hold our monthly critical mass [when cyclists meet to ride through their local area] but this has been cancelled. This is especially upsetting as Treviso has a serious problem with air pollution and we had managed to involve school principals in our ride through town.\u201d In France, the government urged anyone who has visited Lombardy or Veneto \u2013 the two most affected regions in Italy \u2013 to wear face masks if they go outside, limit non-essential activities and take their temperatures twice a day. The French health ministry issued the same advice for anyone who had traveled to China, South Korea, Singapore or Macao. France has had 12 cases of the virus overall, and one death. The national health agency said officials were \u201cevaluating the situation\u201d of a bus of Italians, blocked in Lyon, which originated in Milan and stopped in Turin, but wouldn\u2019t give details, or say whether anyone on the bus was suspected of having the virus. Slovenia and Croatia, on the Italian border, which are popular destinations for Italian tourists and whose own citizens often travel to Italy, were holding crisis meetings Monday. Croatia announced it would monitor any travellers coming from Italy, including Croatian children returning from school trips. The Romanian prime minister, Ludovic Orban, said anyone entering Romania from any region where the virus had been reported would be quarantined for 14 days, but local media reported that arriving passengers were only being asked to fill out a form. In Albania, about 5,000 passengers arriving by plane, ferry and land were being monitored, with border crossing points targeting travellers from Italy in particular. Fears spread to as far away as Mauritius, which blocked an Alitalia airplane that had landed. The Italian foreign ministry said it was working to provide maximum assistance to Italians on board. Many Italians are travelling this week for the mid-winter school holiday, and Mauritius is a popular destination. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the coronavirus outbreak after reports suggested the death toll from the disease was more than four times higher than official figures claim. Sam Jones has more: On Monday, a lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 75 miles (120 km) south of the capital, Tehran, accused Iran\u2019s health minister of lying about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. \u201cThe rest of the media have not published this figure, but we prefer not to censor what concerns the coronavirus because people\u2019s lives are in danger,\u201d the Ilna editor Fatemeh Madiani told Agence France-Presse. But the country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report. In a news conference broadcast live on state television, Iraj Harirchi said 12 people had died from the coronavirus and 66 had been infected. \u201cI categorically deny this information,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis is not the time for political confrontations. The coronavirus is a national problem.\u201d A fifth person infected with the coronavirus has died in Italy, the chief of the civil protection agency has announced, according to Reuters. Italian media reported that the dead patient was 88 and came from the region of Lombardy. The four other people who have died of the illness were also elderly and at least three of them had been suffering serious underlying health problems Germany will not be closing the country\u2019s borders due to the coronavirus outbreak, a spokesman for the interior ministry said on Monday. A spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said Germany was not issuing a travel warning for Italy but said it had updated its advice on travelling there, Reuters reports. A health ministry spokesman said the danger to the German population from coronavirus remained low but warned the assessment could change at short notice. Austria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, Italy, to Munich in Germany was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said. Iraq has detected its first case of coronavirus, the health ministry said on Monday. Local health officials in the Iraqi Shia city of Najaf said an Iranian theology student was the first positive case of the virus, Reuters reports. The patient had entered Iraq before the government shut border crossings and banned the entry of any non-Iraqis coming from Iran, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cIt has become clear to the ministry that the results of lab tests conducted on a theology student, an Iranian citizen, who had entered the country before \u2026 the decision to stop travel have revealed he is ill with the coronavirus,\u201d it said. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the coronavirus outbreak after reports suggested the death toll from the disease was more than four times higher than official figures claim. On Monday, a lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 75 miles (120km) south of the capital, Tehran, which has had a cluster of cases \u2013 accused Iran\u2019s health minister of \u201clying\u201d about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official ILNA news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. \u201cThe rest of the media have not published this figure, but we prefer not to censor what concerns the coronavirus because people\u2019s lives are in danger,\u201d Fatemeh Madiani, the ILNA editor, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). But the country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report. In a news conference broadcast live on state television, Iraj Harirchi said that 12 people had died from the coronavirus and 66 had been infected. \u201cI categorically deny this information,\u201d said Iraj Harirchi. \u201cThis is not the time for political confrontations. The coronavirus is a national problem.\u201d Iran\u2019s government pledged to be transparent about the outbreak. In the Middle East, concerns are mounting that Iran is now a major hub of the coronavirus, and that the virus may have taken hold on pilgrimage routes before its existence was known. Authorities said 50 people have died in the Shia shrine city of Qom this month alone, up sharply from the 12 deaths reported among 47 cases nationwide. Deaths per reported infections were much higher in Iran compared with other countries, and that data reflected concerns that the extent of the virus had been significantly under-reported. Those fears appear to have been realised, and officials are rushing to contain a cluster \u2013 the spread of which would have serious implications for regional health. A Shia seminary in Qom containing 250 people was quarantined on Monday, and the director of one of the city\u2019s main hospitals was reported to have contracted the virus. Schools were closed across the country for a second day. While Qom appears to be the focal point of the cluster, there are also fears that nationwide polling for parliamentary elections over the weekend could have been another conduit to spread the virus. WHO said on Monday it had serious concerns about the situation in Iran. One Lebanese pilgrim who tested positive for coronavirus after returning from Iran is in hospital in Beirut. Turkey has closed its borders to Iranian travellers. Overriding these concerns though is the fate of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees in Iraq and Syria, many of whom have already impaired immunities, less access to state healthcare and live in highly concentrated population groups. Small rooms containing infected people are thought to sharply increase mortality. Tents would likely have the same effect Mongolia has halted all flights from South Korea and will block entry through its borders until 2 March as it steps up its efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s national emergency commission announced the efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on Monday. It has also already closed its schools until the end of March. Mongolia had previously suspended all entries through its borders from China. A suspension of coal deliveries into China is scheduled to come to an end on 2 March. Mongolia has not yet reported any confirmed cases of infection. In aan attempt to slow the worst flare-up of the disease outside of Asia, Italian authorities across the north have shut schools, universities, museums and cinemas for at least a week, and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival, Reuters reports. \u201cTo be honest, nobody thought the spread (of coronavirus) would be so aggressive. The illness is not serious, but it must not be underestimated,\u201d Attilio Fontana, the regional governor of Lombardy, told 102.5 RTL radio. Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy, with a combined population of nearly 50,000, have been placed under effective quarantine, with similar measures in place for a small town in neighbouring Veneto. Fontana added that emergency measures imposed at the weekend would be effective and that \u201cin a matter of days, the spread of the virus will regress\u201d. We\u2019d like to hear from people in northern Italy who are affected by the quarantine restrictions in the area. What has your experience been like and how concerned are you about the outbreak?

At least 50 people have died in the Iranian city of Qom from the new coronavirus this month, Iran\u2019s semiofficial ILNA news agency reported on Monday. The Associated Press reported that the new death toll was significantly higher than the latest number of confirmed cases of infections that Iranian officials had reported just a few hours earlier and which stood at just 12 deaths out of 47 cases, according to state TV. An official from Qom, Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani, was quoted in ILNA saying more than 250 people are quarantined in the city. He said the 50 deaths date as far back as 13 February. Iran, however, first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on 19 February. Renewed fears over the coronavirus outbreak have prompted steep falls on European stock markets \u2013 most notably in Italy, which has suffered the most serious outbreak outside Asia. The FTSE MIB stock market index in Italy has dropped by 4%. Shares on London\u2019s FTSE 100 have fallen by 2.8%, more than 200 points. In Germany, the Dax index is down by 3.4%. France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 3.5%. Budget airline easyJet and holiday provider Tui are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, both down by 9%, and British Airways owner IAG has lost 7%. Carnival, the cruise ship operator, has lost another 5%. The company has fallen steeply during 2020 after an outbreak of the virus on its Diamond Princess cruise ship. The flight to safety for investors fearful of the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak has pushed gold prices to their highest since February 2013. Spot gold prices rose by 2.1% on Monday to hit highs above $1,679 per troy ounce. Investors traditionally buy gold as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. Chinese political leaders including President Xi Jinping are normally expected to attend the annual parliament session in March, but it has been postponed as a result of the virus outbreak. It is the first time the meeting has been postponed since the Cultural Revolution. Kuwait, Bahrain, and Afghanistan recorded their first new coronavirus cases on Monday. The cases in Kuwait and Bahrain involve people who had visited Iran, which has reported 43 cases of the disease, Reuters reports. Kuwait detected the virus in three people among 700 who had been evacuated on Saturday from the north-eastern Iranian city of Mashhad, the state news agency KUNA said. The health ministry identified them as a 53-year-old Kuwaiti man, a 61-year-old Saudi man and a 21-year-old whose nationality was unclear. It said the Kuwaiti and Saudi had been asymptomatic while the third person showed initial symptoms. In Bahrain, the health ministry said a Bahraini national who arrived from Iran had been diagnosed with the disease and that \u201call necessary measures have been taken with individuals in contact with the patient\u201d. Afghanistan\u2019s minister of public health said on Monday the country had identified its first case of coronavirus, following dozens of cases of the disease and eight deaths in neighbouring Iran. Reuters reports that Ferozuddin Feroz, the minister of public health, told a press conference in Kabul one of three suspected cases had been confirmed in the western province of Herat. He announced a state of emergency in the province, which borders Iran, where dozens of cases of the disease have been confirmed and eight people have died. Qatar Airways announced it will quarantine passengers arriving from Iran and South Korea who show symptoms for the virus. Passengers who show symptoms will be transferred to the communicable disease centre at the Hamad Medical Corporation. All incoming passengers from Iran and South Korea whose final destination is Doha and are showing no symptoms will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing was not considering issuing travel advisories for countries such as South Korea and Japan that are reporting an increase in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. But the Vietnamese carrier Bamboo Airways announced it would be suspending all flights to and from South Korea over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Authorities have so far confirmed 763 cases of novel coronavirus in South Korea. South Korea\u2019s K-league on Monday postponed the start of the new football season, which had been due to kick off this weekend. \u201cThe K-league has decided to temporarily postpone the start of the 2020 K-league season until the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak eases,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis is a measure to protect the health and safety of the citizens and our players with the highest priority against the outbreak of the Covid-19 which has entered a serious phase.\u201d Matches featuring Daegu FC, based in the city that is the epicentre of the South Korean outbreak, and nearby Pohang Steelers, had already been delayed. Italy is rushing to contain Europe\u2019s first major coronavirus outbreak after a fourth person in the country died, Reuters reports. The Italian government introduced draconian measures such as imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas as the number of cases and deaths spiked over the weekend. The number of cases of the virus in the country rose to 152 on Saturday, prompting the government to close off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Police are patrolling 11 towns that have been in lockdown since Friday night. The latest victim died in the Lombardy city of Cremona. French junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said on Monday morning that there was no need to close down transport borders between France and Italy, despite the spread of coronavirus. \u201cClosing down the borders would make no sense, as the circulation of the virus is not just limited to administrative borders,\u201d Djebbari told BFM Business. Austria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, Italy, to Munich in Germany was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said. An announcement that the Chinese city of Wuhan would relax some of its travel restrictions and allow some people to leave was made without authorisation and has been revoked, the local government said on Monday, according to a report by Reuters. The city at the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak that has already killed more than 2,500 people said it would continue to impose strict controls over its borders in order to prevent the virus from spreading further. The people responsible for the earlier announcement, which stated healthy people would be allowed to leave if they had vital business, have been reprimanded. Here\u2019s the latest round up of the number of cases the coronavirus and deaths from AP. Mainland China: 2,592 deaths among 77,150 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. Hong Kong: 74 cases, two deaths. Macao: 10 cases. Japan: 838 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, four deaths. South Korea: 763 cases, seven deaths. Italy: 152 cases, three deaths. Singapore: 89 cases. Iran: 43 cases, eight deaths. US: 35 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China. Thailand: 35 cases. Taiwan: 28 cases, one death. Australia: 23 cases. Malaysia: 22 cases. Vietnam: 16 cases. Germany: 16 cases. France: 12 cases, one death. United Arab Emirates: 13 cases. United Kingdom: 13 cases. Canada: 10 cases. Philippines: three cases, one death. Kuwait: three cases. India: three cases. Russia: two cases. Spain: two cases. Lebanon: one case. Israel: one case. Belgium: one case. Nepal: one case. Sri Lanka: one case. Sweden: one case. Cambodia: one case. Finland: one case. Egypt: one case. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Alison Rourke. Four British nationals rescued from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship are being treated at specialist centres in the north of England after testing positive for the illness, PA Media reports. The four had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had been moored off the coast of Japan for more than two weeks amid the outbreak. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside on Saturday, but on Sunday NHS England confirmed the positive diagnoses. Two of the patients are in the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield, one is in the Royal Liverpool University hospital and a fourth was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The new confirmed cases brings the total number of people to be diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain in the UK to 13. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know about the coronavirus outbreak so far on Monday: Wuhan \u2013 the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 has eased some lockdown restrictions, including allowing uninfected residents to leave the city for \u201curgent medical operations\u201d. China reported 150 new deaths from the virus, with one outside Hubei province. Infections rose by 409 (398 in Hubei) to 77,150. The Chinese health commission said 24 out of China\u2019s 31 provinces had reported no new cases of the virus. Four Chinese provinces lowered their alert levels on the virus, including Yunnanm Guangdong, Shznxi and Guizhou. South Korean cases spiked to over 760, as several countries imposed travel bans, and some airlines cancelled routes to Seoul. Australia raised its travel advice to South Korea and Japan to \u201creconsider your need to travel\u201d. North Korea is reported to have quarantined 380 foreigners over virus fears. Asian financial markets have fallen amid fears about the global economy. More information is being reported out about Wuhan\u2019s easing of lockdown conditions. Earlier Chinese state media said the changes would allow \u201cstranded personnel\u201d to leave the city if they are not under quarantine or medical observation. The Global Times has just tweeted that the decision would allow residents not infected with Covid-19 to leave for \u201curgent medical operations in other cities\u201d. I\u2019m not clear if that\u2019s in addition to Earlier we reported that 24 out of 31 provincial-level regions across China had no new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. This includes Beijing and Shanghai. We\u2019re getting some more details on the changed conditions in Wuhan \u2013 here\u2019s a report from China Global Television Network: China\u2019s Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), will allow non-residents of the city to leave if they show no symptoms and have never had contact with patients, local authorities said in a statement on Monday. Meanwhile, people who are not quarantined and seeking treatment for special diseases can also leave in batches. Wuhan, home to over 11 million people and capital city of central China\u2019s Hubei Province, suspended buses, subways, ferries, flights and trains for outbound passengers on January 23 to halt the coronavirus spread, which so far has sickened over 77,000 people and killed at least 2,595. We have reported a lot today on the virus crisis facing South Korea, but in North Korea state media says Pyongyang has quarantined about 380 foreigners as part of efforts to prevent the new coronavirus from breaking out in the country. The Korean Central Broadcasting Station said: \u201c(We) have quarantined some 380 foreigners so far across the country, while intensifying isolation, medical monitoring and testing measures on those who have returned from overseas travel, those who have contacted them and those showing abnormal symptoms.\u201d The identity of those quarantined was not clear but South Korean media reports say they appear to be diplomats stationed in Pyongyang and people involved in overseas trading. North Korea has not reported any cases of Covid-19 infection, but has doubling the quarantine period to 30 days against those coming from foreign countries. The vice governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, has said the virus\u2019s impact on the economy \u201cwill be short-lived and will not change the country\u2019s sound economic fundamentals\u201d. Here\u2019s an excerpt of CGTN\u2019s take on it: Liu said in the short term, the novel coronavirus outbreak will rattle certain aspects of the economy such as loan growth, consumer prices and debt ratio. For instance, fewer outdoor activities and work resumption delay would discourage the borrowing demand of consumers and certain industries. But the impact is temporary and will fade with progress being made in epidemic control and factories gradually returning to work, he said. Liu said the central bank would continue to keep liquidity at a reasonable and ample level, push for reform of loan prime rate (LPR), China\u2019s new market-oriented benchmark lending rate, and lower borrowing costs to ease the financing strain for smaller companies. South Korean airlines have suspended or plan to halt flights to South Korea\u2019s southeastern city of Daegu, where hundreds of new coronavirus infections were reported over the weekend. Yonhap news agency says Korean Air Lines Co, the country\u2019s biggest airline, canceled its flights to Daegu from the southern resort island of Jeju and Incheon on Sunday. Meanwhile, 30 South Koreans who recently visited Israel have tested positive for Covid-19, according to Yonhap: Of 39 Catholic pilgrims from North Gyeongsang Province who visited Israel between February 8 and 16, 12 were diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, while the other 18 were confirmed positive and quarantined last week, according to municipal health authorities. One Beijing resident has tweeted that things are still quiet in the Chinese capital today, with regards to people going back to work. The scale of the crisis in Wuhan is plain to see with the mass effort in the city to provide hospital beds, as pointed out in the tweet below by CGTN. Chinese state media is reporting that the lockdown in Wuhan is being eased to allow \u201cstranded personnel\u201d to leave the city if they are not under quarantine or medical observation. The Global Times has also reported that six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday. Huanggang has had 2,904 confirmed cases and 103 deaths (the third highest number of deaths in China). Jingzhou has had 1,574 and 42 deaths (fourth highest number of deaths in China). By comparison, Wuhan has had 46,607 cases and 1,987 deaths. The Global Times also says 24 out of 31 provincial-level regions across China report zero new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. Of all the new cases announced today, only 11 were outside Hubei province. South Korea\u2019s National Assembly has cancelled its plenary session scheduled for Monday afternoon after it emerged a coronavirus patient attended a parliamentary forum last week. Australia is sending a flight to Wuhan with donated goods, the first since the travel ban from China was imposed. Let\u2019s put those Chinese figures into context. The figure of 150 deaths is the highest recorded number of deaths in China in 11 days. Monday 24 February: 150 deaths, 409 new cases Sunday 23 February: 97 deaths, 648 new cases Saturday 22 February: 109 deaths, 397 new cases Friday 21 February: 118 deaths, 889 new cases Thursday 20 February: 114 deaths, 394 cases (China stopped counting clinically diagnosed cases this day as confirmed cases and instead counted only cases that had tested positive) Wednesday 19 February: 136 deaths, 1,749 new cases Tuesday 18 February: 98 deaths, 1097 new cases Monday 17 February: 105 deaths, 2,048 new cases Sunday 16 February: 142 deaths, 2,009 new cases Saturday 15 February: 143 deaths, 2,641 new cases Friday 14 February: 121 deaths, 5,090 new cases Thursday 13 February: 254 deaths, 15,152 new cases (On this day China began including cases diagnosed by doctors and scans in addition to patients who had tested positive to virus). China\u2019s, secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Cong Liang, has told a press conference that China is confident in overcoming the coronavirus and maintaining stable economic growth. He said China had launched tax and fee cuts for small businesses and that the impact on China\u2019s economy would be limited and short term. It follows President Xi\u2019s speech on Sunday in which he warned of the economic impact of the virus, while at the same time saying he though it was temporary and containable. We\u2019re now getting today\u2019s figures from China\u2019s National Health Commission. There have been 150 deaths in the past 24 hours, and 409 new cases of infections. Of the deaths, 149 were in Hubei province, as were 398 confirmed new cases, of those (348 were in Wuhan). It brings the total number of confirmed cases in China to 77,150, with 2,592 deaths. As I mentioned earlier in the blog, we are still waiting for Monday\u2019s announcement of cases of the virus from both the Hubei health commission and the National Health Commission. Both have almost always reported by this time (in fact by a few hours ago). There is no explanation for the delay that I can find. South Korea\u2019s stock market has plunged more than 3% as investors take fright at the worsening outbreak in the country. Not only is one of its largest cities, Daegu, in semi-lockdown, and large gatherings of people cancelled around the country, but airlines are beginning to cancel flights into South Korea, threatening its export-oriented economy. In Shanghai the Composite index is off 0.93% and its worth noting that the yuan has weakened again to 7.0246 per US dollar. In Hong Kong, shares were off 1.63%. Brent crude has slumped 3%, or $1.77, to $56.72 a barrel while U.S. crude dropped 2.7%, or $1.48, to $51.9 a barrel. Stocks have also fallen 2.26% in Sydney. The Australian dollar has fallen 0.3% to US66.09 and is now close to its lowest point for 11 years. New Zealand has extended a ban on arrivals from mainland China into a fourth week to contain the risk of exposure to the coronavirus, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday. The ban has been extended by a further eight days and would be reviewed after that, Ardern told a news conference. New Zealand so far has no confirmed cases of the virus in the country. We\u2019re hearing from Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. He confirms that seven passengers from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship have contracted Covid-19 and are being treated (they have been returned to their home states). No Australians who were evacuated from Wuhan earlier this month were diagnosed with the illness. They have returned to their homes. He confirms Australia has lifted its travel advice to Level 2 to Japan and South Korea (as we reported earlier). We\u2019re now hearing from Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, who says the rising cases in South Korea, Japan and Italy are a \u201ccause for concern\u201d. He says he has \u201ccautious optimism\u201d for Chinese provinces outside of Hubei, in terms of the virus spread. There is no community transmission of the virus in Australia at the moment, he says. But Australia is preparing \u201cfor every eventuality\u201d with regards to a potential spread of the virus. The Reuters news agency is reporting that the four Chinese provinces Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi and Guizhou on Monday lowered their coronavirus emergency response measures. Yunnan and Guizhou cut their emergency response measures from level I to level III, according to local authorities, while Guangdong and Shanxi lowered their measures to level II. China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures it will implement, with level I the most serious. Gansu province was the first to lower its measures on Friday, followed by Liaoning on Saturday. Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post, has President Xi\u2019s speech on the front page, with the headline: \u201cVirus the nation\u2019s most serious health crisis, Xi warns\u201d. We are still waiting for the update on today\u2019s virus figures out of China, but the Hubei province\u2019s report on test kits for the virus gives a sense of the scale of what the epicentre of Wuhan is dealing with. The Xinhua news agency says Wuhan has conducted nucleic acid tests for all backlog of patients, including those confirmed or suspected to be infected with the virus, close contacts of confirmed cases, and patients with fever. It says they carry out an average of 14,000 tests per day, taking 10 hours to deliver results, which patients can now check online. New Zealand media is reporting that the country\u2019s national carrier, Air New Zealand, has suspended flights to Seoul until April. No sooner had I typed in those South Korean infection figures, and they are out of date. We have just heard from the health authorities there that infections have jumped to 763, up from 602. Yonhap news agency says there has also been a 7th death. Over 110 people including nine medical staff, at the Daenam Hospital have been confirmed to be infected with Covid-19, with five victims of the potentially fatal illness reported or linked to the hospital, which has been in cohort isolation to stem further spread. With six deaths and 602 infections, Seoul has raised the virus alert to \u201cred\u201d its highest level in the four-tier system. It\u2019s the first time it has been at red in more than a decade, the Yonhap news agency reports. The country\u2019s health minister said the next seven to 10 days would be crucial in fighting the virus. The country\u2019s new school year, set to begin in March, has been postponed by a week (March 9). This applies from kindergartens up to high schools. It\u2019s the first time the school term has been postponed nationally. More than half of the country\u2019s cases are linked to the religious group Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. More than 9,000 members of the group are in self-quarantine. Yonhap says 1,248 have shown Covid-19-related symptoms. Still in Australia, and the government has updated its official travel advice for Japan and South Korea due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Travellers are being told to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19)\u201d. \u201cMonitor your health closely and follow the advice of local authorities,\u201d the Department of Foreign Affairs said for both countries. In South Korea, it advises Australians to \u201creconsider your need to travel in Daegu and Cheongdo\u201d, the centre of Covid-19 infections. \u201cWe advise you to reconsider your need to travel to Daegu and Cheongdo due to significant outbreaks of Covid-19 in those cities,\u201d the advice said. South Korea has reported 602 infections and six deaths. The Australian stock exchange has plummeted after offshore markets fell on fears the virus is spreading across Asia and may affect global economic stability. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index fell was a 116.7 points in the first half hour of trade, or 1.63%, to 7,022.3. The broader All Ordinaries index was down 117.1 points, or 1.62%, at 7,113.3 as all indices fell. Australian Associated Press reports that after half an hour of trading, the biggest drags were the energy, materials and consumer discretionary indices. Energy was 2.82% lower, industrials were down 2.42% and the consumer discretionary index had tumbled 3.39%. US and European markets fell on Friday on the back of increasing concerns over COVID-19 as more companies face disruptions and issue profit warnings. Oil prices also fell but gold jumped to its highest level in seven years as investors rushed to the save-haven metal. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea\u2019s Kospi index plunged more than 2% on Monday morning (the country has more than 600 coronavirus infections). The Hong Kong and mainland China markets open shortly with the focus on what is expected to be very weak factory output data from China later. You can read our full story on the deepening economic impact of the virus below: In an important speech on the virus on China, President Xi Jinping has warned that \u201cat present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage\u201d. \u201cThe outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,\u201d Xi said, adding that the impact would be short-term and controllable. The outbreak, which has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,400 in China, is one of the most serious public health crises to confront Chinese leaders in decades. \u201cFor us, this is a crisis and is also a big test,\u201d Xi said. Xi said the virus had caused the most extensive infection and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. We are waiting for the daily update of figures from the Chinese health commission. As of Sunday there were nearly 77,000 infections and more than 2,400 deaths But here are the main points you need to know before we get underway: The world is approaching a tipping point in containing the spread of the coronavirus, experts say, warning that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it. China\u2019s president Xi has acknowledged the \u201crelatively big\u201d impact the virus will have on the country\u2019s economy and society, but also said the results of prevention and control work have \u201conce again demonstrated the notable advantages of the leadership of the CPC (Chinese communist party) and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d. South Korea\u2019s president has placed the country on red alert, responding to a rapidly growing number of cases (six deaths, 602 infections). Italy has imposed strong measures in a number of towns in the northern Lombardy region to stop the spread of the virus (including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas), after a third person died on Sunday. Iran (eight deaths, 43 infections) has closed schools and in 14 provinces as \u201ca preventative measure\u201d. Japan still has the most cases outside China (838), the vast majority of which were onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

The Irish health minister said on Monday that the fixture needs \u201cconsiderable consideration\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/24/six-nations-talking-points-from-a-thrilling-third-round\">Six Nations: talking points from a thrilling third round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Italian rugby federation has also postponed all matches, from elite to grassroots level, this weekend and suspended all gatherings of its national teams in the affected regions.</p> <p>Postponed matches would mean the Six Nations is forced into at least one extra week, or fixtures could have to be played considerably later. That could wreak havoc, with France, England and Ireland still harbouring hopes of winning the title. In 2001 one match was played in September and two in October owing to the disruption caused by the spread of foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s minister for health, Simon Harris, said: \u201cThe rugby game is something that needs considerable consideration. This situation is evolving. The weekend\u2019s activities have shown there is still an awful lot unknown about the coronavirus and about the path it might take. There will be some big decisions in the coming days.

Several towns in the areas are under lockdown. While England\u2019s men\u2019s side face Italy in Rome next month, both the women\u2019s and under-20 matches are scheduled for those affected regions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Six Nations is monitoring this situation very closely and is in regular contact with the [Italian federation] and all other unions and federations as well as the relevant local authorities and health organisations,\u201d read a statement from the tournament organisers.</p> <p><br>Mauro Vegni, the head of the race organisation for several top Italian cycling events including the Giro d\u2019Italia, which is scheduled to start on 9 May in Budapest, said he was concerned the virus could affect the Milan\u2011San Remo race next month. \u201cLike everyone, we are concerned by what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told Cycling News.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-dead-in-iranian-city-of-qom\">Coronavirus: Iran denies cover-up as six deaths reported in Italy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt the same time we hope that, with time, the situation will improve and that the number of cases will not increase.

      "bodyText": "The Rugby Football Union is in talks with Six Nations organisers amid concerns England\u2019s push for the title could be affected \u2013 and the remainder of the competition thrown into chaos \u2013 by the spread of the coronavirus in Italy. England are due to face Italy in Rome on 14 March on the final day of the Six Nations but there are already doubts over Italy\u2019s match against Ireland in Dublin a week earlier. The Irish health minister said on Monday that the fixture needs \u201cconsiderable consideration\u201d. The Italian rugby federation has also postponed all matches, from elite to grassroots level, this weekend and suspended all gatherings of its national teams in the affected regions. Postponed matches would mean the Six Nations is forced into at least one extra week, or fixtures could have to be played considerably later. That could wreak havoc, with France, England and Ireland still harbouring hopes of winning the title. In 2001 one match was played in September and two in October owing to the disruption caused by the spread of foot and mouth disease. Ireland\u2019s minister for health, Simon Harris, said: \u201cThe rugby game is something that needs considerable consideration. This situation is evolving. The weekend\u2019s activities have shown there is still an awful lot unknown about the coronavirus and about the path it might take. There will be some big decisions in the coming days. Most particularly, I\u2019m thinking of the Ireland-Italy game.\u201d Two Pro14 matches \u2013 Ospreys\u2019 match against Zebre in Parma and Ulster\u2019s trip to Treviso to play Benetton \u2013 have been called off. \u201cTo ensure the safety of our players and spectators Pro14 Rugby fully supports the preventative measures taken in Italy,\u201d read a statement. On Sunday, all sporting events in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto were postponed, including the women\u2019s Six Nations match between Italy and Scotland. Several towns in the areas are under lockdown. While England\u2019s men\u2019s side face Italy in Rome next month, both the women\u2019s and under-20 matches are scheduled for those affected regions. \u201cThe Six Nations is monitoring this situation very closely and is in regular contact with the [Italian federation] and all other unions and federations as well as the relevant local authorities and health organisations,\u201d read a statement from the tournament organisers. Mauro Vegni, the head of the race organisation for several top Italian cycling events including the Giro d\u2019Italia, which is scheduled to start on 9 May in Budapest, said he was concerned the virus could affect the Milan\u2011San Remo race next month. \u201cLike everyone, we are concerned by what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told Cycling News. \u201cAt the same time we hope that, with time, the situation will improve and that the number of cases will not increase. Milan-San Remo is the one that worries me the most,\u201d he added. At the moment there\u2019s no plan B for Milan\u2011San Remo. It would make no sense to cut three quarters of the race. We can only follow the lead from the government. We still have three weeks until Milan\u2011San Remo.\u201d South Korea\u2019s K-league has postponed the start of its football season, which had been due to kick off this weekend. \u201cThe K-league has decided to temporarily postpone the start of the 2020 K-league season until the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak eases,\u201d it said in a statement. Matches featuring Daegu FC, based in the city at that is the epicentre of the South Korea outbreak, and nearby Pohang Steelers, had already been postponed.",
