      "bodyText": "On a quiet street corner in a neighbourhood in Beijing known for families and retirees, Xue Min, 22 a recent graduate, swats her legs, fighting off mosquitoes, as she encourages passersby to browse the earrings and scrunchies she has laid out on a cloth, surrounded by fairy lights. \u201cHave a look,\u201d she says brightly to a couple, who pause briefly before moving on. Just before 10pm, two men arrive with a food cart \u2013 a gas stove, wok and counter, attached to a motorbike and begin to prepare their menu of fried rice and noodles. Xue and her neighbour, a woman selling books, toothbrushes and trinkets from abroad, murmur and watch with expectation. Business might pick up a little now. Soon, more people begin to stop. Two young men, carrying a bag of cans of beer, browse the books. One picks up a translation of Pride and Prejudice before opting for a collection of stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The other buys a journal. Meng, 35, one of the food-stall owners, calls to delivery drivers as they stop their electric bikes by the kerb: \u201cHey big brother, what will it be?\u201d It is a scene that should belong to another era, when Beijing\u2019s sidewalks were often crowded with hawkers selling local street food and a surprisingly diverse selection of daily necessities \u2013 socks, tableware, DVDs, textbooks, lingerie and pets. Street vendors came to be viewed as backwards and poor, pushed out by many city authorities in an effort to modernise the country\u2019s urban centres. But now, according to a recent speech by the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, street hawkers are the \u201clifeblood\u201d of the country and a key source of employment in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak. Li\u2019s remarks during a visit to Shandong province last week has created a frenzy around the idea of the ditan, or \u201cstreet vendor\u201d, economy. Stocks in companies selling vendor equipment have surged. Major Chinese tech companies began offering cheap loans to new stallowners. On the search engine Baidu, queries for \u201cstreet vendor tips\u201d jumped in the days after Li\u2019s speech, according to the company. In May, officials said a ranking of \u201ccivilised cities\u201d would no longer penalise for the presence of street stalls. At least 27 cities have pledged to support the once undesirable micro-economy. Soon after Li\u2019s speech, both Meng, whose wages at his day job at a restaurant have been cut, and Xue, who holds out little hope of finding a job soon, turned to street vending. \u201cI am looking for a job while also running a stall,\u201d said Xue, who studied human resources. She has only been out for the last three days and the profits have so far not been great. \u201cWe have come out because the policy is relaxing, and there is nothing else to do,\u201d she says.

Around that \u201cpeculiar institution,\u201d the thinkers of the time crafted an equally inhumane ideology to justify their brutality, using religious rhetoric in tandem with pseudoscience to rationalize treating humans as chattel. After the Civil War, the arrangements of legal slavery were replaced with those of organized, if not strictly legal, terror.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, thanks for following along. A recap of some key developments of the day: General Mark Milley, the nation\u2019s top military officer, apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op after the forcible removal of peaceful protesters. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the National Defense University in a prerecorded video commencement address. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\u201d Trump\u2019s convention speech is officially moving to Florida after it was originally supposed to be in North Carolina. Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, said he would support a national ban on police chokeholds. The House minority leader said he was also open to renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, which Trump has said he will \u201cnot even consider.\u201d Nancy Pelosi called for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol. The House speaker said she also believed the military bases should be renamed, telling reporters, \u201cThe American people know these names have to go.\u201d Pelosi added that Trump \u201cseems to be the only person left who doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d Trump condemned a bill amendment to establish a commission for changing the base names within three years. The president called on Republicans to block the amendment, but the Republican-led Senate armed services committee has already adopted the amendment to the annual defense authorization bill, although it can still be stripped out. Chicago police officers were caught on camera relaxing in a Democratic congressman\u2019s office while looting took place nearby. House Democrat Bobby Rush shared some of the footage, which showed several officers lounging on couches and making themselves popcorn and coffee from the office\u2019s supplies as the looting unfolded. \u201cThey were in a mode of relaxation, and they did not care about what was happening to businesspeople, to this city,\u201d Rush said at a press conference with mayor Lori Lightfoot. The mayor of San Francisco said today police would no longer respond to calls for \u201cnon-criminal activity\u201d, such as disputes between neighbors and complaints about homeless people, part of reforms she is pushing amid protests. The metro council in Louisville has unanimously passed a policy banning police from using \u201cno-knock warrants\u201d, the practice that led to the killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor. Trump\u2019s convention speech will take place in Florida, Republican officials have just announced. The GOP is officially moving the speech to Jacksonville after there were disputes over coronavirus safety measures in the original North Carolina location. The speech will happen 27 August in a venue with a capacity for 15,000 people. Florida recently reported a record number of Covid-19 diagnoses. The governor of North Carolina had required that there be a plan for social distancing and masks, which is why Trump and the GOP found a new location. The mayor of San Francisco said today police would no longer respond to calls for \u201cnon-criminal activity\u201d, such as disputes between neighbors and complaints about homeless people, part of reforms she is pushing amid protests. Mayor London Breed said officers in these cases would be replaced by professionals who are trained and unarmed and is meant to limit contact between police and the public. Her announcement comes amid increasing calls to defund the police stemming from the George Floyd protests. Breed did not provide specifics about budget or implementation of her plans, which also included a call to \u201cdemilitarize police\u201d. Breed recently faced criticisms when records revealed that she had personally texted police officials to \u201cclean up\u201d homeless encampments that she saw. The metro council in Louisville has unanimously passed a policy banning police from using \u201cno-knock warrants\u201d, the practice that led to the killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor: The ordinance, called Breonna\u2019s law, comes three months after police entered Taylor\u2019s home while executing a warrant and killed her. \u201cAll Breonna wanted to do was save lives,\u201d Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, said at the council meeting. \u201cSo it\u2019s important this law passes, because with that, she\u2019ll get to continue to do that, even in her death.\u201d The local ACLU said it would work to push this policy statewide. An essential worker in New York City has spent a week in jail after he was arrested for violating curfew, according to a report in Gothamist: The 27-year-old was leaving a job as a janitor and preparing to get a few hours of sleep before beginning a graveyard shift at another job when he briefly participated in the protest and was then arrested, Gothamist reported. The publication said the mayor\u2019s office and police spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. At Trump\u2019s Dallas event on policing, which has just ended and featured a panel of people who heaped praise on the president, there were some notable absences. The local police chief, sheriff and district attorney, who are the county\u2019s top three law enforcement officers and are all black, did not attend, the Dallas Morning News noted. The three were not invited, the paper noted. The event came as Trump is moving forward with his campaign rallies while the protests against police brutality continue across the country. A physician speaking at Trump\u2019s roundtable is repeatedly praising the president\u2019s support of hydroxychloroquine, sparking loud applause from the audience. The latest on hydroxychloroquine from the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley: Hydroxychloroquine does not work against Covid-19 and should not be given to any more hospital patients around the world, say the leaders of the biggest and best-designed trial of the drug, which experts will hope finally settle the question. \u201cIf you are admitted to hospital, don\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine,\u201d said Martin Landray, deputy chief investigator of the Recovery trial and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Many countries have permitted emergency use of the drug for Covid-19 patients in hospitals, following claims from a few doctors, including Didier Raoult in France, that it was a cure, and the ensuing clamour from the public. Landray said the hype should now stop. \u201cIt is being touted as a game-changer, a wonderful drug, a breakthrough. This is an incredibly important result, because worldwide we can stop using a drug that is useless.\u201d The National Football League announced it would donate $250m to the black community over the next ten years. The NFL has been under increased scrutiny as reckonings around race and discrimination touch practically every industry. Numerous celebrities, from rapper Ludacris to tennis star Naomi Osaka, have called for the organization to redraft Colin Kaepernick. The football star and civil rights activist was allegedly blackballed after he began kneeling at games during the national anthem, in protest of police brutality and racial inequality. In 2017, an unemployed Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL and the two parties reached a confidential settlement last year. In today\u2019s announcement, the league acknowledged Kaepernick for pushing it to change. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without the work Colin and other players have led off,\u201d an unnamed source told NFL.com. \u201cThat is a key point here. We listened to our players. We needed to listen more, we needed to move faster. We heard them and launched a social justice platform because of what Colin was protesting about.\u201d The NFL announcement comes after Major League Baseball, Nike, and other major players in the sports industry announced similar pledges as protests against racial injustice rage across the globe. The Trump campaign\u2019s invite for rallies now includes a coronavirus disclaimer, CNN notes: There have been growing concerns that the recent mass protests could lead to a spike in coronavirus cases, though public health experts have said the police response, including tear gas, pepper spray and aggressively arresting people could exacerbate problems. There are likely to be concerns about Covid exposure at the president\u2019s upcoming rallies, which come as much of the US is reopening despite the ongoing pandemic. The attorney general at Trump\u2019s event also says, \u201cThe real oppression and danger to our communities comes more from violent crime and lawlessness than it does from the police.\u201d Fact check: Violent crime has steadily decreased in the US, but police continue to kill nearly 1,000 people every year. Police in the US kill more people in days than many countries do in years. At Trump\u2019s roundtable, attorney general Bill Barr says, \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president who\u2019s more committed to reforming law enforcement.\u201d Fact check: The Trump administration abandoned Obama-era police reform efforts, which had included civil rights investigations into local police agencies with documented records of abuse and problems. \u201cPolice departments are not investigated under this administration,\u201d Christy Lopez, who led the justice department group investigating police departments under Obama, recently told the Washington Post. The roll-back of Obama\u2019s efforts began under attorney general Jeff Sessions. On the calls to defund the police, Trump said: \u201cI heard they want to close up all police forces... What happens late at night when you make that call to 911 and there\u2019s nobody there? What do you do, whether you\u2019re white, black, or anybody else, what do you do?\u201d The calls to \u201cdefund police\u201d come from community groups, who have long advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Groups now have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. Some lawmakers are responding and now proposing minor cuts that would allow police to continue to receive substantial funding. Regarding questions about the impact of public safety if police budgets are defunded, abolition groups argue that policing and prison are at their core racist and harmful and make communities less safe. They also point out that the vast majority of police work has nothing to do with responding to or preventing violence, and that police have a terrible track record of solving murders or handling rape and domestic violence. More here: Hi all - Sam Levin in Los Angeles, taking over our live coverage. Trump is currently doing a roundtable on police. The president is focused on defending police and presenting problems with officers as isolated incidents. He said: And you always have a bad apple no matter where you go. You have bad apples. And there are not too many of them, and I can tell you, there are not too many in the police department.\u201d In the massive protests of the last two weeks, there has been a growing interest in the movement to defund police, with activists arguing that brutality and killing are not isolated problems but systemic issues, and that the best way forward is to take funding away from law enforcement. While many defenders of police have cited the \u201cbad apple\u201d argument in recent days, there have been increasing accusations of widespread abuse. In Los Angeles, for example, police are now investigating 57 cases of alleged misconduct by officers during the protests. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Sam Levin, will take over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: General Mark Milley, the nation\u2019s top military officer, apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op after the forcible removal of peaceful protesters. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the National Defense University in a prerecorded video commencement address. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, said he would support a national ban on police chokeholds. The House minority leader said he was also open to renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, which Trump has said he will \u201cnot even consider.\u201d Nancy Pelosi called for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol. The House speaker said she also believed the miliary bases should be renamed, telling reporters, \u201cThe American people know these names have to go.\u201d Pelosi added that Trump \u201cseems to be the only person left who doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d Trump condemned a bill amendment to establish a commission for changing the base names within three years. The president called on Republicans to block the amendment, but the Republican-led Senate armed services committee has already adopted the amendment to the annual defense authorization bill, although it can still be stripped out. Chicago police officers were caught on camera relaxing in a Democratic congressman\u2019s office while looting took place nearby. House Democrat Bobby Rush shared some of the footage, which showed several officers lounging on couches and making themselves popcorn and coffee from the office\u2019s supplies as the looting unfolded. \u201cThey were in a mode of relaxation, and they did not care about what was happening to businesspeople, to this city,\u201d Rush said at a press conference with mayor Lori Lightfoot. Sam will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump has arrived in Dallas, Texas, for his rountable on \u201chistoric economic, health, and justice disparities in American communities.\u201d as protests against police brutality continue across the country. The president was greeted on the tarmac by Texas governor Greg Abbott, lieutenant governor Dan Patrick and attorney general Ken Paxton. Two congressional candidates who the president has endorsed were also present for Trump\u2019s arrival. Senate candidate Tommy Tuberville, who is running against Trump\u2019s former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, in Alabama, and House candidate Ronny Jackson, who previously served as Trump\u2019s White House physician, welcomed Air Force One in Dallas. A lawyer for Martin Gugino said the 75-year-old is starting physical therapy, after he was pushed to the ground by two police officers during a George Floyd protest. \u201cAs heartbreaking as it is, his brain is injured and he is well aware of that now,\u201d lawyer Kelly Zarcone said in a statement, per NBC New York. \u201cHe feels encouraged and uplifted by the outpouring of support which he has received from so many people all over the globe. It helps. He is looking forward to healing and determining what his \u2018new normal\u2019 might look like.\u201d Trump was widely criticized earlier this week after he suggested (without evidence) that Gugino was an Antifa plant, which Zarcone vehemently denied. One of Gugino\u2019s friends told CNN that the man \u201chad a good chuckle\u201d about Trump\u2019s tweet. Republican senator Lindsey Graham expressed support for General Mark Milley, after the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op at St John\u2019s Church last week. \u201cI have nothing but deep admiration for and total confidence in General Milley as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\u201d Graham said in a tweet. \u201cI support his statement in both substance and spirit regarding the recent presidential visit to St. Johns.\u201d The tweet was a bit surprising coming from Graham, who is one of the president\u2019s closest Senate allies and is generally reluctant to criticize him. Milley said in a prerecorded video released today that he should not have been at St John\u2019s moments after peaceful protesters nearby were forcibly removed using tear gas. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics,\u201d Milley told the graduates of National Defense University. \u201cAs a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.\u201d Democratic congressman Bobby Rush said his South Side office had been vandalized two weeks ago amid the George Floyd protests, and his staff later discovered the footage showing several officers in his office as looting took place nearby. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot said as many as 13 officers, including supervisors, were in Rush\u2019s office at various points in the early hours of June 1, even as the mall where the office is located became the target of looting. The mayor said the officers \u201cabandoned\u201d their obligations and would be \u201cthoroughly\u201d investigated to determine who was responsible. \u201cNot one of these officers will be allowed to hide behind the badge and go on like nothing happened,\u201d Lightfoot said. Chicago police officers were caught on camera relaxing in the South Side office of Democratic congressman Bobby Rush as looting took place at a nearby shopping plaza. Rush announced at a press conference alongside mayor Lori Lightfoot that the cameras in his office had captured footage of at least eight officers relaxing instead of addressing the looting. Rush shared some of the footage, which showed several officers lounging on couches and making themselves popcorn and coffee from the office\u2019s supplies. One of them was asleep on Rush\u2019s couch. \u201cThey even had the unmitigated gall to go and make coffee for themselves and to pop popcorn, my popcorn, in my microwave while looters were tearing apart businesses within their sight and within their reach,\u201d Rush said. \u201cThey were in a mode of relaxation, and they did not care about what was happening to businesspeople, to this city. They didn\u2019t care. They absolutely didn\u2019t care.\u201d Lightfoot apologized to Rush that his office had been treated \u201cwith such profound disrespect.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a personal embarrassment to me,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you and your staff even had to deal with this incredible indignity.\u201d Miranda Bryant reports for the Guardian from New York: Following widespread criticism over officers not wearing face masks \u2013 including from lawyers, protesters and the mayor - New York Police Department have issued a bizarre response, claiming: \u201cWe can put our energy to better use\u201d. The statement, sent out in response to questions over why the majority of officers do not appear to be wearing masks, references the weather, long days and uniforms, but makes no reference to coronavirus or public health in the middle of a pandemic. \u201cPerhaps it was the heat. Perhaps it was the 15-hour tours, wearing bullet resistant vests in the sun. Perhaps it was the helmets,\u201d Sgt Jessica McRorie, a spokesperson for the deputy commissioner for public information, said last night. \u201cWith everything New York city has been through in the past two weeks and everything we are working towards together, we can put our energy to a better use.\u201d It comes after legal experts warned of \u201cabysmal\u201d conditions for protesters who they said are being unnecessarily arrested and detained for as long as 48 hours without access to masks, food and water. The Legal Aid Society told The Guardian that police officers \u201crarely\u201d wear masks and are endangering protesters\u2019 health and safety. On Sunday, New York mayor Bill de Blasio called on NYPD officers to wear masks, accusing them of \u201cflouting the rules\u201d. Despite the president\u2019s opposition, an increasing number of Republican lawmakers are expressing openness to renaming military bases named after Confederate generals. Republican senator and veteran Joni Ernst, who is up for reelection this year, told Iowa reporters today, \u201cI know there will be opposition to [renaming the bases], but it is a discussion that we absolutely need to have.\u201d Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota said he agreed with Trump that we should not \u201cforget our history,\u201d but he added, \u201cAt the same time, that doesn\u2019t mean that we should continue with those bases with the names of individuals who fought against our country.\u201d Amid a similar debate over removing Confederate statues from the Capitol, senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said earlier today, \u201cA lot of those statues and monuments were put there to kind of declare, \u2018We\u2019re not going to integrate.\u2019 ... For those that were digging in during the time of Jim Crow, they need to know that time has passed.\u201d Trump has sent a tweet condemning senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bill amendment aimed at renaming military bases named after Confederate generals. \u201cSeriously failed presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth \u2018Pocahontas\u2019 Warren, just introduced an Amendment on the renaming of many of our legendary Military Bases from which we trained to WIN two World Wars,\u201d Trump tweeted from aboard Air Force One, reusing an offensive nickname for the Massachusetts senator. \u201cHopefully our great Republican Senators won\u2019t fall for this!\u201d But the Republican-led Senate armed services committee has already adopted Warren\u2019s amendment to the annual defense authorization bill, although it could later be stripped out of the legislation. The amendment calls for establishing a commission to devise a plan for removing Confederate names from military sites, with a goal of implementing the plan within three years. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said yesterday that the president would veto the defense authorization act if it included a proposal to rename the bases, but top House Republican Kevin McCarthy said he was \u201cnot opposed\u201d to the idea earlier today. A US senator this afternoon urged Attorney General Bill Barr to provide an account of how surveillance technology has been deployed against Americans during protests over the death of George Floyd. Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, told Barr that peaceful protesters \u201cshould not be subject to invasive surveillance\u201d and asked whether the Department of Justice had authorized the use of facial recognition, unmanned aircraft, or cellphone tracking technology in connection with the rallies, Reuters writes. Concerns have risen amid sightings of drones and other surveillance aircraft deployed over American cities and reports about government plans to spy on protesters. A recent BuzzFeed News report said the Drug Enforcement Agency had been authorized to conduct \u201ccovert surveillance\u201d at the gatherings. The news has intensified a backlash against the surveillance of protesters and surveillance technology in general. On Tuesday, 35 members of Congress issued a letter to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, describing urban drone flights as a \u201cvast overreach of federal government surveillance\u201d and demanding that officials \u201ccease surveilling peaceful protests immediately and permanently.\u201d Companies that make and market the technology have also come under pressure from Congress. IBM lawmakers Monday it \u201cno longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software.\u201d Amazon said it was imposing a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software, dubbed Rekognition. In a separate statement on Thursday, Markey said he was not satisfied by Amazon\u2019s move. \u201cPressing pause on the use of this technology by law enforcement is a positive step, but what Amazon should really do is a complete about-face and get out of the business of dangerous surveillance altogether,\u201d he said. Joe Biden has released a plan on how to reopen the US economy in a way that is \u201cas effective and safe as possible\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. The plan calls for guaranteeing coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment for anyone called back to work, as well as paid leave for anyone who gets sick. Biden also proposed creating a national contact tracing workforce and establishing best practices for schools and childcare facilities to reopen. \u201cA stronger, more effective reopening requires doing the work to keep workers safe, to restore consumer confidence, to support small businesses, to ensure seniors can participate, and to provide parents with the help they need to get back to work,\u201d the Biden campaign said in a press release about the plan. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee criticized Trump last week for celebrating the unemployment rate slightly dropping to 13.3%, emphasizing that 20 million Americans are still out of work. \u201cTrump has abdicated any effective federal leadership, leaving state, tribal, and local officials to do their best without help from Washington,\u201d the Biden campaign said. \u201cWith cases of COVID-19 still rising rapidly in parts of the country, Trump has effectively ceased to mobilize any national public health response.\u201d Trump is now en route to Dallas, Texas, where he will host a roundtable discussion on plans for a national \u201cholistic revitalization and recovery,\u201d according to the White House. The president will also attend a high-dollar fundraiser for his reelection campaign. Joe Biden released a statement earlier today criticizing Trump for making the trip, particularly because Texas is seeing a rise in coronavirus infections after relaxing some social distancing restrictions. \u201cFor weeks we\u2019ve seen President Trump run away from a meaningful conversation on systemic racism and police brutality. Instead, he\u2019s further divided our country. Today\u2019s trip to Texas won\u2019t change any of that,\u201d the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said. \u201cHe should be implementing an effective plan to re-open our communities so more Americans aren\u2019t lost to this disease. Families in the Lone Star State are hurting and they deserve a President who will rise to the challenges facing our country.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: General Mark Milley, the nation\u2019s top military officer, apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op after the forcible removal of peaceful protesters. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the National Defense University in a prerecorded video commencement address. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, said he would support a national ban on police chokeholds. The House minority leader said he was also open to renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, which Trump has said he will \u201cnot even consider.\u201d Nancy Pelosi called for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol. The House speaker said she also believed the miliary bases should be renamed, telling reporters, \u201cThe American people know these names have to go.\u201d Pelosi added that Trump \u201cseems to be the only person left who doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Shifting to the coronavirus pandemic, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced opposition to shutting down the US economy again, even as many public health experts warn of a potential second wave of infections later this year. \u201cWe can\u2019t shut down the economy again,\u201d Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that if you shut down the economy, you\u2019re going to create more damage. And not just economic damage, but there are other areas, and we\u2019ve talked about this \u2014 medical problems and everything else that get put on hold.\u201d The cabinet secretary\u2019s comments came as the number of US coronavirus cases surpassed 2 million, and about a dozen states are seeing a rise in infections since relaxing some social distancing restrictions. The president has similarly praised states for reopening and warned the costs of shutdowns may outweigh the benefits, although the vast majority of public health experts disagree with that opinion and have expressed caution about relaxing restrictions. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said he would support a national ban on police chokeholds, which is included in congressional Democrats\u2019 police reform bill. During a press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy complained about Republicans being excluded from the drafting process of the Justice in Policing Act, but he said there are elements of the bill that his caucus \u201cconceptually\u201d agrees with. Asked about the separate proposal to rename military bases named after Confederate generals, McCarthy said, \u201cI think it could be appropriate to change some.\u201d The California Republican said he would wait to see what came out of the defense authorization bill, which may include an amendment addressing the issue, but he noted he was \u201cnot opposed\u201d to the idea. McCarthy\u2019s comments were noteworthy considering Trump said yesterday that he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming the bases, and the House minority leader is generally reluctant to distance himself from the president. House speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted the Army bases named after Confederate generals should be renamed and the Confederate statues remaining in the Capitol should be removed. During her weekly press conference, Pelosi noted that she had a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee relocated to the Capitol crypt during her first term as speaker, but she claimed she does not have the authority to remove the statues. \u201cWhen I was speaker, I did do what I had the authority to do,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBelieve me, if I had more authority, we would have fewer of those statues around.\u201d Pelosi sent a letter yesterday to Republican senator Roy Blunt and Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, the chair and vice chair of the joint committee on the library, which oversees the placement of statues in the Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall. In her letter, the speaker called for the removal of 11 statues celebrating Confederate leaders. \u201cThey committed treason against the United States of America, and their statues are still here because their states put them here,\u201d Pelosi said today. Shifting to the issue of renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, Pelosi said such a change might require legislation. But she added, \u201cThe American people know these names have to go.\u201d Pelosi said Trump, who has expressed opposition to renaming the bases, \u201cseems to be the only person left who doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d She discussed the possibility of crafting legislation that addressed both the statues and the bases. \u201cBut these names have to go from these bases, and these statues have to go from the Capitol,\u201d Pelosi said. Judges at the International Crimnal Court gave the green light in March to an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, and began an investigation into crimes by Israeli and Palestinian forces in December. In his remarks, secretary of state Mike Pompeo made clear the newly announced US sanctions against the ICC were also aimed at defending Israel. David Bosco, an associate professor at Indiana University who wrote a book on the court, \u201cRough Justice: The International Criminal Court in a World of Power Politics,\u201d sent this comment on the Trump measures against the ICC: \u201cI think this is as much directed at the looming Palestine situation as it is at the Afghanistan investigation. The executive order clearly allows for sanctions against ICC personnel who investigate US allies who have not consented to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cThe actual effect on the court\u2019s Afghanistan investigation will probably not be significant. That investigation faces many logistical and evidentiary obstacles already and will take years to complete.\u201d The ICC was set up in 2002, as an attempt to extend the effort to impose international humanitarian law for war crimes and crimes against humanity begun by the war crimes tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Over 120 countries, including Washington\u2019s closest allies in Europe, are party to the Rome Statute, the founding document of the ICC. Bill Clinton signed for the US in 2000, but said the statute would not be sent to the Senate for ratification until the US had assessed the court\u2019s operations. George W Bush informed the UN in 2002 that the US would not join the court. The Trump administration is launching an economic and legal offensive on the International Criminal Court in response to the court\u2019s decision to open an investigation into war crimes carried out by all sides, including the US, in Afghanistan. The US will not just sanction ICC officials involved in the investigation of alleged war crimes by the US and its allies such as Israel, the administration declared it was launching a counter-investigation into the ICC for alleged corruption. The secretary of state Mike Pompeo, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, defence secretary Mark Esper and attorney general William Barr gave a presentation of the decision at the state department, but then left without taking questions. Barr made clear that this was the beginning of a sustained campaign against the ICC, and that Thursday\u2019s measures were just an \u201cimportant first step in holding the ICC accountable for exceeding its mandate and violating the sovereignty of the United States\u201d. \u201cThe US government has reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC, the Department of Justice has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor,\u201d Barr said. Even Trump\u2019s former communications director is criticizing his decision to restart campaign rallies on Juneteenth in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Anthony Scaramucci, who spent an eventful 10 days in the Trump White House, said the campaign\u2019s decision to hold its first campaign rally in three months on a holiday celebrating the end of slavery was \u201cabhorrent and a wink at his racist supporters.\u201d Scaramucci noted Tulsa\u2019s history as the site of a deadly 1921 race massacre targeting African Americans, and he pointed out that Oklahoma is not even considered a swing state for the presidential election. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the Trump campaign\u2019s decision to restart campaign rallies on Juneteenth, a holiday that celebrates the end of slavery in America. \u201cThe African American community is very near and dear to his heart. At these rallies he often shares the great work he has done for minority communities,\u201d McEnany said this morning. \u201cHe\u2019s working on rectifying injustices,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it\u2019s a meaningful day to him and it\u2019s a day where wants to share some of the progress that\u2019s been made as we look forward and more that needs to be done.\u201d The president announced yesterday that he would hold his first campaign rally in more than three months next Friday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a deadly 1921 race massacre that targeted African Americans and their businesses. The announcement was quickly met with criticism from Democratic strategists and commentators. From Joe Biden\u2019s director of strategic communications: From a progressive political strategist: From a former National Security Council spokesperson under Barack Obama: Various measures of support for the Black Lives Matter movement were agreed upon at Thursday\u2019s meeting for the restarted Premier League. A minute\u2019s silence will also be held before each match in the first round of the restarted league to honour those who have died with Covid-19, and heart-shaped badges paying tribute to NHS workers will be embroidered into team kit. The Guardian understands that the league will have no problem if players or teams wish to take a knee before games, as some clubs have done before recent friendlies. The names on the back of players\u2019 shirts will be replaced, for at least the first set of games, by the words Black Lives Matter, following an initiative driven by club captains this week. One club explained that their kit staff had been primed to order shirts reflecting the change. Black Lives Matter badges are also likely to be displayed on shirts, along with their NHS equivalents, although their exact placement is yet to be finalised. The issue of what happens if a player removes his shirt to reveal a slogan in support of the movement was raised, after referees expressed concerns about the appropriateness of issuing a mandatory yellow card in such cases. Officials are expected to be asked to use their discretion. Meanwhile, the president is being mocked on social media for referring to the US secret service as \u201cSS,\u201d the name of the Nazi military organization that helped to run Adolf Hitler\u2019s death camps. Trump tweeted this morning, \u201cOur great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. \u2018A walk in the park\u2019, one said. The protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY easily by the Guard, D.C. Police, &amp; S.S. GREAT JOB!\u201d A Bloomberg reporter responded by sharing the history of the Nazi SS: An AFP editor noted the secret service is usually referred to as USSS for obvious reasons: The anti-Trump conservative commentator Bill Kristol offered the president this advice on the matter: Here is the video of Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, apologizing for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op at St John\u2019s Church: \u201cAs senior leaders, everything you do will be closely watched, and I am not immune,\u201d the top military official told the graduates of the National Defense University in a prerecorded commencement address. \u201cAs many of you saw the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society. I should not have been there,\u201d Milley continued. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.\u201d Gen Mark Milley has been \u201cagonized\u201d about participating in Trump\u2019s photo op and expressed anger with the president about the issue, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: General Milley\u2019s friends said that for the past 10 days, he has been agonized about appearing \u2014 in the combat fatigues he wears every day to work \u2014 behind Mr. Trump during the walk across Lafayette Square, an act that critics said gave a stamp of military approval to the hard-line tactics used to clear the protesters. The general believed that he was accompanying Mr. Trump and his entourage to review National Guard troops and other law enforcement personnel outside Lafayette Square, Defense Department officials said. In the days after the photo op, General Milley told Mr. Trump that he was angered by what had happened. The two had already exchanged sharp words last Monday when General Milley engaged the president in a heated discussion in the Oval Office over whether to send active-duty troops into the streets, according to people in the room. Gen Mark Milley\u2019s apology comes amid another standoff between the White House and the Pentagon over the potential renaming of military bases named after Confederate generals. Milley and Esper signaled earlier this week that they were open to a conversation on renaming the bases, after years of critics complaining the bases\u2019 names celebrated the Confederacy\u2019s efforts to preserve slavery. However, Trump announced yesterday that he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming the bases. The president also tweeted moments ago, \u201cTHOSE THAT DENY THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT!\u201d Of course, the more common quote is, \u201cThose who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.\u201d Critics of the bases\u2019 names would almost certainly argue that removing the names of generals who actively fought against the US military from Army bases is an appropriate way of remembering the past. The apology from Gen Mark Milley, the nation\u2019s top military officer, comes after he and defense secretary Mark Esper received widespread criticism for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op. Former defense officials accused the two officials of giving the appearance of a Pentagon stamp of approval on the forcible removal of peaceful protesters using tear gas. \u201cThe decision to use active military forces in crowd control in the United States should only be made as a last resort,\u201d Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant defense secretary under Trump, told Politico. \u201cActive Army and Marine Corps units are trained to fight our nation\u2019s enemies, not their fellow Americans. American cities are not battlefields.\u201d One member of the defense science board actually resigned in protest of Esper\u2019s participation in the photo op, which took place moments after the protesters were removed. \u201cYou may not have been able to stop President Trump from directing this appalling use of force, but you could have chosen to oppose it. Instead, you visibly supported it,\u201d James Miller wrote in his resignation letter to Esper. Gen Mark Milley\u2019s apology for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op makes it very likely that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will soon be on the receiving end of a negative presidential tweet. The president is notoriously sensitive to having senior officials publicly distance themselves from him, and he was reportedly on the brink of firing Mark Esper last week after the defense secretary said he did not support Trump\u2019s proposal to send active-duty troops to states with George Floyd protests. Esper has not apologized for participating in the photo op, telling reporters last week that he was not aware he would be taking part in it when he came to the White House to meet with Trump. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op at St John\u2019s Church last week, which took place moments after nearby peaceful protesters were removed using teargas. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d Milley told the National Defense University in a prerecorded video commencement address. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\u201d Milley and defense secretary Mark Esper were widely criticized for participating in the photo op, with many former defense officials saying the two were helping Trump\u2019s efforts to politicize the military. \u201cAs a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from,\u201d Milley said, going on to described his anger about \u201cthe senseless and brutal killing of George Floyd.\u201d The Senate armed services committee has adopted an amendment for the Pentagon to rename military sites named after Confederate generals within three years, according to CNN. The proposal was adopted by the Republican-led panel behind closed doors as an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill, which could make it more difficult for Trump to veto. If the amendment makes it into the final version of the defense bill, the president would have to veto a number of popular proposals for the Pentagon in order to prevent the base renaming initiative from moving forward. CNN reports: The amendment was offered by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, defining assets as property own or controlled by the Pentagon, whether it\u2019s a base, installation, facility, aircraft, ship, plane or type of equipment. The amendment would create an independent commission to review and develop a detailed plan for removing the names. The news comes one day after Trump said he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming the bases, and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany specifically said the president would veto the defense authorization bill if it included a proposal to do so. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. Trump\u2019s most recent tweet that the National Guard troops who patrolled Washington amid the George Floyd protests \u201ccould hardly believe how easy it was\u201d is at odds with recent reports about the troops. The New York Times reports: The first days of June, a calamitous period for the Trump presidency, have been a debacle for the National Guard. There has been a torrent of criticism from Congress, senior retired military officers and Guard members themselves since more than 5,000 Guard troops \u2014 from the District of Columbia and a dozen states \u2014 were rushed to the streets of the capital to help in the crackdown on mostly peaceful protesters and occasional looters after the killing of George Floyd in police custody. The D.C. Guard has halted recruiting efforts, and at least four National Guard troops have tested positive for the coronavirus. D.C. Guard members, typically deployed to help after hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters, say they feel demoralized and exhausted. More than 60 percent are people of color, and one soldier said he and some fellow troops were so ashamed in taking part against the protests that they have kept it from family members. Donald Trump is up and tweeting, and is straight on the attack against \u201cAntifa\u201d. This is somewhat in contrast to Trump\u2019s final tweets last night, where he was labelling protesters in Seattle \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d, and not \u201ca walk in the park\u201d at all. Axios has an interesting note about the next New York Times bestseller list. The top ten entries on the \u2018combined print and e-nook non-fiction list\u2019 are absolutely dominated by titles that focus on race in the US. The top five consists of: White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi Me and White Supremacy by Layla F. Saad The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander You can read the full list here. It has been similar in the UK, where Bernardine Evaristo and Reni Eddo-Lodge have become the first black British women to top the UK\u2019s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts. And if you are wondering which books might be useful for your children at this moment in time, Aim\u00e9e Felone has this list: \u2018No reader is too young to start\u2019: anti-racist books for all children and teens Joe Biden was on Trevor Noah\u2019s Daily Show on Wednesday night, and he touched on two important topics that are likely to make headlines - what he feels about defunding the police, and how willingly Donald Trump would leave the White House if he lost November\u2019s election. On the policing issue, Biden said \u201cWell, I think there are a lot of changes that can take place period, without having to defund police completely\u201d. He has in fact dismayed some activists by proposing extra money for police to tackle inequality. He suggested that social workers couldn\u2019t replace cops on call outs, but that maybe police should be accompanied when dealing with situations like suspected overdoses or mental health episodes. He also suggested a change of tack on drug policy, saying \u201cNobody should be going to jail for the use of drugs, they should be going to mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers, not more prisons\u201d On Trump leaving the White House, in some quotes that seem to have excited Fox News, Biden suggested he had faith that if Trump did refuse to move, the military would happily step in. \u201cI promise you,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced they [the military] will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.\u201d Another 1.5 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week even as states across the US continued to relax their coronavirus quarantine measures. In just 12 weeks more than 44 million claims have been made for benefits as people lost their jobs. Dominic Rushe and Amanda Holpuch in New York have our full report. We\u2019ll have further live economic reaction to the news on our Business live blog which my colleague Jasper Jolly is running over here. Time magazine\u2019s new cover and lead essay is out. It does not mince its words The origins of America\u2019s unjust racial order lie in the most brutal institution of enslavement that human beings have ever concocted. More than 12 million Africans of all ages, shackled in the bottom of ships, were sold into a lifetime of forced labor defined by nonstop violence and strategic dehumanization, all cataloged methodically in sales receipts and ledgers. Around that \u201cpeculiar institution,\u201d the thinkers of the time crafted an equally inhumane ideology to justify their brutality, using religious rhetoric in tandem with pseudoscience to rationalize treating humans as chattel. After the Civil War, the arrangements of legal slavery were replaced with those of organized, if not strictly legal, terror. Lynchings, disenfranchisement and indentured servitude all reinforced racial hierarchy from the period of Reconstruction through Jim Crow segregation and on until the movement for civil rights in the middle of the 20th century. The essay - \u201cAmerica\u2019s Long Overdue Awakening to Systemic Racism\u201d by Justin Worland - was published online earlier today. John F Harris has written a column this morning for Politico about Confederate statues. He used to live in Richmond, Virginia, where last night a statue of Confederate president Jefferson Davis was pulled down by protesters. In it, he examines what has changed about the monuments he lived next to and the 1990s, and how they have been seen in recent years. Why did I tolerate, and even, at times, take friends to see the statues? It wasn\u2019t that the legacy of the Confederacy didn\u2019t offend me. It was that the statues depicted a history that seemed functionally dead. They also seemed like a joke\u2014and the joke was on the very racists who had erected them in the first place. Along the way, Harris speaks to Donald P. Baker, known for his biography of the nation\u2019s first black elected governor L. Douglas Wilder. Baker says of the statues on Monument Avenue: \u201cThe longer we lived here, the more they offended me.\u201d For him they weren\u2019t so much about the civil war era, but about a constant reminder of the Jim Crow era, when so many Confederate statues were actually erected. It\u2019s a fascinating piece, well worth your time: On Monument Avenue, Liberal illusions about race come tumbling down The protests over the killing of George Floyd and the run-up to November\u2019s election have all been taking place against the ominous backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak. Recorded cases in the US - according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker - have breached the two million barrier. To put the accelerated spread of the disease in some perspective, it took 14 weeks to go from one case to one million cases. It only took another six weeks to go from one million to two million. Oliver Milman reports for us on how the nation has failed to get to grips with the coronavirus: Deficiencies in the stockpile of testing kits, swabs, ventilators and protective equipment for medical staff marked the opening stanza of the pandemic in the US. It was a muddled and sometimes astonishing response embodied by Donald Trump, who predicted the virus would vanish in the April sunshine, squabbled with state governors and pondered the merits of injecting bleach or taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven anti-malarial drug. Read his full report: \u2018An American fiasco\u2019: US hits grim milestone of 2m Covid-19 cases Jon Ossoff, the 33-year-old media executive, has won Georgia\u2019s Democratic primary for a Senate seat. He will contest it in November against Republican David Perdue, a Trump ally. Democrats are looking to flip the seat in what should be a competitive race in November. That might not be the main thing to draw out of Tuesday\u2019s election though. It was beset with organisational problems, with voting queues extending even longer than usual due to coronavirus social distancing rules. David Daley writes for us today about the lessons it might teach us about November: It wasn\u2019t just in-person voting that malfunctioned on Tuesday. It was also impossible to watch Georgia\u2019s expanded vote-by-mail system meltdown \u2013 forcing tens of thousands of voters who requested, but never received, absentee ballots to either join these long lines during a pandemic, or forfeit their civic voice entirely \u2013 without envisioning a train wreck this fall. Not just in Georgia, but in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and many other crucial states where any repeat of the chaos we have already seen this spring could precipitate a constitutional crisis unlike any other in our history. We are in deep, deep trouble and seemingly completely unprepared for this November\u2019s elections. It\u2019s a worrying read: Georgia\u2019s voting fiasco is a warning. The November election could be chaos Before going to bed last night Donald Trump was tweeting vexedly about the protest situation in Seattle and issuing orders to Governor Jay Inslee. The president also claimed that the protests in Seattle are being run by \u201cradical left Democrats\u201d Mayor Jenny Durkan wasn\u2019t having any of it. Yesterday protesters in the \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone\u201d were doing something that has become a familiar sight in Washington DC and in Philadelphia - painting roads with huge anti-racism messages. A statue of Confederate president Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, is the latest statue to be torn down by protesters. In the last couple of days statues of Christopher Columbus have also been targeted. The statue, which stood on Richmond\u2019s Monument Avenue, was pulled down shortly before 11pm according to local news reports. Jefferson was a Mississippi Democrat who served as the president of the Confederate states from 1861 until 1865. Police were on the scene and videos on social media showed the statue being towed away as a crowd cheered. Among graffiti painted on the Davis monument was the question: \u201cHow much more blood?\u201d The protests over the killing of George Floyd have spread globally and lead to the toppling and removal of statues in several countries. A statue of slaver Edward Colston, which was thrown into Bristol\u2019s harbour in England by protesters at the weekend, has been retrieved from the water by local authorities. They say they are keeping it in a secure location while deciding what to do with it. One of the four former white Minneapolis police officers who were charged over the death of George Floyd was released on bail on Wednesday. Reuters report that Thomas Lane, 37, had been held on $750,000 bail and was freed from Hennepin County jail. He was one of three officers charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter over Floyd\u2019s death on 25 May. Lane\u2019s attorney, Earl Gray, has previously stated that Lane was only on his fourth day of patrol duty and that Derek Chauvin was his training officer, whom he should obey. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. \u201cWhat was my client supposed to do but follow what his training officer said?\u201d Gray said in an earlier court hearing. Chauvin remains in jail on $1.25 million bail. The other two officers, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, also remain in jail on $750,000 bail. Hi, welcome to our US politics and protests live blog today. Here\u2019s what you might need to get caught up on before we start: The US now has more than 2 million recorded cases of coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. There have been over 112,000 deaths Thomas Lane, one of the officers involved in George Floyd\u2019s killing, has been released after posting $750,000 bail Protesters tore down a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia Donald Trump has announced he will resume in-person campaign rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma next Friday. The rally will take place on Juneteenth, in the city where a 1921 massacre of Black people occurred. Philonise Floyd, George Floyd\u2019s brother, spoke before the House judiciary committee on Wednesday - read his full testimony. Donald Trump is going to be in Texas today, where he will be fundraising for his re-election campaign, and attending a round table at Gateway Church in North Dallas which is modestly titled \u201cTransition to Greatness: Restoring, Rebuilding, and Renewing\u201d We are also expecting new jobless figures today - indications are that the number may hit 45 million.

The families\u2019 petition to Johnson and Hancock states: \u201cThere is criticism of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis from all quarters.\u201d It says when a full public inquiry is held, it must consider: The timing of the UK lockdown on 23 March, which was later than almost all European countries. The state of the government stockpile of personal protective equipment and testing capacity. The response to warnings in the 2017 Exercise Cygnus report that the UK was not adequately prepared for a pandemic. The disproportionately high number of black and minority ethnic people who have died from Covid-19. The transfer of patients from hospitals to care homes and several other key issues that have been subject to intense criticism. The group\u2019s lawyers, led by Pete Weatherby QC and Elkan Abrahamson of Broudie Jackson Canter, who represented 22 bereaved families at the 2014-16 new inquests into the Hillsborough disaster, argue that the government is under a legal duty to hold a public inquiry. The chief coroner, Mark Lucraft QC, issued guidance in March that in most cases deaths from Covid-19 should not be investigated at inquests, and that where there were inquests they were not \u201cthe right forum\u201d for addressing concerns about government policy. Johnson and other ministers have so far rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry, including from 27 medical and public health experts who wrote to the Guardian on 5 June . Johnson has acknowledged there will be a time to learn lessons, but said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of his government\u2019s response.",

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"George Miller\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/mad-max-australian-cinema-ozploitation\">George Miller</a></strong><br>Director</h2> <p><strong>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>First of all, I gotta give love!

      "bodyText": "For more than three decades, Spike Lee has been one of the most vital forces in film-making. His latest movie, Da 5 Bloods \u2013 about four African American veterans who return to Vietnam in search of the remains of their squad leader \u2013 is described by Peter Bradshaw as \u201ca blast of satire and emotional agony about \u2026 the fact that black deaths matter\u201d. Last week, Lee released a new short film that spliced footage from his classic 1989 movie Do the Right Thing with the arrests of George Floyd and Eric Garner, both of which led to their deaths \u2013 proof that, even after three decades in the business, his work remains relevant. On Wednesday, the director, 63, spoke to the Guardian over video chat from his office in Brooklyn, New York. He was ebullient as he answered questions sent in by readers and famous fans, often prefacing his responses to his peers with enthusiastic expressions of respect and affection. * * * David Oyelowo Actor You\u2019ve always set an example of being outspoken about the things that matter to you in the film industry and beyond. Do you feel you\u2019ve ever been penalised for that? What\u2019s up, David! Yeah, but when you speak truth to power there\u2019s going to be resistance. You know that going in. Whatever they\u2019ve dished out has not stopped me from what I\u2019ve wanted to do for the past four decades. Thank you for the question. MosheKatse Do you ever get tired of people asking you your views on race relations in the US? Yes. I don\u2019t mind being asked; it\u2019s how I\u2019m asked. Many times, reporters are working on the assumption I\u2019m speaking on behalf of 40 million African Americans. Which is not the case at all. Halle Berry Actor What is the most challenging part of working with actors? They start acting crazy. Hahaha! I love you, Halle, love you, love you. Jungle Fever was Halle\u2019s first film! ThisIsDan If you could describe yourself in five words, what would they be? That\u2019s very hard. I can\u2019t do it. Now, my wife could, but not me. What would she say? I don\u2019t wanna know. No \u2013 I do know, I just don\u2019t wanna hear it! Hahaha! No \u2013 I know, I just don\u2019t wanna hear it again! Hahaha! Lina Wertm\u00fcller Director Reality sometimes overcomes fantasy and the pandemic is a perfect example. Do you think future movies will be able to ignore an event of this magnitude, or will their authors be forced to deal with it? Lina, I love you, I love you, I love you. Be safe, because I wanna see you and give you a big hug when we get over this thing. I think artists are gonna respond in many different ways to this pandemic. Movies, documentaries, novels, paintings, photographs, books: there\u2019s gonna be great art coming out of this. And historians many years from now will specifically go to see how artists commented. CitizenWise Where would you be if you weren\u2019t in the US? If I couldn\u2019t live in America, I would live in the People\u2019s Republic of Brooklyn. Hahaha! David Lammy MP for Tottenham When I watch the protests in the US, the sense I get is one of overwhelming tiredness. Tired of being shot in the street. Tired of waiting for progress. Tired of the never-ending struggle. How do you cope with weariness when injustice never sleeps? And what is the role of art in keeping us awake? David, that\u2019s a great question. I was very impressed when I met you more than once in London. You\u2019re doing a great job, you\u2019re fighting the good fight. You know the answer. The struggle continues and you just gotta keep fighting. So keep fighting! Uppernorwood Given slavery was the norm in all human civilisation until the 19th century, why do you think the US in particular struggles to deal with the consequences? Let me answer this question with a question for this person they can\u2019t answer right now. What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else! Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates. George Miller Director Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories? First of all, I gotta give love! My man\u2019s not only a doctor, he\u2019s a film-maker! That\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve heard that combination; for me that\u2019s like two sides of the brain. But I gotta say, love your films, love your films, love your films and one day I hope to meet you in person. This may sound like a trite answer, my brother Dr George Miller, but storytelling is just part of being a human being. It\u2019s what we do, from the very beginning, when we were writing shit on caves and whatnot. That\u2019s how we communicate. What moment or moments of all those you put on the screen most surprised you with its cultural impact? Do the Right Thing. People still going back to that film, especially today. How can you look at the NYPD\u2019s murder of Radio Raheem without thinking about Eric Garner and now Mr Floyd? It came out 31 years ago. Michael Mann Director I\u2019m curious \u2013 since directors have no idea how any other director directs, because we\u2019re never there \u2013 when you\u2019re in that intense groove during weeks, months of shooting, what do you do to maintain your vision for your film off the set? Do you prep, defocus to clear your head for the next day\u2019s possibilities, socialise, stay isolated and meditative? Michael Mann! Thank you for your question. Big fan of your work. It depends on the film, the scene, how I\u2019m feeling that day. How the actors might be feeling, hahaha! You know what I mean! You know what I\u2019m talking about! You just gotta go with the flow and the vibrations. You know better than me, Michael: this whole thing\u2019s about vibrations that we give back and forth. CountJackula How did you get Nelson Mandela involved in Malcolm X? I knew people that were close to Mandela and while we were shooting in Cairo we made arrangements to go to Soweto to film him. One of the greatest experiences ever. His only feature film is Malcolm X! Francis Ford Coppola Director I feel the most effective way to bring about change to the key areas of criminal justice, health care, education equality and childcare/nutrition is by allocating enormous funds; do you agree? That\u2019s the director of Apocalypse Now, which has two homages in Da 5 Bloods. And the Godfather trilogy. I\u2019m not gonna disagree. And his wine is great, too. That\u2019s my brother. Haigin88 You strongly supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020: are you going to vote for Joe Biden? Yes. Kamasi Washington Musician Nina Simone said that it is an artist\u2019s duty to reflect the times. For the first time, it feels as though people of all races from all over the world have seen the light and are demanding an end to this evil. What role do artists and the arts in general play in this unique time, where we have the world\u2019s attention and true change seems like it might be in our grasp? Thank you for your questions. I think the role that artists take is the role they choose. All art is not the same and many artists refrain from politics in their work and feel it\u2019s their job to entertain. This is something I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve got older: it is an artist\u2019s individual choice to do what they want to do. Any artist who says they\u2019re not going to comment? That\u2019s their choice. John Turturro Actor and director You have given voice to so many issues over the years that haven\u2019t gone away; how do you feel about where we are and are you hopeful for the future? John and I go way, way back. Our first film together was Do the Right Thing. John is one of the most beautiful, sincere human beings I\u2019ve ever met in my life. I love John. That\u2019s my guy. You know, a lot of the time, shit\u2019s fucked up, but you just gotta fight the good fight. You know that better than me, John. Ken Loach Director The long and terrible exploitation of black people lies at the heart of continuing brutal racism, not only in the US, but here as well. Christopher Logue wrote this in his poem Know Thy Enemy: \u201cHe does not care what colour you are / Provided you work for him.\u201d How do we unite people of all races to know their real enemy? Ken Loach?! The heavyweights! Ken, my brother, I\u2019m honoured. Ken, as you know, you are one of the great film-makers. So thank you for taking time out. I wanna meet you. Everybody who\u2019s asked me questions who I\u2019ve never met before: when this thing is over, I wanna sit down with you guys and talk and vibe. We don\u2019t have to talk about cinema; we can talk about football. But Ken, this is a great question. You gotta hold the mirror up. They gotta see what they look like, what they sound like and the hate they\u2019re representing. oliverhollander Why did eight years of Obama fail to make substantial enough change to race relations in the US? Very good question. But you have to understand: race relations \u2013 which have gotten worse \u2013 are a direct response to having a black president. alanpease Has anything fundamentally changed for the good since 1965? That\u2019s a hard question. We just buried King George Floyd. DeJongandtherestless Did you think race would still be such an issue in the US when you made Do the Right Thing? Yes, but I never imagined this. What\u2019s made it worse for me is the cameraphones. Before, you just read articles about it. Now, you are seeing these horrific murders. That makes all the difference in the world. The image of King George Floyd being suffocated for the last eight and a half minutes of his life went global and that is why we\u2019ve had marches globally. People round the world saw a human being with this cop\u2019s knee pressed against our brother\u2019s neck, crying out for his deceased mother. You know what? As he was dying, I believe he saw his mother. His mother came to him in his last breaths. That image hit people\u2019s hearts all round the world and that\u2019s why people took to the streets in England. Get a globe, spin it and, wherever you stop, there\u2019s a good chance people were marching. AllenRoy We need a new Do The Right Thing now. No. As long as I\u2019m alive, there will be no remake and, if they try, I\u2019m coming back from the dead to stop it. Hahaha! I promise you, I will come back from the pearly gates, from the upper room, to stop a remake. So help me God. I will bring him with me, and Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Bill Nunn, Frank Sinatra. Anybody that\u2019s passed; we\u2019ll all come back to stop a remake. Marlon James Novelist Bamboozled didn\u2019t just stun critics, it stumped them, like Sly Stone\u2019s There\u2019s A Riot Goin\u2019 On, or Kara Walker\u2019s work. Like those pieces of black art, they couldn\u2019t quite figure it out, because there was no spot in there for them to feel comfortable critiquing it. So, too many just attacked it with this \u201cyou\u2019ve made the wrong kind of black art\u201d response. At least, that\u2019s my take. Why do you think the same white critics (and a few black ones) who praised Do The Right Thing were outright dismayed by (in my opinion) one of your best films? I guess they felt guilty watching it. They might have felt they were being targeted by Spike Lee. They weren\u2019t \u2013 unless they were running around with blackface at a very young age. Which is what\u2019s now coming out: all these politicians in the US who are blacked-up in college photos. KoShamus Would you consider doing a British-set film with British actors? Especially as the US and UK share many similar racial politics issues. Yes, I have worked with several Brits. Clive Owen! Chiwetel [Ejiofor]! Great actors. I would have no opposition to doing that. But the only thing I\u2019ve ever shot in London was a Jaguar commercial. jimmybearlondon Which of your films are you most disappointed by in terms of their critical and commercial reception? People missed Bamboozled. 25th Hour. Miracle at St Anna. The biggest one is Chi-Raq. I think that film is gonna find an audience who\u2019ll understand what I was doing 20 years from now. Rosario Dawson Actor If you could go forward or backward in time to witness a historic or personal event, what would you want to see or experience first-hand, and why? Well, first of all, I have to give my love to Rosario. The first time I saw her was in Larry Clark\u2019s Kids and I\u2019ve been very lucky to have her in two of my films: She Got Game and 25th Hour. Rosario, I love you, I love you, I love you. That\u2019s a really good question. I would have liked to have been at Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech in Washington DC in 1964. I was alive; I was seven years old. To have heard those words with my own ears \u2026 Paul Schrader Director Would you cast an implausible person of colour in a historical drama for the sake of diversity, eg casting a black soldier in Custer\u2019s seventh cavalry? What were your feelings about Ryan Murphy\u2019s alternative history Hollywood, which placed persons of colour, gay people and women in positions of power they never achieved? When I cast two black actors and a white actor as best-friend factory workers in Blue Collar, I knew it was an unlikely pairing, but not implausible \u2013 therefore worth doing. Oooh! My brother! Hollywood: I\u2019ve yet to see it, but I\u2019m gonna check it out. Were there no black soldiers in Custer\u2019s seventh cavalry? Also \u2013 and I love Paul; that\u2019s my brother \u2013 I would do that film, but Custer would not be the hero. He would be the villain and I would tell it from the viewpoint of the Native Americans. One day! snortontaylor Does the recent win for Green Book, and that for Driving Miss Daisy 30 years ago, reflect the inability of the liberal, white US to confront the seriousness of racism in the US? I\u2019m gonna pass on that question. It does me no good to talk \u2013 especially in this time we\u2019re living in \u2013 about stuff which is insignificant. People are dying every day. Idris Elba Actor Do you think Michael Jordan will ever let anyone make a movie about his life and times \u2026 and would you do it? I ask while shaving my head \u2026 Hahaha! You\u2019re a great actor, but I don\u2019t know if you could handle \u201cthe rock\u201d, my man. Two separate skills. You can\u2019t do Mike on the court without some special effects from ILM. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna allow anybody to play him in a narrative film while he\u2019s alive \u2013 and he might put that in his will, too. I love you, Idris. I wanna commend my brother for telling the world that he tested positive [for coronavirus] and telling the world that this thing is no joke. It was so important. There were some crazy ghetto rumours that black people could not be affected by \u2013 as we call it \u2013 That 19. You did a great service to squash that lie. People might have died or not proceeded with care because they thought their black skin made them immune. impossiblyblack Jackson, Tyson, Jordan: which Michael has been the greatest influence on you? I\u2019ve worked with all three and all three I consider good friends. I\u2019ve been blessed. Botox_Billy Did you ever have political conversations with Michael Jackson? Was he knowledgeable and engaged about such things beyond a surface level? Oh, Michael knew what was going on! Look at that film we made in Brazil: They Don\u2019t Care About Us. It was an anthem when he was alive; it\u2019s even more of one now. We had some deep conversations. He was very aware. All you have to do is listen to the music and read the lyrics. As a grown man, he\u2019s not talking about ABC. He\u2019s saying whole different stuff. Asif Kapadia Director When did you first decide to cross from fiction to nonfiction? Why? For me, it all falls under the umbrella of storytelling. Love your documentaries, Asif, keep doing your thing. Jim Jarmusch Director I realise this is very general, but I\u2019m wondering: why are movies such a powerful and magical form of expression for you? I love Jim. We were at NY grad school at the same time. He was three years ahead; for my class \u2013 which included Ernest Dickinson and Ang Lee \u2013 he\u2019s our hero, because with Stranger than Paradise he provided a blueprint of how we could crack into this industry. Jim was living proof it could be done. Floella Benjamin Presenter and politician I strongly believe that prejudice is learned from an early age and that childhood lasts a lifetime. So, do you agree in order for children to grow up with empathy, more films should be made, specifically aimed at children, that address critical life issues such as racism \u2013 and would you consider making one? I agree 100%. No embryo is racist. No human being that\u2019s being formed in their mother\u2019s stomach is full of hatred. The moment that child pops out \u2013 excuse the terminology, I\u2019ve been there with two of my own children and they just popped out, hahaha! \u2013 they learn from their parents the good and the bad. Racism and hatred is learned; you\u2019re not born with it. So, I agree. Let\u2019s start teaching our children peace and love at a very early age. ClassicMacGruber Which actor from the past would you have liked to direct the most? I would have loved to work with Paul Newman. And Marlon Brando. I\u2019m sorry I never had a chance to work with Sidney Poitier. I did work with Harry Belafonte. I would have loved to work with Dorothy Dandridge. Femorian Why do so many white people teach their children to fear black people? Ignorance. Guilt. yukster_uk You\u2019ve created balanced, compelling and humane white characters in many of your films. Why do many similarly talented white film-makers not create compelling black characters? They probably didn\u2019t grow up around black people. Also: the minorities know more about the majority and it\u2019s not vice-versa because we\u2019re swamped by the majority culture. Mike Leigh Director Occasionally, I get mistaken for you; have you been mistaken for me? What\u2019s up, Mike, my brother! I haven\u2019t had the honour yet! Peace and love.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Call for inquiry into Covid-19 failings Hello, Warren Murray here to round out the week with the top stories of Friday. Officials failed to stockpile gowns and personal protective equipment in the build-up to the Covid-19 pandemic despite warnings to do so, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has revealed. The National Audit Office (NAO) said this meant less than half of the expected pieces of certain equipment were handed out to frontline workers as the crisis developed. About 300 UK health workers have so far died of Covid-19, and many NHS staff groups and families claim inadequate PPE played a key role in exposing them. The NAO also confirmed 25,000 hospital patients were discharged to care homes at the height of the pandemic before testing became routine. Lawyers representing 450 relatives of Covid-19 victims have called on Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock to hold an immediate public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. Their petition questions the lockdown not taking place until 23 March, later than almost all of Europe; the state of the government stockpile of PPE and testing capacity; the 2017 Exercise Cygnus report that warned the UK was not adequately prepared for a pandemic; and the disproportionately high number of BAME deaths, among other issues. A possible reduction of the two-metre physical distancing rule in England has councils and retailers fearing they have wasted millions of pounds on signs and other preparations for the reopening of high streets from Monday. Conservative MPs are increasingly pushing for a reduction to one metre. Retail groups say this would be a boost for shops but have expressed frustration at the lack of notice. Our global coronavirus live blog has all the updates as they arrive. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Brexit news flash \u2013 In breaking news this morning: the government is set to back away from imposing full EU border checks from 1 January 2021. The cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, is anticipated to make an announcement today. The UK had committed to introduce import controls on EU goods in the new year, but ministers are now expected to adopt a more flexible approach to prevent the departure compounding the chaos from Covid-19. * * * BLM seeks to avert far-right clashes \u2013 Black Lives Matters organisers have said they are calling off a planned protest at Hyde Park in London on Saturday, warning that far-right \u201chate groups\u201d were threatening the safety of those planning to come. BLM protests are expected to go ahead in London this afternoon but there is uncertainty and tension headed into the weekend. Tens of thousands of people have waded into the debate over statues of historical figures linked to slavery and racism that has raged since the weekend, signing petitions for and against a growing number of plans for their removal. In the US, Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has apologised for taking part in Donald Trump\u2019s infamous walk to the Church of the Presidents for a photo opportunity, through streets that had been forcibly cleared of protesters. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d Milley said. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.

Further arrests were made of a 13-year-old boy and a 34-year-old man. * * * \u2018Go Green for Grenfell\u2019 \u2013 Windows of tower blocks will glow green and the bells of St Paul\u2019s and Southwark cathedrals will toll 72 times on Sunday to mark the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Due to coronavirus restrictions, the annual vigil at the base of the burned-out council block will not take place, instead being replaced by a programme of remote commemoration including online faith services and song.

      "bodyText": "British airline passengers should avoid bringing hand luggage on to a plane in order to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, according to new government advice. However, the recommendation was criticised by Europe\u2019s biggest airline, Ryanair, which said it was safer for passengers to carry rather than check in bags. The Department for Transport guidance \u201cstrongly\u201d encourages passengers to check in bags and minimise hand luggage because it will \u201cspeed up boarding and disembarking and minimise the risk of transmission\u201d. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the guidelines were \u201ca positive next step\u201d for the embattled aviation sector to start recovery, after most flights were grounded due to coronavirus and travel restrictions from late March. Shapps added: \u201cThe government\u2019s advice currently remains to avoid all non-essential travel, but today we are taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back when it is safe for restrictions on travel to be lifted.\u201d The guidelines for air travel come as more flights are due to resume next week, when easyJet will restart domestic services from Gatwick. The advice, which broadly follows the guidance from the UN aviation body the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as well as input from the UK aviation industry, also recommends checking in online and remaining seated as much as possible during the flight. General health advice will continue to apply, such as attempting to maintain social distancing where possible in the airport, and washing hands regularly after touching any surfaces, including check-in kiosks and trolleys. Passengers are urged to bring their own face covering for use throughout their journey including at the airport, with spare coverings for longer journeys and plastic bags to store used masks. Specific rules on temperature checks or self-certification, which some airlines and airports have asked for, have not been issued. But in line with general guidance passengers have been told not to travel if they have been in close contact with anyone with symptoms in the past 14 days. Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at MAG, the owner of Stansted and Manchester airports, said they had collaborated with the government to draw up the guidelines, based on advice from independent medical and scientific experts who looked at necessary safety measures at each stage of travel. But Ryanair said that it recommended hand luggage, which would only be touched by the passenger, rather than checked-in bags which would have contact with multiple baggage handlers and check-in staff. Apart from Ryanair, most airlines and airports welcomed the guidelines, which they said would help pave the way for travel to resume \u2013 but also urged the government to remove the impediment of its controversial quarantine rules and introduce proposed \u201cair bridges\u201d to enable flights to selected international destinations as soon as possible. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the guidelines were welcome: \u201cThey demonstrate how airlines can apply targeted and multi-layered measures to ensure air travel is safe for customers and crew.\u201d The International Air Transport Association said the measures were sensible but \u201crendered useless if the government continues with the 14-day quarantine rule\u201d. A Ryanair spokesperson said the government should \u201cstop issuing rubbish advice to passengers about baggage and instead focus their efforts on scrapping the UK\u2019s useless visitor quarantine, which the UK Home Office now admit cannot be implemented, supervised or policed effectively\u201d.",

At the Booksellers Association, a survey of membership found that nearly a third of independent bookshops were planning to open fully once restrictions were lifted. \u201cInitially we were assuming that everyone would jump in, but there is quite a variety of opinion,\u201d according to Meryl Halls, the managing director. \u201cSome shops are desperate to get back for a variety of reasons, some of that commercial and some of it community-based; and some are very cautious \u2013 they are worried about staff, family members, or might be shielding themselves.\u201d At the Beckenham Bookshop, in Bromley, Kelly Bradford is trying to make her store \u201ca pleasant and enriching experience again\u201d, with hand-drawn signs, colourful safety markings, sanitiser and even a velvet rope \u201cfor that VIP experience\u201d. \u201cI am anxious about the public response to us reopening, but I am hopeful, if we can provide a calming environment, then it may help people to find their groove,\u201d she says. \u201cThe future is unknown, and it is scary out there, but I am confident that if anyone can pull off a new way to enjoy shopping it is booksellers.\u201d",

Following warnings in May from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), more airlines have started processing refunds to customers, after initially trying to get customers to accept vouchers rather than the full cash refund to which they are entitled. Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways initially bore the brunt of consumer ire, but Virgin Atlantic customers have this week accused the company of not processing refunds in order to prop up the company. Those behind a Virgin Atlantic refund action group on Facebook, which has more 400 members, say they are yet to find a single person who has received a voluntary refund from the airline. Virgin Atlantic, which along with other airlines has been fighting for its survival as the pandemic forced all flights to be cancelled, told the Guardian that it is paying back about \u00a320m a week in refunds. Virgin declined to say how many customers had been refunded so far \u2013 and admitted the company was now taking up to 120 days to process refunds. Hundreds of customers, frustrated at the delays, have instead asked their banks to process chargebacks, or credit card claims. Gill Jones from Rayleigh in Essex has been been waiting since early April for a \u00a31,895 refund for cancelled flights to Las Vegas, and said she has contacted her MP to highlight the company\u2019s failures. \u201cInitially, we were only being offered vouchers but we stuck to our guns and insisted on a refund,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the start, Virgin would only correspond by text, and took until 1 June before it finally emailed to say the refund would be processed.

      "bodyText": "From July Australians could enjoy gatherings of more than 100 people indoors and up to 10,000 outdoors at ticketed concerts, festivals and sporting events as part of new relaxed physical distancing rules. On Friday the national cabinet met and agreed to more generous caps on events in the third stage of eased restrictions and a pilot to allow international students to come study at approved institutions from July.

      "body": "<p>Matt Hancock is facing legal action from the daughter of a man who died from Covid-19 in a care home in which the health secretary is accused of a \u201clitany of failures\u201d and misleading the public with his claim to have \u201cthrown a protective ring\u201d around care homes.</p> \n<p>Dr Cathy Gardner launched a high court claim on Friday after her father, Michael Gibson, a retired superintendent of births, marriages and deaths, died in an Oxfordshire care home in early April. He became infected after a patient who tested positive for the virus was discharged from hospital into the home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The request for a judicial review alleges failings \u201chave led to large numbers of unnecessary deaths and serious illnesses\u201d and have been \u201caggravated by the making of wholly disingenuous, misleading and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 plainly false statements suggesting that everything necessary has been done to protect care homes during the pandemic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The move comes amid growing anger among families of care home residents at policies they believe may have caused their loved ones to become infected. Several have raised complaints with hospitals and care homes about infection control, including the discharging of Covid-negative residents into homes with outbreaks.</p> \n<p>Thirty-five councils have also blamed virus spread on discharges with hospital patients sent to homes that did not have sufficient protective equipment and/or facilities to isolate infected residents.</p> \n<p>Other cases include a decision to discharge John Heywood, 83, from Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge into a Peterborough care facility with an outbreak. He contracted the virus and survived, but his family have lodged a formal complaint with Addenbrooke\u2019s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"769991784b32ea73b9cced4fd41c6f9106563ce0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/769991784b32ea73b9cced4fd41c6f9106563ce0/0_384_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Heywood, whose family fear he contracted Covid-19 after being discharged into a care home with an outbreak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Heywood, whose family fear he contracted Covid-19 after being discharged into a care home with an outbreak.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI was really upset and angry,\u201d said his daughter, Sarah Heywood. \u201cI called the [hospital] discharge planning team and they said there was no obligation to tell us if there\u2019s Covid in a home. I felt it was out of our control. It didn\u2019t make sense. How on earth could they do that?\u201d</p> \n<p>Addenbrooke\u2019s said it would launch a full investigation, but only after the Covid-19 crisis has passed. In a statement, Cambridge University hospitals medical director, Dr Ashley Shaw, said: \u201cOur discharge planning team take great care in ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of patients, and that the facility to which a patient is being discharged is able to support the patient\u2019s needs at that time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In another case, the family of Hughie Leyland, 90, believe he contracted the virus and died aged 90 at the Westwood Hall care home in Wirral after it accepted discharged hospital patients.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t put people from a hospital where they may have had the virus into a place with the most vulnerable people,\u201d said his daughter-in-law, Charlie Leyland. \u201cIf this was one mistake, that\u2019s one thing, but it has been happening all around.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Leyland entered the home on 23 March, at a time when Department of Health guidance stated that \u201cnegative tests are not required prior to transfers/ admissions into the care home\u201d. It was not until 16 April that the government&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">announced</a>&nbsp;NHS patients being discharged into care homes would be first tested for Covid-19.

Guidance on testing people prior to discharge from hospital \u2026 changed when the virus was most virulent and there was heightened media coverage on the rising number of cases in care homes of residents who were testing positive or symptomatic.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Care Quality Commission is also investigating claims that \u201ca patient\u2019s positive Covid-19 status was known to the hospital but not disclosed at the point of discharge\u201d \u2013 a potential breach of the Health and Social Care Act. More than 15,000 people have died from known or suspected Covid-19 in UK care homes.</p> \n<p>In the letter initiating her claim that Hancock, the secretary of state for health and social care, breached his legal duty, Gardner\u2019s lawyers allege \u201cpolicies and measures adopted by the health secretary, NHS England and Public Health England have manifestly failed to protect the health, well-being and right to life of those residing and working in care homes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Gardner said she hoped her case would focus attention on decisions to order care homes to accept hospital discharges, the struggle to access enough personal protective equipment and a lack of comprehensive testing. She is <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/care-home-deaths/\">crowdfunding</a> for legal costs, which she estimates could reach \u00a360,000.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cBy the time the government said they were going to introduce testing [for hospital discharges on 15 April] people had already died.

      "bodyText": "Matt Hancock is facing legal action from the daughter of a man who died from Covid-19 in a care home in which the health secretary is accused of a \u201clitany of failures\u201d and misleading the public with his claim to have \u201cthrown a protective ring\u201d around care homes. Dr Cathy Gardner launched a high court claim on Friday after her father, Michael Gibson, a retired superintendent of births, marriages and deaths, died in an Oxfordshire care home in early April. He became infected after a patient who tested positive for the virus was discharged from hospital into the home. The request for a judicial review alleges failings \u201chave led to large numbers of unnecessary deaths and serious illnesses\u201d and have been \u201caggravated by the making of wholly disingenuous, misleading and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 plainly false statements suggesting that everything necessary has been done to protect care homes during the pandemic\u201d. The move comes amid growing anger among families of care home residents at policies they believe may have caused their loved ones to become infected. Several have raised complaints with hospitals and care homes about infection control, including the discharging of Covid-negative residents into homes with outbreaks. Thirty-five councils have also blamed virus spread on discharges with hospital patients sent to homes that did not have sufficient protective equipment and/or facilities to isolate infected residents. Other cases include a decision to discharge John Heywood, 83, from Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge into a Peterborough care facility with an outbreak. He contracted the virus and survived, but his family have lodged a formal complaint with Addenbrooke\u2019s. \u201cI was really upset and angry,\u201d said his daughter, Sarah Heywood. \u201cI called the [hospital] discharge planning team and they said there was no obligation to tell us if there\u2019s Covid in a home. I felt it was out of our control. It didn\u2019t make sense. How on earth could they do that?\u201d Addenbrooke\u2019s said it would launch a full investigation, but only after the Covid-19 crisis has passed. In a statement, Cambridge University hospitals medical director, Dr Ashley Shaw, said: \u201cOur discharge planning team take great care in ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of patients, and that the facility to which a patient is being discharged is able to support the patient\u2019s needs at that time.\u201d In another case, the family of Hughie Leyland, 90, believe he contracted the virus and died aged 90 at the Westwood Hall care home in Wirral after it accepted discharged hospital patients. \u201cYou don\u2019t put people from a hospital where they may have had the virus into a place with the most vulnerable people,\u201d said his daughter-in-law, Charlie Leyland. \u201cIf this was one mistake, that\u2019s one thing, but it has been happening all around.\u201d Leyland entered the home on 23 March, at a time when Department of Health guidance stated that \u201cnegative tests are not required prior to transfers/ admissions into the care home\u201d. It was not until 16 April that the government announced NHS patients being discharged into care homes would be first tested for Covid-19. Leyland died on 19 April. The home owner, Springcare Ltd, said: \u201cOur overall experience of the testing programme introduced by the government has been poor. Guidance on testing people prior to discharge from hospital \u2026 changed when the virus was most virulent and there was heightened media coverage on the rising number of cases in care homes of residents who were testing positive or symptomatic.\u201d The Care Quality Commission is also investigating claims that \u201ca patient\u2019s positive Covid-19 status was known to the hospital but not disclosed at the point of discharge\u201d \u2013 a potential breach of the Health and Social Care Act. More than 15,000 people have died from known or suspected Covid-19 in UK care homes. In the letter initiating her claim that Hancock, the secretary of state for health and social care, breached his legal duty, Gardner\u2019s lawyers allege \u201cpolicies and measures adopted by the health secretary, NHS England and Public Health England have manifestly failed to protect the health, well-being and right to life of those residing and working in care homes\u201d. Gardner said she hoped her case would focus attention on decisions to order care homes to accept hospital discharges, the struggle to access enough personal protective equipment and a lack of comprehensive testing. She is crowdfunding for legal costs, which she estimates could reach \u00a360,000. \u201cBy the time the government said they were going to introduce testing [for hospital discharges on 15 April] people had already died. My father died on 3 April. The time to protect the care homes was at the beginning. \u201cI want to hold them to account and this seems to be the best way of doing it. We are looking for an admission of wrongdoing and policies to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Her case alleges: The government breached its obligation \u201cto take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction\u201d and to do \u201call that could have been required of it to prevent \u2026 life from being avoidably put at risk\u201d as set out in the European convention on human rights. The government breached the National Health Service Act 2006 requiring it protect \u201cthe public in England from disease or other dangers to health\u201d and the Equalities Act \u2013 equal and fair treatment of individuals with protected characteristics of age and disability and also potentially race. It highlights the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s February guidance to care homes that it was \u201cvery unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected\u201d and the advice in March that \u201cnegative tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home\u201d. The case highlights the Public Health England guidance to care homes on 13 March that did not ban visits and instructions from NHS England on 17 March that \u201ccommunity health providers must take full responsibility for urgent discharge of all eligible patients identified by acute providers\u201d and health ministry guidance in April that \u201cnegative tests are not required prior to transfers/ admissions into the care home\u201d. It also demands to see the evidence behind Boris Johnson\u2019s statement on 13 May, that \u201cwe brought in the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown\u201d, and said Hancock and the other agencies \u201cformulated and applied a policy in respect of care homes that is different to the policy that they have publicly declared\u201d. Hancock has previously said that \u201cfrom the start, we have worked hard to protect those in social care\u201d. He told parliament last month: \u201cWe will not rest in doing whatever is humanly possible to protect our care homes from this appalling virus, to make sure that residents and care colleagues have the safety and security they deserve.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England said they could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.",

Moreover, he recognised he was not being employed for his discretion. It would be a disappointment \u2013 and a surprise \u2013 to his employers and the majority of his listeners to hear Geoffrey start a sentence with \u201cBut on the other hand \u2026\u201d.

Such is the level of trust in Klopp and the club\u2019s owners that this seems pretty reasonable.

His body was buried in a secret night-time ceremony, in an unmarked grave, without a plaque.

      "bodyText": "1. Geoffrey and me: four decades with Boycott, on and off the field \u2018As a broadcaster Boycott was ultra-reliable; he never missed his slot. Moreover, he recognised he was not being employed for his discretion. It would be a disappointment \u2013 and a surprise \u2013 to his employers and the majority of his listeners to hear Geoffrey start a sentence with \u201cBut on the other hand \u2026\u201d. One of his books is entitled The Corridor of Certainty.\u2019 2. Ex-Lesotho PM paid gang to murder his wife, police say \u2018Lesotho\u2019s former prime minister Thomas Thabane paid a team of hitmen from a notorious local gang a down payment of more than $20,000 to kill his estranged wife, according to police statements.\u2019 3. Liverpool need to rebuild but Werner may turn out to be a great non-signing \u2018At \u00a353m Werner was simply the right man in the wrong moment of total economic collapse. Such is the level of trust in Klopp and the club\u2019s owners that this seems pretty reasonable. Footballing lore insists that great teams always build from a position of strength: a line that tends to overlook the wider truth that, weak or strong, in football you always need to be building, that even the finest teams exist in a state of constant disintegration.\u2019 4. Fighting over statues obscures the real problem: Britain\u2019s delusion about its past \u2018There are not many countries as steeped in their own history as Britain appears to be, yet which are so ignorant about it. We look to history as a source of national self-justification rather than to learn. The potent idea that history might offer a warning rather than cause for self-congratulation \u2013 the idea that runs through the approach to history in modern Germany, for example \u2013 is nonexistent here. The net result is a void where a mature and modern relationship with Britain\u2019s history should be.\u2019 5. Tucker Carlson: advertisers desert Fox News host after he attacks protesters \u2018A series of major US corporations, including T-Mobile and Disney, have said they will no longer advertise on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show, after Carlson was accused of racism for attacking anti-racism protesters.\u2019 6. Trump complains about \u2018ugly anarchists\u2019 as police continue aggression on US protesters \u2018On Wednesday night, Trump, who has repeatedly raised the specter of an armed crushing of the roiling protests coast to coast, tweeted that the mayor of Seattle and governor of Washington state need to \u201ctake back your city NOW. If you don\u2019t do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped IMMEDIATELY.\u201d Trump followed this by tweeting, with no evidence, that Seattle had been taken over by \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d, abetted by Democrats.\u2019 7. Robert Clive was a vicious asset-stripper. His statue has no place on Whitehall \u2018When Robert Clive, who established British rule in India, died by his own hand in 1774, he was widely reviled as one of the most hated men in England. His body was buried in a secret night-time ceremony, in an unmarked grave, without a plaque. Clive left no suicide note, but Samuel Johnson reflected the widespread view as to his motives: Clive \u201chad acquired his fortune by such crimes that his consciousness of them impelled him to cut his own throat\u201d.\u2019 8. Canadian conservation officer fired for refusing to kill bear cubs wins legal battle \u2018Under the province\u2019s policy, Casavant shot and killed the mother, but decided not to harm the cubs, who residents told him hadn\u2019t been spotted eating food or garbage.\u2019 9. X marks the spot: treasure hunters in shock after reported $2m find in Rocky Mountains \u2018An eccentric New Mexico millionaire named Forrest Fenn said he hid the bronze chest in the Rockies in 2010. The only clues to the prize\u2019s whereabouts were located in a cryptic 24-line poem written by Fenn and added to the last pages of his autobiography, The Thrill of the Chase.\u2019 10. The Consequences of Love by Gavanndra Hodge review \u2013 a high achiever\u2019s dark truth \u2018The Consequences of Love is a courageous attempt at coming to an accommodation with loss. It\u2019s also an inspired, at times bleakly comic narrative about living in a family so spectacularly dysfunctional that it could have formed the basis of a book in its own right.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

Who decides if I am breaking the new laws? Generally, enforcement will be left up to the discretion of police officers. States have expressed different approaches, for example, the ACT says it will be issuing a warning in the first instance, while Victoria has adopted a more hardline attitude to those break social distancing rules. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said he would personally review all physical-distancing fines issued in the state. \u201cIf I think it\u2019s unreasonable, it will be withdrawn immediately and we\u2019ll make personal contact with the individual,\u201d he said. What are my options for challenging a fine? Not all states have specified this, however, it appears these fines can be appealed using the same process as other fines issued by police. Information on how to lodge an appeal should be available on your state or territory\u2019s government website. \u2022 Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

      "bodyText": "Due to the difference in reporting times between states, territories and the federal government, it can be difficult to get a current picture of how many confirmed cases of coronavirus there are in Australia. Here, we\u2019ve brought together all the figures in one place, along with comparisons with other countries. Guardian Australia has gone through every state and territory press release to construct and maintain an up-to-date database of coronavirus cases, as well as maintaining live data feeds from other groups collating data, such as Johns Hopkins University. This is necessary to get a broader picture of how Covid-19 is affecting Australians and to track the impact of government measures. National view This chart shows the \u201cepidemic curve\u201d for Australia with a timeline of measures introduced by the federal government. It aims to track our progress in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d, and the measures we have introduced to do so. According to experts, the growth in new coronavirus cases in Australia is slowing, likely due to the decrease in travel-related cases. However there is still a long way to go in controlling the spread of Covid-19, and particular attention needs to be paid to the rate of community transmission. The following chart shows the percent growth in cases, with a trend line based on a five-day average. Generally, we want both lines to be heading downwards towards zero: Here, you can see the cumulative total of confirmed cases, with the contribution of each state and territory: State and territory breakdowns Here is the daily count of confirmed cases \u2013 the epidemic curve \u2013 for each state and territory.

British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair say the rules, which came into effect on Monday and require passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate at a single address for 14 days, are flawed and will cost thousands of jobs. The airlines sent a letter to the government last week to start their legal challenge, and court proceedings are now in train. The airlines have requested a hearing as soon as possible. Despite reports of private briefings that \u201cair bridges\u201d allowing travel between the UK and some other European countries could be established by the end of the month, the three airlines say they have not yet seen any evidence of how and when they would be implemented. Instead, they are urging the government to revisit a policy briefly introduced in March that targeted passengers entering from \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries for quarantine. They said: \u201cThis would be the most practical and effective solution and enables civil servants to focus on other, more significant issues arising from the pandemic while bringing the UK in line with much of Europe which is opening its borders mid-June.\u201d The airlines\u2019 chief executives have been outspoken in their criticism of the rules.

In the legal filing, the airlines argue that the rules are more stringent than those applied to people who have Covid-19 and leave their home, that there was no consultation on the policy and no scientific evidence provided to support it, that exemptions for commuters undermine the policy, and that the government is seeking to ban travel to and from countries with lower infection rates than the UK.

      "bodyText": "The Japanese, Singapore and Azerbaijan grands prix will not take place this year, Formula One has announced. All three meetings were under consideration to be part of the season\u2019s flyaway rounds when the sport leaves Europe. F1 remains confident, however, that it will still be able to host between 15 and 18 races this year. The sport made the announcement that the meetings would not form part of the new calendar on Friday morning. F1 intends to publish its full, revised race schedule for 2020 before the Austrian Grand Prix opens the season on 5 July. F1 issued a statement explaining that the restrictions of the coronavirus outbreak had made the meetings untenable. \u201cThese decisions have been taken due to the different challenges our promoters face in those countries,\u201d read the statement. \u201cIn Singapore and Azerbaijan the long lead times required to construct street circuits made hosting the events during a period of uncertainty impossible and in Japan, ongoing travel restrictions also led to the decision not to proceed with the race.\u201d Formula One\u2019s sporting director, Ross Brawn, said he believed the sport would still deliver a strong calendar. \u201cWe have lots of different options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident we\u2019re going to have a great second half of the season, but there is no point making the statement yet as there are still some moving parts we need to put together.\u201d The Baku grand prix had originally been scheduled for 14 June, but was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Singapore had been set for 20 September with Japan due to take place on 11 October. There is understood to be considerable interest from new venues in hosting meetings. F1 currently has eight races set to take place in Europe. Bahrain and Abu Dhabi are due to close out the calendar and Bahrain may host two races, using one of its alternative configurations. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice sort of almost oval track that would be quite exciting, and all the layouts have a grade one licence with the FIA, so that is an option,\u201d said Brawn. The remaining flyaway meetings in the mix to make up the schedule from the current calendar include Canada, Russia, China, USA, Mexico, Brazil and Vietnam. F1 is also discussing further races in Europe. \u201cThere are a number of good European tracks where we could add another one or two races on to make sure we have a comprehensive season,\u201d said Brawn. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to declare it yet, as it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d The Mugello circuit in Italy is reportedly in the frame to host a race, with MotoGP having recently withdrawn its meeting set to be held there. The track is owned by Ferrari who use it for testing and it holds a grade one FIA license.

The Milan president, Paolo Scaroni, argued that \u201chaving two such high-adrenaline matches after a three-month pause is a risk for the players\u201d. Rumours circulated briefly that Inter might field their youth team in protest.</p> <p>No doubt there will be further such disagreements as football picks its way through the complicated weeks ahead. For the football-starved viewer, though, the prospect is mouth-watering. <em>Buon appetito, ragazzi</em>. Here\u2019s hoping that time away has not caused the dishes to spoil.</p>",

With their game against Sampdoria also being postponed prior to the pause, they now find themselves nine points adrift of the leaders \u2013 albeit with a game in hand. As with so many other decisions relating to football\u2019s return, the decision to jump straight back in with such pivotal fixtures was not universally appreciated. The Milan president, Paolo Scaroni, argued that \u201chaving two such high-adrenaline matches after a three-month pause is a risk for the players\u201d. Rumours circulated briefly that Inter might field their youth team in protest. No doubt there will be further such disagreements as football picks its way through the complicated weeks ahead. For the football-starved viewer, though, the prospect is mouth-watering. Buon appetito, ragazzi. Here\u2019s hoping that time away has not caused the dishes to spoil.",

It was also steeper than the 1% decline in September 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis \u2013 an economic collapse that played out over a much longer timespan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c200f0d-cdb0-408d-a119-9c973cced423\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>One of the two main definitions of recession in the UK is at least two quarters of negative economic growth. Judged by this&nbsp;yardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were&nbsp;six consecutive quarters of negative growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some economists believe this definition of recession is flawed, since an economy would not be in recession if it contracted by 5% in the first quarter, expanded by 0.1% in each of the following two quarters and then contracted again by 5% in the fourth quarter. It would, however, be deemed to be in recession if it grew by 5% in each of the first and fourth quarters but contracted by 0.1% in each of the second and third quarters.</p>\n    <p>An alternative \u2013 and tougher definition \u2013 is a full calendar year of negative output. Given the UK economy has grown on average by 2.5% over many decades, it is rare for gross domestic product (GDP) to fall on an annual basis. There have been only five such years since the end of the second world war: 1974, 1975, 1980, 1981 and 1991.</p>\n    <p>The United States has its own method of assessing recession, with the National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle-dating committee making a judgment.</p>\n    <p>The NBER defines recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Given the rapid onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank of England has estimated GDP could contract by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\">25% in the second quarter</a> and unemployment more than double, triggering what it expects to be the deepest recession for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/what-caused-the-economic-slump-of-1706-\">more than 300 years</a>. GDP fell by 2% in the first quarter, with April\u2019s figure setting off the second quarter on a steep downward trajectory. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of falling GDP.</p> \n<p>Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said he stood ready to take further action to support jobs and growth if necessary, although added that there were \u201csigns of the economy now beginning to come back to life\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking to broadcasters, he said: \u201cSo we stand ready to take action.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy shrank by a record 20.4% in April as the first full month of the coronavirus lockdown set the country on course for the worst recession in more than three centuries. The official figures for gross domestic product (GDP) from the Office for National Statistics showed no area of the economy was left unscathed after the government imposed tight controls on business and social life to limit the spread of the disease. Boris Johnson said he was in no doubt that the British economy would suffer a very serious economic impact as a consequence of Covid-19, but that Britain could \u201cbounce back\u201d from the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work slowly to get the economy back on its feet,\u201d he told broadcasters on Friday, saying that the government would outline plans in the coming weeks to boost jobs and growth. \u201cSlowly confidence will return and you will see a bounce back for the UK.\u201d The collapse of growth in the economy in April, compared with the previous month, was the biggest since monthly records began in 1997, and was more than triple the previous record fall of 5.8% in March \u2013 when the lockdown was first announced. The fall was almost 10 times greater than the pre-Covid record monthly decline of 2.2% in June 2002, when an extra bank holiday for the Queen\u2019s Golden Jubilee caused a sharp temporary loss in output that was quickly reversed. It was also steeper than the 1% decline in September 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis \u2013 an economic collapse that played out over a much longer timespan. Given the rapid onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank of England has estimated GDP could contract by 25% in the second quarter and unemployment more than double, triggering what it expects to be the deepest recession for more than 300 years. GDP fell by 2% in the first quarter, with April\u2019s figure setting off the second quarter on a steep downward trajectory. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said he stood ready to take further action to support jobs and growth if necessary, although added that there were \u201csigns of the economy now beginning to come back to life\u201d. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: \u201cSo we stand ready to take action. We\u2019ve already taken very big action, and that\u2019s still going on I should say. And we have to be ready for that because we are still very much in the midst of this.\u201d The ONS said the monthly decline in April broke records across the board with all the main drivers of economic growth plunging into reverse, as people were told to stay at home to save lives, businesses were forced to close and millions of workers placed on furlough. A total of 8.9 million temporarily laid-off employees now have 80% of their wages paid for by the state under the furlough scheme. The country\u2019s dominant services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the economy, shrank by almost a fifth, fuelled by the closure of non-essential shops on the high street and evaporating car sales. Air transport shrank by 92.8%, in the biggest fall of any sector, as flights were grounded across Britain and other countries. After the closure of hotels, pubs, bars and restaurants, the accommodation and food services sector shrank by 88% on the month. Faced with disruption to international supply chains and the need to protect workers, shutdowns in production at many factories and reduced hours at others led manufacturing output to fall by a quarter. The ONS said a 20.3% decline in production \u2013 which includes factory output as well as energy and mining \u2013 was more than double the collapse recorded during the miners\u2019 strikes and Winter of Discontent of the 1970s, in the biggest slump since records began in 1968. With cranes and diggers across the country falling idle as the virus spread, construction output plunged by 40%. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: \u201cApril\u2019s fall in GDP is the biggest the UK has ever seen, more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall.\u201d Although some lockdown measures are now being eased, the snapshot from the ONS showed Britain\u2019s economy at the onset of the deepest recession in living memory. Over the wider three-month period to the end of April, GDP fell by 10.4%, as government restrictions on movement dramatically reduced economic activity. This was the sharpest decline on records dating back to 1955, in a collapse surpassing the industrial strife of the 1970s, recessions of the 80s and 90s, and the 2008 financial crisis. Alongside the domestic hit to activity, the ONS said the UK\u2019s trade with the rest of the world was also badly affected by the pandemic. There were large falls in the import and export of cars, fuels, works of art and clothing. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said the government had protected millions of jobs through its emergency financial support schemes. Saying that the hit to GDP was in line with downturns in other countries amid the global health emergency, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve set out our plan to gradually and safely reopen the economy. Next week, more shops on the high street will be able to open again as we start to get our lives a little bit more back to normal.\u201d This week the OECD said the UK economy would shrink by more than any other developed country as businesses struggled to recover from the pandemic. It predicted GDP would contract by 11.5% in 2020 or 14% if the virus returned and forced the government into a second lockdown. Economists said April should mark the nadir of the downturn as lockdown measures are gradually rolled back. They warned, however, that a fresh rise in Covid-19 infections after the reopening of businesses could lead to the reimposition of tough controls and further economic damage. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said any prospect of a rapid \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery remained unlikely, with many sectors continuing to operate at reduced capacity. \u201cSome firms, including those in our hospitality, leisure and tourism industries, may remain closed for some time and will require flexible and open-ended government support to weather the economic storm,\u201d he said.",

An earlier experiment using artificial grass at the base of 150 bins was a partial success, reducing the dumping of rubbish in the immediate vicinity by around half, but the plastic turf soon became tatty. Rick Vermin, a council official, said it was hoped that the presence of foliage and flowers would act as a \u201ckind of moral appeal\u201d to potential litterers and give a lift to the appearance of Amsterdam\u2019s streets. The main concern for council officials conducting the trail is whether the gardens prove to be an obstacle to teams collecting the rubbish. The problem of litter around public bins has come to the fore during the lockdown as people working from home have ordered more takeaways, increasing the amount of bulky waste. Residents were also found to be fearful of touching the bins due to the coronavirus, and there was a higher level of absenteeism among rubbish collectors, meaning street bins were often left full. The street bins in Amsterdam are used both for general litter and by residents for their rubbish bags.

Any significant corrections made to this or previous versions of the article will continue to be footnoted in line with Guardian editorial policy.",

Here are today\u2019s key events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it.

Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme. They opposed the first home loan deposit scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

      "bodyText": "With the Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney winding down, we\u2019re going to wrap the blog up for the evening. Here are today\u2019s key events: The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply. Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia. South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July. Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive. Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence. Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery. NSW postponed local government elections until 2021. Thank you for joining us. Enjoy your weekend. We will be back here tomorrow. A small queue of protesters are slowly walking to Central station, chanting all the way. Still no arrests, and police are just shepherding the crowd as it walks. Organisers are encouraging them to avoid Central Station. Only about 20 people end up going into Central, where police pepper sprayed protesters last Saturday. Everybody else leaves. It truly seems to be over now. Despite the main crowd of protesters dispersing in Hyde Park, there are still small marches and protests throughout the city. At Town Hall a few minutes ago, a large crowd formed, and were given a move on order by police. After police threatened to arrest them, protesters moved on. But a march is still winding its way down to Central station, where police pepper sprayed people last Saturday. Still no arrests have been made, and police are just shepherding they crowd as it walks, and blocking off traffic. It\u2019s hard to estimate numbers, but I can see fewer than 100 people in front of me. The ABC is reporting the WA government will rename the King Leopold Ranges in the state\u2019s Kimberley region. The King Leopold Ranges are named after the former king of Belgium - King Leopold II - whose atrocities and violent reign of the Congo Free State led to up to 10 million deaths. He has no connection to WA and never visited. The WA Land Minister Ben Wyatt told the ABC King Leopold II was an evil tyrant who had should not be honoured in WA. The second the protest reaches the Captain Cook statue in Hyde Park, it ends. Police are standing at the sides of the crowd, doing nothing, when organisers begin shouting, \u201cIts over. Go home\u201d. The crowd filters through Hyde Park as organisers shout \u201cdisperse\u201d. \u201cEveryone get your friends together and go home. There\u2019s no fight to win here but an arrest.\u201d In five minutes, there\u2019s nobody near the statue but media. But protesters are still slowly making their way out of the park back down Park St in the city, as police follow. They have started shouting at people to go home as well. 10 minutes later, the park is empty. No arrests were made, as far as I can see. The protest has now moved to Hyde Park where there are between 200 and 300 people. At 6.30 there were only about 20 people outside Town Hall who weren\u2019t media. Mounted police are also in the park. It\u2019s 10 minutes before another Sydney Black Lives Matter protest is scheduled to start, and NSW police are out in force at Town Hall. A line of police officers have put up barriers around the town hall but media, observers and bystanders are milling around, and nobody has been moved on or arrested as far as I have seen. There are about 100 officers around Town Hall. NSW Health has confirmed that a suspected case of coronavirus that closed Rose Bay public school in Sydney today was positive. The department says an expert panel reviewed the test results and concluded it was a case of Covid-19. But the date of the infection is still unclear. \u201cThis case may be an older infection. The source of infection is also being investigated,\u201d NSW Health said. It is identifying close contacts and telling them to isolate. \u201cIt should be noted that the case interview has determined this person did not attend any recent mass gathering, including protests,\u201d the department said. People held in prisons in Western Australia will be allowed face-to-face visits again \u201cwithin a few weeks\u201d, the state corrective services minister, Francis Logan, has said. Inmates have been denied face-to-face visits since late March to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and were instead given free telephone calls, extra mail privileges, and in some cases access to video calls. Prisons are potential hotbeds for the virus \u2013 a global report said it was potentially a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d in overcrowded facilities. Thalia Anthony, an Australian academic, called it a \u201cticking time-bomb\u201d. Logan said prisoners will still have to comply with physical distancing rules during visits, so no hugging. Inmates will still be able to access video-conferencing kiosks. Logan said: \u201dStopping social visits was not an easy task and came with its own risks to the good order of a prison or custodial facility. \u201cBut it is to the credit of the department and each custodial facility that they worked cooperatively, including with prisoners, to put in place measures that almost completely eliminated the threat of the virus taking hold inside.\u201d My colleague Melissa Davey has another update on the Surgisphere scandal. Some of the world\u2019s leading medical journals are reviewing their processes after they were forced to retract studies based on flawed data. This follows a Guardian investigation revealing serious flaws in the database behind studies that were published by the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet. You can read more about the latest developments here: The parliament sitting is starting to wind down now, so I will hand you over to Lisa Cox. She\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the Sydney protest for you, so make sure you watch out for that. Thanks to everyone who joined me this week. I\u2019ll be back on Monday when the sitting resumes for the last week before the winter break. Have a wonderful weekend and take care of you. From AAP: The Indigenous Australians minister, Ken Wyatt, has conceded a referendum on recognising Indigenous people in the constitution is unlikely in this term of parliament. Wyatt said the Morrison government remained committed to a referendum. \u201cWe have always said this would be done when consensus was built and it has the best chance of success. It is unlikely this will happen in this term of parliament,\u201d he said. An Indigenous voice to government will be pursued before a referendum. \u201cConstitutional recognition is too important to rush and too important to fail. We will not be placing a timeline on this process,\u201d he said. Wyatt had pushed for a referendum in this term of parliament, which is due to expire in 2022, but Scott Morrison had rejected the timetable. National federation reform: Following on from national cabinet\u2019s agreement to continue as the ongoing forum for first ministers, to form the national federation reform council (NFRC) and to cease the council of Australian governments (Coag), national cabinet today had further discussions regarding the architecture to fundamentally transform federal relations and achieve policy outcomes in areas of shared interest to create jobs and to improve the lives of all Australians. National cabinet has announced six initial priority areas of reform, and the formation of six reform committees: Rural and regional Australia Skills Energy Infrastructure and transport Population and migration Health These committees will be driven by leaders of national cabinet and tasked to progress a rapid jobs agenda. Deregulation will be taken forward by the council of federal financial relations (CFFR) as a matter of priority. National cabinet held further discussions regarding the role of the CFFR, which is led by the commonwealth treasurer and made up of treasurers of states and territories. The CFFR has a central role in the new system, supporting the work of national cabinet as it focuses on job creation. Specifically, national cabinet has tasked CFFR to progress targeted reforms in areas such as tax, deregulation and housing. CFFR will report to national cabinet on findings and recommendations of these commissioned reform projects, with input from expert advisory groups. Further information on reform projects to be undertaken by the CFFR will be provided shortly. The CFFR will also take on responsibility for coordination of all commonwealth/state funding agreements, including national partnership agreements. National cabinet has asked that CFFR commence a review of existing agreements with a view to consolidation and rationalisation. This includes identifying agreements that could be ceased in order to streamline responsibilities and to reduce duplication and overlap. CFFR will provide national cabinet with an update on its progress and a plan for implementation by the end of August. As new commonwealth/state national partnership agreements are developed, it will be CFFR\u2019s responsibility to negotiate funding elements, in consultation with relevant portfolio ministers. National cabinet agreed to work closely and carefully to return international students on a small, phased scale through a series of controlled pilots. This planning process will take time and require well thought through plans from state and territory governments. Preconditions will include the reopening of internal state and territory borders, as well as the return to on-campus learning for the benefit of domestic students and the international students who are already in Australia. Closing the Gap Today national cabinet reaffirmed its commitment to improving the lives of Indigenous Australians so this generation and the next can have the same expectations and opportunities as all Australians. We are doing this in partnership with Indigenous Australians for the first time, working together to decide how policies and targets are developed and delivered. National cabinet was provided with an update on the new Closing the Gap national agreement, and set of targets, that will empower Indigenous Australians to transform their lives. The new national agreement will set ambitious, yet achievable targets for all governments and will ensure that there is shared accountability and shared responsibility to achieve those targets. The agreement is very close to final as the draft is now with states and territories for consideration before the joint council in July. Our aim is to have the agreement signed by the end of July. Outdoor events including stadiums For outdoor venues up to 40,000 spectator capacity, ticketed and seated events will be able to be held in front of a crowd of no more than 25% of capacity under step 3. States and territories will make decisions on when to move to step 3 under CovidSafe plans. At a minimum, CovidSafe arrangements must be maintained including: \u00b7 1 person per 4sqm; \u00b7 staying 1.5 metres away from other people whenever and wherever possible; \u00b7 maintaining good hand washing and cough/sneeze hygiene; \u00b7 staying home when unwell, and getting tested if you have respiratory symptoms or a fever; and \u00b7 downloading the CovidSafe app to allow identification and traceability of people that have been in contact with a confirmed Covid case. For outdoor venues of more than 40,000 spectator capacity, further advice is being sought from the AHPPC, with arrangements to be settled by the states and territories on a venue by venue basis. National cabinet reiterated that high-risk outdoor events without ticketed seating such as music festivals do not form part of step 3 and will be considered following further advice from medical experts. Indoor gatherings National cabinet agreed to remove the 100-person limit on non-essential indoor gatherings under step 3 and replace it with: \u00b7 1 person per 4sqm; \u00b7 staying 1.5 metres away from other people whenever and wherever possible; \u00b7 maintaining good hand washing and cough/sneeze hygiene; \u00b7 staying home when unwell, and getting tested if you have respiratory symptoms or a fever; \u00b7 downloading the CovidSafe app to allow identification and traceability of people that have been in contact with a confirmed Covid case; and \u00b7 developing CovidSafe plans for workplaces and premises. States and territories will determine when to implement these changes under step 3. National cabinet requested further advice from the AHPPC on the one person per 4 sqm density rule and application for small premises. National cabinet reiterated that it is vital for our society and our economy that we can live with this virus, and keep ourselves and others safe. We cannot risk a second wave and having to step backwards, especially now that we are making such good progress. National cabinet reiterated that high-risk venues such as nightclubs do not form part of step 3 and will be considered following further advice from medical experts. The official national cabinet statement is out: National cabinet will meet again on 26 June. Statement on risks of Covid and attending mass gathering protests: National cabinet reiterated the AHPPC advice that protests are very high risk due to the large numbers of people closely gathering and challenges in identifying all contacts. AHPPC again urges the Australian community to not participate in mass gatherings. Progress on restrictions National cabinet reconfirmed the commitment to the three-step framework for a Covid-safe Australia to be completed in July. All states are now in step 2 or 3, the number of new cases has remained low, and localised outbreaks have been responded to effectively. Active case numbers continue to drop, community transmission remains low, and we are starting to see days with no new cases in most parts of the country. This progress needs to be maintained in order to make further economic and social gains \u2013 by living and working in Covid-safe ways as restrictions continue to ease. National cabinet agreed to further changes based on AHPPC advice to enable extended removal of restrictions under step 3 for indoor gathering density rules and reopening ticketed and seated outdoor events, including in stadiums. Question time, as seen by Mike Bowers: Mood of the country: Paul Fletcher mastering the prefect pose: Angus Taylor being Angus Taylor: Universities Australia is happy with the pilot international student program: Universities Australia has welcomed the prime minister\u2019s announcement of a pilot program, beginning as early as next month, aimed at enabling international students to return to Australia. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, today confirmed plans were being considered for the safe return of international students \u201cin a very controlled setting\u201d. Universities Australia\u2019s chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said the safety and welfare of the community was paramount. \u201cIt is important that our hard-won success in limiting the spread of Covid-19 isn\u2019t jeopardised,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why a trial for the safe return of students is a sensible approach. \u201cUniversities Australia has been talking to the federal government about an overarching framework for a safe return for some time. It is good to see progress today with specific pilot proposals under consideration. \u201cThe gradual reintroduction of international students into Australia requires careful planning with coordination between universities, governments across jurisdictions, health authorities and other key stakeholders. \u201cAny trial will rigorously test the controlled entry of international students and will include robust quarantine arrangements put in place by state and territory governments.\u201d Scott Morrison finishes his dixer with a plea for protesters not to go to any events this weekend: \u201cWe have made great, great progress, but the challenge ahead is even greater, so the decisions we make now are about the next five years and the five years of changes we make will set up the next 30 years of prosperity. And we cannot put it at risk. And that\u2019s why I ask those, this weekend, who are contemplating engaging in a mass rally, don\u2019t do it. Follow the health advice. Don\u2019t attend. \u201cDo the right thing by your fellow Australians. Protect the lives and the livelihoods, protect the businesses. \u201cNow is a time not to talk about what people want to tear down, but what we are going to build up, Mr Speaker, together. And, Mr Speaker, I would urge those who are considering this, I say it in total respect for the issues they wish to raise, please find another way to do it and do it with the support of your fellow Australians. He then asks if Anthony Albanese wants to add to his answer on indulgence: \u201cDid you want to support that otherwise I was going to say further questions will be placed on notice. I ask that further questions be placed on the notice. I thought you were going to speak on indulgence, if not I apologise.\u201d Albanese gets up: I am quite happy to take up the prime minister\u2019s invitation. How long would you like me to have, prime minister? I certainly have, consistently, Mr Speaker, as the prime minister knows full well, say that people should follow the medical advice and should not participate in gatherings that are against medical advice. He goes to ask another question, but question time has ended. Jason Falinski, who has deleted his previous cryptic tweet about leadership, gets a dixer. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Has the government modelled how many Australians will have to join the unemployment queues when the job giveaway subsidy is suddenly withdrawn under the prime minister\u2019s hard snap back in September? Frydenberg: Well, Mr Speaker, as the secretary of the Treasury said ... recently, he expects unemployment in the September quarter to reach about 8%. Now, Mr Speaker, we know people are doing it tough at the moment. We have gone through a 1-in-100-year event. But we also know that we are starting to see confidence pick up across the Australian economy, and Mr Speaker, we have seen consumer confidence pick up around 90% and business confidence pick up from around 70%. So Treasury, in relation to the question that was asked by the member for Rankin, will continue to assess the economic situation and we are undertaking a review into jobkeeper, Mr Speaker, and we will make decisions about the future of that program and we will announce those decisions on the 23 July. Mr Speaker, I\u2019ll tell you what helps create jobs, its lower taxes, Mr Speaker ... After the second point of order on relevance (one premature) we get this: Treasury and the government continue to assess the situation, decisions will be taken about the future of the jobkeeper program and announcements will be made in an orderly fashion. Alicia Payne to Scott Morrison: I refer to reports today that Coalition MPs, including the member for Leichhardt, want JobSeeker extended beyond September. But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? Morrison: From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker. And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? Josh Frydenberg gets the nod: Thank you. I thank the member for Rankin for the question. I too, enjoyed that profile piece in the Weekend Australian on the leadership credentials, but maybe not as much as the leader of the opposition. Now, the reality is \u2013 as the honourable member knows \u2013 the Reserve Bank governor said that it is actually too early to tell what the state of the economy will be in a number of months. But what he did say is that the economic support that the government has been providing has been very, very substantial Mr Speaker, and making a real difference in helping to keep people connected to their employer, and staying in a job. Now, we\u2019ve announced that we will be doing a review. A review over the course of this month and the outcomes of that review into the jobkeeper program, and the assembly of the data will inform decisions that the government will take about the future of that program. And any announcements around the future of that program will be made on 23 July when the finance minister and I provide an economic and fiscal update. But Mr Speaker, the jobkeeper program has been saving lives and protecting livelihoods. It is helping millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of businesses right across the country. But, Mr Speaker, what I do know is that at a time of need, because the economy was in a position of economic strength, because we had balanced the budget, because we had provided substantial tax cuts and got people off welfare into work, we were in a position to support the Australian economy with some $260bn, or over 13% of GDP, which is massive macroeconomic support in the words of the OECD and has seen Australia perform remarkably well on not just the health front, but on the economic front as well. Anthony Albanese asks Scott Morrison about the VC for Tasmanian Teddy Sheean, again, and Morrison is NOT impressed: Albanese: the prime minister has received a recommendation from the defence honours and awards appeals tribunal that Tasmania\u2019s Teddy Sheean be awarded a Victoria Cross for \u201cthe most conspicuous act of valour in the presence of an enemy\u201d. Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? Morrison: there is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time. Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy Christian Porter says it is a public document, so no. (He was pretty snippy.) Speaking of awkward, Angus Taylor just took a dixer. So that is a bit awkward, then. Scott Morrison: I don\u2019t agree with the comments, because Mr Speaker, what Australia has done over these many months in which we have been combating the Covid-19 global pandemic is, we have been conscious right from the start of the need to address both the health challenge and the economic challenge. Now they\u2019re extreme views in this debate. There are more extreme views which said that there was nothing going on here, Mr Speaker. And there are others who said that more extreme action should be taken in terms of measures. Now it\u2019s a free country, Mr Speaker, and we support people who can express whatever views they wish on these matters. This is not something that I am seeking to express any judgment against the individual that has been referred to in the question in any way, shape or form. I just happen to have a different point of view. And a point of view that has been informed by the government\u2019s actions. We took early and strong and important actions that have both protected lives and protected livelihoods. And Australia stands out around the world as being the leader, both on the economic response, as is demonstrated by the OECD figures, and on the health response which has been demonstrated by the much lower death rate in Australia. When it is a hundred times more in countries that are overseas. Had we not taken the decision to take action on health, when they would not be in the position today to address the economic opportunities as we come out of this crisis. We are well ahead of where we\u2019d hoped to be, and there are different experiences in different countries. The treasurer just made mention. In New Zealand, they went to a full lockdown. A full lockdown, and their expected position this year on their economy is down 8.9%. Now, we didn\u2019t go to that extreme and we\u2019re looking at a 5% reduction. Every country will make their choices. We\u2019ve made the right choices. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister agree with the Australian\u2019s economics editor, Adam Creighton, who says: \u2018The government\u2019s response to Covid-19 was an act of hysteria because the virus has only led to the quite unwell elderly people.\u2019 If not, why is the minister for energy cohosting a board room dinner with him to raise money for the Liberal party\u2019s Eden-Monaro campaign?\u201d Christian Porter says it is not for the prime minister to talk about party fundraising \u2013 that is a matter for the party executive. Tony Smith rules the first part in order and the second out of order. Jason Clare to Josh Frydenberg: Yesterday the treasurer used the $1bn national housing infrastructure facility as evidence that this government was supporting the community housing sector. Given Treasury has revealed a short time ago that $999,800,000 of this still has not been spent, isn\u2019t this just another example that the government is leaving Australians behind? Frydenberg: Mr Speaker, as I said to the House yesterday, this is a $1bn program that was established by the former treasurer and now prime minister, which is out there providing support on top of our other social housing initiatives which announced yesterday, including in the Hobart City deal, providing support for those in the community who need that community housing. Barnaby Joyce manages to joke out a dixer to \u201cthe deputy prime minister of the commonwealth of Australia and minister for infrastructure, transport and rRegional development\u201d. He\u2019s reminded by the Speaker that he can only summon one deputy prime minister. Tip Top takes to the despatch. Related: the collective noun for a group of Nationals is a \u201cwhinge\u201d. Jason Clare to Michael Sukkar: In question time on Tuesday when the minister quoted the publication Domain, had he already read these Domain stories. \u201cHome builder could be the most equitable construction job.\u201d And \u201cHome builder, how $688m could be better spent to stimulate the economy.\u201d If this is what our real estate thinks of the scheme, isn\u2019t it time to rename it \u201chome blunder?\u201d Sukkar: Thank you very much. The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister. The shadow minister, and indeed, the shadow treasurer on the day that they came out to criticise this policy said, \u201cThe Master Builders Association have criticised this policy.\u201d So relying on the Master Builders Association, which was a surprise to the treasurer and the prime minister and I, because the head of the Master Builders Association was with us when we announced this policy. And indeed, I quote, said the following: \u2018Master Builders Australia believes that the federal government\u2019s announcement of the homebuilder scheme today will be a massive relief to the thousands of home builders and tradies around the country.\u201d Are you listening, shadow minister? Again, \u2018Homebuilder will be a lifeline for an industry facing a valley of death in the coming months. It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. \u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme. They opposed the first home loan deposit scheme. Now oppose homebuilder. The Coalition is the party of residential construction jobs in this country. Ken Wyatt just took a dixer on Indigenous Australians, which is worth noting: Around a cabinet table when we were discussing some matters, the prime minister made it very clear that the minister for Indigenous Australians wasn\u2019t the only minister responsible. That all of us around that cabinet table had to engage with Indigenous Australians in a very different way. The member for Solomon, the partnerships that we\u2019ve got with Indigenous Australians means that they own both the solutions and the way in which we will implement. Because for too long we have done things to Indigenous Australians. It doesn\u2019t matter what the program is \u2013 we\u2019ve defined it and said you will operate within this parameter. On cultural matters, negotiations have occurred with the minister for the environment on some of the key directions we\u2019re thinking about and the way in which we can protect our cultural heritage. And that work is continuing with a genuine desire to have the Indigenous leadership involved in telling us what it is that is needed. That will change the way in which we will achieve outcomes in this nation that we\u2019ve not achieved thus far. Because any of us when we negotiate with local governments or state governments, we negotiate every point thoroughly. We\u2019re now doing that with Indigenous Australians. And both the partnership agreement and the Covid experience has shown us that when you give people the opportunity to determine their own direction, they will take that responsibility, stand up and meet the challenge. Ahhhh, seems there are exemptions to the \u201cstatesman\u201d voice. Kate Thwaites to Scott Morrison: I refer to the prime minister\u2019s comments about the homebuilder scheme. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been putting off that home renovation or new build, the extra $25,000 we\u2019re putting on the table means now the time to get started.\u201d How many Australians who have been putting off renovating their kitchens or bathrooms will get a cent from this scheme? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations. That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000. And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things. One: they never learned the mistakes of their failed schemes when they were in government. And, Mr Speaker, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the suburban families of this country. We are back to sombre and soothing voices from government MPs today. Seems they think they have overdone the political attacks in the past few days and need a return to \u201cstatesman\u201d voice. Susan Templeman to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: 41 homes were lost in my electorate during last summer\u2019s bushfires. People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? Morrison: Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis. Rebuilding communities, rebuilding homes and jobs and rebuilding our economy. Anthony Albanese to Paul Fletcher: Why is the government supporting a decreasing of Australia Post services? Fletcher: You know that there\u2019s a byelection on when Labor turns to the old scare campaign, and the scare campaign that they\u2019re going on this time is about Australia Post and delivery times. The facts are, Mr Speaker, the facts are very clear \u2013 the facts are very clear that Australia Post has seen a sharp increase in the percentage of parcels being delivered. A sharp increase in the number of parcels being delivered, and a sharp decrease in the number of letters that are being delivered. And that is why we have provided temporary fixed term regulatory relief to Australia Post so that it is able to redeploy posties from the area of the business where activity is going down to the area of the business where there is growth so as to secure ... for the employment of posties and to provide Australians with the service that they expect. During the Covid-19 pandemic, what we have seen is a dramatic increase in the number of parcels being delivered because Australians are ordering ... Australia Post is by far and away the market leader in delivering parcels, and to be able to meet the needs of Australians to have parcels delivered, Australia Post has come to the government and proposed this short-term regulatory relief. And look, that is what we\u2019ve agreed to. Now, I hear the leader of the opposition say that they couldn\u2019t employ more. They are employing more \u2013 600 more for parcels. This is really another case of a typical Labor byelection scare campaign. The facts are not substantiated by their claims. We have a leader of the opposition who is under pressure. Who is under pressure from the member for Rankin. The answer continues, but it has already been A DAY. Question time is about to begin. Hold on tight. Quick fact check on Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cwhat you\u2019re watching on TV won\u2019t create one job\u201d line: TV broadcasting in Australia employs more than 17,000 people. So some jobs then. Whingeing about statues and content being temporarily removed from streaming services also appears to be some people\u2019s job at the moment, so I guess that needs a caveat too. And now Steven Marshall has set a date for reopening the borders: 20 July. Queensland is aiming for 10 July. South Australian premier Steven Marshall says the state will be bringing forward its stage three restrictions easing from July to 29 June. Stage three means you\u2019ll be able to have the four square metre rule will be in place South Australia has no new cases of Covid-19. The press conference ends with this question from Paul Karp: Karp: prof Murphy, what social distancing should apply at airports and on flights? Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn Alan Tudge and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra? Murphy: social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask. I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight. But as you say, there are special requirement force flights, and they are not a very high risk environment. Scott Morrison: I\u2019m going to have to call it off there, but I do note that I think on every press conference, except in this room, that I\u2019ve had to warn the media that weren\u2019t practising social distancing. Thank you very much. Ahhh, no glass jaws here. On whether \u201cblackbirding\u201d would be considered slavery (it was) and what needs to be done with Indigenous policies, Scott Morrison says: Well on the first point, I acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place. And so I\u2019m not denying any of that. OK. I\u2019m not denying any of that. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to go into an endless history war discussion about this. It\u2019s all recorded. I acknowledge all of that. OK. The challenges of Indigenous incarceration go across so many different areas of public policy. Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous. And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse. It\u2019s heartbreaking. But it\u2019s true. You want to have an honest discussion about what\u2019s happening in communities, you can\u2019t ignore those for either and its chronic. And it is enough to bring any Australian to their knees in tears. And so this is a complex issue. There is no shortage of funds being thrown at this issue. But clearly the application of funds by governments over decades and decades and decades is not getting the results we want. I can assure you it\u2019s not through a lack of will, it\u2019s an admission of the complexity and the difficulty of the task. I think Scott Morrison is talking to his own side of politics and supporters in the media with these comments. Because they seem to be the only ones talking about it. On statues and shows being removed from streaming services, Morrison says: I\u2019m worried about jobs. I\u2019m worried about 800,000 Australians going on to jobseeker in the last three months. I\u2019m not interested in what they\u2019re showing on streaming services. I\u2019m interested in getting Australians back to work. I\u2019m not interested in the debate on what people want to tear down. I\u2019m interested in what people want to build up, and what we want to build back up are businesses and jobs and we need to restore livelihoods and lives. Honestly people \u2013 let\u2019s focus on what\u2019s really happening. 800,000 extra people are on jobseeker in the last few months. You want to know where my focus is? On them! And the businesses that have closed and the livelihoods that have been destroyed. What you\u2019re watching on television is your business. Not going to create one job. Let\u2019s focus on where Australians are hurting today. And they really are hurting. And I will not be distracted. Scott Morrison is walking back his \u201cno slavery in Australia\u201d comments, but he doesn\u2019t want to get into the \u201chistory wars\u201d: The comments I was referring to was how the New South Wales settlement was first established and the views that were communicated at the time, informing the NSW colony. If you go back to people like William Wilberforce and others, they were very involved in that First Fleet expedition and one of the principles was to be that Australia or in that case, NSW, was not to have lawful slavery. And that was indeed the case. There was not the laws that have ever proved to slavery in this country. So we don\u2019t intend to get into the history laws. My comments were not intended to give offence and if they did I deeply regret that and apologise for that. This is not about getting into the history wars. They were simply trying to make the point that Australia, yes, we have had issues in our history. We have acknowledged them. I have acknowledged them. And we need to address them and, particularly those who work closely within this area would know that. Personally I have been heavily invested in these issues. And I will continue to be heavily invested in these issues. Scott Morrison says the government won\u2019t be taking away unemployment benefits from protesters. We won\u2019t be doing that,\u201d Morrison says. The reason is, enforcement of these matters is for the state and territory governments. And so they will apply their fines and their laws on these issues in those jurisdictions. They are dealing with those gatherings in those state laws, and state restrictions are a matter for state and territory governments, not the federal government. Prof Brendan Murphy is up now. He says you can\u2019t make the protests safe: Because we\u2019ve done so well, you\u2019ve noticed from what the prime minister has said, national cabinet has become more confident about relaxing restrictions in phase three and that is absolutely fantastic that we are in that position, but we do need to be patient with all of these steps. That leads me to the issue of protests and they absolutely agree with the prime minister that those sort of events where you have a large number of people who don\u2019t know each other and who we can\u2019t contact trace easily or track one of the highest risk events. One of the people at the event in Victoria could have been infectious. We won\u2019t know for another week or so whether that has led to any spike in cases in that state, but these sort of events really are dangerous and the AHPPC and all the state chief health officers and our experts released a statement yesterday pleading with the population to not attend those uncontrolled mass events. You cannot make them safe. Despite all the attempts of organisers to try and make them safe, those sort of events where people are crowded together and where you can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t know who is there \u2013 are inherently unsafe. Please express your genuine concerns about issues in other ways. On the protests planned for this tonight and this weekend, Scott Morrison says there \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a double standard\u201d. The medical advice is that this is an unsafe thing to do. It puts not only your own health at risk, but it puts other people\u2019s lives at risk. It puts the \u2013 in economic terms because of the risk of a way that could come from these events, it puts the livelihoods of other Australians at risk, people\u2019s businesses. The very clear message is that people should not attend those events because it is against the health advice to do so. And so I would strongly encourage people to exercise that responsibility by not attending those events and respect their fellow Australians by ... seeking to express those in another way. This is not about the issue that people are raising; this is about people\u2019s health and welfare and I would urge Australians to respect that by not attending those events. Scott Morrison also welcomes Queensland\u2019s 10 July border reopen date. Scott Morrison then moves on to the issue of international students: On international students we\u2019ll be working closely with states and territories, firstly on a pilot basis, to enable, in a very controlled setting, for international students to be able to come to Australia, but only on pre-approved plans for particular institutions worked up between federal authorities and state and territory authorities. I\u2019m not suggesting this is going to happen soon. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do ... We\u2019ve received some very, I think, well thought-through proposals from states as to how this can be done, particularly here in the ACT. This is something that I\u2019m sure we would all welcome happening again, but it has to be done with the appropriate quarantine entry arrangements and biosecurity, and all of those matters, being addressed. That\u2019s something that I know border force is working on. Our federal cabinet has been considering that now for some time. We\u2019re still a little way away on being able to advance on those proposals. But I made clear to the states and territories today: if someone can\u2019t come to your state from Sydney, then someone can\u2019t come to your state from Singapore. That means stadiums should be able to have 25% capacity (from July, if all goes well). Funerals and churches and other gatherings will also be able to have more people, as long as the four-square-metre rule is maintained. But nightclubs will still be out. Step three, which is set down for July, will lift the 100 people in a gathering cap and move to a four square metre rule, which means that larger venues can have more people. Scott Morrison on the national cabinet outcomes: Also today we reaffirmed our commitment to the three-step process to ensure that we are on track after concluding the third step of that three-step process in July. On top of that, we also confirmed that is the national strategy, which brings together all the states and territories to pursue a policy of suppression. If we are able to achieve elimination or eradication as a byproduct then that\u2019s well and good, but we ... are not going to have our policies trapped by the goal of eradication. And it\u2019s important to note that there being cases, and there being the odd outbreak here or there, is something that is anticipated, and the system has been built to deal with. But the emergence of cases is not something that will necessarily require these three-step process and the opening up of the economy to be halted, but that will always be subject to the medical advice from the medical expert panel. The prime minister says it won\u2019t be a long press conference, and apologises to those who have had their midday movie interrupted. Yup. Musician, record label owner, actor, one half of AB Original and Guardian culture desk fav Briggs can now add \u201cbestselling author\u201d to his collection of achievements after his picture book, Our Home Our Heartbeat, shot up the sales charts this week. Our Home Our Heartbeat had been a quiet seller since its release in May, a spokesperson for publisher Hardie Grant Egmont told Guardian Australia, but sales more than doubled this week in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests around the country. While it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Bluey juggernaut (can anything?) \u2013 Bluey has been dominating children\u2019s bestseller lists since the first book in the franchise series was released late last year \u2013 Briggs\u2019 picture book is the top-selling authored title in the children\u2019s charts this week. The book is adapted from Briggs\u2019 song The Children Came Back, and illustrated by Kate Moon and Rachael Sarra. This is in Melbourne More information may be needed here, Mr Falinski: The whole roadmap, which has been out for a while, and includes the July 10 date, is here: For those still screaming for a date on when the greatest nation on earth, Queensland, will be reopening its borders for domestic travel, the deputy premier and health minister, Steven Miles, gives a pretty big hint here: We\u2019ve said very consistently from when we released the roadmap that we would review the borders at the end of June and that, if it was safe to do so, we would relax those restrictions on 10 July. Nothing has changed about that. And just in case there is anyone who follows the same twisted logic of the former foreign affairs minister (who seems to be vying for the title of the whitest man in Australia \u2013 a big call, given we already have Michael McCormack) read this: This is why people heap shit on Queenslanders (of which I am one): The Coalition and Labor have again combined to prevent a One Nation stunt on race politics. Malcolm Roberts has put forward a motion noting the rates of death in custody of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, and accusing people of quoting the 437 Indigenous deaths in custody figure without further context, of \u201cdistorting\u201d debate. He has selectively quoted the sort of data that might make everything look fine if one didn\u2019t realise that Indigenous people are incarcerated at a much higher rate, so a similar (or slightly lower) rate of deaths applied to a much higher imprisoned population = way more deaths, relative to the proportion of Indigenous people in the population. Mathias Cormann proposed that the motion be dealt with in general motions not formal motions \u2013 essentially kicking the can down the road \u2013 and Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher agreed. Gallagher said: We would add that we have had a concern for some time that this part of program is used to move motions that warrant further debate, to force senators to vote yes or no in a way to wedge [political opponents] ... It needs reform. Pauline Hanson had a big spray accusing the government and opposition of \u201cshutting this down\u201d because they \u201cdon\u2019t want the truth\u201d to get out. Greens senator Larissa Waters expressed concern that although the Greens disagree with One Nation the precedent does allow the government and opposition to gang up to shut down minor parties\u2019 motions. The manoeuvre worked, and they\u2019re moving on with other motions now, so we\u2019re spared the One Nation race vote. The national cabinet meeting has broken for the day.The prime minister has called a press conference for about 12.40. It\u2019s in the main committee room, so not a fancy one then. Sadly, this is not a parody account: Labor\u2019s Australia Post campaign has hit a nerve. Paul Fletcher and Mathias Cormann have put out a release disputing Labor\u2019s concerns: Labor\u2019s claims are untrue in multiple respects: It has been claimed that Australia Post will cut jobs and remove one in four posties. This is not true. Australia Post has said there will be no forced redundancies or plans to cut posties\u2019 take-home pay due to the new temporary arrangements. Many posties will continue delivering letters on bikes, and others will be retrained to deliver parcels in vans, putting them where the work is, securing their job with Australia Post, and better meeting the increasing needs of Australians for parcel deliveries. It has been claimed that Australia Post wants to cut delivery services in half. This is not true. Australia Post is permitted to adjust its delivery frequency, in metropolitan areas only, from every business day to every second business day. Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. This is not true. Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested. It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. This is not true. While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes. It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. This is not true. The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes. It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. This is not true. The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period. It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. This is not true. The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership. There will be no change to Australia Post\u2019s ownership, which will remain government owned. The Morrison government is committed to supporting Australia Post to provide important postal services to all Australians. Bill Shorten also spoke on the government\u2019s reaction to robodebt: This is what you expect government ministers to do, to make sure that what they are doing is legal. This is a massive scandal. Can you imagine a set of circumstances \u2013 you couldn\u2019t have written it five years ago \u2013 the Turnbull or the Abbott or the Morrison government is going to create an unlawful scheme, send out letters of demand without any legal basis, raise up to $1.5bn, unjustly enriched itself and then spent five years denying they have been breaking the law. And as important as the apology was yesterday, if it is a fair dinkum apology, Mr Morrison will not reboot robodebt another way and Mr Morrison will repay the money, which has government has unlawfully robbed from Australian people, vulnerable people, and pay it back straightaway. Not next year, not at some point in the future, but if the government has taken people\u2019s money unlawfully, and they have said they have, pay it back now. And your reminder that just yesterday, Stuart Robert said debt collection by the commonwealth, will be resuming. Bill Shorten has held a press conference and is asked about the conservative call to take unemployment benefits from people who received them and went to a protest (because free speech can only be free when its something power agrees with, apparently). Q: Are you against taking away the payments from people who protest this weekend? Shorten: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the main issue but they also want to talk about protests. I did say that Australians have been amazing. They have given up attending weddings, funerals, they can\u2019t go to their sport, the theatre, the music. A lot of people have paid a big price for the public health emergency, so while I am an absolute supporter of drawing attention to the issue of black deaths in custody, while it is the right cause, it is the wrong timing. I think a lot of Australians who have sympathy for the diabolical situation in America, I think I would say to the protesters, everyone else on a range of other matters they consider to be very important: they have done the right thing and they would ask the protesters not to attend because, frankly, let\u2019s get through the public health emergency and let\u2019s get back to all of these fundamental issues of importance, but without jeopardising the good work we have done so far. I am a Collingwood fan \u2013 but the club needs to work on this. And yet the Queensland election will be going ahead in October (and local government elections and two byelections were held in the midst of the lockdowns) and the federal government and the NSW premier are pushing for state borders to be brought down (and I can tell you, there are more people on a Queensland beach than in line at any one time for a local government election). Plus \u2013 postal votes are a thing? The NSW government announced today that the local government elections will be held on Saturday 4 September 2021. It follows the decision to postpone the September 2020 council elections for 12 months because of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure the health and safety of candidates, voters and NSW Electoral Commission staff. The NSW electoral commissioner made the request. The local government minister, Shelley Hancock, said councillors will hold their civic offices until the rescheduled local government elections. \u201cLocal government elections are a vital part of the democratic process, ensuring local councils are accountable to their local communities,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cThe decision to postpone elections was not taken lightly and was made to provide certainty for councils and communities across the state.\u201d An order has been published in today\u2019s government gazette formally postponing the election for 12 months. A second order extending the postponement and setting the new election date will be published in the government gazette shortly. I\u2019ve spoken to a bunch of Coalition MPs about what they think should happen to the jobkeeper wage subsidy and jobseeker coronavirus supplement come the end of September. The main fault lines of the debate seem to be that everyone agrees industry assistance will be needed for sectors such as tourism but only some want jobkeeper to be extended. Others want a more specific bailout package. The Nationals MP for Cowper, Pat Conaghan, told Guardian Australia: Jobkeeper has been essential for both employers and employees in Cowper. It has kept people in a job and has maintained the strong working relationship required for a successful business. More importantly it has also allowed individuals and families to put food on the table. As a government, I think we should acknowledge that those people on jobkeeper right now are Australians who prior to the coronavirus pandemic had jobs and paid taxes, some for many years. In some instances, this is the first time in their working lives they have had to rely on government assistance. To remove this lifeline to those workers in a time where businesses are still struggling to rebuild is counterproductive to the original intent of the scheme. In my view, jobkeeper must continue past the original September deadline to support specific industries such as the tourism and hospitality sectors, particularly in regional and rural Australia where the economic recovery will be vastly different to more densely-populated communities.\u201d On jobseeker, some including Llew O\u2019Brien want the higher rate of $1,100 to continue if unemployment persists. Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey also wants consideration of incentivising jobseeker recipients to join the cashless debit card by offering those who agree a higher rate. While the debate over the protests in Australia in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the treatment of Indigenous and First Nations people in this country continues to focus on statues and whether or not American streaming services removing movies so they can put the same educational disclaimer on them that cartoons have had for years, while asking people to think about whether or not black and brown face has ever been funny (it hasn\u2019t), it is worth remembering the history of some of the people driving the debate. Like Peter Dutton, who is one of the loudest and often most visible people on these issues but often without any caveat that he left the chamber when the national apology was delivered to Indigenous people. If we are going to remember history, we should probably remember that too: (from Q&amp;A on 15 March 2010) Tony Jones: to Peter Dutton: why did you choose not to attend the apology to the stolen generations?\u201d Dutton: Well, for pretty much the same reasons. I support any legislation whatsoever that would go through our parliament that I thought would provide a tangible outcome for, particularly, Aboriginal children. I ... Jones: Well, hang on, when you say for the \u201csame reasons\u201d you mean you regarded the apology as tokenism? Dutton: I regarded it as something which was not going to deliver tangible outcomes to kids who are being raped and tortured in communities in the 21st century. Now if I thought for a moment that it was going to deliver positive outcomes to those kids, to their families, to those communities, then I would support it in a heartbeat. But I thought it distracted us from that. Jones: But you were on your own on the Liberal frontbench. Did you make a deliberate decision to be the only Liberal frontbencher who didn\u2019t participate in the apology? Dutton: I made a decision what was right for me and what I believed in and that I stayed true to. Now at the time I offered my resignation to Brendan Nelson and that was part of my thinking at the time. I ... Jones: What, you though so strongly about not wanting to see an apology you offered your resignation? Dutton: Well I knew that that would be a difficulty for Brendan and I respected that. But what I said to him at the same time was exactly what I said before. If legislation comes through, you know, regardless of cost \u2013 if there\u2019s a benefit that\u2019s going to be provided to lifting people out of poverty, to changing the future for our generation, then I would do that. If it\u2019s going to lift life expectancy. If it\u2019s going to deliver better health outcomes. That statement ends with: We also respect all who support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make the case for reforms to policies that will improve the circumstances of Indigenous Australians. \u201cWe call on governments and police to lend every support to the BLM protestors in exercising their democratic right to peaceful protest, to forego any legal action to hinder protests, and to support protests in ways that mitigate any risk of COVID-19, for example by providing masks to protesters. \u201cWe call on protest organisers to take every possible measure to avoid virus transmission. \u201cWe recommend that all who choose to be involved in protests wear masks, maintain physical distancing, and download the CovidSafe app. \u201cWe urge all involved\u2013protestors, police, and anyone in the vicinity \u2013 to be respectful, peaceful and non-violent. \u201cIf the same commitment made by Australians and their governments to control COVID-19 was applied to eradicating racism and improving the circumstances of our first people, Australia would be an enormously advanced nation.\u201d The Public Health Association has come out and said it sees no reason protests can\u2019t go ahead, saying given Australia\u2019s success in controlling community transmission, there is no reason the protests shouldn\u2019t proceed safely (which is the same reason the federal government is making to have the state borders reopened). From its statement: Two hugely important public health objectives \u2013Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 \u2013 have been framed as competing imperatives. They are not,\u201d said PHAA CEO Terry Slevin today. The Black Lives Matter movement in Australia seeks to highlight the deplorable circumstances of disadvantage and discrimination experienced by Australia\u2019s first people. It is an important vehicle to seek changes that will help \u2018close the gap\u2019, and address generations of inequality and injustice which continues to this day. Addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is one of the highest order public health issues in Australia today. The fact that over 430 Indigenous deaths in custody have been recorded since the 1991 Royal Commission is a stark illustration of this emergency. It is indisputable that racism is a real and ever-present public health issue. Racism in Australia obviously precedes COVID-19, and has a massive continuing impact on the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Australia has managed the COVID-19 pandemic very successfully. PHAA has recognised this through our special PHAA President\u2019s Award for Members of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) on 12 May. \u201cWe have enormous regard for the work of the public health officials and governments around Australia who have taken the hard decisions to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on the health of Australians,\u201d said Mr Slevin. \u201cWith extremely low levels of community transmission, effective contact tracing and quarantine, Australia is well placed to control the virus.\u201d In case you missed this yesterday - Linda Burney and Terri Butler stopped by the cameras this morning to speak about a new Senate inquiry looking at the destruction of Indigenous heritage sites, in mine expansions. Burney: Yesterday Labor was successful in the Senate of establishing a Terms of Reference to put an inquiry to the Northern Australia committee, a joint parliamentary committee on the destruction of Aboriginal cultural heritage, certainly brought on by the by the explosions that Rio Tinto undertook in the Juukan Gorge. Terri will have responsibility for the carriage of that. ... This is a very significant outcome. This Inquiry will look into the issues around Aboriginal cultural heritage and the relationship with mining companies. We believe that the resources industry is incredibly important to the Australian economy, and we want to see better practices. But most importantly, this is about self-determination. It is what the decisions are made between mining companies and the Traditional Owners. We also make the point very strongly that Aboriginal cultural heritage, as pointed out by UNESCO two weeks ago, is the heritage of all Australians. And it is something that has very much captured the hearts and minds of Australians. ... This is a very serious inquiry. We have not undertaken this lightly. We have undertaken it because there has been so much reaction to the destruction of cultural heritage in the case of the Gorge. We know that BHP has put on hold any further destruction of sites. And it is something that Labor is not going to play politics on. This has to be a joint approach between government and the Labor party. And it serves no purpose for anyone to throw rocks from the side to score political points. This is a serious issue. A Black Lives Matter protest is still planned for Sydney tonight, despite NSW police declaring it \u201cunauthorised\u201d and announcing they will be upholding the current health control orders (code for moving people on/fining people). A smaller protest for refugee rights is also going ahead tomorrow in Sydney, despite also being declared unauthorised. NSW police have said they will be \u201cwell resourced\u201d at the protests. That Kangaroo Point (in Brisbane) protest we showed you a little earlier is still occurring. From AAP: Protesters have called for a mass gathering at a Brisbane hotel after staging a blockade to prevent the removal of asylum seekers detained there. Police are continuing to negotiate with protesters near the Kangaroo Point Central Hotel after dramatic scenes there on Thursday night. Two people were charged after a night-time operation to prevent the removal of asylum seekers from the hotel and move them to an immigration detention facility. The man and woman are accused of jumping on the roofs of parked cars during the operation, which saw people use cars to block the hotel\u2019s driveways and prevent any of the 120 detainees from being shifted. The same hotel has been the scene of previous protests against the detention of asylum seekers. Some of those at the hotel have been in detention for years and have staged balcony protests about their treatment. Refugee Solidarity Brisbane/Meanjin supporters filmed their interactions with police on Friday and uploaded it to Facebook, calling for as many people as possible to descend on the hotel. \u201cWe need as many people to get here as soon as possible. This is an urgent call to action,\u201d a woman who posted the video on the group\u2019s Facebook page says. \u201cCops have rocked up, they are planning to detain people. They\u2019ve already detained two people. We really need people power right now. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019re going to hold this fort until, hopefully, for another week\u2019s time.\u201d Police said they were only aware of the two arrests on Thursday night involving public nuisance charges. On Thursday, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned people not to attend a Free the Refugees protest planned at Kangaroo Point on Saturday because of coronavirus fears. Labor\u2019s South Australian team have come together to put out this statement, calling for the government to save community television in their state (and in Victoria): Community television has been serving Australian audiences for 25 years but the Morrison Government wants to boot Channel 44 Adelaide and Channel 31 Melbourne and Geelong off-air from 30 June 2020. The Liberal Minister for Communications and the Arts, Paul Fletcher MP, is refusing to renew or extend their broadcast licences beyond the end of the month. Through the COVID-19 crisis Adelaide\u2019s C44 has provided a valuable community service connecting isolated people through broadcasting in addition to the local content and voices it normally empowers. Instead of vibrant community services that have fostered talent the likes of Rove McManus, Peter Hellier, Hamish and Andy, Merrick Watts and Tim Ross, Nazeem Hussain, Shona Devlin, Corinne Grant, Tom Ballard, Waleed Aly and more, there will be blank screens. Australia has one of the most concentrated media markets in the world and Community TV provides much needed diversity and local content. At a time when at a time when newsrooms are closing, Community TV supports local news and provides a training ground for emerging journalists and screen practitioners, including in partnership with universities. At a time when social cohesion, national culture and identity should be fostered, Community TV provides a platform for local multicultural, sporting and arts events, as well as small business. At a time when social distancing makes participation in religious services difficult, Community TV provides accessibility, particularly to elderly citizens without internet access. The Liberal Government came up with the idea of forcing Community TV off-air to an online-only mode of delivery back in 2014. Since then the sector has been operating under huge uncertainty and most stations haven\u2019t survived: Sydney, Brisbane and Perth don\u2019t even have Community TV any more. Now the impact of COVID-19 means the idea of moving audiences and sponsors to an online-only model is simply impossible. Community TV should remain on-air. C44 and C31 serve a wide and diverse audience and they don\u2019t cost the government anything to run. Community TV is part of the broadcasting mix in Australia and spectrum is a valuable public resource that should not go unused when C44 and C31 could make such good use of it. The Minister provided COVID-19 relief for other sectors of the media and he should give Community TV a fair go too. Killing Community TV is wasteful and wilful destruction. Labor calls on the Morrison Government to keep Community TV on-air. AAP also has a wrap on Australia\u2019s latest attempt to talk about its history: Australia won\u2019t have proved itself as a nation until Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures are brought together, indigenous historian Bruce Pascoe says. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science really,\u201d he told ABC radio on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s about recognition, it\u2019s about embracing the history - good and bad.\u201d Mr Pascoe says successive governments have failed to make any headway on the issue, with both histories not being embraced. Indigenous people must be included in history and the economy, he added. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened. Until it does, we really can\u2019t call ourselves a mature nation. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re any better than America.\u201d Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been widely criticised for claiming there was no slavery in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that when you chain people up by the neck and force them to march 300km and then work on cattle stations for non-indigenous barons, then that is slavery,\u201d Mr Pascoe said. Indigenous incarceration rates and deaths in custody have come under the spotlight along with the Black Lives Matter movement, which gained momentum in the US after black man George Floyd was killed by police after being arrested. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton lashed out at an apparent rash of \u201ccancel culture\u201d in response to the movement. Netflix has pulled four shows featuring controversial Australian performer Chris Lilley and there are supposedly calls to topple statues of British explorer Captain James Cook. \u201cI don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history you don\u2019t agree with or you don\u2019t like is really something the Australian public is going to embrace,\u201d Mr Dutton told Nine\u2019s Today show. \u201cThere are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that.\u201d Mr Dutton said Netflix\u2019s decision to remove the Chris Lilley shows, depicted the comedian in a range of characters including blackface, was absurd. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese does not want statues removed. \u201cYou can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it,\u201d he told Sydney radio 2GB. \u201cThe idea that you go back to year zero of history is in my view, just quite frankly unacceptable.\u201d The US movies classic Gone with the Wind has been temporarily removed from HBO until \u201cethnic and racial prejudices\u201d depicted in the 1939 film can be contextualised by the streaming service. \u201cI mean, for goodness sake, I just think a bit of common sense here,\u201d Mr Albanese responded. \u201cPeople can watch things, they can learn from them. Doesn\u2019t mean you agree with them. Doesn\u2019t mean that everything that they did was right. But it happened. You cannot pretend that it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d AAP has an update on the Tasmanian situation: Tasmania is on the verge of being free of Covid-19 cases, with just one active infection remaining in the island state. As of Friday morning, the state had gone 27 days without recording a new case of coronavirus. Of 226 recorded cases from more than 39,300 tests, one is active while 212 people have now recovered. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, is asked whether the man who attended Saturday\u2019s protest and subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 will be identified. No one is supposed to have that information, except for health authorities. Mikakos: Well, it would be a breach of the Health Records Act for this individual to be named in these circumstances. You know, we want to not do anything to discourage people from coming forward. It is important that the community takes this issue very seriously. Obviously, we were very clear in our advice last week that we did not want people to attend the protest. We made it very clear that there was a public health risk for people attending any mass gathering event, regardless of the cause, regardless of the level of passion that people have about an issue. But having thousands of people come together was something that was incredibly, inherently risky. So if people now are exhibiting symptoms, when they would urge them to go forward and to get tested. And I refer you to the National Committee\u2019s advice of public health experts, AHPPC, that\u2019s chaired by Professor Brendan Murphy, who issued a statement just yesterday that had some very clear advice there that there was no need for all the protesters to be mass quarantined, but that they would be reiterating our call that for any person exhibiting even mild symptoms, that they go forward and get tested. (The man, like most of the protesters, was wearing a mask during the protest, which authorities believe will help minimise, but not eliminate, any risk of transmission.) For the record, the chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, issued a statement yesterday saying there was no need for the mass quarantine or testing of people who attended the Melbourne protest: The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) noted the positive coronavirus test in a person who attended the large protest in Victoria last week. It will take some days to determine whether other people have been infected. AHPPC noted Victoria\u2019s advice that a significant investigation to determine the source of the infection and identify close contacts is underway. AHPPC emphasises once more the very high risk environment of a protest, with large numbers of people closely gathering and challenges in identifying all contacts. AHPPC again urges the Australian community to not participate in mass gatherings. Anyone who attends protests must be vigilant and ensure they get tested if they develop any symptoms. Anyone who is feeling unwell or with symptoms should stay home. It is particularly important to avoid any interaction with people who are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Currently there is no requirement for people who attended the Melbourne protest or other protests to quarantine or be tested if they remain well (unless they have been identified as a close contact). Situations like this are a reminder of how important it is for everyone to continue to take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19. This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms. AHPPC also reinforces the importance of downloading the COVIDSafe app to help public health authorities find people exposed to the virus quickly. Victoria has recorded four new cases in the past 24 hours. One was found through routine testing, another two were returned travellers in hotel quarantine and the fourth is under investigation. And no, none of them had anything to do with the protests on the weekend. Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy says she would take part in another Black Lives Matter protest if she were in Darwin. And before all the whataboutters start jumping up and down, listen to why she is talking about \u201cif she were in the NT\u201d: We have different circumstances obviously in the Northern Territory where our restrictions have reduced quite dramatically over the past month and we can have crowds of up to 500, if not more now,\u201d she told the ABC. We\u2019ve got sporting fixtures where spectators are at the events. So this has been occurring since last week and the rally that took place in Darwin and in Alice Springs occurred within that environment. Every state and territory jurisdiction has to look at their own situation and, certainly, those individuals and families need to consider what\u2019s important for themselves and the families, and the people around them. So I would certainly say, have a good look at that. I noticed that New South Wales is going down the path of a legal structure. I know that there\u2019s conversations in Queensland and Victoria. But I would also urge political leaders to engage with the black community. What\u2019s missing here, I think, is the ability for leaders to actually engage with these leaders of the First Nations groups who are trying to reach out with a message that\u2019s significant. I\u2019d certainly urge the Prime Minister to do the same. You know, talk to First Nations media, start engaging with people instead of always being combative with First Nations people. We\u2019re again hearing calls for the commissioners of Scott Morrison\u2019s Covid-19 commission to release their conflict-of-interest declarations. The commissioners, all leaders of the private sector, are helping to shape Australia\u2019s non-health response to Covid-19. But the government has steadfastly refused to release their conflict-of-interest declarations, detailing not only their board positions but also their private interests. I asked all six commissioners whether they would release a list of their interests voluntarily. Only one, Greg Combet, did so. Even then, the entries on his list were already publicly known and published on the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission website. Other commissioners have disclosed their board positions but not their private interests. That has prompted renewed calls for greater transparency. The Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said releasing the declarations was the least the NCCC could do. Merzian noted the role of the commission \u2013 a publicly funded body led by corporate leaders \u2013 was clearly to influence the government. It is clearly in the public interest for any conflicts of interest to be publicly declared. There is no excuse for any potential conflicts of interest to remain secret.\u201d Peter Dutton also managed to slip in that people were angry at Daniel Andrews (as well as Annastacia Palaszczuk) about the border closures in that Today interview. Victoria never closed its borders. Seems like something the federal minister in charge of Australia\u2019s border should know. The fact that statues have taken over the debate in this country, and not the treatment of Indigenous people, really says a lot about Australia and how we just cannot let go of a cultural war. Here are Richard Marles and Peter Dutton on the Today show this morning: Q: There\u2019s a bit of anger around at the moment. You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think? Dutton: Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it. Q: Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far? Dutton: He has got two left wings. Marles: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus. For all the international coronavirus news, head here Anthony Albanese called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues. My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it. And I\u2019ve always been opposed to the idea of, there was a proposal a few years ago to relocate Captain Cook\u2019s statue in Hyde Park, and I opposed that. I think the idea that you go back to year zero of history is in my view, just quite frankly unacceptable. And you have a proposal, I see as well that somehow it is wrong to watch Gone With The Wind. I mean, for goodness sake, I just think a bit of common sense here, people can watch things, they can learn from them. Doesn\u2019t mean you agree with them. Doesn\u2019t mean that everything that they did was right. But it happened. You cannot pretend that it didn\u2019t happen. For the record, they are not saying you can\u2019t watch Gone With The Wind. They are just saying to remember the historical context in which it is set, and to think about it as you watch the movie. It\u2019s really not that hard. Looney Tunes did it. There has been a disclaimer in front of the cartoons since about 2014 And if kids can handle it without passing out from political correctness vapours, than we should be able to watch Katie Scarlett O\u2019Hara defend her part of the South, while recognising that in today\u2019s world, she\u2019d be rightly called out for her bullshit. And yes, I have read the book. Labor will move to disallow the Australia Post changes in both the House and the Senate today. The Senate is where the move has the most chance of success. These things are usually left out of the House, because the government of the day (obviously) has the numbers there, making it sort of against the point. So in moving it himself in the House, Anthony Albanese will be making a bit of history \u2013 it is the first time since at least the 1960s that an Opposition leader has moved a disallowance motion In Brisbane, this is still happening. The national cabinet is national cabineting as of now. You\u2019ll hear a bit more about borders at the end of that meeting. Rose Bay public school in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs has been closed after a probable Covid case. Students will be asked to learn from home while the school is cleaned. Mathias Cormann told Sky News it was worth having \u201cthe conversation\u201d about whether or not protesters should lose their unemployment benefits \u2013 just in case you were wondering how far down the Howard era we were going. The \u201cconversation\u201d is only being raised in conservative circles. The protests were mostly held on weekends. You can have a job and protest. You\u2019re allowed to be unemployed and protest. But hey \u2013 he\u2019s managed to put Pauline Hanson in \u201ccontext\u201d, so what a hero. The Greens Senator Rachel Siewert also has a few things to say about Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201capology\u201d for robodebt: The PM\u2019s so-called apology in Parliament yesterday failed to show empathy and recognise the pain and trauma that the robodebt program caused to hundreds of thousands of Australians. \u201cThis Government relentlessly pursed people for years in the full knowledge that they were targeting vulnerable people for savings. \u201cI would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue,\u201d does not cut it, the PM clearly doesn\u2019t get how much hurt and grief robodebt has caused. \u201cIf you are sorry you say \u201cI AM SORRY\u201d not \u201cI would apologise\u201d. \u201cHow about showing exactly how sorry your Government is and put in place a Royal Commission to get to the bottom of this whole mess.\u201d Meanwhile, the Victorian Labor government will be asked to strengthen anti-racism laws in that state after advocacy groups say there was an increase in racist attacks during the height of the Covid lockdowns. From their statement: During the COVID-19 pandemic, people from Asian backgrounds have reported almost 400 racist attacks to a reporting tool organised by the Asian Australian Alliance. This has included verbal and physical assaults, death threats, people being abused in front of their children, people being refused service in stores and property damage. Incidents include people being spat on, two female international students being assaulted in Melbourne, a man with Asian heritage being deliberately coughed on and being told to \u201cgo home\u201d, a Chinese woman suffering a concussion after a person threw a bottle at her head from a moving car and multiple examples of people being subjected to racial abuse. A coalition of union, civil society and faith-based groups have made a supplementary submission to the Parliamentary committee inquiring into Victoria\u2019s anti-vilification laws highlighting these recent incidents of hate conduct. The coalition is calling for a range of law reform measures, including stronger civil and criminal laws so that people are held accountable for conduct fuelled by hate. The group is also calling for the Andrews Government to ban the public display of vilifying and offensive materials, like the Nazi Swastika, which is increasingly being displayed and used as a calling card for white supremacist groups across Victoria. Mark Dreyfus was also asked about the demands of Black Lives Matter protesters in Australia: We should start to see implementation of recommendations that have been on the table for, in some cases, decades. You only had to listen to my colleague, my wonderful colleague Pat Dodson in the Senate a couple of days ago, to understand the frustration that First Nations people are experiencing, to understand his frustration. He was one of the royal commissioners in the black deaths in custody royal commission, and you can only imagine how he must feel 30 years on to see that the recommendations that he made with his fellow commissioners are still unimplemented. This morning the ABC is running this story: It is also worth pointing out that Stuart Robert also said the debt collection would resume yesterday (something that seemed a little lost in all the \u201capology\u201d talk): Right now, just so that colleagues are aware in the House, 939,000 Australians have debts \u2013 over $5 billion worth \u2013 that the government lawfully has to collect across a whole range of programs. Governments of all persuasions have done this across the divide. The government, of course, have paused all debt collection across all programs as we work our way through the COVID crisis, but government will have to restart that debt collection. We will do it sensibly, we will do it engaging all people and we will do it in a very transparent manner. It is incumbent on us all, if we have constituents who are hurting or suffering, to bring them through to me. All colleagues know where I am. Give me a buzz and we will seek quickly to help you out. Mark Dreyfus was on ABC radio this morning. He was asked about the prime minister\u2019s apology for the \u201churt or harm\u201d caused to anyone by how the government carried out robodebt. Dreyfus said the apology wasn\u2019t enough: This was a qualified and partial apology for what was a shocking abuse of government power. Scott Morrison has never taken responsibility for it and yet, he started this when he was social services minister, went on with it and expanded it when he was treasurer and owned it as prime minister. I find it extraordinary that the best he can do is express, in this partial way, regret for a particular case. What we need to know is what happened. We need to know when the government knew that this scheme was illegal. We need to know why the government persisted with this preying on the most vulnerable people in our community for years after it\u2019s apparent they knew that it was illegal. Well, this is heartening. From Chris Knaus: More protests are planned for this weekend. In NSW, police have declared the planned Black Lives Matter event \u201cunauthorised\u201d and said they would be upholding the health control orders. Scott Morrison, while saying there was \u201cno slavery in Australia\u201d (there was) has also said any further protesters should be fined. It\u2019s going to get very, very messy. It\u2019s a sitting day and national cabinet, so aren\u2019t we lucky ducks. Yesterday both the prime minister and the treasurer turned up the heat on states to reopen borders (while also condemning Black Lives Matter protesters for setting back the easing of restrictions and ignoring any contradiction in what they were saying). The closed states have mostly pointed to July as when they\u2019ll be comfortable reopening. That\u2019s what Scott Morrison says was part of the national cabinet plan. But because politics is back, so is the border open push. Queensland, where a state election is to be held in October, is bearing the brunt of it. Even though the NT, WA and South Australia are also closed. So, good times. We\u2019ll cover that and everything else that happens today. You\u2019ve got Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. There may not be enough coffee in the world for this Friday. Ready?",

      "body": "<p>A Whole Foods worker in Philadelphia has been fired after sharing posts on social media criticizing their store management for providing free food to police during George Floyd protests in the area.</p> <p>Megan Murray, 22, had worked at the store in Philadelphia for nearly two years. The company denied the firing was caused by her postings and said it was for a \u201cmajor infraction\u201d.</p> <p>The outlet shares a building and parking garage with a local police station. During recent anti-police brutality protests, they and other workers heard that a manager had provided police officers with free food and water.</p> <p>A Whole Foods spokesperson confirmed the store had closed and evacuated early on 1 June due to the protests and provided remaining prepared food and water for free to police officers on site assisting with evacuation.</p> <p>The move angered some workers, including Murray.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/retail-workers-at-amazon-and-whole-foods-coordinate-sick-out-to-protest-covid-19-conditions\">Retail workers at Amazon and Whole Foods coordinate sick-out to protest Covid-19 conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAround June 4th and 5th, team members started making public posts about it. At that point, I started sharing some of those posts and started talking to co-workers about a response,\u201d said Murray. \u201cThat Friday I went back into work after I shared that stuff, and that was when they pulled me in for an investigation. They put me on administrative leave and called me 24 hours later to tell me I was fired.\u201d</p> <p>According to Murray, they were not provided with a specific reason for the termination other than a \u201cmajor infraction\u201d. Murray claimed the firing was retaliatory as management had previous discussions with her about organizing activity in the past, including participating in sickout protests over working conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic and <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/covid-19-coronavirus-whole-foods-safety-employees-groceries/\">speaking publicly </a>to the media.</p> <p>\u201cIt constituted retaliation simply for the fact that no other employees were even so much as investigated about this even though I made it clear in my statement and interview that this was a collective effort,\u201d added Murray. \u201cIf they were investigating people on the basis of their involvement that means they would have had to investigate 40 to 50 workers, but they only investigated me, which leads me to believe it is retaliatory for my history of organizing.\u201d</p> <p>Whole Foods denied the firing was retaliatory and noted the company had a zero-tolerance policy for retaliation.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Team Member was separated due to a major infraction, which we investigated after it was brought to our attention by fellow Team Members.\u201d</p> <p>They did not clarify on what the major infraction was but after publication a spokesperson added: \u201cThe team member was presented with evidence that showed clear violation of our policies against behavior and language that is threatening, vulgar and obscene towards a team member and was separated as a result. Her actions were specifically directed towards an individual in the workplace and perceived as a safety threat. They were brought to our attention by fellow store team members.\u201d</p> <p>In emails sent to Whole Foods employees, the company has touted its parent company, Amazon, making a $10m donation to \u201corganizations that are working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans\u201d. Whole Foods announced to employees on 5 June that the company was creating an inclusion taskforce of team members to raise awareness and support diversity and inclusion at Whole Foods.</p> <p>Shortly after the George Floyd protests began, Amazon changed <sup> </sup>its website banner to affirm support for Black Lives Matter and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/06/08/jeff-bezos-shares-angry-emails-over-support-black-lives-matter/5317310002/\">publicly shared</a> a blunt response to a racist customer upset about the company\u2019s public support for the anti-racism movement.</p> <p>Murray is the second Whole Foods employee involved with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WholeWorkerWFM\">Whole Worker</a>, a grassroots collective of Whole Foods workers seeking to unionize, who was recently terminated.</p> <p>Katie Doan, an employee for three years at a Whole Foods in Tustin, California, was <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3zd9g/whole-foods-just-fired-an-employee-who-kept-track-of-coronavirus-cases\">fired</a> on 27 May for time theft after she left the store during a panic attack. But Doan, who was tracking coronavirus cases among Whole Foods workers around the US for Whole Worker, argued management was aware of her issues with panic attacks and had previously made accommodations during episodes.</p> <p>\u201cUp until my termination, I had one write-up in the three years I worked there and was told often I was a valuable team member to the store,\u201d said Doan. \u201cKnowing that I have a strong and close relationship with my store, it made no sense to me that they would suddenly change their tune unless they had another reason to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Whole Foods denied Doan\u2019s firing was retaliatory and said she had violated company policies. \u201cAny suggestion that the separation of this team member is related to any form of retaliation is completely false. The team member admitted to violating well-established policies,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <p>Two workers at a Whole Foods in Bedford, New Hampshire, have been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatterNH/posts/1323083811208029\">protesting</a> outside the store after management told them they could not wear face masks displaying messages of support for the anti-racism protests. A Whole Foods spokesperson said company dress code prohibits visible slogans, messages, or logos that are not company related, and the employees were offered other face masks, which only one accepted.</p> <p>Other workers around the US have reported facing retaliation from employers in response to supporting or participating in the George Floyd protests.</p> <p>Jamila Swopes, a physical therapist in Gulfport, Mississippi, <a href=\"https://www.wxxv25.com/2020/06/03/protest-racial-inequality-gulfport/\">claimed</a> she was fired the day she stood up against two white co-workers who were disparaging the protests.</p> <p>Two black journalists at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette were <a href=\"https://www.pittsburghcurrent.com/pittsburgh-post-gazette-removes-second-black-journalist-from-protest-coverage-in-two-days/\">removed</a> from covering the protests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/09/amazon-black-lives-matter-police-ring-jeff-bezos\">Amazon says 'Black Lives Matter'. But the company has deep ties to policing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Columbus, Ohio, a server at the Forum at Kingsbridge, a five-star senior living facility, who requested to remain anonymous over concerns for future employment prospects, said she was fired after her employer found out she participated in local George Floyd protests.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just about to start working, I get pulled out of the kitchen and they ask me why I called off the day before. I told them my voice was gone and my feet were hurting because I was out protesting and didn\u2019t get home until late because the police weren\u2019t providing ways for people to leave. They say \u2018you are not allowed to protest\u2019,\u201d said the server.</p> <p>Her manager then told her she was laid off, citing coronavirus concerns to residents. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a good reason to let me go, they could have just had me quarantined. No matter how I try to fight this, they\u2019re always going to use something against me \u2013 I\u2019m a black woman trying to fight against them, it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d the worker said.</p> <p>The Forum at Knightsbridge declined to comment, citing an ongoing HR process.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Whole Foods worker in Philadelphia has been fired after sharing posts on social media criticizing their store management for providing free food to police during George Floyd protests in the area. Megan Murray, 22, had worked at the store in Philadelphia for nearly two years. The company denied the firing was caused by her postings and said it was for a \u201cmajor infraction\u201d. The outlet shares a building and parking garage with a local police station. During recent anti-police brutality protests, they and other workers heard that a manager had provided police officers with free food and water. A Whole Foods spokesperson confirmed the store had closed and evacuated early on 1 June due to the protests and provided remaining prepared food and water for free to police officers on site assisting with evacuation. The move angered some workers, including Murray. \u201cAround June 4th and 5th, team members started making public posts about it. At that point, I started sharing some of those posts and started talking to co-workers about a response,\u201d said Murray. \u201cThat Friday I went back into work after I shared that stuff, and that was when they pulled me in for an investigation. They put me on administrative leave and called me 24 hours later to tell me I was fired.\u201d According to Murray, they were not provided with a specific reason for the termination other than a \u201cmajor infraction\u201d. Murray claimed the firing was retaliatory as management had previous discussions with her about organizing activity in the past, including participating in sickout protests over working conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic and speaking publicly to the media. \u201cIt constituted retaliation simply for the fact that no other employees were even so much as investigated about this even though I made it clear in my statement and interview that this was a collective effort,\u201d added Murray. \u201cIf they were investigating people on the basis of their involvement that means they would have had to investigate 40 to 50 workers, but they only investigated me, which leads me to believe it is retaliatory for my history of organizing.\u201d Whole Foods denied the firing was retaliatory and noted the company had a zero-tolerance policy for retaliation. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Team Member was separated due to a major infraction, which we investigated after it was brought to our attention by fellow Team Members.\u201d They did not clarify on what the major infraction was but after publication a spokesperson added: \u201cThe team member was presented with evidence that showed clear violation of our policies against behavior and language that is threatening, vulgar and obscene towards a team member and was separated as a result. Her actions were specifically directed towards an individual in the workplace and perceived as a safety threat. They were brought to our attention by fellow store team members.\u201d In emails sent to Whole Foods employees, the company has touted its parent company, Amazon, making a $10m donation to \u201corganizations that are working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans\u201d. Whole Foods announced to employees on 5 June that the company was creating an inclusion taskforce of team members to raise awareness and support diversity and inclusion at Whole Foods. Shortly after the George Floyd protests began, Amazon changed its website banner to affirm support for Black Lives Matter and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, publicly shared a blunt response to a racist customer upset about the company\u2019s public support for the anti-racism movement. Murray is the second Whole Foods employee involved with Whole Worker, a grassroots collective of Whole Foods workers seeking to unionize, who was recently terminated. Katie Doan, an employee for three years at a Whole Foods in Tustin, California, was fired on 27 May for time theft after she left the store during a panic attack. But Doan, who was tracking coronavirus cases among Whole Foods workers around the US for Whole Worker, argued management was aware of her issues with panic attacks and had previously made accommodations during episodes. \u201cUp until my termination, I had one write-up in the three years I worked there and was told often I was a valuable team member to the store,\u201d said Doan. \u201cKnowing that I have a strong and close relationship with my store, it made no sense to me that they would suddenly change their tune unless they had another reason to do so.\u201d Whole Foods denied Doan\u2019s firing was retaliatory and said she had violated company policies. \u201cAny suggestion that the separation of this team member is related to any form of retaliation is completely false. The team member admitted to violating well-established policies,\u201d a spokesperson said. Two workers at a Whole Foods in Bedford, New Hampshire, have been protesting outside the store after management told them they could not wear face masks displaying messages of support for the anti-racism protests. A Whole Foods spokesperson said company dress code prohibits visible slogans, messages, or logos that are not company related, and the employees were offered other face masks, which only one accepted. Other workers around the US have reported facing retaliation from employers in response to supporting or participating in the George Floyd protests. Jamila Swopes, a physical therapist in Gulfport, Mississippi, claimed she was fired the day she stood up against two white co-workers who were disparaging the protests. Two black journalists at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette were removed from covering the protests. In Columbus, Ohio, a server at the Forum at Kingsbridge, a five-star senior living facility, who requested to remain anonymous over concerns for future employment prospects, said she was fired after her employer found out she participated in local George Floyd protests. \u201cI\u2019m just about to start working, I get pulled out of the kitchen and they ask me why I called off the day before. I told them my voice was gone and my feet were hurting because I was out protesting and didn\u2019t get home until late because the police weren\u2019t providing ways for people to leave. They say \u2018you are not allowed to protest\u2019,\u201d said the server. Her manager then told her she was laid off, citing coronavirus concerns to residents. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a good reason to let me go, they could have just had me quarantined. No matter how I try to fight this, they\u2019re always going to use something against me \u2013 I\u2019m a black woman trying to fight against them, it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d the worker said. The Forum at Knightsbridge declined to comment, citing an ongoing HR process.",

They assign new urgency to longstanding issues. \u201cIf you declare something an emergency, you\u2019re also saying it\u2019s imperative to address the problem,\u201d Agwu said.</p> \n<p>In San Bernardino, pastor Samuel Casey, one of the community leaders and activists who pushed the county to declare a crisis, said the move is an important first step. \u201cI fought for this because I was just sick and tired of being sick and tired,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some of our neighborhoods, kids are birthed into the generational trauma of slavery, and they\u2019re traumatized by systemic oppression.\u201d By focusing on health, activists were able to capture all the racist institutional and social structures that erode the wellbeing of Black and Brown people, Casey explained.</p> \n<p>Decades of research back up their case. Police have fatally shot about 1,000 people a year in recent years, disproportionately killing Black people, as documented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">the Guardian\u2019s Counted</a> project. The criminal justice system disproportionately jails African Americans and Latino people. Housing segregation and racist housing policies have limited access to education and healthcare, and left minorities disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/09/the-blackest-city-in-the-is-us-facing-an-environmental-justice-nightmare\">exposed</a> to toxic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/16/louisiana-cancer-alley-residents-march-pollution\">cancer-causing</a> chemicals in the water they drink, the air they breathe.</p> \n<p>Amid the pandemic, a labor market structured by racism means that Black and Latino people working frontline jobs as nurses, grocery staff, cleaners and transit workers are disproportionately exposed to the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of a number of coronavirus patients, and I\u2019ve had frank discussions with my Black patients about their risks,\u201d said Dr Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine. \u201cAnd as a Black provider, I offer that perspective in a way that doesn\u2019t feel as painful or threatening.\u201d But pervasive discrimination within the medical system also contributes to bad health outcomes, she noted. \u201cBlack people aren\u2019t believed when they\u2019re in pain,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f487ef5fb81e8ef66a801b82e045d2090396730\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f487ef5fb81e8ef66a801b82e045d2090396730/0_0_5775_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses take a stand for racial justice outside of Bellevue hospital in New York City, in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses take a stand for racial justice outside of Bellevue hospital in New York City, in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Sanchez/Pacific Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Discrimination as a chronic illness</h2> \n<p>Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard, who previously served as a New York City health commissioner, said race can also gradually erode physical wellbeing in less obvious ways. A growing body of research has found links between the chronic stress of experiencing discrimination and health disorders; for instance, people who endure years of microaggressions develop <a href=\"https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/race-discrimination-and-cardiovascular-disease/2014-06\">heart disease</a> more rapidly. A <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.128.suppl_22.a9550\">study</a> of Black women found that stress from frequent racist encounters was associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Other research <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/20/570777510/how-racism-may-cause-black-mothers-to-suffer-the-death-of-their-infants\">suggests</a> that pregnant women who report high levels of discrimination tend give birth to babies that have a lower birth weight.</p> \n<p>Some researchers have also linked the constant stress of being marginalized to a phenomenon called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470581/\">weathering</a>\u201d \u2013 which accelerates ageing on a genetic level. \u201cOf course, the answer to all this is not sending everyone on a yoga retreat \u2013 though that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. We still need to address the structural issues,\u201d Bassett said. Doing so will probably involve a range of reforms across many different departments of local governments, she told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>To that end, Somerville, Massachusetts \u2013 along with declaring a public safety and health emergency \u2013 announced it would withdraw from a federal defense department program that provides military weapons to police departments and committed to implementing a 10-point plan to reform law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/02/ayanna-pressley-rachael-rollins-police-reform-violence-racism-press-conference\">developed</a> by US representative Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat of Massachusetts. Cleveland lawmakers are planning to create a community advisory board to help shape legislation to address health disparities.</p> \n<p>In San Bernardino, community activists plan to keep the pressure on officials to go beyond a ceremonial declaration, by addressing not only the criminal justice and policing system that doles out \u201cinstant death\u201d for Black men, Casey said, but also inequities in the education and medical system.</p> \n<p>\u201cRacism is a pandemic just like Covid-19 is a pandemic,\u201d Casey said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been dealing with the coronavirus for, what, four months? We\u2019ve had systematic oppression for 400-plus years.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

In San Bernardino, pastor Samuel Casey, one of the community leaders and activists who pushed the county to declare a crisis, said the move is an important first step. \u201cI fought for this because I was just sick and tired of being sick and tired,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some of our neighborhoods, kids are birthed into the generational trauma of slavery, and they\u2019re traumatized by systemic oppression.\u201d By focusing on health, activists were able to capture all the racist institutional and social structures that erode the wellbeing of Black and Brown people, Casey explained. Decades of research back up their case. Police have fatally shot about 1,000 people a year in recent years, disproportionately killing Black people, as documented by the Guardian\u2019s Counted project. The criminal justice system disproportionately jails African Americans and Latino people. Housing segregation and racist housing policies have limited access to education and healthcare, and left minorities disproportionately exposed to toxic and cancer-causing chemicals in the water they drink, the air they breathe. Amid the pandemic, a labor market structured by racism means that Black and Latino people working frontline jobs as nurses, grocery staff, cleaners and transit workers are disproportionately exposed to the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of a number of coronavirus patients, and I\u2019ve had frank discussions with my Black patients about their risks,\u201d said Dr Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine. \u201cAnd as a Black provider, I offer that perspective in a way that doesn\u2019t feel as painful or threatening.\u201d But pervasive discrimination within the medical system also contributes to bad health outcomes, she noted. \u201cBlack people aren\u2019t believed when they\u2019re in pain,\u201d she said. Discrimination as a chronic illness Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard, who previously served as a New York City health commissioner, said race can also gradually erode physical wellbeing in less obvious ways. A growing body of research has found links between the chronic stress of experiencing discrimination and health disorders; for instance, people who endure years of microaggressions develop heart disease more rapidly. A study of Black women found that stress from frequent racist encounters was associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Other research suggests that pregnant women who report high levels of discrimination tend give birth to babies that have a lower birth weight. Some researchers have also linked the constant stress of being marginalized to a phenomenon called \u201cweathering\u201d \u2013 which accelerates ageing on a genetic level. \u201cOf course, the answer to all this is not sending everyone on a yoga retreat \u2013 though that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. We still need to address the structural issues,\u201d Bassett said. Doing so will probably involve a range of reforms across many different departments of local governments, she told the Guardian. To that end, Somerville, Massachusetts \u2013 along with declaring a public safety and health emergency \u2013 announced it would withdraw from a federal defense department program that provides military weapons to police departments and committed to implementing a 10-point plan to reform law enforcement developed by US representative Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat of Massachusetts. Cleveland lawmakers are planning to create a community advisory board to help shape legislation to address health disparities. In San Bernardino, community activists plan to keep the pressure on officials to go beyond a ceremonial declaration, by addressing not only the criminal justice and policing system that doles out \u201cinstant death\u201d for Black men, Casey said, but also inequities in the education and medical system. \u201cRacism is a pandemic just like Covid-19 is a pandemic,\u201d Casey said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been dealing with the coronavirus for, what, four months? We\u2019ve had systematic oppression for 400-plus years.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>On Saturday, my wife and I went to join a short vigil for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> on Tooting Bec common. It was a very orderly, socially distanced affair \u2013 so much so that standing near the back I couldn\u2019t hear any of the speeches as there was no PA system. All I could do was take my lead from what others were doing. So I clapped when other people clapped and got down on one knee when everyone else did. This was something of a problem as I have a metal knee and I was in a lot of discomfort throughout \u2013 kneeling down is still painful even years after the operation \u2013 and my wife had to help me to get upright again. Other Black Lives Matter events weren\u2019t quite so peaceful. Violence broke out in London, while in Bristol, the statue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Edward Colston</a> was pulled off its plinth and rolled into the river. The statement on the protests in the Commons was a classic piece of parliamentary hypocrisy. Because while MPs on all sides were keen to condemn the civil disorder, everyone seemed secretly relieved that the statue had been removed. Certainly no one called for it to be reinstated. Bristol council has now decided that the statue\u2019s final resting place should be in the local museum which feels like the right decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e736296a02e6d95384953e54fdaa7f259feb30aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e736296a02e6d95384953e54fdaa7f259feb30aa/269_0_2390_2387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frederick Douglass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American social reformer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass visited Bristol in 1844.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Granger/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However I was quite taken with a more creative solution suggested to me by Aidan Quinn who runs the <a href=\"http://www.beauxartsbath.co.uk/about/\">Beaux Arts</a> gallery in Bath. He wanted to melt down the statue of Colston and invite a local artist to recast it as the American social reformer and abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2018/jul/05/the-frederick-douglass-200\">Frederick Douglass</a> who visited Bristol in 1844. There is no reason why all statues have to exist in situ in perpetuity and for some to be time limited seems to be an important acknowledgment that history is as much a study of the present as it is of the past.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s sod\u2019s law. There were we wondering if we were ever going to get a holiday this year \u2013 we\u2019ve long since given up any hope of going to America to see our daughter \u2013 when my wife, along with two other couples, took a punt that Airbnb holidays might be a goer later this summer and put down a deposit on a week\u2019s stay in a Norfolk house for the first week in September. Now it turns out that parliament has plans to curtail its own holidays and come back a week earlier than planned which would be the same week we were in Norfolk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-says-removing-statues-is-to-lie-about-our-history-george-floyd\">Boris Johnson says removing statues is 'to lie about our history'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The official reason for the government\u2019s change of heart is that it has a lot of business it needs to get through. After the events of the past week, please excuse my hollow laughter, as parliament has gone out of its way to waste its own time, not to mention money, and that of the entire country. First we had Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s absurd change to procedures which resulted in MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">queueing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">for 90 minutes</a> to vote on preventing some other MPs who were either carers, shielding, socially isolating or who had to travel long distances from taking part in debates or voting. Since then the government has had to make so many concessions that parliament is basically back to operating how it was before Rees-Mogg took matters into his own hands. We\u2019ve also had to endure the spectacle of the government doing a U-turn on all children going back to school. So, if on the vague off-chance that Airbnb holidays with other couples are allowed and we aren\u2019t in a second major lockdown, then I\u2019m planning on taking my holiday regardless. I can\u2019t plan my entire life around the government\u2019s incompetence.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Speaking on the phone to my daughter, it seems that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/george-floyd-killing-minneapolis-protest-police\">Minneapolis</a> is gradually returning to some kind of normality. The protests have thinned out and the national guard is less visible. Also, having shut down a lot later than us \u2013 I remember conversations we had in early March in which she said that the coronavirus just wasn\u2019t on the US radar \u2013 Minneapolis has now eased almost all of its lockdown regulations. It\u2019s not immediately clear if this has been done on a scientific basis or because the city authorities are keen to ease some of the tensions that sparked the protests, but restaurants and gyms are now open and everyone is now free to meet pretty much anyone they want, subject to physical-distancing guidelines. It\u2019s made me realise just how easily institutionalised I am. When I came out of hospital after a longish stay some years back, I found being at home totally disorientating and quite scary. But that was nothing to how I feel about the possibility of the government lifting lockdown measures here. At least with the hospital, I trusted that the doctors were making the right clinical decision to discharge me. But with this government, I have no faith that Boris Johnson will make the right decisions for the right reasons at the right time. I chose to put myself in isolation a week before it became official government policy and I will maintain a similarly cautious approach for a few weeks after lockdown is eased. Even though my 96-year-old mother has seen off Covid-19, I\u2019m not willing to take any chances myself. I have always been a creature of habits, and right now my habit is staying indoors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c47857915ea139b9890cf9ef2f565f34f0e36110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47857915ea139b9890cf9ef2f565f34f0e36110/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson with windswept hair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson: \u2018Don\u2019t worry.

Now the only way we can get any parliamentary scrutiny is for Labour to table an urgent question, and even then Gove couldn\u2019t be bothered to turn up in person. Instead he let a junior minister, Penny Mordaunt, take the flak. Also missing in action this week was the accident-prone Robert Jenrick. Having caused controversy by travelling from London to visit his parents in Shropshire during lockdown, the housing minister has got himself into trouble by overruling Tower Hamlets council to allow the Tory donor Richard Desmond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/robert-jenrick-ducks-commons-question-planning-intervention-richard-desmond\">planning permission</a> for the Westferry development the day before he would have been liable for a \u00a340m tax surcharge. To add to the intrigue, Jenrick was not only on the same table as Desmond at a Tory fundraiser in January, at which the development was raised, he also later admitted that his granting of permission was unlawful. A few weeks later, Desmond paid \u00a312,000 to the Tory party. Understandably, the opposition parties suspect that the ministerial code may have been somewhat stretched, and today managed to secure an urgent question so that Jenrick could explain how his actions had been totally above board. Only Jenrick pleaded the fifth amendment and sent along the junior minister Chris Pincher to face the music instead. As Pincher had clearly only been briefed on how not to give direct answers, MPs left the chamber none the wiser than they had been at the beginning. At any other time, this would have been a major scandal. But in the new coronavirus normal, it was just a minor inconvenience to be shrugged off. The crisis is good news for some.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s less than a week until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-project-restart-the-key-questions-answered\">Premier League restarts</a> and I still find myself totally underwhelmed by the prospect. This isn\u2019t at all how I imagined I would feel back in March \u2013 I thought that I\u2019d be ecstatic \u2013 and I\u2019m not entirely sure why. Part of it must be partisan: at the start of the lockdown, Spurs were playing like a bunch of strangers and had nothing to look forward to apart from the outside possibility of qualifying for the Europa League \u2013 a competition many clubs try to avoid \u2013 so the final nine matches always felt as if they were going to be an ordeal to be endured. Then there\u2019s the thought of the rest of the season being played out behind closed doors. I like my football live, preferably with me in the crowd, and the idea of empty stadiums in which three DJs \u2013 one for a remix of home team chants, one for the away fans and a neutral one for background noise of fans talking to each other about how everything is basically a bit pointless \u2013 competing over the PA system to provide atmosphere, feels soulless. I go to football as much to escape from myself for 90 minutes \u2013 to lose myself in something over which I have no control \u2013 as for the game itself. Not that I intend to boycott the games \u2013 I\u2019ll be sat in front of the TV for all Spurs\u2019 remaining fixtures along with a whole lot of matches in which the main attraction is wanting the team I hate more to lose \u2013 but I do wonder how much lockdown has affected me. This time next year, will the coronavirus just feel like a distant, bad memory with life having gone back to normal, or will it have changed my relationship with the world in a more permanent way? Not least with my sense of risk. I know I will go back to live sport, just as I will go back to opera, theatre and concerts, because life without them is a life half-lived. But I think it will be some years before I can do so without having a niggling worry there is someone in the crowd or audience who could unwittingly kill me.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> A 20.4% drop in GDP.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"524ec83ae6965b2804fda706fc58579e66203046\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/524ec83ae6965b2804fda706fc58579e66203046/0_94_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social distancing markers at the penguin enclosure at ZSL London Zoo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture of the week: \u2018Don\u2019t know what you\u2019re moaning about.

I like my football live, preferably with me in the crowd, and the idea of empty stadiums in which three DJs \u2013 one for a remix of home team chants, one for the away fans and a neutral one for background noise of fans talking to each other about how everything is basically a bit pointless \u2013 competing over the PA system to provide atmosphere, feels soulless. I go to football as much to escape from myself for 90 minutes \u2013 to lose myself in something over which I have no control \u2013 as for the game itself. Not that I intend to boycott the games \u2013 I\u2019ll be sat in front of the TV for all Spurs\u2019 remaining fixtures along with a whole lot of matches in which the main attraction is wanting the team I hate more to lose \u2013 but I do wonder how much lockdown has affected me. This time next year, will the coronavirus just feel like a distant, bad memory with life having gone back to normal, or will it have changed my relationship with the world in a more permanent way? Not least with my sense of risk. I know I will go back to live sport, just as I will go back to opera, theatre and concerts, because life without them is a life half-lived. But I think it will be some years before I can do so without having a niggling worry there is someone in the crowd or audience who could unwittingly kill me.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is facing a growing outcry for choosing to hold his first election rally during the coronavirus pandemic in Tulsa, Oklahoma \u2013 the scene of one of the worst race massacres in US history in 1921. The rally will also be held on 19 June \u2013 known as \u201cJuneteenth\u201d \u2013 the anniversary of the day in 1865 when a general read out Abraham Lincoln\u2019s emancipation proclamation in Texas, freeing slaves in the last un-emancipated state. The decision to hold the rally in Tulsa in the midst of nationwide protests over racist violence and discrimination, triggered by the police killing of George Floyd, has been criticised as all the more incendiary for the widely understood historic symbolism of the Tulsa race massacre in which up to 300 black Americans were killed by white mobs. Critics accused the president of \u201cracially motivated trolling\u201d and timing akin to \u201cblasphemy\u201d. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a wink to white supremacists \u2013 he\u2019s throwing them a welcome home party,\u201d tweeted senator Kamala Harris of California, who is widely seen to be a leading candidate for Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate ahead of the November election. Sherry Gamble Smith, the president of Tulsa\u2019s Black Wall Street Chamber of Commerce, an organisation named after the prosperous black community that white Oklahomans burned down in the 1921 attack, said: \u201cTo choose the date, to come to Tulsa, is totally disrespectful and a slap in the face to even happen.\u201d If the rally went ahead, Gamble Smith said, the least the campaign could do is change the date to 20 June. Writing in the Washington Post, poet CeLillianne Green, described the move as \u201calmost blasphemous to the people of Tulsa and insulting to the notion of freedom for our people, which is what Juneteenth symbolises,\u201d and in the New York Times, the columnist Michelle Goldberg decried the move under the headline: \u201cA racist president trolls his enemies with a rally on Juneteenth.\u201d Those attending the rally have been asked to sign a waiver to say the Trump campaign is not liable if they contract coronavirus at the event. The massacre took place over two days from 31 May to 1 June in the highly segregated city, with mobs attacking the Greenwood neighbourhood of the city, known as Black Wall Street for its prosperity. Following a familiar pattern to the racist lynchings of the era, the attacks started with accusations that a 19-year-old black man, Dick Rowland, had assaulted Sarah Page, a 17-year-old white girl. As he was arrested, rumours spread that the accused man was about to be lynched leading to confrontations outside the courtroom in which shots were fired, and leading to exchanges that killed a dozen people. That in turn triggered white mobs to attack black businesses, homes and individuals. Over two days of violence, according to a later Red Cross estimate, 1,256 houses were burned, and two newspaper offices, a school, a library, a hospital, churches, hotels, stores and black-owned businesses were among the buildings destroyed or damaged by fire. Although the official tally at the time claimed just 36 people had been killed, historians believe the number to be considerably higher. In 2001, the report of the Race Riot Commission suggested there were between 100 and 300 deaths. The US journalist Dan Rather said on Twitter: \u201cSo. Let\u2019s set the stage...

The campaign was aware that the date for the president\u2019s return to rallies was Juneteenth, according to two campaign officials, who were not authorised to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity. They said that when the date was discussed, it was noted that Biden had held a fundraiser a year ago on Juneteenth.

Arizona has more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases a day When Arizona lifted its stay-at-home orders last month, the state was recording fewer than 400 confirmed new Covid-19 cases a day. Now, with the south-west facing a surge in infections, Arizona\u2019s daily count is more than 1,000. The Republican governor, Doug Ducey, insists the rise is at least partly attributable to increased testing \u2013 but critics say he is doing too little to address the continuing crisis. New Yorkers are quitting the city, according to real estate brokers who say the coronavirus crisis has generated a boom in demand for homes upstate and on Long Island. India is experiencing a surge in Covid-19 infections as its lockdown eases, while the WHO has warned the spread of the disease is accelerating in Africa. America\u2019s top military officer apologises for Trump\u2019s photo op The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \u2013 the most senior US military official \u2013 has publicly apologised for taking part in the president\u2019s controversial photo opportunity at a church in Washington DC last week. Gen Mark Milley admitted it was \u201ca mistake\u201d for him to appear with Trump after police had violently ousted protesters from Lafayette Square, saying his presence had \u201ccreated a perception of the military involved in domestic politics\u201d. The Trump administration is imposing sanctions on the international criminal court, after it opened an investigation into war crimes committed by all participants in the war in Afghanistan, including the US. Joe Biden has said the military would escort Trump from office if he lost the election in November but refused to leave the White House. Speaking on the Daily Show, the Democrat said his greatest concern was that Trump would \u201ctry to steal this election\u201d. In other news \u2026 Climate change can be directly blamed for $67bn in damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, which tore through the Caribbean, Texas and Louisiana in 2017, according to new research. New US sanctions on Syria could prove devastating. The \u201cCaesar Act\u201d law, set to take effect next week, was supposed to punish the perpetrators of war crimes \u2013 but observers say it also threatens to crush what is left of the country\u2019s already shattered economy. Twitter has deleted 170,000 accounts linked to China\u2019s influence campaigns focusing on the Hong Kong protests, Covid-19 and the US protests over the death of George Floyd. \u2026 But Zoom admitted bowing to Beijing\u2019s demands by cutting off the accounts of activists hosting online meetings to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Great reads Spike Lee: \u2018Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates\u2019 As his new film Da 5 Bloods arrives on Netflix, the celebrated director takes questions from readers, film-makers and politicians about Covid-19, race relations and a Do the Right Thing remake: \u201cIf they try, I\u2019m coming back from the dead to stop it.\u201d How Fannie Lou Hamer stood up to white supremacy Amid the current protests, many people are looking to the civil rights movement of the 1960s for inspiration. Author Tommy Jenkins and illustrator Kati Lacker present the story, in graphic form, of Fannie Lou Hamer, a heroic Mississippi sharecropper who endured violence and imprisonment as she fought for the right to vote. Opinion: the arts world faces a fierce reckoning over diversity Publishing and the arts have this week undergone a public reckoning over race and inequality, with resignations, cancellations and apologies across the media. If real change is coming to the industry this time, says Arwa Mahdawi, then it is long overdue. It feels like we might actually be on the verge of actual change. It feels like this might actually be a real reckoning, rather than a panicked reaction to a cultural moment.

I think it\u2019s 180-something now. It\u2019s just constant.\u201d</p> \n<p>The situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland has been clearer, with the devolved administrations deciding earlier on that children were not returning this school year. In Wales, the guidance is that all children will return on 29 June. But until this week, English schools had been in limbo.</p> \n<p>Parry\u2019s schools had been looking after key worker and vulnerable children for more than two months before government decided to tell schools to keep children 2 metres apart, he said: \u201cThey\u2019ve been washing hands lots and being sensible, but they are primary school kids. We weren\u2019t able to adhere to the 2-metre rule.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are only three classrooms at Thornsett, which is perched on a hillside above the town of New Mills. They are already at capacity, with 29 pupils back from reception, year 1 and year 6, split into three \u201cbubbles\u201d that don\u2019t mix. It was never feasible to have all the children back and abide by physical-distancing rules, said Parry.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e71b2da5cb247819061a8e923a1547e56c5996d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e71b2da5cb247819061a8e923a1547e56c5996d/0_441_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Headteacher Ashley Parry at Thornsett primary school in New Mills, Derbyshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headteacher Ashley Parry at Thornsett primary school in New Mills, Derbyshire.

She is the head of St Mary\u2019s, an outstanding primary school with 420 pupils, 90% of whom speak English as a second language. About 70% of students qualify for free school meals.</p> \n<p>The government has failed to understand how difficult it can be getting vulnerable children into school at the best of times, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe relationship between disadvantaged families and school is complex. Often they are families who struggle to engage with school when things are typical. There needs to be an acknowledgment that getting children back to school is not just about having the space but also having the conversation, the hearts and minds part.\u201d</p> \n<p>The vast majority of children and many staff at St Mary\u2019s are black or from another ethic minority, a group known to be at higher risk of dying from Covid-19. \u201cThere is an added anxiety for them. Parents are anxious. We\u2019ve had a lot of doorstep visits, a lot of phone calls but parents still aren\u2019t completely convinced that school is safe before September so we have very low numbers,\u201d said McGarry.</p> \n<p>The school surveyed parents and found 80% did not want to send their children back at all until September. About 30% of staff are unable to come in, either because they are shielding or have family members who are. Even McGarry is coordinating everything at home, being clinically vulnerable herself.</p> \n<p>St Mary\u2019s reopened to year 6 on Monday but only five pupils showed up. McGarry has a few theories why. \u201cSome of our families are quite big and they might only be sending one child back and have the rest at home, so it doesn\u2019t make life easier. Also, if you look at our level of free school meals, our levels of unemployment are incredibly high, so that pressure to get back to work is probably felt a little bit less than schools in more affluent areas,\u201d she said. It had not gone unnoticed that the government said parents would not be fined for keeping children at home, she added: \u201cBut we are trying to whip up interest on a daily basis.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/11/i-dont-feel-i-can-say-no-parents-torn-on-sending-children-back-to-school\">'I don't feel I can say no': parents torn on sending children back to school</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A month into lockdown, the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-major-package-to-support-online-learning\">announced a scheme</a> to give laptops to all vulnerable and disadvantaged children. But the criteria was so strict that only three of St Mary\u2019s students qualified. They are still waiting for the laptops.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the school bought laptops and iPads for about 15 other families, sometimes showing parents how to set up email addresses for the first time.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have other families where the mum is using data on her phone and perhaps four kids all trying to access remote learning,\u201d said McGarry. A less centralised approach would have been better, she said: \u201cIf we have been given the funding ourselves we could have gone out and bought equipment right at the start for those who needed it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Sunderland, which has one of the highest number of Covid-19 cases in England (499 per 100,000 people, compared with the English average of 279), staff at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic primary school in Penshaw, Houghton-le-Spring, have been working non-stop since February half-term, throughout the Easter holidays and taking just one Bank Holiday Monday off. \u201cWe have been particularly lucky and blessed that staff were fit and able to keep working,\u201d said the headteacher, Barbara Reilly-O\u2019Donnell.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted.

The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Staff have pulled out all the stops to try to reassure the children, she said. Some have filmed themselves reading stories and put them on YouTube: \u201cIt\u2019s nice for the children to see a familiar face, to give them some certainty that not everything has changed in their life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like all the headteachers interviewed for this story, Reilly-O\u2019Donnell was taken aback to hear Boris Johnson announce this week \u201ca big summer of catchup\u201d for pupils who have missed months of lessons in the lockdown. \u201cDo I want all children to catch up? Well of course I do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to explore lots of different avenues how to do that \u2026 I\u2019m disappointed we haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity to explore what that might look like and the quality of that provision.\u201d</p> \n<p>In High Peak, Parry is categorical his staff will not be working at a summer school, as they are on the verge of burnout after trying to balance the expectations of \u201cparents who expect three Zooms a day and others who just want to be left alone\u201d, he said. \u201cStaff are exhausted. It\u2019s just a non-starter.\u201d</p> \n<p>In York, Tomsett does not think schools will be back to normal in September. \u201cI\u2019m planning for three scenarios: a spike happens and we are completely closed, we\u2019re completely open or it\u2019s 50-50. If it goes down to 1 metre we can get half the school back.\u201d Under 2-metre rules they can only fit eight pupils into a classroom that normally seats 30.</p> \n<p>He pooh-poohed the suggestion that village halls could be co-opted into \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/boris-johnson-nightingale-schools-summer-a4464906.html\">Nightingale schools</a>\u201d providing spillover classrooms.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got coronavirus and you are in hospital, you are either unconscious or unbelievably compliant and just want people to help you. You don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in some warehouse. If you\u2019re a year 10, in a town hall being taught by someone you\u2019ve never met, the situation is completely different.\u201d</p> \n<p>He, too, questioned how these pop-up schools would be staffed. While the NHS seemed to have little trouble coaxing doctors out of retirement, the same may well not be true for teachers, he added: \u201cLots of teachers have gone into retirement for very good reason: because they never want to teach again. It\u2019s completely different. I just don\u2019t understand the government\u2019s thinking.\u201d</p>",

Then, in a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, conceded defeat. Now, he said, \u201cwe will be working to bring all children back to school in September\u201d. It was just the latest screeching U-turn from an education department that effectively left schools to fend for themselves, and has moved the goalposts so many times over the past 12 weeks that teachers and parents are finding it hard to remember how this interminable guessing game began. That was on 18 March, when Boris Johnson announced all schools in England were to close indefinitely, following similar announcements in Scotland and Wales. Until June, only the most vulnerable children and the offspring of key workers were allowed to go to school, with everyone else muddling along at home. Ashley Parry is headteacher of two small primary schools in High Peak, Derbyshire: Thornsett, which has 85 pupils, and New Town, with 73. \u201cProbably the most difficult thing throughout this has been the constant guidance changes,\u201d he said. \u201cI sent a newsletter out to parents at the end of last month and at that point there had been 150 guidance changes. I think it\u2019s 180-something now. It\u2019s just constant.\u201d The situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland has been clearer, with the devolved administrations deciding earlier on that children were not returning this school year. In Wales, the guidance is that all children will return on 29 June. But until this week, English schools had been in limbo. Parry\u2019s schools had been looking after key worker and vulnerable children for more than two months before government decided to tell schools to keep children 2 metres apart, he said: \u201cThey\u2019ve been washing hands lots and being sensible, but they are primary school kids. We weren\u2019t able to adhere to the 2-metre rule.\u201d There are only three classrooms at Thornsett, which is perched on a hillside above the town of New Mills. They are already at capacity, with 29 pupils back from reception, year 1 and year 6, split into three \u201cbubbles\u201d that don\u2019t mix. It was never feasible to have all the children back and abide by physical-distancing rules, said Parry. Twenty miles to the north-west. in the Moss Side area of Manchester, Jenny McGarry was having problems trying to get her pupils back full stop. She is the head of St Mary\u2019s, an outstanding primary school with 420 pupils, 90% of whom speak English as a second language. About 70% of students qualify for free school meals. The government has failed to understand how difficult it can be getting vulnerable children into school at the best of times, she said. \u201cThe relationship between disadvantaged families and school is complex. Often they are families who struggle to engage with school when things are typical. There needs to be an acknowledgment that getting children back to school is not just about having the space but also having the conversation, the hearts and minds part.\u201d The vast majority of children and many staff at St Mary\u2019s are black or from another ethic minority, a group known to be at higher risk of dying from Covid-19. \u201cThere is an added anxiety for them. Parents are anxious. We\u2019ve had a lot of doorstep visits, a lot of phone calls but parents still aren\u2019t completely convinced that school is safe before September so we have very low numbers,\u201d said McGarry. The school surveyed parents and found 80% did not want to send their children back at all until September. About 30% of staff are unable to come in, either because they are shielding or have family members who are. Even McGarry is coordinating everything at home, being clinically vulnerable herself. St Mary\u2019s reopened to year 6 on Monday but only five pupils showed up. McGarry has a few theories why. \u201cSome of our families are quite big and they might only be sending one child back and have the rest at home, so it doesn\u2019t make life easier. Also, if you look at our level of free school meals, our levels of unemployment are incredibly high, so that pressure to get back to work is probably felt a little bit less than schools in more affluent areas,\u201d she said. It had not gone unnoticed that the government said parents would not be fined for keeping children at home, she added: \u201cBut we are trying to whip up interest on a daily basis.\u201d A month into lockdown, the government announced a scheme to give laptops to all vulnerable and disadvantaged children. But the criteria was so strict that only three of St Mary\u2019s students qualified. They are still waiting for the laptops. In the meantime, the school bought laptops and iPads for about 15 other families, sometimes showing parents how to set up email addresses for the first time. \u201cYou have other families where the mum is using data on her phone and perhaps four kids all trying to access remote learning,\u201d said McGarry. A less centralised approach would have been better, she said: \u201cIf we have been given the funding ourselves we could have gone out and bought equipment right at the start for those who needed it.\u201d In Sunderland, which has one of the highest number of Covid-19 cases in England (499 per 100,000 people, compared with the English average of 279), staff at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic primary school in Penshaw, Houghton-le-Spring, have been working non-stop since February half-term, throughout the Easter holidays and taking just one Bank Holiday Monday off. \u201cWe have been particularly lucky and blessed that staff were fit and able to keep working,\u201d said the headteacher, Barbara Reilly-O\u2019Donnell. Staff have pulled out all the stops to try to reassure the children, she said. Some have filmed themselves reading stories and put them on YouTube: \u201cIt\u2019s nice for the children to see a familiar face, to give them some certainty that not everything has changed in their life.\u201d Like all the headteachers interviewed for this story, Reilly-O\u2019Donnell was taken aback to hear Boris Johnson announce this week \u201ca big summer of catchup\u201d for pupils who have missed months of lessons in the lockdown. \u201cDo I want all children to catch up? Well of course I do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to explore lots of different avenues how to do that \u2026 I\u2019m disappointed we haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity to explore what that might look like and the quality of that provision.\u201d In High Peak, Parry is categorical his staff will not be working at a summer school, as they are on the verge of burnout after trying to balance the expectations of \u201cparents who expect three Zooms a day and others who just want to be left alone\u201d, he said. \u201cStaff are exhausted. It\u2019s just a non-starter.\u201d In York, Tomsett does not think schools will be back to normal in September. \u201cI\u2019m planning for three scenarios: a spike happens and we are completely closed, we\u2019re completely open or it\u2019s 50-50. If it goes down to 1 metre we can get half the school back.\u201d Under 2-metre rules they can only fit eight pupils into a classroom that normally seats 30. He pooh-poohed the suggestion that village halls could be co-opted into \u201cNightingale schools\u201d providing spillover classrooms. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got coronavirus and you are in hospital, you are either unconscious or unbelievably compliant and just want people to help you. You don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in some warehouse. If you\u2019re a year 10, in a town hall being taught by someone you\u2019ve never met, the situation is completely different.\u201d He, too, questioned how these pop-up schools would be staffed. While the NHS seemed to have little trouble coaxing doctors out of retirement, the same may well not be true for teachers, he added: \u201cLots of teachers have gone into retirement for very good reason: because they never want to teach again. It\u2019s completely different. I just don\u2019t understand the government\u2019s thinking.\u201d",

The Fed has ruled out interest rate rises for the foreseeable future indicating it thinks things will be difficult for the medium term. This is good for stock markets. </p> <p>For instance, the GDP output of the UK economy fell by 20.4% in April. But at the time of writing, the FTSE 100 is up over 1% today. Although the GDP fall is unprecedented, it is no surprise given this is when the economy went into lockdown. The stock market is not reacting aversely to historic information.</p> <p>Now, it is reacting more to how we come out of this. The government has provided a good deal of support thus far and will likely have to think carefully about how it deals with each sector in the coming months. The ongoing effect of CV19 will not be the same for each industry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee366658f08cdef7bed4351\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T11:32:07.697Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 in London is 1.2% ahead, rising 74 points to 6,152.

US stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later.</p> <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at trading platform Spreadex, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a torrid week, Europe attempted to reignite June\u2019s rally, doing so with a fair amount of gusto.</p> <p>There was little reason behind Friday\u2019s gains, beyond investors deciding that the severe losses of the last few days provide a handy entry point to a market that had gone on a hell of a run at the start of the month.</p> <p>A huge reason why Europe feels comfortable enough to post such gains is that the Dow Jones is aiming for a 600 point rebound when the bell rings on Wall Street. It\u2019s a sign of just how staggering Thursday\u2019s losses were that such a surge would only recoup a third of that decline.

In Brexit news, the UK has told the EU that it will NOT apply for an extension to the transition period, which ends on 31 December. The European Commission\u2019s vice president Maros Sefcovic said there is still a lot of work to do before a trade deal can be struck and the window of opportunity is closing for London before the transition period ends, Reuters reported. He spoke after talks with British cabinet office minister Michael Gove, who told him the UK had no intention of asking for an extension of the transition period beyond the end of this year. Ali has extended its trial of grocery home deliveries in partnership with Deliveroo into London. The German chain will offer the service at its Camden store and customers will be able to order around 200 essential products through the Deliveroo app, which will be delivered by Deliveroo riders. Delivery costs \u00a34.99. Last month, Aldi started a trial at eight stores in the east Midlands, which has gone well. it said: In the three weeks since we launched our partnership with Deliveroo, feedback from customers has been very positive. Unlike the other big supermarkets, Aldi does not usually deliver, apart from wine and non-food items such as electrical appliances and garden tools. The Deliveroo tie-up came after Aldi started selling online food parcels in April. The \u00a324.99 food parcels, designed to help vulnerable and elderly shoppers, contain 22 set essential products including rice, pasta, tea and toilet roll and are delivered directly from Aldi\u2019s warehouse. Let\u2019s take another look at today\u2019s other news. As reported earlier, British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have filed papers in the high court to seek an urgent judicial review of the government\u2019s quarantine laws, which they say are having a devastating effect on tourism and the wider economy. Here\u2019s our story: And UK travellers have been urged not to bring hand luggage on board to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, under new government guidance. Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx and the Bash Street Kids \u2013 characters from the popular Beano comics \u2013 will soon be teaching primary school children about money. Beano for Schools is a new primary school teaching resource on money and financial wellbeing, brought to us by the Bank of England, Beano and Tes, formerly known as the Times Educational Supplement, a weekly UK publication aimed at education professionals. It will be included in the Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) curriculum. The website, which can be previewed here, has a set of 12 lessons about Money and Me where the Beano gang will educate youngsters between 5 and 11 about the basics of how money and the economy work. It launches in July. Teachers can sign up now to register their interest in the free resource. To mark My Money Week, the Bank of England announced the collaboration. Andrew Bailey, its governor, said: Financial literacy is essential for everyone. The Bank\u2019s education programme is central to our role in equipping the public with sufficient financial and economic knowledge for their daily lives. We are delighted to partner with Beano and Tes on the new Money and Me resource, which will take our programme into primary schools. It will support teachers in giving young people a strong sense of the importance of economic and financial decisions from an early age. Emma Scott, chief executive of Beano Studios, says: Beano has been engaging children for more than 80 years, and we love bringing that experience to the classroom. Our Beano for Schools programme translates complex topics into entertaining and engaging content for both kids and teachers and we\u2019ve had fun producing these unique financial literacy lessons so kids can enjoy learning about money and gain necessary life skills. Derrick Dunne, chief executive at Beaufort Investment, explains why markets have shrugged off the staggering falls in UK GDP and eurozone industrial production in April. Yesterday\u2019s falls aside, the markets have been buoyant while we get more Q2 data for the real economy. The Fed has ruled out interest rate rises for the foreseeable future indicating it thinks things will be difficult for the medium term. This is good for stock markets. For instance, the GDP output of the UK economy fell by 20.4% in April. But at the time of writing, the FTSE 100 is up over 1% today. Although the GDP fall is unprecedented, it is no surprise given this is when the economy went into lockdown. The stock market is not reacting aversely to historic information. Now, it is reacting more to how we come out of this. The government has provided a good deal of support thus far and will likely have to think carefully about how it deals with each sector in the coming months. The ongoing effect of CV19 will not be the same for each industry. The FTSE 100 in London is 1.2% ahead, rising 74 points to 6,152. Germany\u2019s Dax has gained 1.1% to 12,104, France\u2019s CAC 40 has rallied 2% to 4,913 and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has added 1.27% to 19,046. US stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at trading platform Spreadex, explains: After a torrid week, Europe attempted to reignite June\u2019s rally, doing so with a fair amount of gusto. There was little reason behind Friday\u2019s gains, beyond investors deciding that the severe losses of the last few days provide a handy entry point to a market that had gone on a hell of a run at the start of the month. A huge reason why Europe feels comfortable enough to post such gains is that the Dow Jones is aiming for a 600 point rebound when the bell rings on Wall Street. It\u2019s a sign of just how staggering Thursday\u2019s losses were that such a surge would only recoup a third of that decline. Nevertheless, it is a strong comeback, especially considering the US increasingly looks like it is going to face a second wave of coronavirus cases. In terms of data, US import prices are set to rise from -2.6% to 0.6% month-on-month, while the preliminary consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan is expected to jump from 72.3 to 75.0. The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research has published its analysis of this morning\u2019s GDP data from the Office for National Statistics. You can read it here. It says the UK economy looks set to decline by 20% to 25% in the second quarter, a significantly steeper decline than the first quarter\u2019s 2% drop, reflecting the full impact of lockdown measures. Kemar Whyte, senior economist at the economic research institute, says: The economy now appears to have bottomed out, as recent survey evidence suggests an easing in the rate of contraction in the manufacturing and services sector. The re-opening of non-essential stores from 15 June, coupled with the government\u2019s continued support should aid a gradual, albeit limited, recovery in domestic activity. Turning to other glittery matters, gold is heading for its biggest weekly gain since early April, as economic optimism has faded. Spot gold is up 0.5% today to $1,735 an ounce, which means it\u2019s on course for a weekly gain of about 3%. Peter Fertig, an analyst at Quantitative Commodity Research, told Reuters: One of the reasons has been the statement from the FOMC and the testimony of the [Fed chair] Jerome Powell, painting a darker picture of the US economy. There is talk about a second wave, especially after cases of new infections of the virus have risen again in some countries. A warning which many people ignored. And Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at trading platform ActivTrades, notes: As at the start of the crisis in March, the turmoil in stock markets did not generate any immediate rally in gold [yesterday], as such a violent correction also meant some investors needed quick liquidity for margin calls, and had to close their (profitable) positions on gold in order to keep alive some other less fortunate trades. The main trend remains supportive for bullion, which is recovering strength this morning, in a favourable environment for other gains. In the \u201creal world,\u201d the world\u2019s biggest exhibition company expects to host its first major post-Covid-19 event in China next month. My colleague Mark Sweney reports: Informa, the world\u2019s largest exhibition company, said it has cancelled or postponed more than 160 events worth \u00a3300m in revenue and a further 300 have been run as digital instead of physical events. The company, which raised \u00a31bn in April to help weather the financial impact of the pandemic, said it has made more than \u00a3400m in cost savings including a recruitment and salary review freeze. The company, which has seen its share price slump more than 40% over the last year, said that its first major post-coronavirus event will be the China Beauty Expo in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. In the financial markets, stock markets are pushing higher after heavy losses yesterday \u2013 shrugging off dismal UK and eurozone data for April and fears of a second Covid-19 wave in the US. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 1.2%, or 73 points, at 6,150 Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.2% at 12,224 France\u2019s CAC up 1.8% at 4,901 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.45% at 19,078 The UK economy shrank by a quarter in April in the depths of the Covid-19 lockdown, with the services, industrial and construction sectors all suffering record falls in output. International trade also collapsed. The eurozone also recorded a record plunge in industrial production in April, albeit smaller than that in the UK. The pound strengthened slightly against the dollar and flattened against the euro, after a disappointing week. Sterling traded 0.2% higher versus the dollar at $1.2630 and was little changed against the euro at 89.59 pence. There is more appetite for riskier currencies again (yesterday the dollar and the Japanese yen, both seen as safe havens, rose as global stocks tumbled), but the shocking UK data and Brexit risks continue to weigh on sterling. Gold, another safe-haven investment, rose 0.3% to $1,732 an ounce and is heading for its first weekly rise in a month, up more than 2.5%. Oil prices have turned positive after earlier losses of more than 3%, but are heading for a weekly fall. Brent crude is 0.57% higher at $38.77 a barrel while US light crude has gained 0.5% to $36.52. These are the largest monthly falls recorded since the start of the series, significantly higher than the 3% to 4% drops seen in late 2008 and early 2009 during the financial crisis, Eurostat said. Spain, Germany, France and Italy were among the countries that suffered the biggest declines. In the eurozone, industrial production also collapsed in April when Covid-19 lockdowns forced factories to close. Data from the EU\u2019s statistics office Eurostat showed industrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 17.1% from March, the biggest decline since records began in 1991. Stocks are pushing higher, with the FTSE 100 in London now up 1.16% while the CAC 40 in Paris is 1.27% ahead and the FTSE MiB in Milan has gained 1.26%. Not surprisingly, the UK\u2019s trade with other countries also collapsed in April. Export volumes fell by 17.7% month on month, but import volumes dropped even more, by 26.5%. The trade balance shifted from a deficit of \u00a34bn in March to a surplus of \u00a3300m in April as a result. Trade in services was hit much harder than trade in goods. Services export volumes fell by 27.8%, while services imports slumped by 43.1%, reflecting the collapse in travel and tourism. In trade in goods, the monthly declines were smaller, at 8.7% for exports and 20.2% for imports. In the three months to April, the UK posted a trade deficit of \u00a31.2bn. The falls in exports and imports, excluding precious metals, were the largest since records began in 1998. The biggest declines in exports and imports were in machinery and transport equipment, in particular cars and vans, as well as other goods such as art and clothing. Despite the shocking UK economic data, all of the main UK and European stock markets have now turned positive. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 18 points, or 0.3%, at 6,095 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.25% at 12,000 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.6% at 4,845 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.5% at 18,904 Faced with this unprecedented recession, the Bank of England is expected to add to the \u00a3200bn of asset purchases it announced in March, to revive the economy. Economists are forecasting another increase of at least \u00a3100bn in the bond-buying programme. Andrew Bailey, the central bank\u2019s governor, said on Wednesday that this downturn is not a \u201cnormal recession\u201d and that there will be some long-term damage. If there is any such thing as a normal recession ... this one will be different. There will be elements of a faster recovery, because the first stage of the recovery is literally lifting restrictions and allowing people to go out. And we see ... evidence of elements of that recovery starting. Turning to long-term damage, as some businesses will go bust and some business models such as packed bars will no longer appeal to the public, he added: We don\u2019t know how much scarring there will be. I think it is reasonably to say there will be some but it is very hard to judge. Britain\u2019s economic recovery will be a far more drawn-out affair than the collapse, warns Capital Economics analyst Andrew Wishart. At its peak in April the lockdown reduced economic output by 25%, making the coronavirus crisis by far the deepest recession on record. The peak-to-trough fall in GDP was 7% in both the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Depression. Having plumbed those unprecedented depths, the economy is now on the return leg. Given the lockdown started to be eased in May, April will mark the trough in GDP. Overall, we are past the worst. But the recovery will be a drawn-out affair as restrictions are only lifted gradually and businesses and consumers continue to exercise caution. And while the trough in activity is now behind us, the fiscal cost of the collapse and the impact on the labour market, including the rise in the unemployment rate to over 8% that we expect, are only just starting to emerge. We don\u2019t have comparative figures for the UK\u2019s 20.4% economic decline in April in other countries. Coming after a 5.8% drop in GDP in March, the combined loss during the Covid-19 lockdown period is 25.1%. The French economy is set to have contracted by 15% between April and June, the Banque de France estimated yesterday. German industrial production shrank by 17.9% in April from March, according to official data released this week \u2013 not quite as bad as the UK\u2019s 20.3% decline in industrial output. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a respected Paris-based think tank, expects Britain\u2019s economy to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world. A slump in the UK\u2019s national income of 11.5% during 2020 will outstrip the falls in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the US, the OECD estimated earlier this week. Germany\u2019s economy, the largest in Europe, is expected to contract by 6.6% this year while Spain\u2019s GDP is seen falling by 11.1%, Italy\u2019s by 11.3 and France\u2019s by 11.4%. The US, the world\u2019s largest economy, is forecast to take a hit of 7.3%. Oil prices continue to slide, as a rise in Covid-19 infections in the US this week sparked fears of a second wave of coronavirus, which could lead to restrictions being reimposed on the US economy, and hit demand for crude oil. The US is the world\u2019s biggest consumer of crude and fuel. Brent crude dropped 3.1% to $37.35 a barrel this morning while US light crude has fallen even more, by 3.4%, to $35.09. The two oil benchmarks are on course for their first weekly declines in seven, down more than 12% this week, as growing stockpiles also act as a drag on prices, Reuters reported. Back to the markets. The FTSE 100 index and Germany\u2019s Dax have recouped some of their losses in early trading and are now almost flat, while French and Italian shares have risen slightly. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.06% at 6,074 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.02% France\u2019s CAC up 0.15% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.35% In other news, Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines \u2013 British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair \u2013 have now launched legal action against the UK government\u2019s quarantine policy, according to BA\u2019s parent IAG. They have asked for a judicial review to be heard as soon as possible. The three airlines argue that the policy is irrational and unfair, as it comes months after the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown was imposed, and at a time when the pandemic is easing. The quarantine took effect on Monday and requires air passengers arriving in the UK from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days. The aviation and travel industries fear that it will kill off a nascent recovery in air travel. Hotels, B&amp;Bs, cafes and restaurants were worst hit during the Covid-19 lockdown, recording a 91.8% slump in output between January and April, notes Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The economy will take a long time to recover from the pummelling inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. April\u2019s unprecedented drop in GDP extends the decline from January\u2019s peak to a gargantuan 25.2%. This collapse greatly surpasses the 6% peak-to-trough decline in GDP seen in the 2008-to-09 recession, which previously was the deepest in post-war history. Output in April was below its January level in all but one of the 20 sub-sectors of the economy; output in the public administration sector ticked up by 0.2%. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), the UK\u2019s oldest independent economic research institute, has sent us some quick thoughts on this morning\u2019s data. UK and European shares have fallen at the open. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 1.3% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.9% France\u2019s CAC down 1% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.6% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.9% James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, says: Today\u2019s data won\u2019t necessarily come as much of as a surprise to markets - it shows the damage was a little greater than expected, but the reality is that markets have become fairly desensitised to big numbers over recent weeks. We know too that April was the first month to be fully encompassed by the lockdown. But these figures are nevertheless shocking, and it goes without saying that this kind of fall in activity is virtually unprecedented, either in scale or speed. Social distancing constraints, consumer and business caution, as well as Brexit, all pose challenges to the UK economic recovery. This is set to keep the pressure on the Bank of England to continue expanding its balance sheet, and we expect a further increase in its quantitative easing programme next week. The record fall in UK GDP in April means that the economy lost \u00a330bn. The decline is much worse than during the financial crisis. The ONS says: The monthly decline in GDP in April 2020 is three times greater than the fall experienced during the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. During the global financial crisis, from the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, a total of 13 months, GDP contracted 6.9%. The figures suggest that the British economy is suffering one of the worst downturns in the world. The UK economy shrank by an unprecedented 10.4% in the three months to April, the ONS\u2019s rolling three-month estimate showed. April\u2019s decline reflected widespread falls in services, production and construction output, the ONS said. Industrial output fell 20.3% in April, the largest monthly fall since records began in 1968. Manufacturing, which makes up three-quarters of industrial output (the rest is utilities, mining and quarrying), plunged 24.3%. Services output was down 19% and construction output plummeted 40.1% as companies downed tools during the nationwide lockdown. All declines were the biggest on record, and worse than City economists had expected. The UK\u2019s deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: April\u2019s fall in GDP is the biggest the UK has ever seen, more than three times larger than last month and almost ten times larger than the steepest pre-COVID-19 fall. In April the economy was around 25% smaller than in February. Virtually all areas of the economy were hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all giving the biggest contributions to this historic fall. Manufacturing and construction also saw significant falls, with manufacture of cars and housebuilding particularly badly affected. The UK\u2019s trade with the rest of the world was also badly affected by the pandemic, with large falls in both the import and export of cars, fuels, works of art and clothing. There is a ton of UK economic data out this morning. The GDP figure for April was worse than expected, showing an economic contraction of 20.4% in April from the month before, as the economy was paralysed by the coronavirus pandemic. Factories, shops, restaurants cafes, bars, building sites and schools shut across the country, with only \u201cessential\u201d stores such as supermarkets and pharmacies allowed to open. Good morning and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. The UK economy contracted by a whopping 20.4% in April from the month before as the full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic hit, according to official figures just released. City economists had been expecting an 18.4% decline. It is the biggest contraction since records began in 1997. Stock markets suffered heavy losses yesterday as economic optimism faded and fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections intensified. In the US, another 1.5 million people filed for jobless benefits, taking the total over the last three months to more than 44 million - a staggering number. The number of Covid-19 infections passed 2m and more than 115,000 people have died from the virus. The night before, Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), said the coronavirus was the \u201cbiggest economic shock\u201d in living memory and warned it would be a long road to recovery. The US Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said yesterday that shutting down the economy again was not an option. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones tumbled nearly 7%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.9% and the Nasdaq, which hit a record high earlier in the week, fell 5.3%. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index fell nearly 4%, or 252 points to 6,076.70 yesterday, marking its third day of declines. Germany\u2019s Dax lost 4.5% and France\u2019s CAC 40 tumbled 4.7%. It was another bleak day for the UK jobs market yesterday, as the owner of British Gas announced 5,000 job cuts, chemicals firm Johnson Matthey said it would lay off 2,500 people and Heathrow airport launched a redundancy programme. BP, Mulberry and Debenhams also announced major job losses this week. Asian markets are also in the red today, although the losses are less steep. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 2.3%, South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped 2.2%, Australia\u2019s stock market lost 1.7%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is down 1.3% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.9%. European markets are expected to open lower. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Yesterday was like a flashback to the madness that was seen in markets in February and March as fears about a possible second wave of Covid-19 prompted intense selling. The sharp declines that were registered yesterday must be put in context with the major gains that have been racked up in recent weeks.

      "bodyText": "Full border controls on goods entering the UK will not apply until July next year the government has announced, as it formally notified the EU it does not want an extension to the transition period. The announcement of a three-phased plan for Brexit border checks was welcomed by industry leaders but represents the most dramatic change to international trading since 1993 when the single market was introduced. It comes as the chancellor for the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, told the vice-president of the European Commission, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, of the UK\u2019s plans to press ahead with exiting the customs union and the single market on 31 December. \u201cWe have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period. The moment for extension has now passed. At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step towards getting the country ready for the end of the transition period,\u201d said Gove. The border delays have been instigated as a \u201ctemporary and pragmatic\u201d response to accommodate the current strains on businesses as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Further delays of full controls could be put in place if there is a second wave of coronavirus, sources have indicated. The Freight Transport Association, which had lobbied for the delays, said it was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d the government had listened to its concerns. The Road Haulage Association, a vocal critic of the government\u2019s hardline approach to Brexit in the past, also welcomed the announcement. The government plan involves a phased implementation of controls in January, April and July next year. In the first stage, full customs checks and tariffs will be imposed on \u201ccontrolled\u201d goods such as alcohol and tobacco. But importers of \u201cstandard\u201d goods ranging from clothes to electronics will have up to six months to complete customs declarations and to pay tariffs, if any apply. However, they will need to keep sufficient records of imports and make preparations for VAT payments. There will also be checks on live animals and high-risk plants. In April, the health checks will be extended to all products of animal origin including, meat, pet food, honey, milk or egg products with pre-notification of imports required by the authorities. From July all goods will be subjected to customs declarations at the point of importation and relevant tariffs, which will be determined by the outcome of the current Brexit talks on the free-trade agreement. Business leaders have long warned that new checks will mean major disruption to the supply chain and those who trade in fresh and chilled food still face checks on the EU side in key ports including Calais, Rotterdam, Zeebrugge and Dublin. Brussels officials have said the EU has no intention of relaxing checks on UK goods entering the bloc. \u201cThe UK has stated on several occasions it wants to take back the control and I would say that it is up to the UK how they do it,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters after his meeting with Gove. The new trading regime will involve fresh infrastructure at ports and airports with a \u00a350m support package to get an estimated 50,000 customs agents, freight forwards and other experts in place for 2021. Border inspection posts will also have to be built, something neighbouring countries including France and Ireland put in place last year in preparation for no-deal planning.

Businesses in Northern Ireland recently called for a similar six-month delay to the checks that will apply on goods traded across the Irish Sea and expressed disappointment the UK had no plans for similar approach in the region. A delay on the protocol would require EU approval but sources say there is no sign of any political will either in London or Brussels to make it easy for already strained businesses in the region. Sources say there has been little to no engagement with HMRC reaching out for information after an \u201ceight-month silence\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has used a series of tweets to speak out against the removal of statues and to urge Black Lives Matter activists not to protest this weekend. Here is some context to his comments. The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country \u2013 and the whole of Europe \u2013 from a fascist and racist tyranny. It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violent protesters. Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial. While the idea of Churchill as a lone political figure standing up against prewar appeasement has become somewhat mythologised \u2013 not least by Churchill himself in his own books \u2013 there is no doubt he played a central role in Britain\u2019s wartime destiny, and remains a hero to many Britons, regularly topping polls of most revered prime ministers. Johnson has himself written a biography of Churchill that sold well, if the critical reaction was sometimes mixed, and so has a very obvious personal stake in the argument \u2013 particularly as many reviews felt that Johnson was trying to liken his own career to that of his hero. Nonetheless, there were episodes in Churchill\u2019s life that remain hugely controversial; for example his role in the 1943 Bengal famine, which killed up to 3 million people and has been blamed on policy failures rather than drought.

      "body": "<p>Amid a continuing pandemic and a painful national introspection on race, a volatile American economy is also forcing Donald Trump and Joe Biden to recalibrate how they campaign in 2020\u2019s presidential election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/us-economy-unemployment-us-states\">Stock markets tumble as another 1.5m Americans file for unemployment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Trump, any positive news about the economy needs to be trumpeted. That\u2019s what the president did when the most recent unemployment figures came in surprisingly lower than expected, at 13.3%.</p> <p>For Biden, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the approach is to remind voters that the soaring unemployment numbers are unacceptably high. Virtually every time he can, Biden looks to link the virus-cratered economy to Trump.</p> <p>But as with many other things in 2020, there is nothing normal or easy to predict about the US economy as the election unfolds.</p> <p>Unlike normal recessions, the devastation unleashed on the American jobs market has come about because of deliberate shutdown policies aimed at curbing the pandemic\u2019s spread. That makes blaming Trump for the 40 million plus new jobless Americans a little more difficult.</p> <p>By the same token, coaxing the economy back into life is not just a matter of trying to stimulate demand or tinkering with interest rates. It is instead deeply entwined with public health policy, where reopening the artificially shut-down economy could cost tens of thousands of US lives.</p> <p>That situation poses problems for both contenders as they seek to make the economy central to their campaigns.</p> <p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as the 2008 John McCain campaign\u2019s director of domestic and economic policy, said the challenge for Biden and Trump is different as they seek to persuade voters they have the answers to solve the problems posed by an economic freefall driven by a virus.</p> <p>\u201cFor the Biden campaign, the challenge is to ask themselves every day: \u2018OK, what looks presidential in this moment?\u2019\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cBoth have to appear presidential, but Trump in particular has to be a source of trustworthy information.</p> <p>\u201cPeople derive great comfort from someone who can tell them what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump, he either needs to communicate a convincing argument to be optimistic that he can lead the economic recovery, or show that Biden is a worse alternative.</p> <p>A swath of recent polling has shown Biden beating Trump in a general election matchup. But on the economy, Trump is still competitive. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plurality of voters still think Trump is preferable on dealing with the economy and cutting the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Trump has habitually pointed to certain metrics \u2013 such as the stock market \u2013 to argue that he\u2019s the stronger candidate on the economy.

      "bodyText": "Amid a continuing pandemic and a painful national introspection on race, a volatile American economy is also forcing Donald Trump and Joe Biden to recalibrate how they campaign in 2020\u2019s presidential election. For Trump, any positive news about the economy needs to be trumpeted. That\u2019s what the president did when the most recent unemployment figures came in surprisingly lower than expected, at 13.3%. For Biden, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the approach is to remind voters that the soaring unemployment numbers are unacceptably high. Virtually every time he can, Biden looks to link the virus-cratered economy to Trump. But as with many other things in 2020, there is nothing normal or easy to predict about the US economy as the election unfolds. Unlike normal recessions, the devastation unleashed on the American jobs market has come about because of deliberate shutdown policies aimed at curbing the pandemic\u2019s spread. That makes blaming Trump for the 40 million plus new jobless Americans a little more difficult. By the same token, coaxing the economy back into life is not just a matter of trying to stimulate demand or tinkering with interest rates. It is instead deeply entwined with public health policy, where reopening the artificially shut-down economy could cost tens of thousands of US lives. That situation poses problems for both contenders as they seek to make the economy central to their campaigns. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as the 2008 John McCain campaign\u2019s director of domestic and economic policy, said the challenge for Biden and Trump is different as they seek to persuade voters they have the answers to solve the problems posed by an economic freefall driven by a virus. \u201cFor the Biden campaign, the challenge is to ask themselves every day: \u2018OK, what looks presidential in this moment?\u2019\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cBoth have to appear presidential, but Trump in particular has to be a source of trustworthy information. \u201cPeople derive great comfort from someone who can tell them what\u2019s happening.\u201d For Trump, he either needs to communicate a convincing argument to be optimistic that he can lead the economic recovery, or show that Biden is a worse alternative. A swath of recent polling has shown Biden beating Trump in a general election matchup. But on the economy, Trump is still competitive. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plurality of voters still think Trump is preferable on dealing with the economy and cutting the unemployment rate. Trump has habitually pointed to certain metrics \u2013 such as the stock market \u2013 to argue that he\u2019s the stronger candidate on the economy. He also likes to say Democrats are the party that wants to raise taxes. Holtz-Eakin expects Trump to focus more on bashing Biden as the election nears, regardless of how the economy is doing on any particular day. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to concentrate on the messenger,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. In recent days, Biden has tried to multitask in attacking Trump. He and his campaign, publicly and privately, have put a heavy focus on race relations, and the unrest around the police killing of George Floyd. Talking points sent to some Biden surrogates on Monday and obtained by the Guardian did not mention the economy, and instead focused on Floyd. But Biden\u2019s fundraising schedule this week includes multiple economy-related events, according to invitations obtained by the Guardian. One fundraiser on Wednesday was labeled a \u201cVirtual Conversation on Rebuilding a Most Resilient Health Economy after Covid-19\u201d. Another fundraiser featured Peter Orszag, the former director for the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration. In public remarks, Biden has also eagerly pivoted to addressing the economy and laying out his policy platform. \u201cTrump has loved to crow about the great economy he built. But when the crisis hit, it became clear who that economy has been built to serve. Not workers. Not the middle class. Not families,\u201d Biden said in recent public remarks. In addressing the economy, Biden often ties it to race relations or the coronavirus. On Thursday, Biden\u2019s campaign released a new factsheet titled \u201cThe Biden Plan for an Effective Re-Opening that Jumpstarts the Economy\u201d. The campaign has also set up a secretive group of advisers who have Biden\u2019s ear on economic policy. The state of the economy isn\u2019t everything in presidential politics ad campaigns. Obama won re-election in the wake of the outbreak of the Great Recession against a candidate with a strong business background. But amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, it casts a long shadow in 2020 and both Democratic and Republican strategists have to deal with it. Scott Kozar, a veteran Democratic strategist, said that the unemployment rate is something that will continue to matter in the coming months, and is likely to be a problem for Trump because of the sheer scale of the collapse. \u201cYou\u2019re really arguing that 16% unemployment\u2019s good? It\u2019s a bit like arguing only 100,000 people died,\u201d Kozar said. \u201cThere is a clear vacuum of leadership.\u201d Other strategists, though, argue that the state of the economy will be too complicated for just one side to take advantage of. \u201cI think the campaign that does a better job spinning the economic data, and the campaign that does a better job convincing people that the economy is either roaring back or is stalling out \u2026 whichever campaign wins that messaging battle is likely to be in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Republican strategist Todd Harris, who served as a top adviser for the Florida senator Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be enough conclusive economic data one way or the other to have it be a slam dunk win for one side or the other.\u201d Still, Democrats are optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to know when the light at the end of the tunnel\u2019s going to come about between now and the election,\u201d the Democratic strategist Aaron Pickrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be some ebbs and flows, and potentially a good jobs report and things aren\u2019t as bad as they\u2019re going to be one month.

The 1,700-strong pub chain says it has spent \u00a315m on preparing venues to reopen, which could happen as soon as 4 July in England. The rival chain JD Wetherspoon has already laid out its blueprint for how pubs will look in a world shaped by the pandemic, with protective screens between tables and staff wearing goggles and masks. Greene King will deploy some of the same plans but unveiled some new measures it hopes will make pubs safe enough to avoid coronavirus transmission, without ruining the atmosphere. It said toilets would be cleaned every 15 minutes and customers would be allowed in only one at a time. Upon entering and leaving the toilet, they would be asked to flip an indicator between red and green, so that other patrons knew whether someone was inside. Customers are being advised to pre-book a table rather than stand at the bar, while perspex screens will be erected to create barriers between tables and between drinkers and bar staff. A \u201cpub host\u201d will welcome people at the entrance and show them to tables, and keep physically distanced queues in order, while signage will be used to direct people to routes around the pub that minimise contact. Like Wetherspoons, the company is urging customers to pay using its app and to use hand sanitiser stations positioned around the pub. Each pub will provide one-time-use menus customers can take away or dispose of, while cutlery will be wrapped and condiments in sachets or in fresh ramekins. A designated \u201cpub safe monitor\u201d, wearing a special uniform, will be tasked with ensuring compliance and dealing with any safety concerns raised by pub-goers. Greene King\u2019s chief executive, Nick Mackenzie, said: \u201cOf course, customers will notice some differences when they return but it\u2019s important that alongside implementing the changes, we maintain the very essence of the great British pub. \u201cMany pubs across the country, including a number of our own, will not be financially viable or able to open for operational reasons with the current restrictions in place and we hope that, for the future of our industry, these measures will be short-lived. \u201cWe are working towards a phased reopening and are planning to open as many as we can.\u201d The pub industry has called for clarity on when it can reopen after the government hinted that drinks could be served in beer gardens from 22 June, only to abandon the plan and say that pubs would not open before 4 July.

      "body": "<p>Hopeful hotel owners in English beauty spots are looking to staycationers for a much-needed financial boost this summer, even though their local communities fear an influx of tourists may bring a second wave of coronavirus infections.</p> <p>As lockdown measures continue to be eased, hotel and holiday home owners have set their sights on taking guests from 4 July \u2013 the earliest date the government has stated they can reopen.</p> <p>And with Britons facing a strict 14-day quarantine upon returning from overseas, booking websites including lastminute.com and Airbnb have predicted a spike in people choosing to stay in the country for their summer breaks.</p> <p>But while new cases of Covid-19 continue to be reported, residents in tourist hotspots, such as the Lake District and Cornwall, are seeking reassurances that restarting the local economy will not come at the expense of public health.</p> <p>In May, parts of Cumbria \u2013 a county in which the biggest employer is the tourism industry \u2013 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-remote-cumbrian-town-with-the-uks-highest-covid-19-infection-rate-barrow-in-furness\">some of the highest rates</a> of coronavirus infections in the country. The South Lakes MP, Tim Farron, said that although rates had \u201csettled down a bit\u201d, there were palpable fears among residents about \u201clarge numbers of people coming in one go\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are one of the areas with the highest older population. The average age here is about 10 years above the national average, so there is a real sense of justified nervousness,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Farron \u2013 who encouraged the government to publish localised R values, which measure the rate of infection from an individual \u2013 said hotel owners were \u201cmaking decisions in the dark\u201d about whether it was safe to reopen because they were not aware of how great the risk was of further outbreaks.</p> <p>He said a balancing act needed to be struck because 80% of the working population in the Lake District were employed in the hospitality and tourism sector.</p> <p>\u201cI am worried about a second spike, and I\u2019m also worried about the fact that we had a 312% increase in unemployment here last month. There is that tension between wanting to get back up and running economically and at the same time wanting to keep everybody safe.\u201d</p> <p>His views were echoed by Gillian Race, the manager of the Wasdale Head Inn, a pub and hotel set in the Wasdale Valley, in the western part of the Lake District National Park.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to reopen and we\u2019ve got to get businesses moving again, but if we do have another outbreak we\u2019ll just have to be on lockdown again,\u201d she said, adding that all staff at the pub were currently furloughed. \u201cIt has been difficult.\u201d</p> <p>As they await the green light to reopen, having transferred bookings made for during lockdown to next year, the pub management have begun putting up perspex screens across the bar and reception areas and implementing a one-way system.</p> <p>They have received many inquiries from British tourists for short stays during July and August. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty full in July and August and we\u2019ve taken quite a few bookings for September, October time.

      "bodyText": "Hopeful hotel owners in English beauty spots are looking to staycationers for a much-needed financial boost this summer, even though their local communities fear an influx of tourists may bring a second wave of coronavirus infections. As lockdown measures continue to be eased, hotel and holiday home owners have set their sights on taking guests from 4 July \u2013 the earliest date the government has stated they can reopen. And with Britons facing a strict 14-day quarantine upon returning from overseas, booking websites including lastminute.com and Airbnb have predicted a spike in people choosing to stay in the country for their summer breaks. But while new cases of Covid-19 continue to be reported, residents in tourist hotspots, such as the Lake District and Cornwall, are seeking reassurances that restarting the local economy will not come at the expense of public health. In May, parts of Cumbria \u2013 a county in which the biggest employer is the tourism industry \u2013 had some of the highest rates of coronavirus infections in the country. The South Lakes MP, Tim Farron, said that although rates had \u201csettled down a bit\u201d, there were palpable fears among residents about \u201clarge numbers of people coming in one go\u201d. \u201cWe are one of the areas with the highest older population. The average age here is about 10 years above the national average, so there is a real sense of justified nervousness,\u201d he said. Farron \u2013 who encouraged the government to publish localised R values, which measure the rate of infection from an individual \u2013 said hotel owners were \u201cmaking decisions in the dark\u201d about whether it was safe to reopen because they were not aware of how great the risk was of further outbreaks. He said a balancing act needed to be struck because 80% of the working population in the Lake District were employed in the hospitality and tourism sector. \u201cI am worried about a second spike, and I\u2019m also worried about the fact that we had a 312% increase in unemployment here last month. There is that tension between wanting to get back up and running economically and at the same time wanting to keep everybody safe.\u201d His views were echoed by Gillian Race, the manager of the Wasdale Head Inn, a pub and hotel set in the Wasdale Valley, in the western part of the Lake District National Park. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to reopen and we\u2019ve got to get businesses moving again, but if we do have another outbreak we\u2019ll just have to be on lockdown again,\u201d she said, adding that all staff at the pub were currently furloughed. \u201cIt has been difficult.\u201d As they await the green light to reopen, having transferred bookings made for during lockdown to next year, the pub management have begun putting up perspex screens across the bar and reception areas and implementing a one-way system. They have received many inquiries from British tourists for short stays during July and August. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty full in July and August and we\u2019ve taken quite a few bookings for September, October time. I think the pub will also be very busy with day visitors,\u201d Race said. Surge in demand for visits to UK tourist destinations is not restricted to the Lake District. During lockdown, Lastminute.com said the hotel booking trends showed a 45% week-on-week increase for the UK, and in particular for London (+140%), Manchester (+300%), Blackpool (+200%) and Bristol (+200%) during summer and autumn. A recent survey conducted by the site showed 33% of British people intended to stay in the country for their summer breaks this year. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Airbnb said although it had limited bookings only to medical workers on essential trips until 4 July, it was expecting a heightened demand for UK holiday homes from British nationals next month \u2013 \u201cwhen the comeback starts, it\u2019s going to start locally\u201d. In Cornwall, strict measures have been imposed ahead of hotels reopening to enforce social distancing among tourists. On Thursday, Visit Cornwall announced the bulk of attractions would sell tickets for specific timeslots, while all restaurants would work on a reservation-only basis. At the Headland hotel, which overlooks Newquay\u2019s Fistral Beach, a spokesperon said bookings \u201cwere looking very strong\u201d among Britons during the summer months, adding that the same looked to be the case for neighbouring hotels, bed and breakfasts and holiday cottages. Steve Double, the Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, said that while the tourism industry was vital to the Cornish economy, his constituents were \u201cvery aware of the risk of another outbreak\u201d. \u201cI welcome the government\u2019s general cautious approach in taking this gradually, stage by stage, and also making sure that businesses are putting measures in place to maintain the social distancing and also to keep customers and staff safe as they do reopen,\u201d he said.",

Those present were angry at Duda\u2019s messaging and also at the lack of support from other candidates. \u201cWe need solidarity, but almost all the candidates in the presidential election are scared to be associated with the LGBT community, and that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Jvlia \u015awi\u0119ch, one of those involved in creating the event. The election was originally scheduled for May as the PiS leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, was keen to take advantage of polling that suggested Duda would win easily in the first round. It was called off with days to go and rescheduled. Poland has since relaxed many lockdown rules, although it is recording more new infections a day than in May. Recent polls suggest the race will be much closer, with Duda projected to win around 40% of the votes in the first round, requiring a second-round run-off that would be held two weeks later.",

Even before the coronavirus lockdown limited people\u2019s trips to retailers in the flesh, online shopping was flying high.

      "bodyText": "Starting a business and planning for its future once involved bricks and mortar, shelves, tills and customers walking through your door. Not so today. Even before the coronavirus lockdown limited people\u2019s trips to retailers in the flesh, online shopping was flying high. According to the Global Ecommerce Market Ranking 2019, the UK has the world\u2019s fourth largest e-commerce market in revenue terms, and the third highest percentage of online shoppers, at almost 80%. And it\u2019s set to continue. Research by the analysts Retail Economics last year found that 53% of retail sales were expected to be online by 2028. In the wake of lockdown, it seems likely this trend will only accelerate. Given the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.

Though it survived the second world war and damage to the local economy inflicted during the miners\u2019 strikes, Covid-19 has had an altogether bigger impact.</p> <p>While lockdown measures led Britain\u2019s economy overall to shrink by a fifth in April, the food and drink sector was one of the hardest hit, plunging by 89% in a month.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m 63 now and I cant remember not having a good nights sleep until recently. But we will survive. I plan to see in our centenary,\u201d said Waterfield.</p> <p>The chain usually sells more than 30,000 of its much-loved sausage rolls and loaves a week, but during lockdown Waterfields furloughed 100 of its 350 staff to stay afloat.

While sales slumped for Corbetts, contracts to provide galvanised steel cable holders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/07/how-to-build-a-hospital-in-nine-days-emergency-architecture-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-outbreak\">to fit out the Nightingale hospitals</a> in Birmingham and Manchester helped the company keep running.</p> <p>Williams said redundancies would be likely as the government\u2019s furlough scheme is wound down, but added that the outlook was starting to improve. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to forecast where we\u2019ll be in three months time but the general consensus is getting a lot better,\u201d she said.</p> <h2><strong>York Emporium, Yorkshire</strong></h2> <p>Laurence Beardmore\u2019s coffee roasting business <a href=\"https://yorkemporium.co.uk/\">York Emporium</a> had no money coming in at all from late March until mid-May as lockdown shut the cafes and restaurants it supplies across Yorkshire.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a tap turning off,\u201d said the 55-year old business owner, whose firm employs 85 people and would usually sell about100 tonnes of coffee a year. \u201cI\u2019ve been through lot of recession in my life from the 1980s onwards, but there\u2019s been nothing like this.

Waterfields, Leigh Just two weeks in April wiped out the equivalent of a year\u2019s profit for Waterfields bakery in Leigh, after the coronavirus crisis forced all 35 of its shops dotted across the former south Lancashire coalfields to temporarily close. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t careful we\u2019re going to go under like other businesses,\u201d said Richard Waterfield, chairman of the family-run firm established in 1926. Though it survived the second world war and damage to the local economy inflicted during the miners\u2019 strikes, Covid-19 has had an altogether bigger impact. While lockdown measures led Britain\u2019s economy overall to shrink by a fifth in April, the food and drink sector was one of the hardest hit, plunging by 89% in a month. \u201cI\u2019m 63 now and I cant remember not having a good nights sleep until recently. But we will survive. I plan to see in our centenary,\u201d said Waterfield. The chain usually sells more than 30,000 of its much-loved sausage rolls and loaves a week, but during lockdown Waterfields furloughed 100 of its 350 staff to stay afloat. Although it is gradually reopening with social distancing measures in place, sales are expected to remain depressed until Christmas at least, particularly in town centres such as Warrington, Widnes, St Helens and Leigh where footfall has fallen most. \u201cI don\u2019t think that town centre trade will ever come back,\u201d said Waterfield. \u201cThe high street is going to change without question. We feel as a business there will remain an awful lot of people working from home, certainly this side of Christmas.\u201d Corbetts, Telford Production volumes halved within 72 hours at Midlands-based manufacturer Corbetts at the start of lockdown, forcing the business to close one of its two metal galvanising plants and furlough almost half of its 72 employees. Set up in 1860 as an ironmonger in Telford close to the world\u2019s first iron bridge, the company faces a recession this year deeper than at any time in its entire history. \u201cApril was really quite catastrophic for us and we really had to think on our feet,\u201d said Sophie Williams, finance director of Corbetts. Manufacturing output across the country collapsed by a quarter in April, according to the ONS. While sales slumped for Corbetts, contracts to provide galvanised steel cable holders to fit out the Nightingale hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester helped the company keep running. Williams said redundancies would be likely as the government\u2019s furlough scheme is wound down, but added that the outlook was starting to improve. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to forecast where we\u2019ll be in three months time but the general consensus is getting a lot better,\u201d she said. York Emporium, Yorkshire Laurence Beardmore\u2019s coffee roasting business York Emporium had no money coming in at all from late March until mid-May as lockdown shut the cafes and restaurants it supplies across Yorkshire. \u201cIt was like a tap turning off,\u201d said the 55-year old business owner, whose firm employs 85 people and would usually sell about100 tonnes of coffee a year. \u201cI\u2019ve been through lot of recession in my life from the 1980s onwards, but there\u2019s been nothing like this. It\u2019s unique.\u201d A prominent member of the local chamber of commerce, Beardmore warned the government that continued support for firms would still be needed long after lockdown measures are lifted. \u201cThe choice is support it or let it go, that\u2019s the stark choice. If the tap turned on again great we\u2019d recover but it\u2019s going to come in drips so that support needs to continue,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "People living in the poorest areas of England and Wales have been twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as those in less deprived areas, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The analysis reveals the disproportionate impact of the death toll in some places, with London boroughs with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation particularly hard hit. The figures covering March to May show that people living in the poorest 10% of England died at a rate of 128.3 per 100,000, compared with a rate of 58.8 per 100,000 among those living in the wealthiest 10% of the country. The pattern was mirrored in Wales, where the equivalent rates were 109.5 deaths compared with 57.5 deaths per 100,000. \u201cGeneral mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still,\u201d said Nick Stripe, the head of health analysis at the ONS. The analysis showed that London had experienced the worst burden of Covid-19 deaths, and the virus was involved in more than four in 10 deaths since the start of March. By contrast, in the south-west, just over one in 10 deaths involved coronavirus. By May, the north-east had become the area with the highest proportion of deaths linked to Covid-19, with a rate double that of London. Nine out of 10 local authorities with the highest Covid-19 age-standardised mortality rates were in London. Brent had the highest overall age-standardised rate, with 210.9 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Newham (196.8 deaths) and Hackney (182.9). Sarah Caul, head of mortality analysis at the ONS, said: \u201cAlthough London had some of the highest Covid-19 mortality rates in the country during March and April, it is now experiencing lower mortality rates compared with most areas. \u201cDuring May, the region with the highest age-adjusted Covid-19 mortality rate was the north-east, where the rate was double that of London. The south-west region continued to have the lowest mortality rate overall and during each of the last three months. \u201cMeanwhile, people living in more deprived areas have continued to experience Covid-19 mortality rates more than double those living in less deprived areas. General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect.\u201d Prof Nishi Chaturvedi, director of the MRC unit for lifelong health and ageing at UCL, said deprivation increased the impact of Covid-19 through a range of factors, including overcrowding, income, employment, disability and health status. A similar increase in risk had been seen previously in flu outbreaks, and to a lesser degree with chronic diseases. \u201cDeprivation is associated both with exposure to greater viral load, and with enhanced susceptibility to disease as a consequence of poor health,\u201d she said. Critics have previously blamed the impact of austerity for the disproportionate toll Covid-19 had taken on the poorest communities. Dave Innes, head of economics at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \u201cBefore the pandemic hit, there were signs that our record on tackling poverty and health inequalities was unravelling.

On 3 June, he told the BBC that he was hopeful an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be agreed by the end of June. Some regional tourist boards have made announcements, including Madeira and Porto Santo, which are aiming to reopen to international tourists from 1 July (travellers must present negative test results from within 72 hours prior to departure or be tested on arrival, paid for by the local government).

The advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) reflects the enormous challenge of reopening pubs, cafes and restaurants any time soon, despite mounting pressure on the government from some Tory MPs to relax physical distancing rules in England. Boris Johnson has so far resisted demands to reduce the limit from 2 metres to 1 metre to help businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, to reopen over the summer. Sage stressed the importance of distancing to prevent the spread of the virus as recently as last week. In situations where people would be face-to-face and less than 2 metres apart, the scientists \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that protective measures be in place, including face coverings, and that efforts be made to minimise \u201cduration of exposure\u201d. The advice prepared by Sage scientists on 4 June was among nearly 40 new documents released on Friday as part of the government\u2019s efforts to improve transparency around the scientific evidence the committee considers and the advice it provides to ministers. Other Sage documents point to the extreme concern scientists had about the introduction of social bubbles whereby households could meet up to form small social groups. In mid-May, the experts urged \u201cstrong caution\u201d over bringing in bubbles when other distancing measures had only just been lifted. \u201cSage has previously advised against making too many changes at once,\u201d they said. The advice highlights the deep consideration that went into the announcement on Wednesday that adults who lived alone would be allowed to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d with another household. The move is the first phase in a three-part process suggested by Sage. If the subsequent phases are adopted, two households of any size will be allowed to meet up, with a third phase allowing multiple-person bubbles being allowed to link up with another household of any size. Other configurations were discussed but were deemed \u201ctoo complex to message\u201d, risked people facing \u201cirresolvable decision making\u201d about who to pair up with, and had the potential to leave those who were not in any bubbles feeling ostracised. Further documents reveal how Sage made clear the absolute need to protect care homes, where an estimated 16,000 of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 deaths have been recorded. On 16 April, the experts stressed that \u201ccare homes should be shielded as self-contained units\u201d and that \u201call efforts should be made to prevent the virus entering such a setting in the first place\u201d. A month later, Sage reiterated the need to minimise \u201cand ideally completely avoid\u201d staff working in different care homes, as this was known to spread infections. Catherine Noakes, a professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds and chair of the Sage Environmental Working Group, which recommended the 2-metre rule, said the guidance on physical distancing depended on the numbers of infections in the community. The infection rate of about 1,000 is still considered reasonably high. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a big theatre venue, someone in that space will have the virus. If you\u2019re on the bus, one in 20 buses will have someone infected on it. At the end of the day it\u2019s what risks society is willing to tolerate,\u201d Noakes said. She did not want to say whether was an appropriate moment to relax the 2-metre rule, but said it might be appropriate to have guidance depending on the context rather than a blanket rule. \u201cPeople are very hung up on 2 metres,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as just 2 metres. It depends on duration and activity.\u201d In addition to the Sage documents, officials released the first regional R values for the epidemic, where R is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to. The R values for all regions of the country are hovering close to the critical threshold of 1, according to government estimates, suggesting the epidemic is in a slow but tentative decline. The average R value for the UK, as a whole, remains at 0.7-0.9, with values ranging from 0.7-0.9 in the east of England to 0.8-1 in London, the Midlands and the north-west, with the highest value seen in the south-west at 0.8-1.1. The south-west currently has very low rates of infection, meaning the higher R value there is not necessarily a cause for concern. Prof Matt Keeling, of the University of Warwick, said the values were all closer to 1 \u201cthan we would ideally like to see\u201d. \u201cThis also means we haven\u2019t got much wiggle room for additional relaxation of social distancing measures,\u201d he said.",

His shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, also criticised the disorderly way the statue came down and made a point of asking the home secretary, Priti Patel, about the welfare of police officers injured in the protests in London. Some leftwing Labour MPs were unhappy about what they saw as equivocation \u2013 and the strength of feeling was underlined by a letter signed by more than 30 MPs accusing Patel of \u201cgaslighting\u201d for highlighting her experiences of racism. But with voters apparently willing to give Starmer a hearing \u2013 judging by a Mori poll on Friday showing he had the most positive approval ratings for an opposition leader since Tony Blair \u2013 it may be more difficult than the Tories hope to pigeonhole his party. Not only has Starmer chosen his words with care; he has continued to focus the majority of his fire on the government\u2019s performance in tackling the Covid-19 crisis. Deborah Mattinson, of the political consultancy Britain Thinks, who is writing a book about the red wall, says \u201cculture war\u201d questions are barely registering with many voters, at a time when they are overwhelmingly concerned with the pandemic. She says Johnson may have misjudged the moment, if he is hoping to use this febrile time to trap Starmer: \u201cOne of the really interesting things, on this and some other issues, is that Boris Johnson is really struggling adapting to not having Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader.\u201d",

Nkurunziza was elevated to the status of \u201cParamount Leader and Champion of Patriotism\u201d, a title that came with a $535,000 retirement package and villa. His cause of death was officially given as a heart attack, yet many suspect it was Covid-19. Ten days before his death, his wife was airlifted to Kenya for treatment for coronavirus symptoms, according to the Daily Nation. Nkurunziza had refused to introduce any social distancing or lockdown rules. When World Health Organization officials questioned his government\u2019s coronavirus statistics earlier this year, he expelled them. He is survived by Denise, by five children, Kelly, Kevin, Jonathan, Naomi and Dorcas, and a sister. \u2022 Pierre Nkurunziza, politician, born on 18 December 1964; died 8 June 2020",

In a trial run for the 1 June briefing, Ruth May was asked about Cummings driving his family from London to Durham while his wife had suspected Covid-19. When she failed to back the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, she is understood to have been dropped from the press conference taking place later that day \u2013 though this has been denied by a government minister. May\u2019s removal was first reported by the Independent, citing senior NHS sources, and has been confirmed separately by the Guardian. The scientific and medical experts who appear at the briefing alongside a politician were initially reluctant to get involved in the row surrounding Cummings, who, while in Durham, also made a 60-mile round-trip to a beauty spot, which he said was to test his eyesight ahead of a longer journey back to London. On 28 May, Boris Johnson tried to prevent the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, from answering questions on the subject, before Whitty said that neither he nor Vallance wished to comment on politics. However, on 30 May, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, caused embarrassment for the government by saying, in response to a question about the alleged lockdown breach: \u201cIn my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion they are for the benefit of all.

From my own perspective, I can assure you that on a matter of personal and professional integrity, I will always try to follow the rules, as I know he does.\u201d The timing of May\u2019s removal suggests that the government was wary of a senior medical adviser to the government implicitly criticising Cummings for a third day in a row as it desperately tried to move the news agenda away from his actions. Van-Tam has not appeared at a press conference since his comments on 30 May. The government\u2019s advisers have generally been on-message at press conferences and supportive of Downing Street, although there have been divergences.

It is believed the restrictions have impeded the flow of illegal drugs into the prison and turned some inmates towards brewing their own alcohol.</p> <p>The restrictive regime in prisons has seen increased time in cells, segregation and a ban on all visits to prisons across the country.</p> <p>As at 5pm on Thursday, 492 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19 across 80 prisons, a 0.4% increase in 24 hours, while there were 961 infected staff across 105 prisons, revised down from 964 due to an error with reporting.</p> <p>Owers said the IMBs had raised concerns about mental health across the prison estate.</p> <p>In one prison there had been an increase in sleeping tablet prescriptions, she said.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the letter revealed that symptomatic prisoners in isolation often have no direct human contact and some were unable to access showers. At one prison, healthcare visited only on the first and fifth day of isolation.</p> <p>As a result, concerns have been expressed that prisoners are reluctant to reveal symptoms to avoid such extreme isolation.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T17:58:27.978Z\">at 6.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee3b5738f08bc1dd58e1339\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T17:06:31.371Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s GDP posted a record fall of 20.4% in April as the economy suffered a total lockdown loss of 25%, ONS figures revealed. The staggering figures showed just how badly the pandemic paralysed the economy. The figures marked the biggest monthly decline since 1997 when records began. Poorer areas in England and Wales have bit hit hardest by Covid-19, ONS figures showed. The data revealed that people living in the most deprived areas died of coronavirus at double the rate of those living in the most wealthy areas. The London borough of Brent recorded the worst overall age-standardised rate with 210.9 deaths per 100,000 population. The UK \u2018formally confirmed\u2019 the Brexit transition period would not be extended. Michael Gove said the moment for extension had passed and Michel Barnier said the EU \u201ctook note\u201d of the UK\u2019s decision adding talks would be intensified: \u201cWe must now make progress on substance\u201d. Full border controls on goods entering the UK won\u2019t apply until July next year, the government announced. Its plan involves a phased implementation of controls in January, April and July next year. The R number may be above 1 in parts of England, figures released by Sage revealed. The R for all regions remains close to 1 with the South West of England recording the highest, at between 0.8 and 1.1. The UK death toll reached 41,481. Another 202 deaths were recorded across all settings. That\u2019s it from me today on the UK side. If you would like to continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Hartwig Fischer, the head of the British Museum, which has faced its own controversies about looted historical artefacts, said in response to Boris Johnson\u2019s comments that there was \u201ca debate to be had\u201d about the removal of statutes. He said: There is not one simple single answer to that complex question, but I think the exasperation which is directed now against these sculptures is a pent-up anxiety and exasperation which is down to the fact that we have not addressed adequately this whole massive part of our past about shared complicated history. And that debate is far from being over, that will go on and it has to go on. Prisons are starting to report spikes in violence, often linked to illicitly-brewed alcohol, as well as a rise in self-harm and suicide, as the heavily restrictive regime designed to combat the spread of the coronavirus continues, the chair of a prison watchdog network has warned. In a letter to the justice select committee, Dame Anne Owers, the chair of the independent monitoring boards (IMBs), statutory bodies set up to monitor welfare of prisoners in individual prisons, said while prisoners were initially compliant, as lockdown restrictions in the community are relaxed, frustration is growing. Some of the violence in prisons is fuelled by \u201chooch\u201d, alcohol brewed illicitly behind bars, often using fruit rations and bread or deodorant. It is believed the restrictions have impeded the flow of illegal drugs into the prison and turned some inmates towards brewing their own alcohol. The restrictive regime in prisons has seen increased time in cells, segregation and a ban on all visits to prisons across the country. As at 5pm on Thursday, 492 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19 across 80 prisons, a 0.4% increase in 24 hours, while there were 961 infected staff across 105 prisons, revised down from 964 due to an error with reporting. Owers said the IMBs had raised concerns about mental health across the prison estate. In one prison there had been an increase in sleeping tablet prescriptions, she said. Elsewhere, the letter revealed that symptomatic prisoners in isolation often have no direct human contact and some were unable to access showers. At one prison, healthcare visited only on the first and fifth day of isolation. As a result, concerns have been expressed that prisoners are reluctant to reveal symptoms to avoid such extreme isolation. Q. When will student nurses get clarity on the shape their courses are going to take from September? Powis says institutions are having to rethink the way they do teaching and effectively deliver training in a Covid context. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q. What solid, measurable action is being taken to make sure the NHS and social care system is a safe, supportive place for BAME nurses? Shapps says Kemi Badenoch is working with PHE on recommendations on this. Powis adds there is an understanding that people at greater risk need additional support and risk assessments against the work they\u2019re doing, and where necessary redeploy them. Q. Is it acceptable that student nurses who answered the government\u2019s call to join the frontline response to Covid-19 are being asked to carry out duties beyond their level of competence? How will they be fully protected and supported? Shapps says people should be working in areas in which they are and feel competent. Q. Is it fair to say that UK businesses aren\u2019t ready to trade with the EU without a deal at the beginning of the year? Shapps says business is being provided with the certainty that the transition period will end at the end of the year. Q. Is it a possibility the strain of Covid-19 and leaving the EU without sufficient trading arrangement could leave the NHS without enough medicine supplies? Shapps says that with everything going on we\u2019ve never had a medicines shortage so he\u2019s confident this won\u2019t happen. Powis says the NHS has a very good understanding of supply chains and looking ahead to deal with problems that might arise. Disruption to medicine supplies happens often and the NHS is good at dealing with them, he adds. Q. What would be the best replacement for quarantine system if the review concludes a different approach needs to be taken? Shapps says air bridges / travel corridors with countries with lower infection are a potential way forward, along with testing at ports and airports. Q. Is the government in talks with countries regarding air bridges, how are the talks going and have any countries declined to work with the UK so far? Shapps says they don\u2019t want to reimport the virus from abroad, hence an initial blanket quarantine. They are actively working on travel corridors, he says. The first review of quarantine will take place on 29 June, he adds. They will only open up air bridges when it\u2019s safe to do so, he says. Q. What extra arrangements are the NHS putting in place to prepare for a potential second wave this winter and the effects of a second lockdown? Powis says staff working flexibly, the Nightingale hospitals are there in case we need them, and different ways of working such as remote consultation will all ensure there is capacity to deal with a second wave. Q. What do you say to businesses in the south-west who are actually quite worried about it [the R value]? Shapps says stay alert and stay at home as much as possible. Q. The R rate may have risen above 1 in the south-west [between 0.9 and 1.1]. Are we moving now towards the possibility of regional lockdown? Shapps says a large number of tests are being produced, which gives more data about where issues could bubble up in future. Powis says Sage takes data from numerous academic groups who do modelling around the R number to produce a consensus. There is a range, as a result, he says. The most important thing is that in all regions, the central projection is below 1, he adds. Q. Why has there been an increased in outbreaks in hospitals in the last week? Powis says we are moving from community incidence, to over time there more local, discrete, individual outbreaks, including in hospitals and other settings. Q. Given the dismal economic figures today, wouldn\u2019t it be sensible to mandate wearing masks everywhere, not just on public transport, to get the economy back on its feet and stop further spread of the virus? Shapps says face coverings on public transport not face masks. Social distancing is still the most important thing to do along with washing your hands and not touching your face, he says. Public transport is an enclosed space, but that\u2019s not the case out on the streets, he adds. Hendy says that as the economy ramps up, it seems logical to mandate face coverings now on public transport. Powis adds the evidence is weak but there is some evidence, so it\u2019s better for enclosed spaces. Q. The R number is still near to 1, largely to the amount of coronavirus in hospitals and care homes. Does that show we\u2019re not preventing the spread there? Powis says minimising the risk of infection in hospitals is an area that is being focused on, e.g. increased testing for staff and patients. Q. Is it true, and do you think it\u2019s right, that the chief nursing officer Ruth May is either unwilling or unable to attend these press conferences any more because she won\u2019t defend Dominic Cummings? Shapps says he doesn\u2019t think this is true as she has attended many times and he\u2019s noticed one of her tweets is pinned on the No 10 Twitter feed. Powis says he doesn\u2019t know but he\u2019s been here many times saying exactly what he thinks. Q. How can it be that where you live can double your chances of dying from Covid-19, doesn\u2019t this show more needs to be done to deal with health inequalities? Shapps says he agrees more needs to be done to level up health inequalities and linked issues such as access to opportunities. Powis says the NHS is focusing on this more in its long-term plan. Many of the risk factors e.g. diabetes, obesity, are seen more frequently in deprived areas of the country, he says. Tackling those issues fundamentally in a targeted approach will mean people are less likely for infections such as Covid-19, he adds. Simon from Dorset asks what work is being done to establish if antibodies mean less risk of infection or possible immunity. Powis says after any infection the body will generate antibodies to control the infection and ensure the virus doesn\u2019t take hold in future infection. They are now measuring antibodies and getting a sense of how many people have developed antibodies to the virus, he says. It will only be studies over time that answer the question, but they\u2019re underway in the UK and internationally, he says. Siren is recruiting healthcare staff who might have been exposed into a study to observe if they are infected again and how that corresponds with antibody levels, he says. David from Sunderland asks what specific plans the government has to create jobs. Shapps says the government has an enormous battle on its hands in recovering from the pandemic. They\u2019ve tried to put their arms around the British people to protect jobs from a temporary but severe jolt to the economy, he adds. They want to be proactive in getting the economy going again in a safe way, he says. People should avoid large gatherings, including to protest, Shapps says. For the sake of your health and that of friends and families, don\u2019t attempt mass gatherings, he says. Jet Zero Council will be charged with making net zero emissions possible for future flights, Shapps says. If you can work from home you should continue to do so, Shapps says. If you can\u2019t, you should try to avoid public transport, he says. If you must, you should try to do so at quieter times, he adds. From Monday, you must wear face coverings on public transport, he says, in a bid to prevent those who show no symptoms from infecting others. Transport operators will be able to refuse permission to travel where someone isn\u2019t wearing a face covering, he says, and fines can be issued for refusal to comply. Journey makers will also be deployed in the coming weeks to remind commuters to wear face coverings, he adds. The transport secretary is speaking now. The R rate remains unchanged from last week at between 0.7 and 0.9, he says, which is stable. They want to keep the R below 1. As of 12 June, a further 1,541 cases were confirmed positive. The number of people testing positive is falling, he says. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus is broadly continuing to fall across the regions and four nations, he says. The 7-day rolling average of deaths continues to fall, he adds. Shapps is joined by Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, and the chair of Network Rail, Peter Hendy. As the government admits the R number may have risen above 1 in some parts of England (see 2.50pm.), the transport secretary will lead this afternoon\u2019s press conference, which is due to begin shortly. The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said that a drop of 20.4% in GDP in April was unsurprising and generally in line with what the Bank had expected. Speaking to Sky News, he said: Well obviously it\u2019s a dramatic and big number, but actually it\u2019s not a surprising number. The economy clearly closed down substantially in the end of March into April, so it\u2019s not surprising. It\u2019s actually pretty much in line with what we were expecting. Now the big question of course is obviously what happens next. We monitor a lot of very high-frequency data these days, we have a lot of access to that data. Which is why we had a reasonably good read on what was going to happen in April. We see signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life in the high-freq data, we do see that. It\u2019s early days, and obviously I don\u2019t want to emphasise too much. It\u2019s a gradual coming back into life but we do see those signs. The Department of Health, in a breakdown of testing statistics on its website, said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday 59,973 tests were sent out for delivery and 42,406 were processed in person under pillar two of the testing regime, which includes swab testing of the wider population. Some 40,058 tests were carried out on 23,703 people under pillar one - swab tests in NHS hospitals and Public Health England labs for people with clinical needs and health and care workers. This was the only pillar for which the number of people tested was given. Another 46,491 tests were antibody tests, under pillar three, and 4,325 antibody and swab tests were carried out under pillar four as part of a national surveillance programme studying the prevalence of the virus. Fewer than one in six adults in England \u201cstrongly support\u201d the easing of stay at home measures across the country, a survey suggests. Only 15.6% of almost 2,000 adults surveyed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they strongly backed the easing of the lockdown, which started on 10 May in England. A third said they \u201ctend to support\u201d the easing, while a similar proportion (34%) said they tend to or strongly oppose the move. This compares with 37% of adults in Wales and 44% in Scotland who said they strongly support relaxing the measures, which happened separately in the two countries. The ONS analysed responses from 1,914 adults in Great Britain aged 16 and over between 4 and 7 June. It also found that more than a fifth of 130 adults who have returned to the workplace, where they have direct physical contact with others, said they have not worn protective gear in the last week. Over a third of employed adults said they had travelled to and from work in the past seven days. Of these, 46% said their work requires direct physical contact with other people, 22% of whom said they had never worn PPE during the past seven days. Almost two-thirds (63%) said they often or always wore PPE. Among those who have returned to their offices or workplaces where they do not need to be in physical contact with others, under half said they had always kept two metres apart. More than a third (36%) said they had managed to do this often. Four in 10 said they had often or always worn PPE during the last seven days at work. ONS spokesman Hugh Stickland said: As stay at home guidance is being relaxed, with more shops and outdoor entertainment spaces opening, we will continue to monitor how safe people feel in different environments, including the workplace. The R-values for all regions of the country are hovering close to the critical threshold of 1, according to government estimates published today, suggesting the epidemic is continuing to decline slowly. The average R value for the UK, as a whole, remains at 0.7-0.9, with values ranging from 0.7-0.9 in the east of England to 0.8-1 in London, the Midlands and north-west England, with the highest value seen in south-west England at 0.8-1.1. The south-west currently has very low rates of infection, meaning that higher R value there is not necessarily a cause for concern. Prof Matt Keeling, of the University of Warwick, said the values were all closer to 1 \u201cthan we would ideally like to see\u201d. \u201cThis also means we haven\u2019t got much wiggle room for additional relaxation of social distancing measures,\u201d he said. The Turner-prize winning sculptor, Anish Kapoor, described the prime minister\u2019s opinion on statues as \u201cbullshit\u201d, adding: Statues are not history; they are emblematic monuments to our past which can be thought to represent how we see ourselves and our history. It is long overdue that we reassess these emblems and get rid of the bigots they portray. We must acknowledge the horror perpetrated in our names by these horrid individuals and seek to find nobler ways to make spaces of commemoration and history. This must now mean looking at the forgotten amongst us. Boris Johnson had said that removing statues, including of imperialist figures, was to \u201clie about our history\u201d. He tweeted: We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history and impoverish the education of generations to come. Now for some lighter news. A zebra born at a Gloucestershire wildlife park has been named after Dame Vera Lynn in a nod to wartime lyrics used to inspire hope during the coronavirus pandemic. Born on 7 June, Vera was named after the Queen punctuated a speech to the UK public during lockdown with words from Dame Vera\u2019s 1939 song We\u2019ll Meet Again. The baby zebra is the first of her near-threatened species ever to have been born at the Wild Place Project, Bristol, which has been closed since 20 March. The reproduction number, or R, of coronavirus across the UK remains between 0.7 and 0.9, while across England it is 0.8-1.0, according to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. Sage also published regional values for R in England for the first time, with thesouth-west having the highest range at 0.8-1.1. The east of England is at 0.7-0.9, London, the Midlands, the north-west and the south-east at 0.8-1.0, and the north-east and Yorkshire at 0.7-1.0. But experts cautioned against the use of regional R values \u2013 the average number of people an infected person passes the disease on to \u2013 saying that as the number of infections falls, regional R values become less reliable. Instead, from next week the government will publish the growth rates for regions that are based on data and make fewer assumptions. Public Health Wales said a further 10 people had died after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,435, while the total cases increased by 77 to 14,658. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 41,481 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Thursday, up by 202 from 41,279 the day before. The government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 52,000. The DHSC also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Friday, 193,253 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,541 positive results. Overall, a total of 6,434,713 tests have been carried out and 292,950 cases have been confirmed positive. The figure for the number of people tested has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d across all methods of testing. NHS England said another 70 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, bringing the total number of confirmed, reported deaths in hospitals in England to 27,860. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England 4 London 8 Midlands 13 North East &amp; Yorkshire 8 North West 23 South East 11 South West 3 Total: 70 One further coronavirus-linked death has been reported in Northern Ireland, taking the total reported by the Department of Health to 539. There were 16 new confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total to 4,838 since the pandemic began. England\u2019s chief nurse, Ruth May, was dropped from one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus briefings after refusing to publicly back Dominic Cummings\u2019 behaviour during the lockdown, according to the Independent. A senior NHS source was quoted as saying: A No 10 Spad [special adviser] asked her directly how she would answer the Dominic Cummings question and she refused to play along and told them she would answer the same way as Jonathan Van-Tam. She was dropped immediately from the press briefing. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has given his reaction to Michael Gove\u2019s confirmation that the UK will not be seeking an extension to the transition period. At the start of her daily press conference, Nicola Sturgeon, announced that three more people have died from coronavirus in the Scotland. Johnson also urged people not take part in anti-racist protests this weekend, claiming that a \u201cgrowing minority\u201d was using the demonstrations to attack the police and public property. He said: What makes me sad about what\u2019s happening today, is that you\u2019ve got a situation in which the statute of Winston Churchill, who is a national hero, has had to be boarded up for fear of violent attack. That, to me, is both absurd and wrong. You should not have a situation in which people who are protesting on one basis are violently attacking the police or public property. I\u2019m afraid what\u2019s happened with these demonstrations, is that .... a growing minority unfortunately have hijacked them, and they are using them as a pretext to attack the police to cause violence, and to cause damage to public property. My message to everybody is that for all sorts of reasons, they should not go to these demonstrations. And whatever our feelings about the cause, we should not support a demonstration that is in all probability, looking at what\u2019s happened before, going to end in deliberate and calculated violence. Boris Johnson has insisted the UK economy can bounce back after the lockdown largest drop in GDP since records began. The prime minister said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d at official statistics indicating the UK during April had experienced the largest single drop in economy activity since records began as a result of the coronavirus shutdown. Speaking to broadcasters, Boris Johnson said: We\u2019ve always been in no doubt this was going to be a very serious public health crisis but also have big, big economic knock-on effects. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not surprised by the figures we have seen. The UK is heavily dependent on services, we\u2019re a dynamic creative economy, we depend so much on human contact. We have been very badly hit by this. The vice-president of the EU Commission Maros Sefcovic has said Michael Gove \u201ccould not have clearer\u201d in ruling out an extension to the transition period. Speaking after talks with Gove, Sefcovic said: He [Gove] referred to the very clear position of not asking for the extension even though, as you know, our President Ursula von der Leyen was ready to provide for one. He explained that this was the promise which was given to the British citizens in the election campaign and also Prime Minister Johnson was very explicit on this issue. So he made it very, very clear and, as you know, the only body which can decide about the possible extension in this spirit is the Joint Committee. We just concluded the proceedings so I take this as a definite conclusion of this discussion and therefore I was pleading so much for the acceleration of our work - in my case on the proper implementation of the withdrawal agreement, but I think it has also clear implications for the work of Michel Barnier to make sure that we will proceed much faster in the discussion on our future relationship. Sefcovic added: I have to underline that the meeting took place in very good atmosphere and I am glad that at the end of our discussions we also arrived at some positive results, which I believe would pave the way forward for the proper implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. However, with some six months to go before the end of the transition period we still have lots of work to do. The window of opportunity to put in place the operational measures needed to ensure that the protocol can function as intended on January 1 2021 is rapidly closing. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said it is thought the R figure in Wales has gone from 0.8 to 0.7. He said this may give \u201cadditional headroom\u201d for lockdown easings. Drakeford said there had been \u201ctremendous social solidarity\u201d in Wales backing the lockdown. He said decisions would be made next week about whether any more restrictions could be lifted. We need to use the headroom to allow more economic activity to happen. Coronavirus is a health crisis but it is also an economic crisis. But he added that the government would not be pressured into easing the lockdown too quickly. We will stick to the path we have chosen. The Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said he has \u201cformally confirmed\u201d to the EU the UK will not extend the Brexit transition period, adding: The moment for extension has now passed. It follows a letter to the prime minister from the first ministers of Scotland and Wales warning that failing to extend the transition period would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d at a time when the UK economy will be just beginning its recovery from the coronavirus crisis (see 11.52am.). Here is our story on the prime minister\u2019s comments about the removal of statues of controversial figures from public spaces. He made it clear in his thread on Twitter that he believes removing statues, including of imperialist figures, is \u201cto lie about our history\u201d. The prime minister Boris Johnson has waded into the debate about the role of statues in public history in the wake of anti-racism protests across the UK. In a thread on Twitter he claimed the protests had been \u201chijacked by extremists\u201d and said it was \u201cabsurd and shameful\u201d that the statue of Winston Churchill was at risk of attack. It comes after the memorial in Parliament Square was boarded up to protect it ahead of more planned weekend demonstrations. The prime minister said: We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. A protective box was placed around the statue of the former premier after it was vandalised with the words \u201cWas a racist\u201d. The Cenotaph, which has also now been protected with hoarding, was also targeted. Johnson added: Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial. We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history and impoverish the education of generations to come. Johnson added that the \u201conly responsible action\u201d was to stay away from planned protests this weekend. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have called for an extension to the Brexit transition period, warning Boris Johnson it would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d to exit the bloc at the end of the year amid recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to the prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said \u201cfundamental issues\u201d still remain between the UK and EU negotiators after the most recent round of talks on a deal. The Scottish government has repeatedly called for the transition period to be extended beyond the 31 December deadline, but that can only be done if a request is made before the end of this month. The UK government has previously rejected any calls for an extension. Sturgeon and Drakeford warned in their letter that exiting the transition period at the end of this year, when the UK economy will just be beginning its recovery from coronavirus, would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d. They wrote: No-one could reproach the UK government for changing its position in the light of the wholly unforeseeable Covid-19 crisis, particularly as the EU has made it clear it is open to an extension request. We therefore call on you to take the final opportunity the next few weeks provide to ask for an extension to the transition period in order to provide a breathing space to complete the negotiations, to implement the outcome, and the opportunity for our businesses to find their feet after the enormous disruption of recent months. At the time the Withdrawal Agreement was signed, no-one could have imagined the enormous economic dislocation which the Covid 19 pandemic has caused - in Wales, Scotland, the whole of the UK, in the EU and across the world. The letter claimed that, at best, there would only be a \u201cbare bones\u201d trade deal in place by December, or a move to a no-deal exit from the EU. The National Portrait Gallery will not reopen its doors until 2023. The gallery, currently closed because of the pandemic, had hoped to welcome back visitors before it was due to close on 29 June as part of a \u00a335.5m redevelopment project. But it said it will now remain shut throughout June \u201cto help contain the spread of the virus and ensure the safety of visitors and staff\u201d. The gallery\u2019s director Nicholas Cullinan said: We had very much hoped we would be able to reopen the gallery to visitors before our refurbishment commenced, but sadly it is now clear that this won\u2019t be possible. We understand how disappointing this will be for many people who had planned to visit the gallery for a final time. The gallery, near Trafalgar Square in London, will reopen in spring 2023. It will loan hundreds of works from its collection during the period of closure. David Hockney: Drawing From Life, which was on display when it had to close, will be staged again when the gallery reopens, while the exhibition Cecil Beaton\u2019s Bright Young Things, which was due to end in June, will tour. The transformation of the gallery will be the biggest since it opened its doors in 1896. It plans to create a new main entrance, \u201cbring back to life\u201d its East Wing and create a public forecourt. It will also redisplay all of the collection in its 40 galleries, providing a \u201cgreater and more diverse selection of portraits\u201d. Coronavirus mortality rates more than halved in all but two regions in England and Wales between April and May, the latest ONS figures show. After rising between March and April, age-standardised mortality rates fell by more than 50% in all regions except the north-east, and Yorkshire and the Humber. The greatest decrease was in London, where the mortality rate fell by 83.3%. The local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in May was Preston, in Lancashire, with a rate of 51.1 deaths per 100,000 people. The figures are based on all deaths that occurred in March, April and May 2020 where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, and which had been registered by 6 June. Except in London, mortality rates in May were still higher than in March. The ONS said as more deaths are registered the mortality rate is likely to increase, especially in May. The figures show that people living in the most deprived areas of England continue to experience coronavirus mortality rates more than double those of people living in the least deprived areas (see 10.27am.). Good morning everyone! I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the blog for the remainder of the day. Please feel free to get in touch to share news tips and stories we should be covering. Your contributions are always very welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The British public are deeply divided over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to a new poll published by the Evening Standard. The Ipsos MORI survey finds that Boris Johnson wins a run-off between him and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, over who makes the \u201cmost capable prime minister\u201d by 43% to 38%. More of those polled believe that the prime minister has handled the Covid-19 epidemic well (45%) than badly (42%). This marks a decline since March when the divide was 47%\u201338% in his favour. Infections from Covid-19 have continued to fall, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS snapshot infection survey showed a further fall in infections in the latest data, covering 25 May to 7 June, with an estimated 33,000 people infected at any time over this period, compared to 53,000 in last week\u2019s figures. The estimate is based on tests on nearly 20,000 people in the community, but excludes those in hospitals and care homes. More volunteers are urgently needed to take part in fast-tracked clinical trials to help develop potential Covid-19 treatments, a government research agency chief has said. Although more than 100,000 people have enrolled to take part in the crucial public health research, Professor Nick Lemoine, of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), said \u201clarge numbers of people\u201d are needed to generate the scientific evidence required to establish an effective treatment or vaccine for the disease. The NIHR has prioritised 48 urgent public health research studies with 101,622 participants recruited to date. But as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to drop in the UK, the agency said there is an even greater need for people testing positive with Covid-19 to sign up for research. Prof Lemoine, who is chair of the NIHR\u2019s Urgent Public Health Group, said: \u201cDespite a remarkable 100,000 participants volunteering to help our fight against Covid-19 through taking part in health research, we still need more people to take part. New data reveals the poorest in England and Wales have been hit the hardest by coronavirus. People living in the most deprived areas died of Covid-19 at double the rate of those living in the most wealthy areas, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. The figures show people living in the poorest 10% of England died at a rate of 128.3 per 100,000, compared with those living in the most wealthy 10%, who died at a rate of 58.8 per 100,000, between March and May this year. (Poverty is based on the relative deprivation of small areas which are broken into deciles in the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019.) The same pattern was reflected in Wales where the equivalent rates were 109.5 deaths compared with 57.5 deaths per 100,000. Nine out of 10 local authorities with the highest Covid-19 age-standardised mortality rates were in London. Brent had the highest overall age-standardised rate with 210.9 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Newham (196.8 deaths) and Hackney (182.9 deaths). Confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the UK now stand at 291,409. There\u2019s more here on the latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of the virus in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You can find out more here on how the disease has been progressing where you live: Uber has said that it will make face coverings mandatory for drivers and passengers across the UK from Monday. The minicab app firm\u2019s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said: \u201cFor months we\u2019ve been urging people to stay home, for their safety and the safety of drivers who make essential trips. \u201cNow, as cities begin to reopen and people start moving again, we\u2019re taking measures to help everyone stay safe and healthy every time they use Uber. \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced measures to ensure that every driver can access the PPE (personal protective equipment) they need for free to help keep them safe when driving with Uber, and, from Monday, we will require anyone using the Uber app in the UK to wear a face covering.\u201d Crime recorded by Britain\u2019s largest police force has started to rise after a sharp drop when lockdown measures were imposed. The Metropolitan police said all recorded crime in London dropped to 48,349 offences in April, down from 65,633 the previous month, and compared with 74,898 in April 2019. But in May, total recorded offences went back up to 56,514, according to figures published on the force\u2019s crime data dashboard. Britain\u2019s top police officer had previously said that falls in gun and knife crime under lockdown were \u201csilver linings\u201d to the pandemic. Cressida Dick, the Met commissioner, said officers had a \u201csmile on their face\u201d as they had more time to go after criminals. Strict lockdown measures were eased in England in the middle of May to allow people to spend more time outside and to exercise with one other member of another household. The Metropolitan police had also started taking pre-emptive action ahead of an expected rise in crime as society enjoyed more freedom. Officers visited 1,000 known offenders to try to point them towards \u201cdiversionary activities\u201d in an effort to stop crime returning to pre-pandemic levels. They also targeted 250 \u201cmicro hotspots\u201d of previously high levels of street violence and robbery. The most recent national figures for England and Wales released by the National Police Chiefs Council suggested crime had fallen by a quarter in the four weeks to 10 May, compared with the same period last year. However assaults on emergency services workers were up 14% during the period, and there was a 4% rise in domestic abuse incidents. There\u2019s a fairly damning quote from a UK-based foreign diplomat in a piece from the Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner today about the manner in which the UK has navigated the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cWhat has become of your country?\u201d Warner was asked by the diplomat. \u201cWe see only a ship of fools, and a plague ship at that.\u201d Warner makes the argument that more leadership is needed to bring the UK out of lockdown, writing: \u201cEven as a halfway house, transitional arrangement, the 2-metre rule provides no kind of solution. Schools, restaurants, bars, most retailers, and many workplaces cannot be viable as long as it lasts. Time is running out.\u201d The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has said the government needs to \u201cget a grip\u201d on the coronavirus test-and-trace system because \u201cit is holding us back economically as well as in health terms\u201d. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: \u201cWe have to get that test, track and isolate system working properly. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have it functioning as well as in other nations, then we risk seeing additional lockdowns and much slower reopening than would otherwise occur. \u201cAnd, of course, we risk seeing much lower consumer confidence, and that\u2019s critically important now \u2013 that we push demand up.\u201d Today\u2019s economic figures confirm that Britain \u201cfaces the most serious economic challenge in generations\u201d, tweeted the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, who has also turned his fire on the looming risk again of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cNot a time to exit the world\u2019s largest market. Not a time to increase trade barriers. Not a time to deny business skills they need with a damaging new immigration system.\u201d Virgin Atlantic has become the latest airline to leave a vapour trail of furious customers who are now being told they will have to wait up to four months to receive refunds for cancelled flights. Following warnings in May from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), more airlines have started processing refunds to customers, after initially trying to get customers to accept vouchers rather than the full cash refund to which they are entitled. Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways initially bore the brunt of consumer ire, but Virgin Atlantic customers have this week accused the company of not processing refunds in order to prop up the company. Those behind a Virgin Atlantic refund action group on Facebook, which has more than 400 members, say they are yet to find a single person who has received a voluntary refund from the airline. The airline\u2019s social media channels are bearing the brunt of anger as well. Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, has insisted a move to enable all shops to open on Friday had not been fast-tracked in response to the opening of retailers in the Irish Republic. Retailers were given the all-clear by Stormont ministers on Thursday following a reduction in the numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths. Scientific experts estimated the level of transmission of Covid-19 is manageable. Outlets like independently-run bookshops have spent days getting ready and installing protective screens while those based in shopping centres also received the green light as ministers accelerated the pace at which society emerges from lockdown. Foster said on Friday: \u201cWe have had our plan, we launched it back on the 12th of May, and in that plan we said we would take a step-by-step process out of the lockdown and we would do it in a way that didn\u2019t have a cumulative impact upon the transmission of the virus. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taking steps to come out, we do that in a gradual way, and we think that now is the right time to open all retail.\u201d One third of people who tested positive for coronavirus and were referred to the NHS test-and-trace app were not successfully contacted because they \u201csimply didn\u2019t feel like answering the phone\u201d, the health minister Edward Argar has said. In the first week of the app being in use, 8,117 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England had their case transferred to the NHS system. Of these, 5,407 (67%) were reached, while 2,710 (33%) did not provide information about their contacts or could not be reached. Argar told BBC Breakfast: \u201cSome people won\u2019t necessarily have answered their phone, you and I know what it\u2019s like if you have flu, for example, and Covid-19 is a much, much nastier disease than that, you sometimes simply don\u2019t feel like answering the phone or responding to much at all.\u201d Edward Argar, a junior minister at the Department of Health and Social Care, is being pressed on BBC Radio 4 about when the test-and-trace app, which has been trialled on the Isle of Wight, will be ready. He\u2019s repeating that new ministerial mantra that the app is (altogether now) the \u201ccherry on the cake\u201d. The test-and-trace system has got off to a good start, he insists, despite criticism directed at the government after it emerged that a third of those who have tested positive for the coronavirus in England have not provided details of people they have been close to and may have infected. The data came from the first full week of the new contact-tracing scheme has revealed. On an already difficult day for the government, the Financial Times has this piece on how ministers are braced for a wave of job cuts as big companies prepare to launch redundancy consultations before they have to start picking up some of the cost of furloughed workers. Ministers are reported to fear that many large companies may rush out announcements on job cuts in the coming days and weeks. One minister told the FT that many Tory MPs were being told by local employers that \u201credundancy notices are being prepared\u201d \u2013 a message confirmed by business organisations. Centrica and Johnson Matthey became the latest London-listed companies to announce lay-offs while hundreds of manufacturing jobs are also due to disappear at Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory and Bombardier\u2019s Belfast plant. Matt Hancock is facing legal action from the daughter of a man who died from Covid-19 in a care home in which the health secretary is accused of a \u201clitany of failures\u201d and misleading the public with his claim to have \u201cthrown a protective ring\u201d around care homes. Dr Cathy Gardner launched a high court claim on Friday after her father, Michael Gibson, a retired headteacher, died in an Oxfordshire care home in early April. He became infected after a patient who tested positive for the virus was discharged from hospital into the home. The request for a judicial review alleges failings \u201chave led to large numbers of unnecessary deaths and serious illnesses\u201d and have been \u201caggravated by the making of wholly disingenuous, misleading and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 plainly false statements suggesting that everything necessary has been done to protect care homes during the pandemic\u201d. The size of the fall in GDP due to the coronavirus lockdown is a first, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has said. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWell, 20% is really unprecedented. \u201cActually, if you take March and April together, the fall was 25%. So in two months the economy shrank by a quarter.\u201d The political debate is now being picked up. Here\u2019s Kevin Maguire of the Daily Mirror laying a striking graphic at the feet of the prime minister. The health minister Edward Argar has meanwhile claimed on BBC Breakfast that the economy is \u201cin roughly the same place\u201d as other western European economies. It\u2019s been no secret that the UK growth figures for April would be a horror show. With the economy in full lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic it was inevitable that activity would take a hit of historic proportions. All that was at issue was whether the news from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) would be bad, really bad, calamitous or so far off the scale that even the most hardcore pessimist had not envisaged it. In the end, it was merely calamitous. It goes without saying the 20.4% contraction of the economy was the worst on record. The decline was three times as big as the contraction in March and 10 times as big as anything seen before Covid-19. The economy was 25% smaller in April than in February. Almost two decades of growth has been wiped out in two months. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog coverage of coronavirus developments in the UK, where the country has been learning about what a full month\u2019s lockdown does to its economy. The economy slumped by 20.4% in April in the biggest monthly decline since records began, as the coronavirus lockdown paralysed the country. Richard Partington has that story here on a day when Boris Johnson is expected to come under sustained pressure from his MPs to take further steps to open up the economy, amid calls for caution from other quarters. A range of other indicators are also out while the ongoing ramifications of the public health crisis continue to be felt. On that front, lawyers representing 450 bereaved people whose relatives have died due to Covid-19 have called on the prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to hold an immediate public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis to help prevent many more deaths.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson was accused of \u201cstoking fear and division\u201d ahead of a weekend of Black Lives Matter demonstrations after he unequivocally condemned the removal of historic statues and claimed the protests had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>As statues \u2013 including of Winston Churchill \u2013 were boarded up to protect them ahead of planned marches, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">the prime minister </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">tweeted</a> his opposition to those calling for memorials with links to slavery and racism to be torn down.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,\u201d the prime minister wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson said \u201cwe all understand\u201d the \u201clegitimate feelings of outrage\u201d about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">the police killing of George Floyd</a> in the US last month, but \u201cthe only responsible course of action\u201d was to stay away from this weekend\u2019s protests, which he said had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The comments, set out in eight tweets, marked a significant escalation in his criticism of the protesters, and sparked a backlash ahead of a potentially febrile weekend, amid concerns over clashes between anti-racist campaigners and \u201chate groups\u201d including the far-right.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, urged Johnson not to be \u201cfound wanting\u201d at what he called \u201ca powerful moment in our history\u201d.</p> \n<p>Warning that briefings with the police this week had highlighted the risk of \u201cviolence on our streets,\u201d he said: \u201cThe prime minister should be showing national leadership, by coordinating the government\u2019s response to the complex issues underpinning these protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis means recognising the deep hurt so many black people in our country have spoken so powerfully about, and setting our steps for meaningful action against racism in our country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP and home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests following the horrific killing of George Floyd by a police officer have been overwhelmingly peaceful. The prime minister is stoking division and fear in our communities by suggesting they have been hijacked by extremists.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhen Boris Johnson was elected last year, he promised he wanted to unite our country. Instead he is taking yet another leaf straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook, and deliberately whipping up his base, to divide and polarise our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s intervention came amid pressure from Tory backbenchers to take a tougher line with protesters. Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted: \u201cThis attack on our history [and] our culture [is] increasingly aggravating my constituents. Government need to be absolutely clear and firm on this if we are to keep a lid on increasing tensions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ministers have stressed repeatedly that gatherings of more than six people remain illegal under coronavirus regulations. But protesters said they would not be deterred. While a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">BLM protest planned for Saturday</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\"> was called off</a> after busloads of far-right activists were set to descend on London, anti-racist campaigners vowed to keep demonstrating.</p> \n<p>Tyrek, 21, an organiser with All Black Lives UK, said of Johnson\u2019s tweets: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop us from going out on the streets. It\u2019s within our right to protest. Women\u2019s rights has come from protesting, LGBT rights has come from protesting, any big change has come from protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The protests across the country have been organised sporadically and by individuals not associated with established anti-racist groups in the past two weeks. The organisers of these protests, largely young students, have come together under the umbrella of All Black Lives UK. They are working to facilitate more localised protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve built up momentum from the protests we\u2019ve had and we intend on protesting as much as we can until the government responds to our concerns,\u201d Tyrek said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad, this is a movement. It\u2019s got steam now and it is going to continue going ahead.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Friday, fresh graffiti appeared on road signs on Penny Lane in Liverpool over claims they are linked to slave merchant James Penny, and on a statue of Robert the Bruce at the site of his most famous battle at Bannockburn. It was painted with the slogan BLM and the words \u201cracist king\u201d. Robert the Bruce was king of Scotland from 1306 until his death in 1329 and led Scotland during the first war of Scottish independence against England, centuries before the transatlantic slave trade began.</p> \n<p>Some leftwing Labour MPs have been keen to see the leadership weigh in on the row more robustly.</p> \n<p>Backbencher Clive Lewis, who signed a letter to Priti Patel this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/bame-mps-accuse-priti-patel-of-gaslighting-in-racism-debate\">accusing her of \u201cgaslighting\u201d</a> and shutting down debate after citing her own experience of racism, said he hoped his party\u2019s leadership would continue to speak out. \u201cKeir\u2019s taken the knee: he\u2019s picked a side,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He called for the history curriculum to be changed, so that pupils are taught \u201cthe dark side\u201d of Britain\u2019s past \u2013 and questioned the use of the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe word patriotism, which Keir came out with the other day: if you take it literally, it means fatherlandism. It\u2019s about colonialism. It\u2019s about empire. It\u2019s jingoistic. It\u2019s got lots of connotations. I think we need to unpack it.\u201d He said Labour should be trying to present \u201can inclusive idea of what what it means to be British\u201d.</p> \n<p>Crowds in Bristol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/the-fall-of-edward-colston-statue-bristol-it-didnt-even-take-long-about-four-tugs\">pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston</a> last weekend, sparking a nationwide debate about the future of scores of other monuments to controversial historical figures. All Labour councils in England and Wales announced a review of monuments\u2019 links to slavery.</p> \n<p>The Turner-prize winning sculptor Anish Kapoor described Johnson\u2019s opinion on statutes as \u201cbullshit\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cStatues are not history, they are emblematic monuments to our past which can be thought to represent how we see ourselves and our history. It is long overdue that we reassess these emblems and get rid of the bigots they portray.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must acknowledge the horror perpetrated in our names by these horrid individuals and seek to find nobler ways to make spaces of commemoration and history. This must now mean looking at the forgotten amongst us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The perceived threat to the Churchill statue in Parliament Square, Westminster, which was daubed with graffiti at the weekend, was the focus of tweets by the prime minister. Anti-racist campaigners monitoring hate speech say far-right groups have been using the graffiti to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\">stir anger among </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\"> supporters and would-be recruits</a>.</p> \n<p>BLM organisers said they had decided to call off a planned protest at Hyde Park at 1pm on Saturday, and in a video message to supporters, the far-right extremist Tommy Robinson said he would now not be travelling to the capital as it \u201cwould be detrimental to racial tensions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Police are still expecting protests and laid out conditions that would keep the two sets of demonstrators apart, setting out different routes that they must follow. They ordered that both sets of marchers must disperse by 5pm.</p> \n<p>But discussions on far-right online forums and those of some football gangs have now turned to mobilising in other cities and towns including Leeds, Bristol and Sunderland against perceived threats to contested historical monuments.</p> \n<p>Far-right activists have also discussed targeting statues such as that of Nelson Mandela, perceived to be associated with their opponents, according to researchers at the campaign group Hope not Hate.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany on the far-right who tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care about race, only culture and identity, let the mask slip and openly started talking about whiteness and race again and threatened to pull down the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square,\u201d said Nick Lowles, Hope not Hate\u2019s chief executive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was accused of \u201cstoking fear and division\u201d ahead of a weekend of Black Lives Matter demonstrations after he unequivocally condemned the removal of historic statues and claimed the protests had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d. As statues \u2013 including of Winston Churchill \u2013 were boarded up to protect them ahead of planned marches, the prime minister tweeted his opposition to those calling for memorials with links to slavery and racism to be torn down. \u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,\u201d the prime minister wrote. \u201cThey had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d Johnson said \u201cwe all understand\u201d the \u201clegitimate feelings of outrage\u201d about the police killing of George Floyd in the US last month, but \u201cthe only responsible course of action\u201d was to stay away from this weekend\u2019s protests, which he said had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d. The comments, set out in eight tweets, marked a significant escalation in his criticism of the protesters, and sparked a backlash ahead of a potentially febrile weekend, amid concerns over clashes between anti-racist campaigners and \u201chate groups\u201d including the far-right. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, urged Johnson not to be \u201cfound wanting\u201d at what he called \u201ca powerful moment in our history\u201d. Warning that briefings with the police this week had highlighted the risk of \u201cviolence on our streets,\u201d he said: \u201cThe prime minister should be showing national leadership, by coordinating the government\u2019s response to the complex issues underpinning these protests. \u201cThis means recognising the deep hurt so many black people in our country have spoken so powerfully about, and setting our steps for meaningful action against racism in our country.\u201d Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP and home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests following the horrific killing of George Floyd by a police officer have been overwhelmingly peaceful. The prime minister is stoking division and fear in our communities by suggesting they have been hijacked by extremists.\u201d The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhen Boris Johnson was elected last year, he promised he wanted to unite our country. Instead he is taking yet another leaf straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook, and deliberately whipping up his base, to divide and polarise our communities.\u201d Johnson\u2019s intervention came amid pressure from Tory backbenchers to take a tougher line with protesters. Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted: \u201cThis attack on our history [and] our culture [is] increasingly aggravating my constituents. Government need to be absolutely clear and firm on this if we are to keep a lid on increasing tensions.\u201d Ministers have stressed repeatedly that gatherings of more than six people remain illegal under coronavirus regulations. But protesters said they would not be deterred. While a BLM protest planned for Saturday was called off after busloads of far-right activists were set to descend on London, anti-racist campaigners vowed to keep demonstrating. Tyrek, 21, an organiser with All Black Lives UK, said of Johnson\u2019s tweets: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop us from going out on the streets. It\u2019s within our right to protest. Women\u2019s rights has come from protesting, LGBT rights has come from protesting, any big change has come from protest.\u201d The protests across the country have been organised sporadically and by individuals not associated with established anti-racist groups in the past two weeks. The organisers of these protests, largely young students, have come together under the umbrella of All Black Lives UK. They are working to facilitate more localised protests. \u201cWe\u2019ve built up momentum from the protests we\u2019ve had and we intend on protesting as much as we can until the government responds to our concerns,\u201d Tyrek said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad, this is a movement. It\u2019s got steam now and it is going to continue going ahead.\u201d On Friday, fresh graffiti appeared on road signs on Penny Lane in Liverpool over claims they are linked to slave merchant James Penny, and on a statue of Robert the Bruce at the site of his most famous battle at Bannockburn. It was painted with the slogan BLM and the words \u201cracist king\u201d. Robert the Bruce was king of Scotland from 1306 until his death in 1329 and led Scotland during the first war of Scottish independence against England, centuries before the transatlantic slave trade began. Some leftwing Labour MPs have been keen to see the leadership weigh in on the row more robustly. Backbencher Clive Lewis, who signed a letter to Priti Patel this week accusing her of \u201cgaslighting\u201d and shutting down debate after citing her own experience of racism, said he hoped his party\u2019s leadership would continue to speak out. \u201cKeir\u2019s taken the knee: he\u2019s picked a side,\u201d he said. He called for the history curriculum to be changed, so that pupils are taught \u201cthe dark side\u201d of Britain\u2019s past \u2013 and questioned the use of the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d. \u201cThe word patriotism, which Keir came out with the other day: if you take it literally, it means fatherlandism. It\u2019s about colonialism. It\u2019s about empire. It\u2019s jingoistic. It\u2019s got lots of connotations. I think we need to unpack it.\u201d He said Labour should be trying to present \u201can inclusive idea of what what it means to be British\u201d. Crowds in Bristol pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston last weekend, sparking a nationwide debate about the future of scores of other monuments to controversial historical figures. All Labour councils in England and Wales announced a review of monuments\u2019 links to slavery. The Turner-prize winning sculptor Anish Kapoor described Johnson\u2019s opinion on statutes as \u201cbullshit\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cStatues are not history, they are emblematic monuments to our past which can be thought to represent how we see ourselves and our history. It is long overdue that we reassess these emblems and get rid of the bigots they portray. \u201cWe must acknowledge the horror perpetrated in our names by these horrid individuals and seek to find nobler ways to make spaces of commemoration and history. This must now mean looking at the forgotten amongst us.\u201d The perceived threat to the Churchill statue in Parliament Square, Westminster, which was daubed with graffiti at the weekend, was the focus of tweets by the prime minister. Anti-racist campaigners monitoring hate speech say far-right groups have been using the graffiti to stir anger among supporters and would-be recruits. BLM organisers said they had decided to call off a planned protest at Hyde Park at 1pm on Saturday, and in a video message to supporters, the far-right extremist Tommy Robinson said he would now not be travelling to the capital as it \u201cwould be detrimental to racial tensions\u201d. Police are still expecting protests and laid out conditions that would keep the two sets of demonstrators apart, setting out different routes that they must follow. They ordered that both sets of marchers must disperse by 5pm. But discussions on far-right online forums and those of some football gangs have now turned to mobilising in other cities and towns including Leeds, Bristol and Sunderland against perceived threats to contested historical monuments. Far-right activists have also discussed targeting statues such as that of Nelson Mandela, perceived to be associated with their opponents, according to researchers at the campaign group Hope not Hate. \u201cMany on the far-right who tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care about race, only culture and identity, let the mask slip and openly started talking about whiteness and race again and threatened to pull down the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square,\u201d said Nick Lowles, Hope not Hate\u2019s chief executive.",

Food is now more expensive than at any other time during the nine-year conflict, triggering scenes reminiscent of the Arab spring protests of 2011 on the streets of the nominally government-loyal town of Sweida this week. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live, we want to die in dignity,\u201d and \u201cHe who starves his people is a traitor,\u201d protesters chanted as they marched for consecutive days in the southern city, calling for the downfall of the president and ruling Baath party. Another demonstration is scheduled for Saturday. Assad has all but won Syria\u2019s war, but he is currently struggling on multiple other fronts, including the threat of the coronavirus, a feud with Syria\u2019s richest man, his cousin Rami Makhlouf, and balancing the divergent interests of his backers in Moscow and Tehran. The president\u2019s biggest problem by far, however, is the financial turmoil next door in Lebanon, which has helped send the Syrian economy into meltdown. New US sanctions against his regime that come into force next week could be potentially devastating. Syria\u2019s currency has already nosedived in recent months, falling this week to a record 3,500 pounds to the dollar on the black market, compared with 700 at the beginning of the year. As a result, the cost of living has soared and basics such as flour, sugar, rice and medicine are increasingly hard to find. More than 80% of the country now lives below the poverty line, while the children of regime officials show off sports cars, jewellery and technological gadgets on their Instagram accounts. On Thursday, Assad sacked his prime minister, Imad Khamis, in an attempt to mollify growing public anger, but even in Assadist strongholds such as the coastal city of Latakia people are becoming bolder in their criticism of regime corruption. Public figures including MPs, business leaders and members of the army have all openly criticised government policy in recent weeks. \u201cWhen your kids are hungry, you don\u2019t think of strongmen, you don\u2019t think of what Russia wants, you don\u2019t worry about geopolitics. You blame the person who is in charge. And I see it happening on a daily basis, from people way up in the regime all the way [down] to the average loyalist,\u201d said the activist Shoueb Rifai. \u201cAssad\u2019s biggest risk is no longer what Putin wants, or what Iran wants, or what regional powers are scheming. It is his own people, sitting in a pressure cooker.\u201d Meanwhile, in north-western Idlib province, the last part of the country controlled by Sunni opposition groups, the currency collapse has caused the price of bread to spike by 60%, triggering demonstrations against Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the dominant jihadist group in the area. While the Turkish lira has been in circulation in rebel areas for years, HTS\u2019s civilian wing announced on Thursday that it will begin paying salaries in the Turkish currency to insulate the local population from the Syrian pound\u2019s continued fall. Despite a ceasefire brokered by Ankara and Moscow, this week also saw Russian warplanes carry out the first airstrikes on Idlib and the surrounding area in three months, in which at least three people were killed. The push to retake Idlib at the beginning of this year caused the worst displacement crisis of Syria\u2019s war to date, driving 1 million people from their homes to already overcrowded camps on the Turkish border.",

      "bodyText": "Seven West Media\u2019s $87m saving from a renegotiated AFL deal this week will do little to improve financial issues plaguing the company, according to industry insiders and former employees who have raised concern about large debt and job cuts. The focus on Seven\u2019s financial position comes as it dropped out of the ASX300, the top 300 companies on the stock exchange, on Friday as the value of Australian media companies continues to decline. Guardian Australia has also learned of about 50 workers in production at Seven who were either made redundant or whose contracts were not renewed, a move which followed about 50 earlier redundancies in its sales team. One former employee who was made redundant at the company this year has told Guardian Australia the staff cuts were \u201cmade under the cover of coronavirus\u201d but had been inevitable given the broadcaster\u2019s financial position. Other industry sources also criticised Seven \u2013 whose largest shareholder is mogul Kerry Stokes \u2013 for being slow to adopt digital and streaming technologies, with a former employee saying \u201cit never felt like they moved with the times\u201d. The company includes a publishing arm of several newspapers in Western Australia, including the West Australian. While Seven will be buoyed by ratings wins from its Big Brother reboot and Thursday\u2019s AFL return, it had already been struggling going into the pandemic, with observers pointing to CEO James Warburton\u2019s unsuccessful move to take over regional broadcaster Prime as an indication of problems afoot for the company. In its half year financial report, released to shareholders in February, Seven declared a net loss of $67m for the half year to December 2019, after recording a profit of $83m in the same period the previous year. The report also stated its net debt stood at $683m, with the first repayment due in November 2021 and the final one due in the same month of the following year. Seven has not previously revealed how much of the debt needs to be repaid in each instalment, but if it is unable to meet the payments and it cannot refinance them, the broadcaster could fall into administration like its competitor Ten did in 2017. In addition to the reported job cuts and renegotiated AFL deal, Seven has taken several steps to raise money this year, which include the sale of Pacific Magazines to Bauer Media at the beginning of May for $40m in cash consideration, as well as $6.6m in advertising over three years in Bauer publications. Bauer laid off 60 of the 160 staff it inherited from Pacific days after the deal. Later in May, Seven sold its West Australian Newspapers building in Perth for $75m, as part of an agreement to continue to keep the site as its headquarters under a 15-year lease. Financial analysts have said the sale of its production studio, Seven Studios, could \u201coffset a large portion\u201d of the company\u2019s debt, with UBS\u2019s Eric Choi previously forecasting the in-house operation could raise as much as $400m. While reports suggested Seven had entered negotiations to offload parts of Seven Studios to Beyond Productions, Guardian Australia understands several of the 50 production staff reportedly cut came from within the production house. While a Seven spokesman told Guardian Australia Seven Studios had resumed production of shows including Home and Away, Better Homes and Gardens and Border Security, he declined to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic had impacted the revenue from international sales of shows like Home and Away, which is syndicated to the UK.

      "bodyText": "From your local servo to the oilfields of Saudi Arabia, the petrol industry is in trouble. Oil prices have collapsed, and the coronavirus lockdown has slashed demand to such an extent experts think it might never recover to pre-pandemic levels. In the short term the fall in oil prices has largely been good news for motorists, despite concerns from the competition regulator that some retailers engaged in price gouging by not passing the plunge on quickly enough. But experts say the turmoil has exposed the perilous financial position of the Australian industry, priming it for a shake-up that could reduce competition and increase pump prices. The local industry is dominated by a few big players. There are just four refineries and a handful of big networks of petrol stations. Australia\u2019s two big supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths, are among the keys to the market \u2013 they are deeply involved in petrol through deals with Shell and EG Group (which sells fuel under the Caltex brand), respectively. Competitive tension that helps keep prices low is injected by the presence of smaller groups and independent retailers, says former Caltex executive Ben Everitt. \u201cIf the little guys go out of business it\u2019s going to have a really significant impact on competition,\u201d he says. Everitt now monitors the industry, alongside another former Caltex executive, Mick Jarvie, at data and consulting company The Pricing Project. Demand for petrol tumbled in late April as lockdowns around the world emptied streets of cars. As a result, demand for oil in turn plummeted by as much as 14m barrels a day, global pricing group Oil Price Information Service estimates. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Storage filled up, and because crude oil is difficult to store \u2013 it lets off deadly gases \u2013 traders who had purchased oil and were then required to actually take delivery of it had to pay people to take it off their hands. Back at the pump, prices fell, although not fast enough to satisfy competition tsar Rod Sims. \u201cCoronavirus has had a really significant impact on volumes,\u201d Everitt says. \u201cIf the big guys reduce their prices the little guys have to reduce their prices too.\u201d Petrol profit margins can be slim, depending on the day of the week, due to pricing cycles that can see the price of fuel swing by 20c or more a litre in the space of a couple of days. Sims says the petrol market is \u201cbizarre\u201d. \u201cThat cycle, that demand for action when prices are high, particularly when oil prices are falling, I think gives most people the sense that the petrol market is terrible and of course the ACCC is doing nothing about it,\u201d he says. The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is passionate about petrol (although he is yet to be photographed wielding twin pumps, six-shooter style, as a predecessor has). As oil plunged in late April, Sims waded into the fray, calling on retailers \u2013 especially in regional areas and the smaller capital cities of Hobart, Canberra and Darwin \u2013 to bring petrol prices down faster. He says that when he questions why people portray the ACCC as a toothless tiger, \u201cthe answer inevitably is going to be petrol\u201d. \u201cThey think we should be doing something about petrol, without understanding of course that price gouging is not illegal,\u201d he says. \u201cPrices came down much too slowly, there was a lot of profiteering in all markets.\u201d He said the petrol market was \u201cconcentrated\u201d due to the limited number of players and competition was always a concern because petrol stations could signal prices to each other on their billboards. \u201cIf you had this structure in other markets it might be OK, but in petrol it\u2019s too concentrated because of that ability to signal,\u201d he says. He says the ACCC is not allowed to control prices and doing so could be bad for smaller players anyway. \u201cThe bigger companies have got lower unit costs, so if you price-control them to a reasonable level you put out of business the smaller players.\u201d At the same time, he\u2019s been dealing with the potential sale of Caltex. Potential bids by EG Group and Canada\u2019s Alimentation Couche-Tard have both fallen away. A sale to EG Group would have meant the effective consolidation of Woolworths and Caltex outlets, he says. \u201cClearly there were issues, but we never reached a concluded view,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, a step up the supply chain, Australia\u2019s four oil refineries have also felt the pinch. Even before the crisis, refiners have been reluctant to spend any more money on their ageing plants. Last year, they successfully fended off improvements to Australian fuel standards that would have dramatically reduced noxious emissions, but would also have involved them spending large sums to upgrade their refineries. \u201cA couple of weeks ago it cost money to run a refinery,\u201d Jarvie says. He says the refineries are so old and costly to run that their operators might decide to pull the plug. \u201cYou might just make that call,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big call because the remediation costs are enormous. \u201cI see the refining business in Australia as a year-to-year proposition.\u201d In the longer term, the industry also faces disruption from electric cars. Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, there was much talk of \u201cpeak oil\u201d \u2013 the moment when production of fossil fuels can\u2019t be increased anymore because the world\u2019s supply is beginning to run dry. This was supposed to happen some time before 2010, sending oil prices surging and wreaking economic havoc. Amid ongoing uncertainty about just how much oil really is buried under the sands of Saudi Arabia, peak oil has still yet to happen. But now the phrase has returned in a different context. This time, it describes the peak in consumption that will occur as the natural growth in demand is whittled away by the increasing number of electric vehicles on the road. According to research by not-for-profit group Carbon Tracker released on Thursday, the decarbonisation of the global economy under the Paris Agreement, which is designed to limit global heating to less than 2C, is likely to slash the value of oil, gas and coal reserves by two thirds. Before the coronavirus pandemic, analysts thought the peak in demand for oil might be five years away, Everitt says. \u201cNow the theory is that demand will take so long to recover from coronavirus that it will never come back,\u201d he says. While in the short term a fall in demand should also reduce petrol prices, the fear is that it could make it uneconomic to refine oil in Australia, leaving the country completely dependent on imports. \u201cThe pressure on operators is pretty intense,\u201d Everitt says. \u201cIf I was a large institution invested in an oil company listed in Australia I would want to know what the plan is.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Australia navigates the gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions, experts and businesses say it has reached a crucial few weeks in managing the broad public consensus that has so far marked the response to Covid-19. \u201cA month ago, the risk [of opening up] would have been higher than the benefits,\u201d says Prof Jon Watson, the dean of the health faculty at the University of Western Australia. \u201cNow, the benefits in Australia are higher than the risk.\u201d The fine balancing act is particularly acute in New South Wales, where police have threatened to prosecute protesters who breach health orders, while at the same time the NRL clamours for the return of crowds and wedding venues protest that restrictions have so many anomalies they are becoming unenforceable. Guardian Australia can reveal that no fines have been issued in NSW for breaching coronavirus restrictions since Saturday. Police have been told to use their discretion and have to seek advice from a superior before they fine people. But a spokesperson for NSW Police said restrictions would still be enforced and police would \u201ccontinue to work with individuals, businesses and industry to ensure compliance\u201d. Last Friday the NRL\u2019s corporate boxes were re-approved. On Wednesday, the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced that community sport \u2013 for adults as well as children \u2013 could return to full-fledged competition on 1 July. On Thursday, she said homes and outdoor spaces could now have 20 people, and food courts joined the ever-growing list of venues to welcome the relaxation of restrictions. And on Saturday, gyms will be able to reopen with 100 people (as long as they obey the 4 sq metre rule). On Friday, prime minister Scott Morrison announced that as part of \u201cstep three\u201d in July, national cabinet had agreed stadiums and outdoor venues could have up to 10,000 people in stands \u2013 but it would be up to individual states. There will be no limit for indoor gatherings at venues under the national plan, as long as they adhere to the 4 sq metre rule, except for restaurants, cafes, pubs and clubs, which are still restricted to 50 people, and weddings, which are limited to 20. Since an estimated 20,000 people gathered in Sydney last weekend for a Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter rally, fears have been expressed that the remaining constraints on normal activity will be increasingly questioned, or simply ignored. Peter Strong, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, said his members felt restaurants were increasingly lagging behind. \u201cIf you can go to sport, but can\u2019t go to a restaurant on the way home, people will be wondering why,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Other business owners, such as the head of one of Sydney\u2019s largest wedding venue chains has pledged to reopen \u201cto any numbers\u201d and break restrictions, after seeing eased restrictions elsewhere. Strong said his members would not be taking that approach, but were anxious for the rules to catch up. \u201cMy members want to be safe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no ratbag among them that is sitting there denying everything.

He doesn\u2019t even express sympathy to the families \u2026 It\u2019s as if his policies are being driven by a [Freudian] death drive.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dourado added: \u201cIf we carry on like this \u2026 it\u2019s possible we might even catch up with the US in the number of cases.

      "bodyText": "Brazil has overtaken Britain as the country with the world\u2019s second-highest Covid-19 death toll after a further 843 deaths pushed its total to 41,901. The tally was published on Friday night by a coalition of news outlets which has been compiling independent statistics since Brazil\u2019s health ministry was accused of seeking to conceal the full figures last week. According to the British government 41,481 lives have been lost in the UK since late January although the number rises to more than 50,000 when suspected cases are included. Brazil\u2019s death toll is also considered an underestimate. Only in the US, where the official death toll stands at more than 116,000, have more died. Medical experts have voiced despair at what they call Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s calamitous response to the pandemic. The Trump-admiring former army captain has repeatedly downplayed Covid-19 as media \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201ca bit of a cold\u201d and on 12 April, with the official death toll at 1,223, falsely claimed: \u201cThis matter of the virus appears to be going away.\u201d Since then more than 40,000 Brazilians have died yet the far-right populist has continued to undermine social distancing by attending rallies and visiting shops. Two health ministers have been forced from government in under a month after clashing with Bolsonaro over coronavirus. During a live broadcast on Thursday Bolsonaro \u2013 who has defended his response as designed to protect the economy and jobs \u2013 again minimized the tragedy. He accused Brazilian journalists of focusing too much on the dead in order to produce \u201cfuneral TV\u201d and claimed one former health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, had produced \u201cficticious\u201d Covid-19 statistics in a bid to keep Brazilians at home. \u201cThe aim was to disseminate terror.\u201d Bolsonaro also insinuated his rivals were deliberately exaggerating the number of Covid-19 deaths in their states. \u201cWhat do they hope to gain from this? Political benefits, that\u2019s all it can be. They\u2019re taking advantage of people who are dying to profit politically and blame the federal government,\u201d Bolsonaro claimed. Daniel Dourado, a public health expert and lawyer from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the president shouldered overwhelming responsibility for the scale of the catastrophe. \u201cBolsonaro has played a pitiful role. I\u2019ve not heard of a single country whose president has hampered the fight against the epidemic so much. It\u2019s as if he still hasn\u2019t grasped the danger of the situation. He doesn\u2019t even express sympathy to the families \u2026 It\u2019s as if his policies are being driven by a [Freudian] death drive.\u201d Dourado added: \u201cIf we carry on like this \u2026 it\u2019s possible we might even catch up with the US in the number of cases. It seems preposterous to say this now. But if Brazil reopens and does what the federal government wants \u2026 things could deteriorate very fast. So I\u2019m really worried. As incredible as it might seem, with [about] 1,000 deaths a day we could still be underestimating the impact of this pandemic.\u201d The US has recorded more than 2 million infections, according to Johns Hopkins University, while Brazil has registered 829,902. This week a University of Washington projection found another 100,000 Brazilian lives could be lost by August, meaning Brazil might overtake the US as the country with the highest death toll. Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 crisis is playing out against the backdrop of one of the most bitter and bizarre political crises since its return to democracy in the 1980s. Federal police are investigating at least two of Bolsonaro\u2019s sons for suspected corruption and links to a fake news racket. Last month investigators raided addresses linked to key Bolsonaristas including a former Femen activist turned anti-abortion-militant and a multimillionaire retail magnate famed for wearing garish yellow and green suits and building Statue of Liberty replicas outside his stores. In an apparent bid to stave off the threat of Bolsonaro\u2019s impeachment or the voiding of his 2018 election, loyalists, including top military figures, have played up the threat of military intervention against congress and the supreme court.

[but] sometimes, if you\u2019re alone and you\u2019re fighting someone, it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> on Friday.</p> \n<p>He gave an example of a \u201creally bad person\u201d confronting a police officer and said that situation had played out amid the protests, which were sparked after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes during an arrest attempt in May.</p> \n<p>The autopsy report concluded homicide and the now former officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder. A video by a witness went viral and spurred protests over police bias and brutality and wider issues of societal racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou saw some very good people protesting, but you saw some bad people also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you get somebody in a chokehold.

Let go and say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s start all over again\u2019?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump later said be believed chokeholds to be theoretically acceptable, but he acknowledged they are often used inappropriately by police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said, adding that \u201cyou have to be careful. With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed action by a number of US cities and states towards banning police chokeholds. In the latest such move, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo<strong> </strong>signed legislation on Friday morning to ban chokeholds in the state.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump further stoked controversy over race issues and policing by remarking on Friday that chokeholds sounded \u201cso innocent and so perfect\u201d, and once again claimed he has been the best president for black Americans \u2013 only partially conceding that Abraham Lincoln may have surpassed him. The US president also called his choice to resume rallies on 19 June, the Juneteenth day marking the end of slavery, \u201ca celebration\u201d, despite having picked a city known for a historic massacre of black Americans by white Americans and used divisive language over the anti-racism protests spurred by the police killing of George Floyd. As more American cities and states move to ban chokehold-type restraints by police, Trump said he would like to see a ban on such tactics in most instances, but suggested their use would be understandable in some situations. \u201cI don\u2019t like chokeholds ... [but] sometimes, if you\u2019re alone and you\u2019re fighting someone, it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said in an interview with Fox News on Friday. He gave an example of a \u201creally bad person\u201d confronting a police officer and said that situation had played out amid the protests, which were sparked after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes during an arrest attempt in May. The autopsy report concluded homicide and the now former officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder. A video by a witness went viral and spurred protests over police bias and brutality and wider issues of societal racism. \u201cYou saw some very good people protesting, but you saw some bad people also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you get somebody in a chokehold. What are you going to do now? Let go and say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s start all over again\u2019?\u201d Trump later said be believed chokeholds to be theoretically acceptable, but he acknowledged they are often used inappropriately by police. \u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said, adding that \u201cyou have to be careful. With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d The remarks followed action by a number of US cities and states towards banning police chokeholds. In the latest such move, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo signed legislation on Friday morning to ban chokeholds in the state. In the interview with Fox News\u2019s Harris Faulkner, Trump had been emphasizing the outbreaks of rioting and looting seen during early nights of unrest after Floyd\u2019s killing, on the fringe of larger, peaceful protests. When Faulkner asked the president what he would say to the many peaceful demonstrators, he said: \u201cI think you had protesters for different reasons, and then you had protesting also because, you know, they just didn\u2019t know \u2026 they\u2019re following the crowd.\u201d The comments contrasted with millions on the streets chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, after the dying words uttered by Floyd and Eric Garner, who was killed during a police chokehold arrest attempt in New York in 2014, as well as other victims of police killings. The president\u2019s remarks also flew in the face of the fresh surge of the Black Lives Matter movement, with the slogan emblazoned on clothing, banners and entire city streets. Trump offered several equivocal answers on sensitive issues in a time of exceptional national tumult, with the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic nosedive and the blight of police brutality all falling disproportionately on black Americans. The president has also come under heavy fire for announcing on Thursday, two days after George Floyd\u2019s funeral and a day after his brother testified tearfully to Congress about racism in policing, that he will resume election rallying with an event on 19 June in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the scene of one of the worst race massacres in US history, in 1921. In the Fox interview, Trump said the choice of Juneteenth for a partisan rally was not specific, but \u201cthe fact that I\u2019m having a rally on that day, you can really think about that very positively as a celebration because a rally, to me, is celebration.\u201d A fresh wave of protests is expected that day in many cities and critics have accused him of \u201cracially motivated trolling\u201d and timing akin to \u201cblasphemy\u201d. Senator Kamala Harris of California remarked on Twitter on the implications, calling the move a \u201cwelcome home party\u201d for white supremacists. This week the president has refused outright to consider removing the names of US military bases honoring Confederate leaders from the civil war. And he has spoken up before in defense of Confederate monuments, including after defending white supremacists who rallied to protect one amid violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Friday\u2019s Fox interview, Trump also said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve done more for the black community than any other president, and let\u2019s take a pass on Abraham Lincoln because he did good, although it\u2019s always questionable, you know, in other words, the end result.\u201d It was not clear if \u201cend result\u201d was referring to Lincoln\u2019s assassination. Faulkner, who is black, interjected to say of Lincoln: \u201cWell, we are free, Mr President, so he did pretty well.\u201d Trump has previously claimed that \u201cnobody has ever done for the black community what President Trump has done\u201d, which factcheckers rate as patently false.",
