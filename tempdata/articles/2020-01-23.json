Wuhan, the central Chinese city in Hubei province where the outbreak is believed to have originated in a market, has been put under tighter supervision, Li said, with the sale of live poultry banned.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person.

      "bodyText": "Chinese authorities have suspended all outbound public transport from Wuhan, the city at the centre of an outbreak of the mysterious Sars-like coronavirus, which has so far killed 17 people. Bus, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transportation networks from the city were suspended from 10am local time on Thursday, state media reported. The city\u2019s airport and train stations were also closed to outgoing passengers. The government asked citizens not to leave the city of 11 million unless there were special circumstances, state media said. The latest death toll, announced by the provincial government of the central province of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have originated, almost doubles the previously estimated total. More than 540 people who have contracted the virus have been taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. Many more are thought to have developed a milder form of the illness, which is mainly passed through the respiratory tract. On Thursday, authorities said 571 people had been infected. The first case of the virus was also confirmed in Hong Kong. China is in the midst of a public health crisis as a new strain of coronavirus, from the family of viruses that gave rise to Sars, has swept the country. Officials said the nation was now at the most critical stage of prevention and control, especially as China prepares to celebrate the lunar new year on 25 January and hundreds of millions will crisscross the country. \u201cSpring festival is just around the corner \u2026 which objectively increases the risk of the disease spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control. We must not be careless, and we must be highly vigilant,\u201d said Li Bin, deputy director of the commission. \u201cThe virus may mutate, and there is a risk of further spread of the virus,\u201d he said. The public have been advised to avoid densely populated areas. The World Health Organization put off a decision over whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency and asked its expert committee on the issue to continue their meeting for a second day on Thursday. The Who\u2019s director general said that the emergency measures taken by authorities in Wuhan showed commitment to minimising risks locally and abroad. \u201cWhat they are doing is a very, very strong measure and with full commitment,\u201d said Dr Tedros Ahanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cWe stressed to them that by having a strong action not only they will control the outbreak in their country but they will also minimise the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally.\u201d In the last week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The deaths have all taken place in Hubei province. The commission said more than 2,000 close contacts have been identified and more than 1,000 were under current medical watch. Li said the increase in cases was the result of deeper understanding of the disease and improvements in screening for it. Wuhan, the central Chinese city in Hubei province where the outbreak is believed to have originated in a market, has been put under tighter supervision, Li said, with the sale of live poultry banned. Wild animals and poultry are no longer allowed in the city, he said. The local government has cancelled public activities during the holiday, including the annual prayer-giving at the city\u2019s Guiyan Temple, which attracted 700,000 tourists last year. Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, urged residents to not leave the city and visitors to avoid it so that the possibility of transmission can be reduced. \u201cIf it\u2019s not necessary we suggest that people don\u2019t come to Wuhan,\u201d Zhou told state broadcaster CCTV. Fever scanners have been set up at the city\u2019s train station and airport and officials check the temperatures of drivers at highway checkpoints, while outbound tour groups have been banned from leaving the city. Taiwan\u2019s China Airlines and Singapore\u2019s Scoot cancelled flights into Wuhan on Thursday. The commission noted the virus is being treated as a class A disease, which means authorities can quarantine patients and put affected areas on lockdown. Li said the government had implemented measures to prevent further spread, including adding temperature checks, minimising large crowds, more screening of potentially infected patients and more protections for health workers. The virus has also been confirmed outside of China, in the US, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. On Wednesday, Thailand confirmed four new cases of the virus while Macau reported its first cases, and officials have introduced health screenings at all airports that have daily flights from Wuhan, including Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueng, Chiang Mai and Phuket. As many as 1,400 tourists from Wuhan visit Thailand every day, according to local media, with many more expected to travel to celebrate the lunar new year. Hong Kong, which was hit particularly hard by Sars, confirmed its first case on Wednesday, according to local media. Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, has appealed to citizens not to visit central China. \u201cI want to call on our nationals please not to visit this region if not necessary,\u201d Tsai Ing-wen wrote on her Facebook page late on Tuesday, referring to Wuhan. North Korea has also banned foreign tourists to guard against the spread of a new virus from China, one tour operator said. The temporary closing of the North Korean border would begin on Wednesday, according to Young Pioneer Tours. Meanwhile, Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific said that it will allow cabin crew to wear surgical masks on mainland flights, after a flight attendant union said it had been flooded with messages of concern from members. Investor nerves over the spread of a deadly new virus from China rattled Asian equities and oil benchmarks on Thursday.

This is Martin Farrer bringing you a taste of the best stories and features from the Guardian this Thursday morning.</p> \n<p>Residents of Wuhan have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown\">thrown into panic</a> after authorities placed the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak into lockdown, banning all outgoing modes of transport and advising people not to leave unless it was an emergency. People reported that supermarket shelves were being emptied and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and locked themselves at home amid an outbreak that has left at least 17 people dead and infected almost 600 more across China, Asia and the US. Petrol stations were also overwhelmed by demand as drivers stocked up on fuel and it was reported that pharmacies had sold out of face masks. Videos posted online showed highway routes out of the city had also been blocked and special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. \u201cI am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn\u2019t serious so no one thought it was a big deal,\u201d said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker.</p> \n<p>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/coronavirus-doctors-use-robot-to-treat-first-known-us-patient\">doctors are using robots</a> to treat a man in Washington state who contracted the virus after visiting China.

The UN special rapporteurs \u2013 Agn\u00e8s Callamard and David Kaye \u2013 were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the apparent targeting of Bezos and what appeared to be an \u201ceffort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia\u201d. The rapporteurs, who are investigating the death of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018, said a WhatsApp account in the prince\u2019s name sent two messages to Bezos revealing confidential information about Bezos\u2019s private life. A message sent in November 2018, shortly after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, included a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/22/click-i-agree-un-rapporteur-says-prince-tried-to-intimidate-bezos-with-text\">\u201csardonic message\u201d</a> along with a picture of a woman resembling a woman with whom Bezos was conducting an affair.

Speaking to the Guardian for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/22/rebecca-long-bailey-sets-out-vision-of-hope-in-labour-leadership-pitch\">the second part of our series on the future of the party</a>, the candidate identified as the heir to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s brand of leftwing politics says \u201cthe only way we ever win\u201d is by appealing to a broad coalition of voters. She praised the policies in the party\u2019s much-criticised manifesto but hinted that strategists failed to present them with one clear message and suggested she would shake up Labour\u2019s organisation. We also look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/labour-leadership-momentum-survive\">what the election loss means for Momentum</a>, the 40,000-strong organisation that rose to prominence in the party during the Corbyn era.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump \u2018cheat\u2019 \u2013</strong> The lead prosecutor at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump has described the case as a national crisis and said the president tried to \u201ccheat\u201d his way to re-election.

Here are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/trump-impeachment-trial-day-2-key-takeaways\"> five key takeaways</a> from the day. As he prepared to return from Davos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/trump-travel-ban-visa-social-security-medicare\">Trump stepped up his bid for another term</a> by indicating he would increase the number of countries subject to a travel ban to the US, cut Medicare payments and attend an anti-abortion event.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Judge \u2018outdated\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Family court judges could be forced to undergo training on the appropriate way to deal with sexual assault cases after a woman complained about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/23/outdated-views-rape-judges-training-appeal\">a judge\u2019s \u201coutdated\u201d views on what constituted rape</a>. The woman has won an appeal after judge Robin Tolson said her allegations of domestic sexual violence were \u201cuntrue\u201d, and that she was \u201cnot raped\u201d because the woman \u201ctook no physical steps\u201d to stop the man.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Firefighters killed \u2013 </strong>Three Americans have been killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/23/all-three-crew-members-dead-in-crash-of-air-tanker-fighting-bushfires-in-snowy-monaro-region\">after an air tanker they were flying crashed while tackling bushfires in New South Wales</a>.

Experts say the vitrified brains belonged to a man of about 25 who was found in the 1960s lying face-down on a wooden bed under a pile of volcanic ash. Brain tissue is rarely discovered intact but they believe that temperatures reached 520C during the eruption, igniting body fat and vaporising soft tissue.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Peak meat \u2013 is veganism the future?</h2> \n<p>Marco Springmann, a public health expert, tells Anushka Asthana why cutting out animal products is the best route to a healthy diet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/23/peak-meat-is-veganism-the-future\">and why veganism is good for the planet</a>.

But although some digital and marketing experts think the couple can take their place alongside the likes of the Obamas in the influencer elite, others aren\u2019t so sure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/23/royals-for-rent-will-harry-and-meghan-become-the-worlds-biggest-influencers\">Elle Hunt checks out what\u2019s in store for the semi-detached royals.</a></p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/manchester-city-financial-fair-play-breaches-2012-13-accounting-sponsorships-uefa-champions-league\">Manchester City made inadmissible submissions to Uefa</a> over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the Guardian can reveal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Burnley have a famous first win at Old Trafford since 1962</a>, but the loss for Manchester United spoke of their callowness and inability to turn possession into goals. The Australian Open needs some drama that does not involve sodden red dust falling out of the sky or players choking on polluted air \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/23/coco-gauff-and-naomi-osaka-to-put-australian-open-focus-back-on-court\">Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka will surely provide it</a> on day five.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Police stop people leaving stricken Chinese city Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you a taste of the best stories and features from the Guardian this Thursday morning. Residents of Wuhan have been thrown into panic after authorities placed the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak into lockdown, banning all outgoing modes of transport and advising people not to leave unless it was an emergency. People reported that supermarket shelves were being emptied and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and locked themselves at home amid an outbreak that has left at least 17 people dead and infected almost 600 more across China, Asia and the US. Petrol stations were also overwhelmed by demand as drivers stocked up on fuel and it was reported that pharmacies had sold out of face masks. Videos posted online showed highway routes out of the city had also been blocked and special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. \u201cI am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn\u2019t serious so no one thought it was a big deal,\u201d said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker. In the US, doctors are using robots to treat a man in Washington state who contracted the virus after visiting China. Pacific nations that are just recovering from a deadly spate of measles are now ramping up biosecurity measures to cope with possible cases of coronavirus. Follow how the outbreak has developed and spread at our timeline here. * * * \u2018Sardonic message\u2019 \u2013 The United Nations has called for US authorities to investigate evidence that Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss and owner of the Washington Post, had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The UN special rapporteurs \u2013 Agn\u00e8s Callamard and David Kaye \u2013 were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the apparent targeting of Bezos and what appeared to be an \u201ceffort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia\u201d. The rapporteurs, who are investigating the death of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018, said a WhatsApp account in the prince\u2019s name sent two messages to Bezos revealing confidential information about Bezos\u2019s private life. A message sent in November 2018, shortly after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, included a \u201csardonic message\u201d along with a picture of a woman resembling a woman with whom Bezos was conducting an affair. The rapporteurs also warned world leaders in Davos who might be meeting Saudi delegates that their electronic security was \u201cfragile\u201d. * * * \u2018Hopeful vision\u2019 \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey says Labour has to appeal to aspirational voters with a more \u201chopeful vision\u201d if it is to win another election as she steps up her leadership campaign. Speaking to the Guardian for the second part of our series on the future of the party, the candidate identified as the heir to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s brand of leftwing politics says \u201cthe only way we ever win\u201d is by appealing to a broad coalition of voters. She praised the policies in the party\u2019s much-criticised manifesto but hinted that strategists failed to present them with one clear message and suggested she would shake up Labour\u2019s organisation. We also look at what the election loss means for Momentum, the 40,000-strong organisation that rose to prominence in the party during the Corbyn era. * * * Trump \u2018cheat\u2019 \u2013 The lead prosecutor at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump has described the case as a national crisis and said the president tried to \u201ccheat\u201d his way to re-election. But although Adam Schiff evoked constitutional history and the global promise of US democracy to outline his case against the US president on day two of the trial in Washington, Republicans remained unmoved about the need for any new evidence. Here are five key takeaways from the day. As he prepared to return from Davos, Trump stepped up his bid for another term by indicating he would increase the number of countries subject to a travel ban to the US, cut Medicare payments and attend an anti-abortion event. * * * Judge \u2018outdated\u2019 \u2013 Family court judges could be forced to undergo training on the appropriate way to deal with sexual assault cases after a woman complained about a judge\u2019s \u201coutdated\u201d views on what constituted rape. The woman has won an appeal after judge Robin Tolson said her allegations of domestic sexual violence were \u201cuntrue\u201d, and that she was \u201cnot raped\u201d because the woman \u201ctook no physical steps\u201d to stop the man. * * * Firefighters killed \u2013 Three Americans have been killed after an air tanker they were flying crashed while tackling bushfires in New South Wales. The plane went missing in the Snowy mountains area near the border with Victoria as fires flared again in Australia amid soaring temperatures. Many American and Canadian firefighters have been in Australia to help during the fire emergency. Follow all the latest updates at our blog here. * * * Roman ruined \u2013 Scientists studying human remains from Herculaneum, one of the Roman towns buried after the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79, have found that the heat was so intense that one victim\u2019s brain turned to glass. Experts say the vitrified brains belonged to a man of about 25 who was found in the 1960s lying face-down on a wooden bed under a pile of volcanic ash. Brain tissue is rarely discovered intact but they believe that temperatures reached 520C during the eruption, igniting body fat and vaporising soft tissue. Today in Focus podcast: Peak meat \u2013 is veganism the future? Marco Springmann, a public health expert, tells Anushka Asthana why cutting out animal products is the best route to a healthy diet \u2013 and why veganism is good for the planet. Plus: Alex Hern on the Guardian\u2019s exclusive story of how the Amazon chief, Jeff Bezos, allegedly had his phone hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message apparently sent from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Lunchtime read: Can Harry and Meghan become influencers-in-chief? They are instantly recognisable, already have millions of online followers and until recently worked for a very well-known firm. So it seems a no-brainer that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will be able to make a comfortable living as online \u201cinfluencers\u201d, monetising their fame on social media through product endorsement and the like. But although some digital and marketing experts think the couple can take their place alongside the likes of the Obamas in the influencer elite, others aren\u2019t so sure. Elle Hunt checks out what\u2019s in store for the semi-detached royals. Sport Manchester City made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the Guardian can reveal. Burnley have a famous first win at Old Trafford since 1962, but the loss for Manchester United spoke of their callowness and inability to turn possession into goals. The Australian Open needs some drama that does not involve sodden red dust falling out of the sky or players choking on polluted air \u2013 and Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka will surely provide it on day five. In rugby, the report that led to Saracens being relegated found the club\u2019s owner, Nigel Wray, broke the rules by entering into ventures totalling \u00a31.3m with England players Maro Itoje, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Chris Ashton. Tom Kohler-Cadmore accepts he was \u201c100% in the wrong\u201d to be part of the sordid WhatsApp group that emerged during Alex Hepburn\u2019s rape trial and is now trying to prevent young cricketers from doing the same. Business Elon Musk is on course for a $50bn payout after his technology company, Tesla, surged in value past the $100bn mark. The worsening coronavirus outbreak in China sent Asian stocks tumbling again overnight. Shanghai shares were worst hit, dropping 2.75%, while Hong Kong was down 1.9%. The FTSE100 is on course for a small dip at the opening later this morning. The pound is up at \u00a31.312 and \u20ac1.185. The papers Many papers lead with the threat to Britain from the coronavirus outbreak in China. The Mail says \u201cUK on killer virus alert\u201d, the i has \u201cBritain on virus alert as medics fear global pandemic\u201d, the Metro goes with \u201cChina virus \u2018on the way here\u2019\u201d and the Sun says \u201cWorld war flu\u201d. The Guardian leads again on the sensational Jeff Bezos story, splashing with \u201cUN demands inquiry into \u2018hacking\u2019 of Amazon boss\u201d. The Telegraph also likes this story and says \u201cSaudi crown prince tried to \u2018intimidate\u2019 Amazon chief\u201d. The Times has a story from Davos saying \u201cBritain heads for clashes with US on three fronts\u201d, while the FT has the same one: \u201cUK-US relations turn sour after war of words on trade and tariffs\u201d. The Express leads with \u201cBoris: I want to cut taxes\u201d. The Mirror prefers to mark the sad death of Terry Jones with a tribute from fellow Python Michael Palin: \u201cTerry fought dementia with laughs to the end\u201d.

Like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/coronavirus-virus-spreading-through-china-should-people-be-worried\">passed human to human</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>At the nearby Walmart, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of Chinese life. On a busy morning at a so-called \u201cwet market\u201d in the Shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very Cantonese part of Shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. Slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies.</p> \n<p>Just a few minutes away at the nearby Walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. It has your average western supermarket vibe \u2013 white daylight lighting, sterile and clean.</p> \n<p>Staff at the meat counter in Walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. So why the huge difference in foot traffic?</p> \n<p>Molly Maj, a corporate communications representative for Walmart, says \u201cthe average customer in China still prefers fresh meat\u201d over other options.</p> \n<p>One reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to China in recent years. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eb341d6a43a605b2b606f339d611ee998a23939\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb341d6a43a605b2b606f339d611ee998a23939/0_0_5926_3956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food for sale at a food market in Sichuan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wet\u2019 markets are a huge part of life in China but have been linked to disease outbreaks.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators.

      "bodyText": "Each evening, under cover of darkness, hundreds of live pigs from farms across China are trucked through the rusting gates of a cluster of mildew-stained quarantine and inspection buildings in the Qingshuihe logistics zone in Shenzhen. Overnight they are checked for illness, primarily the African swine fever (ASF) that is expected to kill off a quarter of the world\u2019s pigs, and reloaded on to ventilated trucks with dual mainland China and Hong Kong licence plates. Before sunrise the caravan makes its way five-and-a-half miles south to the border at Man Kam To, a small customs and immigration checkpoint, where the pigs go through further visual health checks before crossing into Hong Kong. They are bound for Sheung Shui slaughterhouse, the largest of three abattoirs in the territory. Once there they will be checked again before being dispatched in less than 24 hours under new rules meant to prevent the spread of ASF. It\u2019s a lot of effort to get fresh meat from the 1,400 pigs that cross the border each day. The appetite for freshly slaughtered \u2018warm meat\u2019 For various reasons, the Chinese prefer freshly slaughtered pig, chicken and beef over chilled or frozen meat that has been slaughtered before being shipped. That desire is at the heart of why diseases such as avian flu in poultry and ASF have been so difficult to eradicate, with huge movements of live animals from all over the country \u2013 from farm to slaughterhouse to market \u2013 on a daily basis making controlling the spread of disease incredibly difficult. A recent coronavirus outbreak in China has been linked to a wet market in Wuhan, eastern China. Like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being passed human to human. But despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of Chinese life. On a busy morning at a so-called \u201cwet market\u201d in the Shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very Cantonese part of Shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. Slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies. Just a few minutes away at the nearby Walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. It has your average western supermarket vibe \u2013 white daylight lighting, sterile and clean. Staff at the meat counter in Walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. So why the huge difference in foot traffic? Molly Maj, a corporate communications representative for Walmart, says \u201cthe average customer in China still prefers fresh meat\u201d over other options. One reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to China in recent years. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do. The habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators. They say they can tell the quality of fresh meat by its smell, colour and how it feels to the touch. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking with my students I say: \u2018The term warm meat, fresh meat, sounds disgusting to me, I grew up [in Germany] with chilled meat, that\u2019s all I know,\u201d Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at City University in Hong Kong and an expert on diseases related to animal husbandry, says. \u201cSo I ask them why and they come up with all sorts of vague things like the soup tastes better or that it is a trust issue, knowing it is a live animal at the other end and not some diseased animal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all very subjective.\u201d An \u2018utter disaster\u2019 for disease Wet markets are central to the perception that fresh meat is better, says Pfeiffer. They evoke nostalgia among shoppers, many of whom come from rural areas where all they knew were wet markets and no refrigeration. Where a wet market feels familiar a supermarket can seem alien and out of place. \u201cI actually believe that it is an important thing for the older generation to go to the wet market and chat,\u201d says Pfeiffer. However, the way the animal trade operates in China is \u201can utter disaster\u201d, for animal disease and welfare, he adds. A year ago, before rising concerns about the spread of ASF, nearly 4,000 pigs crossed daily with less scrutiny. Pigs were held in dismal conditions for as long as five days before being slaughtered on the Hong Kong side, greatly enhancing the possibility of disease transmission, says Pfeiffer. The recent shortages due to the ASF outbreak have doubled and tripled prices for fresh pork at wet markets across Hong Kong. Farms in Hong Kong itself can usually supply about 300 pigs a day. Land use and environmental restrictions prevent any increase in production. The result is further worries about Hong Kong\u2019s reliance on mainland China beyond its water and energy dependence. \u201cMany years ago, we had imports from all over Asia of live animals, but eventually the entire supply was monopolised by mainland China,\u201d said Helena Wong, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council panel on food safety and environmental hygiene. \u201cThey killed all their competitors and monopolised the supply of live pig and chicken.\u201d More than 6,000 pigs at the Sheung Shui slaughterhouse were culled in May 2019 after ASF was found among animals brought in from China. Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council is now trying to figure out how much it owes traders and farmers in compensation. Massive culls of poultry due to avian flu in imported mainland chickens in the last decade also led to large compensation bills and, eventually, to ending live chicken imports in early 2016. \u201cWe as taxpayers have to give that money,\u201d said Wong. \u201cSo now we are in a big crisis because in the past few years we have experienced avian flu and now African swine fever.\u201d A future beyond \u2018warm meat\u2019 for Hong Kong Disease outbreaks have raised wider questions about the sustainability of Chinese consumers\u2019 appetite \u2013 both on the mainland and in Hong Kong \u2013 for what is often called \u201cwarm\u201d meat. For Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China, a deeper issue driving the live animal trade is a cultural disconnect about animal welfare. \u201cThe main problem is the indifference or perception of people who simply regard animals as food, tools, or as things that people can do anything they want to,\u201d she said. \u201cIn particular, there is no perception of farm animals as having feelings, or being capable of feeling pain or suffering.\u201d Hong Kong may find it difficult to switch to a different model. There is almost no chance of farm expansion to support larger scale production within Hong Kong and, although the government is looking at possibilities of live imports from other Asian countries, the ports do not have adequate facilities to cope with large numbers. \u201cTo a large extent, if we insist on fresh food, we have to rely on China,\u201d said Wong. \u201cIf we can change and make certain concessions, Hong Kong has always been an open market for importing food items from many parts of the world.

You can\u2019t fault this film for its ambition and its willingness to pull out all the stops in terms of spectacle, especially during a colossal slapstick fight scene at Tokyo airport and zany chaos at Tokyo\u2019s world-famous Shibuya crossing. Bizarrely, after all the knockabout absurdity, the movie climaxes with a melodramatic court scene involving a passionate speech and a sentimental flashback to the culprit\u2019s unhappy childhood. We get a diverting moment when the \u201clocked room\u201d detective-story theories of mystery author John Dickson Carr are given an airing. There\u2019s a puppyish charm here. The release of Detective Chinatown 3 has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Panic in Wuhan as China bars 11m residents from leaving Supermarket shelves are bare and the sense of panic is palpable in Wuhan after the Chinese city of 11 million people was put on lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Public transport out of the city has been suspended in response to the outbreak, which has now killed 17 people and infected almost 600 in China and spread to three other Asian countries and the US. However, the World Health Organization has so far refrained from declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. US case. Doctors have been using a robot to treat the first person diagnosed with the disease in the US, a man in his 30s who recently returned from China and who is said to be in \u201csatisfactory condition\u201d at a hospital in Everett, Washington. \u2018Warm meat\u2019. A market where animals are freshly slaughtered rather than chilled has been identified as the source of the virus. Experts say the Chinese appetite for so-called \u201cwarm meat\u201d has long hampered efforts to prevent such disease outbreaks. Schiff warns of dim future in opening impeachment argument The Democrats\u2019 lead impeachment prosecutor, congressman Adam Schiff, used appeals to constitutional history and warnings about future US decline as he strove to persuade Republicans of his opening argument in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial on Wednesday. But there appeared to be little shift in the partisan battle lines, and some frustration at the strictures of the trial format, while the GOP Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, conspicuously nodded off several times during Schiff\u2019s presentation. Trump tweets. Trump tweeted and retweeted 131 times about his impeachment trial as he travelled home from the Davos summit on Wednesday, setting a record for his most active day on the social media platform since he became president. Florida swing voters. In Florida\u2019s I-4 corridor, a famously key election battleground, swing voters tell Richard Luscombe they are barely paying attention to the impeachment battle. Trump announces plan to expand travel ban Donald Trump on Wednesday revealed a raft of new policy proposals, including adding \u201ca couple of countries\u201d to his controversial travel ban, as he prepared to return to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. On Thursday his administration is expected to unveil new visa restrictions targeting so-called \u201cbirth tourism\u201d. The president also indicated his willingness to make cuts to social security and Medicare \u2013 a marked shift in policy between his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. Anti-abortion march. Trump has said he will speak at an anti-abortion demonstration in Washington on Friday, organised by the group March for Life. He will be the first president ever to attend the annual event in person. BP lobbying. US government documents show BP successfully lobbied the Trump administration to weaken a major environmental law, making it easier for infrastructure projects such as pipelines to move forward. UN demands US inquiry into claims of Saudi Bezos hack UN experts have demanded a US inquiry into claims that the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, was hacked with spyware secreted in a May 2018 WhatsApp message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. In November of the same year, after the murder by Saudi agents of the Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Bezos received an \u201cintimidating\u201d message from the same sender, apparently referring to the Bezos\u2019s then secret extramarital affair. US VIPs. Bin Salman met dozens of prominent Americans during the same 2018 tour on which he met Bezos. It is not clear how many he exchanged WhatsApp messages with, though there are unconfirmed reports that he used the messaging platform to chat with Jared Kushner. Cheat sheet One person was killed and seven injured in a mass shooting in Seattle on Wednesday afternoon, the third shooting incident in the city\u2019s downtown area in two days. Three American firefighters have died after their waterbombing air tanker crashed while battling bushfires in Australia\u2019s New South Wales on Thursday. A report produced by more than 70 scholars, union leaders, economists and activists has called for an overhaul of America\u2019s labor laws, saying the best way to combat inequality in the US is to strengthen unions and empower workers. The numbers of western monarch butterflies wintering on the coast of California are critically low for the second year in a row, with an estimated population of 29,000 \u2013 down from 4.5 million in the 1980s. Must-reads Will Harry and Meghan monetise their social media brand? Now that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been relieved of their official royal responsibilities, a new empire stretches before them, writes Elle Hunt: the realm of sponsored content. So will they make their living as social media influencers? How the NRA shaped policy at the interior department In 2017, the National Rifle Association lobbyist Benjamin Cassidy took up a job at the US interior department. His appointment epitomises the deep influence the gun group has at the agency, as a raft of previously unreleased emails reveal. Jimmy Tobias reports. Will The Witcher\u2019s success start a game-to-TV boom? According to Netflix, its new fantasy show The Witcher is on course to be the platform\u2019s most popular opening season ever. Based on a series of fantasy novels but commissioned off the back of a hit game, its success suggests TV is a better fit for game adaptations than the big screen, writes Keith Stuart. The Mormons standing up to Mexico\u2019s drug cartels When nine Mormon women and children were shot dead by cartel members in Mexico last year, many of their community fled north to the US. But two of their cousins stayed to launch a quixotic campaign for justice. \u201cWe have to overcome our fears and do whatever we can,\u201d they tell David Agren. Opinion A man with far-right views who attacked the Guardian columnist Owen Jones outside a pub in London last year has been convicted. But, Jones asks, is a lengthy prison sentence the best way to deal with an extremist? Conceding there are no easy solutions can surely not detract from the basic fact that there is no judicial solution to fascism. My attacker, James Healy, is likely to go to prison a far-right thug and leave much the same way, perhaps even more entrenched in his belief system. Sport Zion Williamson began to deliver on his considerable promise in his NBA debut for the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night, scoring 22 points that briefly gave his team the lead in the fourth quarter. But the Pelicans ultimately went down to a 121-117 defeat against the San Antonio Spurs. Rising star Coco Gauff and defending champion Naomi Osaka will face each other in the third round of the Australian Open on Friday. The pair light up the women\u2019s game like few of their contemporaries, writes Kevin Mitchell, and their clash ought to bring much-needed excitement to a tournament overshadowed by the off-court drama of the nearby bushfires.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly an extraordinary development.

Wuhan\u2019s disease prevention and control centre released a statement on Thursday asking residents not to panic and not to stockpile. \u201cAt the present time, Wuhan\u2019s reserves of food, medicine and other supplies are all enough,\u201d it said. Authorities have made an effort to update citizens regularly on the situation and state media have attempted to frame the current shutdown as a battle being waged by the people of Wuhan for the good of the country. The state-run People\u2019s Daily posted on Weibo: \u201cCome on Wuhan, let us win this disease prevention war together!\u201d But residents are wary of the information provided by their government, which in recent weeks repeatedly said the virus was not serious and was \u201ccontrollable\u201d. \u201cI am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn\u2019t serious so no one thought it was a big deal,\u201d said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker who described going out in large crowds on New Year\u2019s Eve, despite the virus having been detected before then. \u201cThen this morning, Wuhan was suddenly sealed off. I think the government\u2019s early warnings were not enough.\u201d Others criticised local authorities, who held a lunar new year banquet for 40,000 people days before authorities announced that the virus could be transmitted between humans. \u201cIt\u2019s been a month since the first case was discovered and only now do they think of closing the city? This Wuhan emergency response is a little slow, right?\u201d another Weibo user wrote. As reports circulated online that food prices had gone up in Wuhan, there were calls for government intervention. One person said: \u201cThe government needs to address this. If things become too expensive, people will definitely panic and when people feel unsafe, terrible things happen. Right now people are fighting over supplies, soon they may just be fighting.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

      "body": "<p>Very few MPs were taking any chances with the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Which is why the Commons chamber was almost entirely empty for the ministerial statement about it. Some clearly appear to believe the risk of contagion is so high that even talking about it can spread the disease.</p> <p>Fortunately the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is more selfless than many. And more fearless. One of the more charming things about Matt \u2013 other than his gullibility: he consistently remains the only person in the entire country who believes Boris Johnson will actually build 40 new hospitals \u2013 is his tireless dedication to the cause. Tigger doesn\u2019t just wear his NHS badge on the lapel of his suit; he has it attached to his pyjamas in bed at night. As does his Pooh bear teddy.</p> <p>Matt is so hands-on and lives and breathes the NHS so much that he now rather considers himself to be the nation\u2019s doctor-in-chief, rather than a politician with no clinical experience. So for his Commons statement, he tried to adopt the serious yet deeply reassuring bedside tone of a disaster movie superhero who was preventing widespread panic before going back into the contaminated danger zone to singlehandedly save the planet.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it turned out that Tigger didn\u2019t actually have anything worthwhile to divulge. All he had was the same information that was readily available to anyone following the news. The coronavirus was primarily confined to Wuhan city in China, which was now in lockdown. There had been 511 cases confirmed with 17 fatalities, though it was possible these figures could rise. No shit. Isolated cases had been reported in the US and Japan, but none confirmed in the UK so far. But he was ready if there were as the UK was upgrading its risk level from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d. He said it in a way that made \u201clow\u201d sound like a red alert. Either no one had bothered to tell him there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/increased-likelihood-coronavirus-uk-health-secretary-matt-hancock\">four suspected cases in Scotland </a>or he just didn\u2019t want to worry anyone. \u201cMost people do recover,\u201d he added, trying not to sound too disappointed. It\u2019s hard to be appreciated as a proper saviour unless there\u2019s some jeopardy.</p> <p>After advising a few MPs, who were concerned about the wellbeing of their Chinese constituents, that the best way to avoid the coronavirus was not to travel to Wuhan or have anything to do with someone who had just returned from there, Matt then donned his white coat to give one-to-one consultations. He told the shadow health secretary, Sharon Hodgson, that there was no need for her or anyone else to worry if they were suffering from a cough as the disease typically took 10 to 14 days to gestate. Something I found particularly reassuring, as I had been up half the night hacking my guts out and had been prone to the odd hypochondriacal thought. Nice to know Matt\u2019s got my back.</p> <p>There was also no need at present \u2013 at present \u2013 for anyone to wear face masks or hazmat suits, but if anyone was at all concerned, they were to ring the NHS 111 helpline and Dr Matt would personally be on standby to take any calls throughout the weekend. For once, though, his surgery was almost empty, so the entire consultation session was over in a record 15 minutes. Most ministerial statements last a minimum of 45 minutes.</p> <p>But if Matt was disappointed at the lack of referrals, he was too professional to show it. He had done his bit to keep the country safe and that\u2019s what counted. If only he could show the same diligence in other areas of his job, then people might not be dying unnecessarily owing to hospitals missing their A&amp;E and cancer targets.</p> <p>There had been a rather fuller house for international trade departmental questions earlier in the day. Then there had been no risk of imminent death and many MPs had come along out of curiosity as they suspected the session might be something of a collector\u2019s item. With the withdrawal agreement having passed both houses \u2013 sorry, child refugees, you\u2019ll just have to take your chances \u2013 Brexit is now a done deal, which means that we\u2019re about to get down to the much trickier, hard graft of negotiating new trade deals. And as even Boris Johnson can see that the last person you would want in charge of this is someone as catastrophically dim as Liz Truss, it\u2019s likely her days are numbered with a reshuffle imminent.</p> <p>Still, you have to give Truss credit. If this was to be her last outing at the dispatch box, then she was going to go out in the style on which her reputation had been built: confusion and incompetence. She opened by heralding a new dawn of UK-US trade. She had no idea how any such deal could be agreed without first having established what levels of alignment the UK would be keeping with the EU, but she was certain that the new agreement would mean no tariffs on car exports to the US. She then added in the same breath that the UK should be free to impose a digital service tax if it wanted to, even though the US had insisted it would impose tariffs on cars if we did. Go figure.</p> <p>I\u2019ll miss Truss when she\u2019s gone, even if few others will. She\u2019s been very good to me. But then I said much the same when Liam Fox was sacked from the same job. My one consolation is that her successor will almost certainly be no better. There may be numbers on the Tory benches, but there isn\u2019t much talent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Very few MPs were taking any chances with the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Which is why the Commons chamber was almost entirely empty for the ministerial statement about it. Some clearly appear to believe the risk of contagion is so high that even talking about it can spread the disease. Fortunately the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is more selfless than many. And more fearless. One of the more charming things about Matt \u2013 other than his gullibility: he consistently remains the only person in the entire country who believes Boris Johnson will actually build 40 new hospitals \u2013 is his tireless dedication to the cause. Tigger doesn\u2019t just wear his NHS badge on the lapel of his suit; he has it attached to his pyjamas in bed at night. As does his Pooh bear teddy. Matt is so hands-on and lives and breathes the NHS so much that he now rather considers himself to be the nation\u2019s doctor-in-chief, rather than a politician with no clinical experience. So for his Commons statement, he tried to adopt the serious yet deeply reassuring bedside tone of a disaster movie superhero who was preventing widespread panic before going back into the contaminated danger zone to singlehandedly save the planet. Unfortunately, it turned out that Tigger didn\u2019t actually have anything worthwhile to divulge. All he had was the same information that was readily available to anyone following the news. The coronavirus was primarily confined to Wuhan city in China, which was now in lockdown. There had been 511 cases confirmed with 17 fatalities, though it was possible these figures could rise. No shit. Isolated cases had been reported in the US and Japan, but none confirmed in the UK so far. But he was ready if there were as the UK was upgrading its risk level from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d. He said it in a way that made \u201clow\u201d sound like a red alert. Either no one had bothered to tell him there were four suspected cases in Scotland or he just didn\u2019t want to worry anyone. \u201cMost people do recover,\u201d he added, trying not to sound too disappointed. It\u2019s hard to be appreciated as a proper saviour unless there\u2019s some jeopardy. After advising a few MPs, who were concerned about the wellbeing of their Chinese constituents, that the best way to avoid the coronavirus was not to travel to Wuhan or have anything to do with someone who had just returned from there, Matt then donned his white coat to give one-to-one consultations. He told the shadow health secretary, Sharon Hodgson, that there was no need for her or anyone else to worry if they were suffering from a cough as the disease typically took 10 to 14 days to gestate. Something I found particularly reassuring, as I had been up half the night hacking my guts out and had been prone to the odd hypochondriacal thought. Nice to know Matt\u2019s got my back. There was also no need at present \u2013 at present \u2013 for anyone to wear face masks or hazmat suits, but if anyone was at all concerned, they were to ring the NHS 111 helpline and Dr Matt would personally be on standby to take any calls throughout the weekend. For once, though, his surgery was almost empty, so the entire consultation session was over in a record 15 minutes. Most ministerial statements last a minimum of 45 minutes. But if Matt was disappointed at the lack of referrals, he was too professional to show it. He had done his bit to keep the country safe and that\u2019s what counted. If only he could show the same diligence in other areas of his job, then people might not be dying unnecessarily owing to hospitals missing their A&amp;E and cancer targets. There had been a rather fuller house for international trade departmental questions earlier in the day. Then there had been no risk of imminent death and many MPs had come along out of curiosity as they suspected the session might be something of a collector\u2019s item. With the withdrawal agreement having passed both houses \u2013 sorry, child refugees, you\u2019ll just have to take your chances \u2013 Brexit is now a done deal, which means that we\u2019re about to get down to the much trickier, hard graft of negotiating new trade deals. And as even Boris Johnson can see that the last person you would want in charge of this is someone as catastrophically dim as Liz Truss, it\u2019s likely her days are numbered with a reshuffle imminent. Still, you have to give Truss credit. If this was to be her last outing at the dispatch box, then she was going to go out in the style on which her reputation had been built: confusion and incompetence. She opened by heralding a new dawn of UK-US trade. She had no idea how any such deal could be agreed without first having established what levels of alignment the UK would be keeping with the EU, but she was certain that the new agreement would mean no tariffs on car exports to the US. She then added in the same breath that the UK should be free to impose a digital service tax if it wanted to, even though the US had insisted it would impose tariffs on cars if we did. Go figure. I\u2019ll miss Truss when she\u2019s gone, even if few others will. She\u2019s been very good to me. But then I said much the same when Liam Fox was sacked from the same job. My one consolation is that her successor will almost certainly be no better. There may be numbers on the Tory benches, but there isn\u2019t much talent.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Authorities were alerted to her post after it was criticised by social media users, and the Chinese embassy in France put a message on its website on Wednesday evening urging citizens in China to comply with border checks. </p> \n<p>\u201cOur embassy has received multiple phone calls and emails from Chinese nationals regarding a woman from Wuhan who posted on social media about deliberately taking fever medication in order to evade the airport temperature checks,\u201d it said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The embassy said it had contacted the woman and asked her to refer herself to French emergency services.</p> \n<p>Although French authorities do not yet know when she arrived or what airport she travelled through, they said they were introducing measures to separate passengers arriving in the country with a fever and refer them to emergency health personnel.</p> \n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-spreads-in-china-with-three-cities-in-lockdown\">500 cases of the virus</a>, which is thought to be a new strain of coronavirus, have been confirmed, and 17 people have died.

He told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Something quite momentous has taken place with this royal assent. This is absolutely unprecedented and I say to the house that this is a constitutional crisis.</p> <p>We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented, when the government in Edinburgh, in Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. And this completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament to become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations.</p> <p>I full respect that those that voted for the Conservative party in England have got what they wanted. But the fact remains that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that, if we stayed in the UK, our rights as EU citizens would be respected. And moreover we were told that we were to lead the United Kingdom, that this was a family of nations, our rights would be respected. And we find today that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored, and against the express wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum, and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blackford was referring to the fact that, under <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/sewel-convention?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo4iyloKa5wIVx7HtCh2_XQHZEAAYASAAEgLlGfD_BwE\">the so-called Sewel convention</a>, the UK government is not supposed to legislate on matters covered by the devolved administrations without the devolved legislatures granting legislative consent. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act does contain provisions affecting devolved matters. Yet the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-51181641\">all recently voted to refuse it legislative consent.</a></p> <p>In the article 50 case the supreme court ruled that the Sewel convention was a political convention, and not one that could be enforced by law. The wording includes an opt-out - it says Westminster will \u201cnot <em>normally</em> legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent\u201d of the devolved legislatures - and there is precedent for Westminster passing legislation after one of the devolved administrations refused consent. The votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff cannot stop Brexit.</p> <p>But there is no precedent for a major piece of legislation being passed after all three devolved legislatures refused to grant it legislative consent.</p> <p>Blackford\u2019s reference to a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d may sound a touch hyperbolic. If there is a crisis, most MPs in London this afternoon don\u2019t seem to have noticed. But a crisis does not always have to be immediate, and Blackford is right to say that Brexit has unleashed forces that could have a profound impact on the union.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b0354dc852e0ff228256602a733c7b109a85a00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b0354dc852e0ff228256602a733c7b109a85a00/22_0_603_362/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Blackford.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Blackford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliament TV</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29b8008f0879d539efdaf4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T15:13:12.236Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the Brexit department</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DExEUgov/status/1220362856702599179\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Brexit Bill has been given Royal Assent.<br><br>Watch the moment Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans announced it in the Commons \u2b07\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/K9UQZIW8f1\">pic.twitter.com/K9UQZIW8f1</a></p>&mdash; Department for Exiting the EU (@DExEUgov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DExEUgov/status/1220362856702599179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29afaa8f0879d539efda94\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T14:57:34.168Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bercow says he should get peerage and criticises No 10 for not giving him one</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Bercow,</strong> the former Commons Speaker, has issued a fresh statement in response to the report that Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a formal complaint about him alleging bullying.

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have seen in the media that Lord Lisvane is formally complaining that I bullied staff.

Even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues, he did not once complain to me and neither did any other official on his behalf.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the statement Bercow argues that he is entitled to a peerage, because it is conventional for retiring Speakers to go to the Lords, and he criticises No 10 for not giving him one. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Since retiring it has] become increasingly obvious that the government has no intention of honouring the centuries-old convention that a departing speaker is promptly elevated to the House of Lords.

At this lunchtime\u2019s FMQs (first minister\u2019s questions), interim Tory leader <strong>Jackson Carlaw </strong>- who launched his leadership campaign last week with proposals to reverse SNP tax rises for high earners - raised a pretty shocking story that was highlighted by the Courier this morning: the roof of a police station in Broughty Ferry collapsing just hours after the justice secretary dismissed concerns about the crumbling police estate as \u201chyperbole\u201d.</p> <p>Carlaw condemned \u201cyears of missed opportunities from a distracted government\u201d, noting that the FM would be returning to \u201cher favourite topic\u201d next week when she has promised to update parliament on her next steps after Boris Johnson ruled out granting her the legal powers to hold a second independence referendum. </p> <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the first minister, shot back that it was Carlaw himself who was planning to strip public services, quoting an analysis of his tax proposals which she said proved they would \u201ctake \u00a3270m out of public services and give it back to the richest\u201d. With the Scottish draft budget due on February 6, we can expect plenty more of this. <br><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23b9e93486a64112270a94988a517fd2c0c0540a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23b9e93486a64112270a94988a517fd2c0c0540a/0_16_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson Carlaw during FMQs at the Scottish parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson Carlaw during FMQs at the Scottish parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29a1578f0879d539efda06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T13:37:46.438Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Emily Thornberry </strong>has also tweeted a message of support to her fellow Labour leadership candidate Keir Starmer.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the US view, widely supported by intelligence assessments, Huawei\u2019s accountability to political masters is so great that any network that the company builds is going to be in effect a portal for the Chinese government to spy on the activities of anyone using it. So the US has banned Huawei from doing business in the US and blocked American companies from working with it. But the larger struggle is unfolding over Huawei\u2019s business with other countries, in particular US allies.</p> <p>A senior American official told me that one of the Trump administration\u2019s main priorities for 2020 is to persuade countries around the world not to use Huawei in building their 5G networks. Critics say this is, in essence, a form of barely disguised protectionism, that the Huawei threat is overstated and that the US is simply trying to impede the commercial success of a rival Chinese company.</p> <p>To counter that criticism, officials told me, their ideal outcome would be a US-European joint venture that could produce networks just as well as Huawei. But for now that alternative does not exist.</p> <p>Britain, of course, is in America\u2019s sights, with Boris Johnson\u2019s government set to approve a contract with the Chinese company any day now. Last week there was an explosive meeting in London between senior American and British officials. A top US official said that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, \u201cerupted\u201d at a senior policymaker from the White House during a heated exchange over Huawei, as No 10 stood firm in defending its pending decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Baker says the key question is whether Washington would use talks on a UK-US trade deal to try to influence Britain\u2019s policy on Huawei. He quotes an adviser to President Trump as saying that the US is not planning to link the two issues \u201cat this point\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29859e8f08e97ed2128c45\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T11:38:52.909Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A Welsh Conservative candidate accused of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been deselected by his party, PA Media reports.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has become law after it received royal assent from the Queen, having cleared all its stages in parliament. Shortly after this was announced Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told MPs that the country was facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d because the legislation had been passed despite devolved legislatures in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all voting to withhold consent for it. (See 3.37pm.) The government has hinted strongly that it will allow the Chinese firm Huawei some role in the UK\u2019s 5G mobile network, despite warnings from the US that doing so could compromise security. Sajid Javid has sought to reassure business that there will be no wholesale dumping of EU regulations as he pledged there would be no divergence after Brexit for the sake of it. John Bercow has accused Downing Street of trying to scupper his chances of being made a peer, and dismissed accusations of bullying made by his former most senior official. Richard Ratcliffe emerged from a 40-minute meeting with Boris Johnson in Downing Street admitting there had been no breakthrough in his efforts to persuade the government to do more to secure the release of his wife from a Tehran jail. The police watchdog is facing accusations that it is dragging its feet on a decision about whether to investigate Boris Johnson for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was London mayor. The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has implicitly criticised No 10\u2019s decision not to allow ministers to appear on the Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Downing Street has been refusing to put up ministers for interview on the programme in recent weeks, despite the fact that it is seen as one of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs programmes. No 10 has not given an official explanation for the boycott, but, as my Guardian colleague Rowena Mason reported this week, the tactic is one that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief policy adviser, first proposed around 15 years ago, when he was developing a strategy to sabotage the BBC, which he described as the \u201cmortal enemy\u201d of the Conservative party. Morgan was speaking in an interview for the Political Thinking podcast, hosted by Nick Robinson, a Today presenter. Asked if she was comfortable with the ban on ministers appearing on Today, she replied: My personal view is I think it\u2019s good to engage with all programmes on all channels. When Robinson told Morgan she would be welcome to appear on the programme if Cummings allowed that, she just laughed. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexiter leader of the Commons. But other Gibbon quotes are available. The great historian also said: History ... is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind. The European parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee has voted to recommend that MEPs should vote for the withdrawal agreement when they debate it on Wednesday afternoon next week. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has told Sky News that he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a trade deal in 2020 are just 50/50. In a short interview in Davos, when asked if he was confident about there being a deal this year, he replied: 50/50. Because a year is not very long, and if the UK is really not willing to ask for an extension, then we run a risk that we might get to a cliff edge again. By \u201ccliff edge\u201d, he means what would effectively be a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 (although a 2020 no deal would be different from a 2019 no deal, because the withdrawal agreement would be passed, which means the rights of EU nationals would be guaranteed, and the arrangement for Northern Ireland to remain effectively in the single market would be in place). This is from Sky\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway. Boris Johnson insists he is almost certain to get a trade deal, but the EU is more open about the risk of what it calls a \u201ccliff edge\u201d at the end of this year. It has recently published a whole series of briefing slides about the forthcoming trade talks, and this is from one set of slides (pdf) covering trade. Here is some niche research from a reader which might interest people following the Labour leadership contest. Shortly after the granting of royal assent to the Brexit bill was announced, the SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, used a point of order to say that the country was now facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d. He told MPs: Something quite momentous has taken place with this royal assent. This is absolutely unprecedented and I say to the house that this is a constitutional crisis. We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented, when the government in Edinburgh, in Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. And this completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament to become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations. I full respect that those that voted for the Conservative party in England have got what they wanted. But the fact remains that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that, if we stayed in the UK, our rights as EU citizens would be respected. And moreover we were told that we were to lead the United Kingdom, that this was a family of nations, our rights would be respected. And we find today that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored, and against the express wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum, and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored. Blackford was referring to the fact that, under the so-called Sewel convention, the UK government is not supposed to legislate on matters covered by the devolved administrations without the devolved legislatures granting legislative consent. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act does contain provisions affecting devolved matters. Yet the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly have all recently voted to refuse it legislative consent. In the article 50 case the supreme court ruled that the Sewel convention was a political convention, and not one that could be enforced by law. The wording includes an opt-out - it says Westminster will \u201cnot normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent\u201d of the devolved legislatures - and there is precedent for Westminster passing legislation after one of the devolved administrations refused consent. The votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff cannot stop Brexit. But there is no precedent for a major piece of legislation being passed after all three devolved legislatures refused to grant it legislative consent. Blackford\u2019s reference to a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d may sound a touch hyperbolic. If there is a crisis, most MPs in London this afternoon don\u2019t seem to have noticed. But a crisis does not always have to be immediate, and Blackford is right to say that Brexit has unleashed forces that could have a profound impact on the union. From the Brexit department John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has issued a fresh statement in response to the report that Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a formal complaint about him alleging bullying. (See 9.39am.) In it he categorically denies ever bullying anyone. He says: I have seen in the media that Lord Lisvane is formally complaining that I bullied staff. For the record, I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time. According to the Press Association, in the statement Bercow says Lisvane had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to raise concerns about Bercow\u2019s conduct with him and that Lisvane had \u201ca duty of care to all House staff\u201d. Therefore, he had not merely a right but a responsibility to act if he thought that he witnessed misconduct. The simple fact is that he did not at any time do so. Even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues, he did not once complain to me and neither did any other official on his behalf. In the statement Bercow argues that he is entitled to a peerage, because it is conventional for retiring Speakers to go to the Lords, and he criticises No 10 for not giving him one. He says: [Since retiring it has] become increasingly obvious that the government has no intention of honouring the centuries-old convention that a departing speaker is promptly elevated to the House of Lords. Indeed, it has been suggested to me that the government actively seeks to block any other attempt to nominate me for membership of the upper House. The Brexit bill has received royal assent. It is now an act of parliament, the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons (and arch-Brexiter), announced it on Twitter. And here are the latest nomination tallies for the Labour leadership posted by @CLPNominations. This tables, showing nominations by affiliates, is not up to date, because it does not include Chinese for Labour nominating Lisa Nandy. That means that she and Sir Keir Starmer are both now guaranteed a place on the final ballot. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has released a video message backing his fellow leftwinger Richard Burgon for the Labour deputy leadership. McDonnell is also urging constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to nominate Burgon. There are five candidates still in the contest for deputy leader but, as in the contest for the leadership, candidates will only make it onto the final ballot if they can get nominations from either 33 CLPs (5% of the total), or three affiliates (unions or socialist societies), comprising at least 5% of the affiliates vote. At the moment Burgon is struggling, but if he were to get nominated by Unite or CWU (the two big unions yet to decide), he would be close to guaranteeing his place on the ballot. Here are recent nomination tallies for the deputy leadership from @CLPNominations, a reliable guide. Angela Rayner is the only candidate so far guaranteed a place on the final ballot. The likely battle lines between SNP and Scotish Tories in advance of next year\u2019s Holyrood election are becoming clearer every week. At this lunchtime\u2019s FMQs (first minister\u2019s questions), interim Tory leader Jackson Carlaw - who launched his leadership campaign last week with proposals to reverse SNP tax rises for high earners - raised a pretty shocking story that was highlighted by the Courier this morning: the roof of a police station in Broughty Ferry collapsing just hours after the justice secretary dismissed concerns about the crumbling police estate as \u201chyperbole\u201d. Carlaw condemned \u201cyears of missed opportunities from a distracted government\u201d, noting that the FM would be returning to \u201cher favourite topic\u201d next week when she has promised to update parliament on her next steps after Boris Johnson ruled out granting her the legal powers to hold a second independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, shot back that it was Carlaw himself who was planning to strip public services, quoting an analysis of his tax proposals which she said proved they would \u201ctake \u00a3270m out of public services and give it back to the richest\u201d. With the Scottish draft budget due on February 6, we can expect plenty more of this. Emily Thornberry has also tweeted a message of support to her fellow Labour leadership candidate Keir Starmer. (See 1.19pm.) Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister, came up with a particularly unflattering description of himself in his maiden speech in the House of Lords a few minutes ago, Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti reports. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has been forced to cancel campaign events as his mother-in-law is critically ill in hospital. A spokesman for Starmer said: Following an accident, Keir Starmer\u2019s mother-in-law is critically ill and has been admitted to hospital in intensive care. In order to support his family at this difficult time, Keir will be cancelling all campaign events today and tomorrow. We ask that his family\u2019s privacy is respected at this time. In response, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Starmer\u2019s main rival in the contest, posted this on Twitter. The police watchdog is facing accusations that it is dragging its feet on a decision about whether to investigate Boris Johnson for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was London mayor, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is speaking at a CBI lunch in Davos. He has just sought to reassure business that the UK won\u2019t abandon all EU regulations after Brexit, saying: We won\u2019t diverge just for the sake of it. There is full coverage of the speech on my colleague Graeme Wearden\u2019s Davos live blog. From Bloomberg\u2019s Ian Wishart Ratcliffe says the recent weeks, since the killing of Qassem Suleimani, have been terrifying. Q: Did Johnson apologise for his own comments about Nazanin (about her being in Iran to teach journalism - a false statement that was used by Iran to justify her ongoing detention.) Ratcliffe says they did not talk about the past. But he says he was satisfied that Johnson was committed to getting this case resolved. He says he presented Johnson with a wallet made by Nazanin in prison. He says Johnson offered five-year-old Gabriella apple juice. And she was given a toy cat. During the meeting, she did some colouring, he says. Richard Ratcliffe is speaking to journalists now after his meeting with Boris Johnson. He says he did not come away thinking that his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, will be released very soon. He says he still thinks the government should be tougher on Iran. But it was a gracious visit, he says. Q: How could the government be tougher? He says in his opinion Nazanin is being held hostage by Iran. He says he spoke to Johnson about Magnitsky-style sanctions on Iran. He says after the UK leaves the EU it would be easier to impose those. He says hostage taking should not be allowed. That should be a universal value that should be upheld. He says it is important for their to be progress in the court case. (See 11.12am.) But he was told the government was doing all it could, he says. Richard Ratcliffe has arrived at Downing Street for his talks with Boris Johnson about his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is detained in Iran. (See 11.12am.) He has brought their daughter, Gabriella, and his own mother Barbara (to help look after Gabriella if she gets distracted during the meeting, he explained on the Today programme this morning). Turning back to Huawei, Gerard Baker has an interesting column on this topic here in the Times (paywall) today. Here\u2019s an extract. In the US view, widely supported by intelligence assessments, Huawei\u2019s accountability to political masters is so great that any network that the company builds is going to be in effect a portal for the Chinese government to spy on the activities of anyone using it. So the US has banned Huawei from doing business in the US and blocked American companies from working with it. But the larger struggle is unfolding over Huawei\u2019s business with other countries, in particular US allies. A senior American official told me that one of the Trump administration\u2019s main priorities for 2020 is to persuade countries around the world not to use Huawei in building their 5G networks. Critics say this is, in essence, a form of barely disguised protectionism, that the Huawei threat is overstated and that the US is simply trying to impede the commercial success of a rival Chinese company. To counter that criticism, officials told me, their ideal outcome would be a US-European joint venture that could produce networks just as well as Huawei. But for now that alternative does not exist. Britain, of course, is in America\u2019s sights, with Boris Johnson\u2019s government set to approve a contract with the Chinese company any day now. Last week there was an explosive meeting in London between senior American and British officials. A top US official said that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, \u201cerupted\u201d at a senior policymaker from the White House during a heated exchange over Huawei, as No 10 stood firm in defending its pending decision. Baker says the key question is whether Washington would use talks on a UK-US trade deal to try to influence Britain\u2019s policy on Huawei. He quotes an adviser to President Trump as saying that the US is not planning to link the two issues \u201cat this point\u201d. A Welsh Conservative candidate accused of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been deselected by his party, PA Media reports. Ross England was giving evidence as a witness in the trial of a male friend when it was halted after he referred to the female victim\u2019s previous sexual history against the directions of the judge. Today the Conservative party said England\u2019s nomination to contest the Vale of Glamorgan seat in the 2021 Welsh assembly election had been withdrawn. The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, fresh figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high, my colleague Jamie Grierson reports. Sharon Hodgson, the shadow health secretary, is responding to Matt Hancock\u2019s statement. She has some questions. Will flights from other Chinese cities be monitored? What advice is being given to other people flying to China? Are contingency plans in place in case the disease does reach the UK? Hancock is replying now. He says it is important to get enhanced monitoring right. He says symptoms from coronavirus take five to seven days to appear, and can take up to 14 days. So monitoring people on aircraft is of limited value, he suggests. But he says there will be no further flights out of Wuhan anyway. In the Commons Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a statement about the coronavirus outbreak. He says there have been 571 cases, and 17 reported fatalities. Most cases of this new virus have been non-fatal, he says. But some cases have been fatal. There are no cases of this new infection in the UK so far, he says. He says the government is closely monitoring the situation. Since yesterday health officials have been monitoring people on flights from Wuhan. And people on flights from China are receiving information about this, he says. He says the chief medical officer has changed the risk level to the UK from very low to low. But the UK is prepared to deal with any outbreak, he says. He says travel advice has been updated, and the government is now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan. In her Sky News interview this morning Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, hinted that the government is minded to allow the Chinese firm Huawei to play a role in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G network. The US government has been strongly urging London not to use Huawei, claiming that it poses a security risk and threatening to limit intelligence cooperation if Huawei does get the go-ahead. Leadsom said the government would take a decision on this soon. But, as Reuters reports, she highlighted difficulties with not using Huawei. She said: There are other providers but they are limited. Ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon. It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing. But she also said she shared concerns about protecting national security. Speaking ahead of his meeting with Boris Johnson later, Richard Ratcliffe said that he hoped the PM would \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for the detention of his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran. Ratcliffe told the Today programme: [Johnson] needs to take responsibility for Nazanin\u2019s case, for upholding the promise he made to us to leave no stone unturned. Ratcliffe also urged Johnson to be \u201cbrave\u201d in resolving a long-running trade dispute with Iran over the settlement of a \u00a3400m debt. He said: Nazanin was told way back in 2016 she was being held over it. It has long been in the shadows of our case. [Johnson\u2019s] obligation is to protect British citizens. He needs to be brave in doing positive gestures in relation to the debt and other issues that will calm relations down, but also being brave in calling out Iran on hostage-taking. It is not an acceptable way to conduct diplomacy. My colleague Patrick Wintour has more on this in his overnight story previewing the meeting. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has launched a hunt for someone to replace longstanding Office for Budget Responsibility chairman Robert Chote when his term at the fiscal watchdog comes to an end in October. As PA Media reports, Chote has headed up the independent economic forecaster since it was launched in 2010, having served the maximum two five-year terms. The chancellor said Chote had led the OBR with \u201cintelligence, independence and integrity\u201d. In a statement Javid said: Finding the right candidate to lead the OBR and build on the significant progress of the last 10 years is vital for maintaining the credibility of the UK\u2019s fiscal framework and our status as a world leader in fiscal transparency. I look forward to working with Robert Chote to deliver my budget on March 11 before he finishes his second term as chair. The Treasury said the recruitment process would look at the \u201cbroadest possible pool of applicants\u201d and is open to applications until 20 February. Michel Barner\u2019s senior adviser Stefaan De Rynck has warned that the EU will not tolerate any \u201cbacksliding\u201d on the commitment to introduce checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea as part of the controversial Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. At an event at University College London last night, De Rynck was clear that checks were part of the Northern Ireland protocol and warned that if the deal was not complied with there could be sanctions. We will not tolerate any backsliding or half measures on this. It is clear what needs to be done by both sides. His remarks put him at odds with Boris Johnson, who on Wednesday gave yet another assurance to the DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, that there would be no checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to GB or from GB to Northern Ireland under the deal. De Rynck refused to comment on what Johnson said, but confirmed checks were part of the special NI arrangements. He said the protocol was \u201cvery clear\u201d that the UK authorities would have to implement the checks and ensure that products going from GB to NI complied with the EU\u2019s single market standards for food and agrifood. He said: There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented. He warned that the next stage of negotiations would be tough and that there could be no sector by sector cherry-picking. And he said it needed to be better understood in British media that a zero-tariff and zero-quota offer to the single market was a big offer to the UK. That is a pretty generous offer for the EU to consider. Because this is a market of 450m people at the doorstep of the UK. In terms of some of the stories I read this morning in the media, I think we need to stress that this is not something that any other country has, across the board zero tariffs, zero quota access to the market. Touching on recent comments by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, that the UK would not be seeking alignment with the EU on trade rules, De Rynck warned there were \u201cconsequences\u201d for that. Asked if the EU would agree to a \u201csalami slice\u201d deal involving a \u201cbare bones\u201d pact on trade by the end of the year with other issues to follow in the months and years beyond, De Rynck quipped: I prefer \u2026 this kind of pasta where everything is integrated as a main course. An over-arching institutional framework with linked chapters and agreements is certainly part of the political declaration and certainly one the UK has also agreed to. We will want now to see how that pans out in practice. This is from my colleague John Crace on Liz Truss\u2019s comments about trade and the US. Here is the full reply from Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, when she was asked in the Commons a few minutes ago by the Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds if the government would back down in the face of American pressure over its plans for a digital services tax. (See 9.55am.) She told him: Let me be absolutely clear. UK tax policy is a matter for the UK chancellor. It\u2019s not a matter for the US, it\u2019s not a matter for the EU, it\u2019s not a matter for anybody else, and we will make the decisions that are right for Britain, whether it is on our regulatory standards, whether it\u2019s on our tax policy, or whether it is on anything else. In the Commons Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is taking questions. She has just suggested that the government will not back down over its plans for a digital services tax despite opposition from Washington, which is worried about the impact on US tech giants. This is from Politico\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. Truss\u2019s comments reflect what Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said at Davos yesterday, although her tone was more confrontational than his. She was effectively telling the US not to interfere. Yesterday the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the US might respond with retaliatory tariffs if the UK went ahead with the digital sales tax. The shadow Treasury minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said he found her comment interesting. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, was giving interviews this morning to promote the announcement that the government is ensuring that parents who suffer the loss of a child under the age of 18 will be entitled to two weeks of statutory paid leave from work. Our story on the announcement is here. According to the Times (paywall), Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a complaint to the parliamentary commissioner standards about alleged bullying by John Bercow when he was Speaker. Other officials have complained about Bercow\u2019s treatment of staff in the past, but Lisvane is the most senior official to have submitted a formal complaint, the paper says. In a statement to the Times Bercow, who has repeatedly denied claims that he bullied officials, said: During the five years that we worked together, Lord Lisvane had ample opportunity to raise any accusations of bullying with me. At no stage did he do so, even though he became clerk of the House - the most senior official. The timing of this intervention is curious. The last sentence is a reference to reports that Bercow is being nominated for a peerage. It is normal for a former Speaker to be offered a peerage, but there have been reports that Bercow\u2019s nomination for one comes from Jeremy Corbyn, in the dissolution honours list, because Boris Johnson is reluctant to make the nomination himself. In an interview on Sky News this morning the business secretary Andrea Leadsom, who had an acrimonious relationship with Bercow herself when she was leader of the Commons (she says he once called her a \u201cstupid woman\u201d in the chamber), suggested that a bullying complaint could stop Bercow getting a peerage. She said: In the event that there are genuine, upheld complaints about any persons that should have an impact on whether they are found suitable for the House of Lords. In Davos Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, has said Washington expects to conclude a trade deal with the UK by the end of this year, Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, reports. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his Davos live blog. He will be covering Sajid Javid, the chancellor, who will be giving a speech at the conference at lunchtime. There will be an oral statement in the Commons after 10.30am from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on the coronavirus crisis. Yesterday the government\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, the legislation that will take the UK out of the EU next week, cleared parliament. This was a foregone conclusion ever since Boris Johnson won the general election with a near-landslide majority and, in a curious paradox, the Brexit deal that paralysed parliament for more than two years, and brought down a PM, barely made the news as it finally got over its last parliamentary hurdle. In response, Johnson put out this statement: Parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill, meaning we will leave the EU on 31 January and move forwards as one United Kingdom. At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we\u2019ve done it. Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future \u2013 with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country. But \u2018crossing the finishing line\u2019 may be a tad optimistic, given that the government still has not resolved what its final trade relationship with the EU will look like, and last night a senior EU official used a speech in London to make this very point. Stefaan De Rynck, the senior adviser to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said what came next would be \u201cmore complicated\u201d and that a \u201cdose of realism\u201d was needed. As Jack Blanchard reports in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, De Rynck said: There should be no misunderstanding of the fact that the next phase will be more complicated to negotiate than the withdrawal agreement. The construction of the text for the withdrawal agreement wasn\u2019t always easy \u2014 but compared to the construction of the text for the future relationship agreement, we are talking about two different kinds of exercises. The limitation of time must lead to some dose of realism on what can be achieved. I will be filing more on De Rynck\u2019s speech shortly. We will hear more on Brexit in the Commons later, because Liz Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg are both taking questions. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions in the Commons on next week\u2019s business. Lunchtime: Boris Johnson meets Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, in Downing Street. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Amid growing concern over the spread of the virus, China has put Wuhan and four other cities with a combined population of more than 20 million on lockdown. It has banned travel during the biggest mass annual human migration on the planet for the lunar new year this weekend, when up to 400 million Chinese are expected to travel across the country to celebrate with friends and family. With outbound trains, buses and flights halted, fears are rising that the virus could also dent growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy, in a rerun of the Sars outbreak of 2003.

Almost two decades after becoming a member of the World Trade Organization, China is now far more important to the economic prospects of companies and countries worldwide. As fears of a \u201cblack swan\u201d event rise at a fragile time for the world economy, there was a sharp sell-off on Thursday, with markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen down 2-3.5%.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock told the Commons that the UK was one of a few countries to have developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case could be diagnosed quickly.

With concern growing about the spread of the virus, universities in the UK are keeping a check on staff who have recently returned from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, as well as Chinese students who come from affected areas, many of whom will be concerned about loved ones at home. China has become an increasingly important partner in UK higher education in recent years, with 120,000 Chinese students enrolled in UK universities last year and numerous partnerships and collaborations between universities in the UK and China. Nine UK institutions have partnerships with Wuhan University in Hubei Province in central China, among them Dundee University which runs an architecture course in collaboration with Wuhan. In an email to students, the university urged anyone who had travelled to affected areas and was suffering symptoms to contact their GP by phone, avoid crowded places and alert the people they live with. Dr Jim McGeorge, university secretary and chief operating officer at Dundee, also warned students to take care if receiving packages from areas where the virus is present, especially if a package contains food items.

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organization has called on the global community to work together to fight the new coronavirus that is causing an epidemic of viral pneumonia and deaths in China, but stopped short of declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. After the second day of meetings of the emergency committee, WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday that nobody should assume there was no risk that it would become a dangerous global epidemic. \u201cMake no mistake, this is an emergency in China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.\u201d There have been 584 cases and 17 deaths reported to the WHO so far, Tedros said, although reports from China confirmed an 18th death on Thursday in Hebei province \u2013 the first outside Hubei province, where the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan. Chinese state television put the number of confirmed cases at 634 by Thursday evening. All the deaths and 575 cases were inside China, which is where all human-to-human transmission of the virus had so far occurred, said Tedros. \u201cThere is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 24 January.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>The scandal-ridden $100m community sport infrastructure program is facing further scrutiny,</strong> after a rugby union club in a marginal Coalition-held seat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/sports-grants-rugby-club-gets-funding-for-female-change-rooms-but-has-no-womens-team\">received $500,000 for new female change rooms, despite not fielding a women\u2019s team since 2018</a>. Concerned former members of the club have expressed anger at the lucrative grant despite an alleged culture of mistreatment and misogyny that prompted the entire female team to quit. Then sports minister Bridget McKenzie faces an internal investigation, with the prime minister vowing on Thursday to take \u201cwhatever action was necessary\u201d once his department had assessed the concerns.</p> \n<p><strong>The Chinese government has cancelled several major public events and put five cities on lockdown,</strong> in an attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-spreads-in-china-with-three-cities-in-lockdown\">to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus</a>. Transport links from Wuhan were cancelled, with movie theatres and other entertainment venues forced to shut down, with similar restrictions in place for nearby Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang. The World Health Organisation has said it\u2019s too early to declare an emergency, with isolated cases reported in neighbouring Asian nations as well as in the US and Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 24 January. Top stories The scandal-ridden $100m community sport infrastructure program is facing further scrutiny, after a rugby union club in a marginal Coalition-held seat received $500,000 for new female change rooms, despite not fielding a women\u2019s team since 2018. Concerned former members of the club have expressed anger at the lucrative grant despite an alleged culture of mistreatment and misogyny that prompted the entire female team to quit. Then sports minister Bridget McKenzie faces an internal investigation, with the prime minister vowing on Thursday to take \u201cwhatever action was necessary\u201d once his department had assessed the concerns. The Chinese government has cancelled several major public events and put five cities on lockdown, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Transport links from Wuhan were cancelled, with movie theatres and other entertainment venues forced to shut down, with similar restrictions in place for nearby Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang. The World Health Organisation has said it\u2019s too early to declare an emergency, with isolated cases reported in neighbouring Asian nations as well as in the US and Northern Ireland. There have been 17 reported fatalities so far in China, from 575 documented cases. The Australian Red Cross has been criticised for spending up to 10% of bushfire donations on administration, costs it has claimed are \u201cessential\u201d, despite previously committing 100% of monies raised towards causes. Liberal MP for Bega, Andrew Constance, had questioned delays in distributing $115m in donations the organisation has received since July. The Red Cross\u2019 director, Noel Clement, told Guardian Australia donations had been directed to a standing fund for all-year-round support, and that the NGO will strive to keep administrative costs as low as possible. Australia Revenue authorities in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and US have launched coordinated raids against a multinational financial institution, the first overt \u201cday of action\u201d by a joint tax-enforcement body set up in 2018 to fight tax crime and money laundering. Three US firefighters have been killed battling bushfires in southern New South Wales, after their waterbombing plane crashed on Thursday afternoon. There has been no indication, as yet, as to what caused the accident. Biosecurity officials in Sydney have met passengers from one of the last flights out of epidemic-hit Wuhan, clearing those on board of illness, but warning the possibility of \u201cpeople incubating the virus\u201d had to be considered in coming weeks. Prime minister Scott Morrison has paid tribute to his father, John, who died, aged 84. \u201cDad lived a life of love, faith, duty and service,\u201d said Morrison via a Facebook post, honouring his service as a police officer, loving husband and church elder.

The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, providing European parliament approves the deal. US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has belittled Greta Thunberg, dismissing the Swedish school student\u2019s call for immediate fossil fuel divestment, joking to journalists at Davos that he didn\u2019t know who she was and that she shouldn\u2019t be listened to until she\u2019s got a college decree in economics. The Church of England has declared that sex belongs only within heterosexual marriage, calling on Christians in gay or straight civil partnerships to remain sexually abstinent.
