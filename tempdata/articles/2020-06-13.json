Ecuador is one of nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Latin America. As major cities like Quito begin to reopen, authorities have insisted on the need to increases testing. But those efforts have been complicated by corruption scandals, delays in acquiring tests and now shortages of essential lab materials.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the tests and we can\u2019t use them,\u201d city councilman <strong>Bernardo Abad</strong> said. \u201cThey were purchased but the city didn\u2019t prepare.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Central University lab is one of two contracted directly by Quito officials to boost the city\u2019s testing capability. The other has not yet begun processing specimens. The Ministry of Public Health operates its own labs and conducted 16,379 tests in Quito from March to May. That testing is expected to continue, though to date has fallen short of what many believe is needed in the city of 2.7m people. Ecuador has done 133,458 molecular and rapid COVID-19 tests in all, according to the health ministry, and nation\u2019s per capita rate trails far behind countries like Chile and Peru that have greatly expanded testing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee40dae8f08e3e3b74b54de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T23:20:56.374Z\">12.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>White House infectious disease expert <strong>Anthony Fauc</strong><strong>i</strong> has said his advice to people who want to attend US president <strong>Donald Trump\u2019s</strong> campaign rallies is the same for Black Lives Matter and anti-Trump protestors.

Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, <strong>Prof Brendan Murphy,</strong> said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous\u201d. However the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July.<br><br>It follows protests last weekend, when people took to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\">437 known Aboriginal deaths </a>since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow. The protests were sparked in solidarity with the US following the brutal death of unarmed man <strong>George Floyd</strong> on 25 May. </p> <p>One man was diagnosed with the virus following the Melbourne protests, with health authorities saying he was likely infected prior to the rally. Victoria police issued fines of $1652 each to the three people who organised the protest. </p> <p>More protests took place in Sydney and Perth on Friday night. About 300 people who gathered in Sydney\u2019s city were outnumbered by about 600 police officers, in an event deemed unlawful because police were not formally notified. The peaceful protest was also brief, ending around 8pm.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/naamanzhou/status/1271379024606932992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Two stray observations from today\u2019s protest:<br><br>1) These guys were already there, protecting the Captain Cook statue - which nobody else ended up going near <br><br>2) Saw a few commercial TV reporters and crew who clearly have started hiring their own security <a href=\"https://t.co/vERlwByEBc\">https://t.co/vERlwByEBc</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bwNsXyzOaS\">pic.twitter.com/bwNsXyzOaS</a></p>&mdash; Naaman Zhou (@naamanzhou) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naamanzhou/status/1271379024606932992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Thousands of protesters will gather in Perth for Saturday\u2019s protest at Langley Park. Organisers have ignored Premier Mark McGowan\u2019s pleas to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Meanwhile, refugee activists will spread themselves out in Melbourne in an attempt to avoid the same fines issued to the organisers of last weekend\u2019s rally. The group said its rallies will have no more than 20 people in eight different locations to protest against the indefinite detention of asylum seekers. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/12/black-lives-matter-australia-protest-will-blm-protests-spark-second-covid-19-coronavirus-wave-health-experts\">Black Lives Matter: health experts assess risks of Covid-19 transmission at Australia protests</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T22:42:08.809Z\">at 11.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee3feea8f08e3e3b74b5473\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T22:22:59.867Z\">11.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Egypt records highest daily increase of Covid-19 cases in nearly two weeks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Egypt</strong> has confirmed 1,577 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily increase in almost two weeks.</p> <p>In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 41,303 cases including 1,422 deaths, the ministry said in a statement.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee3fbd48f08e3e3b74b5460\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T22:09:02.821Z\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Africa's virus cases increase by 10,000 in five days</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>South Africa\u2019s</strong> confirmed coronavirus infections have risen by more than 10,000 in five days to 61,927 on Friday, official figures showed.</p> <p>Positive cases stood at 50,879 on Monday, just a week after the continent\u2019s worst-hit country further eased lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>South Africa accounts for nearly 25 percent of the continent\u2019s total cases, according to the World Health Organization.</p> <p>The latest figures released by the health ministry showed that the virus has so far killed 1,354 people in the country since the first case was detected in March.</p> <p>Most of South Africa\u2019s infections - around two-thirds - are found in the Western Cape province, a popular tourist destination home to the coastal city of Cape Town.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T22:10:07.735Z\">at 11.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee3f9848f08cea6cb54a496\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T21:55:51.759Z\">10.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brazil's death toll surpasses UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brazil\u2019s </strong>death toll from the virus has overtaken the UK to become the second highest in the world.</p> <p>The figure stands at 41,828, the country\u2019s health ministry said, with only the US having more fatalities. <br> Brazil has registered 828,810 confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s death toll is 41,566, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T21:56:56.405Z\">at 10.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee3f7128f08cea6cb54a488\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T21:48:36.999Z\">10.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Scotland Yard has issued restrictions on Black Lives Matter and counterprotests protests planned for Saturday in <strong>England </strong>with all marching and assembly to end at 5pm.<br></p> <p>Police have warned demonstrators they would be in breach of the coronavirus act and set out conditions to keep the two sets of demos apart. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MetPoliceEvents/status/1271542044922707969\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Protests Sat 13 June | Conditions Imposed<br><br>We are asking you not to come to London, and let your voices be heard in other ways.<br><br>To ensure the safety of the public, participants and officers we have made the decision to impose conditions on the planned demonstrations tomorrow. <a href=\"https://t.co/7huZ9NpC46\">pic.twitter.com/7huZ9NpC46</a></p>&mdash;

<p><strong>Pakistan\u2019s</strong> <strong>ruling party has vowed to double healthcare spending</strong> as it unveiled a new budget which dramatically slashed other expenditure as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the economy. </p> <p>To a chorus of boos from the opposition, the government announced plans to cut the overall budget by 11% compared with last year, as revenues dried up and deficits soared in the impoverished nation. </p> <p>\u201cWe have prepared this budget keeping the coronavirus pandemic in mind,\u201d said <strong>Hammad Azhar</strong>, the minister of planning and industries, during a speech to the lower house of parliament. </p> <p>Pakistan\u2019s economy was already on life support before officials began shuttering large segments of the economy in March as an array of lockdown measures were rolled out in effort to fight the spread of the coronavirus. </p> <p>The country has since called for debt forgiveness from international donors and the IMF as tax revenues cratered, inflation soared, the currency was devalued, and fiscal deficits widened. </p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to say anything with certainty about the coronavirus\u2019s impact ... but there is no doubt that our GDP - which we thought could grow around 3% - will now go down by around 0.4%,\u201d Azhar told parliamentarians. </p> <p>Pakistan has struggled for decades to collect sufficient taxes, piling pressure on successive governments over the decades to provide ample funding for the country\u2019s ailing healthcare and education sectors. </p> <p>Estimates suggest that only around 1% of the 200 million population filed a return in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2ebb7d86d81c784fef911772487c11610cd1d8f\"> <img

Xue and her neighbour, a woman selling books, toothbrushes and trinkets from abroad, murmur and watch with expectation. Business might pick up a little now.</p> <p>Soon, more people begin to stop. Two young men, carrying a bag of cans of beer, browse the books. One picks up a translation of Pride and Prejudice before opting for a collection of stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The other buys a journal. Meng, 35, one of the food stall owners, calls to delivery drivers as they stop their electric bikes by the curb: \u201cHey big brother, what will it be?\u201d </p> <p>It is a scene that should belong to another time, when Beijing\u2019s sidewalks were often crowded with hawkers selling local street food and a surprisingly diverse selection of daily necessities \u2013 socks, flatware, DVDs, text books, lingerie and pets.

      "bodyText": "We are closing off this blog now, thanks for following our coverage. We have launched a new blog at the link below. Head here for the latest: A major laboratory in Ecuador\u2019s capital closed and halted processing coronavirus tests Friday because technicians did not have basic supplies like tubes, pipettes, masks and gloves needed to safely analyse the specimens. The Biotechnology Institute at Quitos Central University had been expected to receive and process tens of thousands of tests but its director said only 5,150 could be done before running out of equipment. \u201cWe can\u2019t process any more tests because of a technical failing,\u201d Lucy Balde\u00f3n said. Ecuador is one of nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Latin America. As major cities like Quito begin to reopen, authorities have insisted on the need to increases testing. But those efforts have been complicated by corruption scandals, delays in acquiring tests and now shortages of essential lab materials. \u201cWe have the tests and we can\u2019t use them,\u201d city councilman Bernardo Abad said. \u201cThey were purchased but the city didn\u2019t prepare.\u201d The Central University lab is one of two contracted directly by Quito officials to boost the city\u2019s testing capability. The other has not yet begun processing specimens. The Ministry of Public Health operates its own labs and conducted 16,379 tests in Quito from March to May. That testing is expected to continue, though to date has fallen short of what many believe is needed in the city of 2.7m people. Ecuador has done 133,458 molecular and rapid COVID-19 tests in all, according to the health ministry, and nation\u2019s per capita rate trails far behind countries like Chile and Peru that have greatly expanded testing. White House infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said his advice to people who want to attend US president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies is the same for Black Lives Matter and anti-Trump protestors. He said the gatherings are \u201ca danger\u201d and \u201crisky.\u201d Trump announced his campaign rallies are planned for 19 June, known as Juneteenth in the US, a holiday marking the end of slavery. Trump has insisted he did not choose the date on purpose. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m having a rally on that day - you can really think about that very positively as a celebration,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cBecause a rally to me is a celebration. It\u2019s an interesting date. It wasn\u2019t done for that reason, but it\u2019s an interesting date.\u201d Black Lives Matter advocates and refugee activists will hold protests throughout Australia on Saturday, despite warnings from health authorities they could lead to Covid-19 outbreaks. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous\u201d. However the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July. It follows protests last weekend, when people took to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been 437 known Aboriginal deaths since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow. The protests were sparked in solidarity with the US following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd on 25 May. One man was diagnosed with the virus following the Melbourne protests, with health authorities saying he was likely infected prior to the rally. Victoria police issued fines of $1652 each to the three people who organised the protest. More protests took place in Sydney and Perth on Friday night. About 300 people who gathered in Sydney\u2019s city were outnumbered by about 600 police officers, in an event deemed unlawful because police were not formally notified. The peaceful protest was also brief, ending around 8pm. Thousands of protesters will gather in Perth for Saturday\u2019s protest at Langley Park. Organisers have ignored Premier Mark McGowan\u2019s pleas to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Meanwhile, refugee activists will spread themselves out in Melbourne in an attempt to avoid the same fines issued to the organisers of last weekend\u2019s rally. The group said its rallies will have no more than 20 people in eight different locations to protest against the indefinite detention of asylum seekers. Egypt has confirmed 1,577 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily increase in almost two weeks. In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 41,303 cases including 1,422 deaths, the ministry said in a statement. South Africa\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections have risen by more than 10,000 in five days to 61,927 on Friday, official figures showed. Positive cases stood at 50,879 on Monday, just a week after the continent\u2019s worst-hit country further eased lockdown restrictions. South Africa accounts for nearly 25 percent of the continent\u2019s total cases, according to the World Health Organization. The latest figures released by the health ministry showed that the virus has so far killed 1,354 people in the country since the first case was detected in March. Most of South Africa\u2019s infections - around two-thirds - are found in the Western Cape province, a popular tourist destination home to the coastal city of Cape Town. Brazil\u2019s death toll from the virus has overtaken the UK to become the second highest in the world. The figure stands at 41,828, the country\u2019s health ministry said, with only the US having more fatalities. Brazil has registered 828,810 confirmed Covid-19 cases. The UK\u2019s death toll is 41,566, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Scotland Yard has issued restrictions on Black Lives Matter and counterprotests protests planned for Saturday in England with all marching and assembly to end at 5pm. Police have warned demonstrators they would be in breach of the coronavirus act and set out conditions to keep the two sets of demos apart. A newborn baby in the UK who was diagnosed with a heart defect has defied the odds after contracting coronavirus. Raees Hassain, from Rochdale in Greater Manchester, had a \u201cremote\u201d chance of survival after being rushed to hospital at six weeks old. After being diagnosed with a rare case of transposition of the great arteries, he tested positive for Covid-19. But five weeks after being rushed to hospital, Raees is back at home with his family after life-saving surgery. His mother Farah told the BBC: \u201cDoctors say there is no reason he can\u2019t do anything he wants to. \u201cHe can climb mountains, be a racer, whatever he wants. He has a life now.\u201d The front page of Saturday\u2019s UK edition of The Guardian. Requiring the wearing of masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus in areas at the epicenter of the global pandemic may have prevented tens of thousands of infections, a new study suggests. Mask-wearing is even more important for preventing the virus\u2019 spread than social distancing and stay-at-home orders, researchers said in the study published in PNAS: The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. Infection trends shifted dramatically when mask-wearing rules were implemented on April 6 in northern Italy and April 17 in New York City - at the time among the hardest hit areas of the world by the health crisis - the study found. \u201cThis protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9,\u201d researchers calculated. When mask wearing went into effect in New York, the daily new infection rate fell by about 3% per day, researchers said. In the rest of the country, daily new infections continued to increase. US stocks ended higher on Friday as bargain hunters stepped back into the market following sharp losses a day earlier - but all three major indexes suffered their biggest weekly percentage declines since March. The day\u2019s trading was marked by wild swings, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 3% at its high of the session and down about 0.6% at the low. The Federal Reserve\u2019s indication earlier this week of a long road to recovery and rising Covid-19 cases in the United States had cast a pall over investor optimism about a swift economic rebound, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped about 6% on Thursday. Slovenia will open its borders for citizens of Montenegro and Italy on Monday, the government said. It also said it will from Saturday introduce an obligatory 14-day quarantine for most people coming to Slovenia from 31 states where the epidemiologic situation has worsened over the past weeks, including Sweden, Britain, Russia, United States and Brazil. Slovenia, which introduced a lockdown in the middle of March, has started gradually lifting it since April 20. In May it became the first European state to call an end to its coronavirus epidemic. Since May it has already reopened its borders to citizens from 17 states, including neighbouring Croatia, Hungary and Austria. Slovenia has so far reported 1,490 coronavirus cases and 109 deaths. From Monday it will allow gatherings with up to 500 people compared with up to 200 at present. Mexico City has announced a plan for reopening that would begin next week by dropping driving restrictions and allowing manufacturing and neighborhood businesses to reopen if they meet health standards. Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said that street markets, malls, restaurants and churches could follow a week later but at reduced capacity. The plan follows Sheinbaums announcement earlier in the week of greatly expanded testing for Covid-19 in the capital. The city plans to make a stronger effort to identify infections and trace contacts as Sheinbaum, in conjunction with the surrounding State of Mexico, tries to safely reactivate a metropolitan area of some 20 million people. Mexico City hopes to process 100,000 tests per day by July, a dramatic increase over current testing levels, but still far short of some of the largest cities elsewhere in the world. The capital was never under a mandatory lockdown, but people were recommended to stay at home. In recent weeks, street traffic has increased steadily as the federal government began pushing a return to a new normal. The move comes as new infections in the country continue to surge. The government has reported 134,000 confirmed cases and about 16,000 deaths, both considered substantial undercounts due to very limited testing. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has been eager to reactivate the economy, which has shed nearly one million formal jobs and is forecast to contract 8.8% this year. \u201cWe don\u2019t think there are going to be new outbreaks\u201d, he said. \u201cWe have to be careful that this doesnt happen and open little by little with health measures, health protocols; and if we see a new outbreak somewhere, return to confinement, everything voluntarily.\u201d As President Trump prepares to resume his campaign rallies and George Floyd protests continue across the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d attendees of large gatherings to wear cloth face coverings in newly issued guidance. According to the guidance, \u201cCloth face coverings are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voice (e.g., shouting, chanting, singing).\u201d Speaking to reporters about the new guidance, Jay Butler, the CDC\u2019s deputy director for Infectious Diseases, dodged questions about what specific events the agency was referring to. \u201cThey are not regulations. They are not commands,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut they are recommendations or even suggestions \u2026 how you can have a gathering that will keep people as safe as possible.\u201d The guidance comes as the Trump campaign asks attendees of the president\u2019s rally in Tulsa next Friday to sign waivers saying they \u201cvoluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19.\u201d Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll is on track to overtake Britain to become the second highest in the world with over 40,000 dead. The World Health Organization inists the nation\u2019s health system was standing up to the pressure. \u201cThe system as such from the data we see is not overwhelmed,\u201d the WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert Dr. Mike Ryan said, with few areas of Brazil using more than 80% of their hospitals\u2019 intensive care bed capacity. Brazil clearly has hotspots in heavily-populated cities, he said, but overall its health system is coping with the world\u2019s second worst number of infections, 802,828 confirmed cases as of Thursday, second only to the United States. \u201cThe data we have at the moment supports (the vision of) a system under pressure but a system still coping with the number of severe cases,\u201d Ryan said at a briefing in Geneva. Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry has reported more than 1,200 deaths a day since Tuesday, a mounting toll as the country moves to ease quarantine restrictions and reopen businesses, a move called for by President Jair Bolsonaro. The right-wing leader has minimized the gravity of the novel coronavirus, dismissing it \u201ca little flu,\u201d and has accused state governments of exaggerating the number of infections and deaths to undermine him. On Thursday night, Bolsonaro encouraged his supporters to \u201cfind a way to get inside\u201d hospitals to film whether the ICU beds are occupied or not, to provide images that the police and Brazil\u2019s intelligence agency could investigate. Brazilian shoppers lined up for hours and crowded into malls that reopened on Thursday in the country\u2019s two largest cities. Shoppers continued to crowd malls on Friday, Brazil\u2019s equivalent to Valentine\u2019s Day. Inside stores in Sao Paulo and Rio, distancing rules were followed and shoppers were required to wear protective masks. Temperatures were taken before people entered some malls. The attempt by President Trump\u2019s campaign to shield itself from lawsuits by people who become infected with the coronavirus at his first political rally in months is unlikely to hold up in court, legal experts said. A waiver on the Trump campaign\u2019s website absolving it from coronavirus-related lawsuits stemming from the June 19 event is \u201cpoorly lawyered\u201d and would not be enforceable because it is not specific enough, said David Noll, a law professor at Rutgers University. \u201cThere are a lot of boxes you have to check in order to have an enforceable liability waiver, and the language they have added to their website is not enough,\u201d Noll said. The Republican president is holding a rally on June 19 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a heavily Republican state he won by more than 36 percentage points in 2016. It is his first rally since the coronavirus shut most of the United States three months ago. The online sign-up page for the event states that the campaign, the owner of the venue, and other companies cannot be held liable for exposure to the virus. \u201cBy clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to Covid-19 exists in any public place where people are present,* the waiver says. It says that anyone attending the rally voluntarily assumes \u201call risks related to exposure to Covid-19.\u201d Hillary Clinton has criticised President Trump for planning a campaign rally next Friday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The former Democratic presidential nominee condemned Trump for asking rally attendees to sign a liability waiver regarding the risks around potentially contracting the virus. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has cancelled face-to-face meetings and visits and will limit his contacts to a close circle after his wife tested positive for coronavirus. Olena Zelenska, said she had tested positive for coronavirus but her husband and their two children had tested negative. Prosecutors question Italy PM over handling of virus crisis. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was questioned for three hours on Friday by the prosecutor investigating an alleged failure by authorities to quarantine two Lombardy towns at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Breast milk has no links to spread of coronavirus says WHO. Breastfeeding mothers do not seem to be passing on Covid-19 to their infants, a World Health Organization expert said. New mothers infected with the virus should generally continue breastfeeding if they wish to and should not be separated from their babies UK travellers unable to fly to Greece as country reopens. Athens announced that the suspension of air links with Britain, in effect since March, will continue to be enforced until 30 June. Germany to lift land border checks late Monday. The country will on Monday night end border checks with its neighbours introduced to fight the coronavirus Turkish medical association says coronavirus lockdown eased too soon. The country\u2019s top medical association has criticised the decision to ease coronavirus restrictions, saying moves were not backed by science and came too soon, before the country had overcome the pandemic\u2019s initial wave. The number of new coronavirus cases in Turkey rose above 1,000 in the last 24 hours for the first time since 29 May. Delhi coronavirus deaths twice as high, say authorities. Deaths from coronavirus in New Delhi are almost twice as high as official figures show, a city leader said, as India overtook Britain with the fourth-highest number of cases worldwide. Macron to visit London in first trip since pandemic. French president Emmanuel Macron will meet Britain\u2019s Prince Charles when he visits London next week, his first trip abroad since the coronavirus crisis. Hundreds of Kenyans defied tear gas and riot police to carry off the body of a popular singer, trying to prevent a swift burial under rules for suspected coronavirus cases. Mourners and fans of Bernard Obonyo, whose stage name is Abenny Jachiga, swarmed the cemetery, preventing the singer\u2019s funeral from taking place in Kisumu city in western Kenya. The region has a tradition of lavish, well-attended funerals, but rules imposed for suspected cases of Covid-19 infection require bodies to be buried within 24 hours of death with only five relatives in attendance. Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd, which removed the body from the graveyard and took it to a mortuary. Obonbyo, 33, died on June 11. His brother told Kenyan daily newspaper the Daily Nation the singer was suffering from severe chest and abdominal pains, difficulty breathing and had been vomiting blood. His family are now asking for a week to organise a proper funeral for the star. \u201cAs a family we are requesting, give us one week, let the fans plan, let the music industry plan,\u201d said George Oningu, the singer\u2019s brother-in-law. \u201cWe do this to make sure there is peace and that Ben is buried in peace.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has cancelled face-to-face meetings and visits and will limit his contacts to a close circle after his wife tested positive for coronavirus, the presidential press service said. \u201cFace-to-face meetings... are excluded in the coming days. Participation in mass events is also excluded, working trips outside the capital of Ukraine are cancelled,\u201d it said in a statement. Earlier on Friday, Olena Zelenska said she had tested positive for coronavirus but her husband and their two children had tested negative. \u201cToday I received a positive test for coronavirus. Unexpected news. Especially considering that I and my family continue to follow all the rules - masks, gloves, a minimum of contacts,\u201d Zelenska wrote on Facebook. She said she felt well and was not hospitalised, but was isolating from her husband and children. Ukraine has reported 29,753 coronavirus cases, including 870 deaths. Richard Luscombe sends this report from Miami on the rising number of coronavirus cases in Florida: New coronavirus cases in Florida have set a daily record for the second day in a row. State figures released Friday morning show 1,902 more cases of Covid-19, up another 204 on Thursday\u2019s previous record tally. Florida, one of the first US states to reopen, is among those to have seen cases rising again significantly in recent days. According to the Florida Department of Health, new cases have topped 1,000 every day since 2 June, compared to only three of the previous 19 days from 13 May until the end of the month. An increase in testing accounts for some of the spike, but fears remain that Florida opened up too soon. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor, has touted what he calls a \u201csafe, smart\u201d recovery plan, which saw 64 of Florida\u2019s 67 counties moving to Phase Two - including partial reopening of bars, theaters, gyms and vacation rentals - on 5 June. (The three counties most affected by coronavirus, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, remain under tighter restrictions.) \u201cThe governor\u2019s first priority in reopening Florida continues to be maintaining the health and safety of all residents,\u201d Alberto Moscoso, spokesperson for the state\u2019s health department, told the Miami Herald. Experts from the Johns Hopkins school of public medicine, however, said on Monday that Florida\u2019s seven-day average was \u201capproximately equal to its peak in early April and is still increasing.\u201d Vietnam was the first country to allow football fans back in to watch matches. The top-flight match between Ha Tinh and Ha Noi had to be halted because of overcrowding. No-one appeared to be hurt and the game resumed with fans stood on the running track around the pitch. Vietnam has had 333 confirmed Covid-19 cases, recording no deaths. Meanwhile, football in Italy returned behind closed doors this evening after 96 days. The Coppa Italia semi-final second leg between AC Milan and Juventus is currently taking place in Turin. The top flight domestic league, Serie A, resumes on June 20. The Americas are bearing the brunt of the global coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said with North and South America currently having four of the 10 worst hit countries in the world. The disease was \u201chighly active\u201d in Central and South America, the WHO\u2019s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said, highlighting problems in Brazil and Mexico. Brazil, now one of the global hot-spots for the virus, was of increasing concern especially in heavily-populated cities, he told a press conference. The country\u2019s health system was \u201cstill coping\u201d, although some intensive care units were at a critical stage and under heavy pressure with more than 90% bed occupancy rates, Ryan said. Mexico meanwhile has nearly 130,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and more than 15,000 deaths, the WHO said. Brazil is the second worst hit country in the world, with more than 800,000 cases and 41,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Both countries lag behind the United States, the worst hit country, which has had more than 2 million cases and nearly 114,000 deaths. \u201cWe are very much in the upswing of this pandemic, particularly in the global South,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSome countries are having trouble exiting of the so-called lockdowns as they are seeing an increase in cases.\u201d Hillary Clinton has criticised President Trump for planning a campaign rally next Friday despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The former Democratic presidential nominee condemned Trump for asking rally attendees to sign a liability waiver regarding the risks around potentially contracting the virus. The president intends to hold his first campaign rally in more than three months at the 19,000-seat BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. Oklahoma is in the process of reopening, but the state is still advising residents to \u201cminimize time spent in crowded environments\u201d. Survivors of Covid-19 are donating their blood plasma in droves in hopes it helps other patients recover from the coronavirus. Scientists are testing if the donations might also prevent infection in the first place. Thousands of coronavirus patients in hospitals around the world have been treated with so-called convalescent plasma including more than 20,000 in the US with little solid evidence so far that it makes a difference. One recent study from China was unclear while another from New York offered a hint of benefit. \u201cWe have glimmers of hope\u201d, said Dr. Shmuel Shoham of Johns Hopkins University. With more rigorous testing of plasma treatment underway, Shoham is launching a nationwide study asking the next logical question: Could giving survivors plasma right after a high-risk exposure to the virus stave off illness? Researchers at Hopkins and 15 other sites will recruit health workers, spouses of the sick and residents of nursing homes where someone fell ill. The 150 volunteers will be randomly assigned to get either plasma from Covid-19 survivors that contains coronavirus-fighting antibodies or regular plasma used daily in hospitals, that was frozen prior to the pandemic. Scientists will track if there is a difference in who gets unwell. It if works, survivor plasma could have important ramifications until a vaccine arrives raising the prospect of possibly protecting high-risk people with temporary immune-boosting infusions. Lebanon will re-open Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport for commercial flights from July 1 but will keep air traffic at 10% of capacity from a year ago, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. Private flights will resume from June 24, the statement said. Passengers will be tested for Covid-19 upon arrival and obliged to practice home quarantine if testing positive, it added. Prosecutors question Italy PM over handling of virus crisis. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was questioned for three hours on Friday by the prosecutor investigating an alleged failure by authorities to quarantine two Lombardy towns at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

Deaths from coronavirus in New Delhi are almost twice as high as official figures show, a city leader said, as India overtook Britain with the fourth-highest number of cases worldwide. Macron to visit London in first trip since pandemic. French president Emmanuel Macron will meet Britain\u2019s Prince Charles when he visits London next week, his first trip abroad since the coronavirus crisis. France has reported the number of Covid-19 deaths over the past 24 hours increased by just 28 to 29,374, the third day the toll remained under 30 and the lowest three-day toll since lockdown started in mid-March. On Thursday and Wednesday the toll stood at 27 and 23, after averaging over 50 in the previous seven days and 91 in the 33 days since the end of lockdown on 11 May. The health ministry also reported the number of people in hospital fell by 341 to 11,124 and the number of people in intensive care units fell by 24 to 879, with both numbers continuing weeks-long downtrends. A further 947 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), taking the country\u2019s total to 113,914. In addition, 21,744 new Covid-19 cases were reported - the country\u2019s total is now 2,016,027. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. The death rate in France returned in May to a level comparable with other years, following weeks of elevated mortality due to the coronavirus outbreak, the country\u2019s Insee statistics institute said. Between 1 May and 1 June, 49,178 deaths were recorded, a decline of 3% on the same period last year, and similar to numbers for 2018, it said. The data is provisional and based on government statistics that do not divulge the cause of death. The larger Paris Ile-de-France department is the only region in France where deaths are still \u201ca bit higher\u201d than levels recorded in previous years, Insee said. The national data showed a drop of 8% in the number of people who died in hospital in May, compared with last year, but a rise of 5% for deaths in retirement facilities, and 7% for deaths at home. For the period 1 March to 1 June, there were 178,706 deaths in France - a rise of 16% (25,200 deaths) from 2019 and of 12% (18,500 deaths) from 2018, the institute said. The coronavirus has killed more than 29,300 people in France to date, some 10,300 of them in care homes. The death toll has been in sharp decline, but the government warns the virus is still in circulation and urges people to keep a safe distance from others to prevent a new wave of infections. The global coronavirus pandemic remains \u201cvery much in the upswing\u201d with a danger the disease could swiftly return to countries as they emerge from lockdowns, the World Health Organization said. Countries in south east Asia are working hard to identify new clusters and break the chains of transmission, WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert Dr Mike Ryan told a news conference. We are still very much in the upswing of this pandemic especially in the global South. It\u2019s not surprising at all that any country coming out of a so-called lockdown can have clusters of disease, re-emergence of disease in clusters. That\u2019s not necessarily a second wave. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said regions like Europe which are seeing the numbers of cases ebb were not safe, as the virus could be reintroduced. The number of new coronavirus cases in Turkey rose above 1,000 in the last 24 hours for the first time since 29 May, after the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of public facilities at the start of last week. Data showed 1,195 new cases were identified, up from a low of 786 last Tuesday, and 15 people died in the last 24 hours. The total number of cases rose to 175,218. Daily infections stood above 5,000 on 11 April. London fashion week, the first of the four major shows to go online-only has replaced catwalks with films, podcasts, live-streamed discussions \u2013 and even a drop-in virtual afterparty. The schedule, which began today and runs until Sunday, will feature no catwalk shows, no cocktail parties and definitely no air-kissing. Today\u2019s opening event was headlined not by a designer, but by a poet. A two-minute reading of a new piece by James Massiah, who describes his work as \u201cparty poetry\u201d, was filmed at his home in south London. The stakes are high for British fashion, because London\u2019s prestige in the industry owes much to its reputation for flamboyant clothes and must-see catwalk theatrics. When Shanghai became the first fashion week to pivot to an entirely digital format in response to the pandemic, the event three months ago was hailed as a commercial success, drawing 11 million viewers and selling \u00a32.2m of merchandise direct to consumers during live streams. But the virtual fashion show is still waiting for its first breakout hit, with even the biggest names struggling to translate their catwalk star power into a winning digital formula. Galicia will become the first of Spain\u2019s 17 regions to exit lockdown next week and enter the \u201cnew normality\u201d when all restrictions on movement are lifted. But the wearing of masks in public places will remain compulsory as it will elsewhere in the country until a vaccine against the virus is found. The northwestern region no longer has any patients suffering from Covid-19 in its intensive care units and has not suffered any deaths from the virus in the past week, according to Spain\u2019s health ministry. By Monday, more than 70% of Spain\u2019s 47 million population will be in the final stage of the phased rollback that should finish by 21 June in a country which has seen more than 27,000 Covid-19 deaths during the pandemic. By contrast, areas that took the brunt of the outbreak like the Madrid region, parts of Barcelona and Lerida in the Catalonia region, and four provinces of Castille-Leon will remain in phase two, the penultimate stage. Spain is the world\u2019s second most popular travel destination after France, but it has said it will not reopen its borders to international tourists until the start of July. Brussels had on Thursday said all of the European Union\u2019s internal borders should be opened by 15 June. Most EU countries as well as those within the passport-free Schengen zone, are on the brink of reopening their frontiers after a months-long closure to slow the spread of the virus. But Spain has insisted on holding out until 1 July. Breastfeeding mothers do not seem to be passing on Covid-19 to their infants, a World Health Organization expert has said. New mothers infected with the virus should generally continue breastfeeding if they wish to and should not be separated from their babies, the WHO said, stressing that the benefits outweighed the risks. WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency had thoroughly investigated the risks of women transmitting the new coronavirus to their babies when breastfeeding. We know that children are at relatively low-risk of Covid-19, but are at high risk of numerous other diseases and conditions that breastfeeding prevents. Based on the available evidence, WHO\u2019s advice is that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of Covid-19. Dr Anshu Banerjee, the WHO\u2019s senior advisor for reproductive health and research, told the briefing that, so far, the live virus that causes Covid-19 had not been found in breast milk. \u201cMothers with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 should be encouraged to initiate and continue breastfeeding and not be separated from their infants, unless the mother is too unwell,\u201d Tedros said. French president Emmanuel Macron will meet Britain\u2019s Prince Charles when he visits London next week, his first trip abroad since the coronavirus crisis. Macron will visit London on Thursday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of former French president Charles de Gaulle\u2019s appeal to French people to resist the Nazi occupation during World War II. He will award the Legion of Honour to London, making it the seventh city to be decorated with France\u2019s highest order of merit, after Algiers, Belgrade, Brazzaville, Liege, Luxembourg and Volgograd. The trip abroad will be Macron\u2019s first since he travelled to Naples for a French-Italian summit on 27 February, weeks before Europe\u2019s borders closed to help halt the spread of the virus. Prince Charles, who is in line to succeed Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II, and his wife Camilla will be the first members of the royal family to leave lockdown and attend a major event. Charles himself contracted Covid-19 and was forced to self-isolate at his mother\u2019s Balmoral estate in northeast Scotland. Britain this week introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for most travellers coming from abroad. The measures are designed to prevent new infections from abroad. But the French leader will be exempt, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman told reporters on Friday. As we set out in the guidelines when they were published, the French delegation will fall within the exempted category of representatives of a foreign country or territory travelling to undertake business in the UK. Quebec, the Canadian province hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak, is touting its vast spaces, \u201clone wolf\u201d running event, and \u201cend of the road\u201d trails to travellers as a centre for social distancing, tourism executives said. Roughly six times the size of France and with a population around the size of New York City, Quebec aims to spur demand among its own residents, while looking to tourists from neighboring province Ontario and the United States when travel restrictions relax. \u201cWe have such a large amount of space that we can easily respect social distancing,\u201d said Martin Soucy, director general of tourism-group Alliance de l\u2019industrie touristique du Qu\u00e9bec. Quebec has more than half of Canada\u2019s 97,530 coronavirus cases and 7,994 deaths from Covid-19 - most of its fatalities were in nursing homes. Coronavirus hit Canada\u2019s tourism hard with a 14-day quarantine requirement upon arrival, travel restrictions between some provinces and the expected continuation of a ban on non-essential travel with the US through July. Social distancing inspired a new \u201cend of the road\u201d campaign in Quebec\u2019s north coast, featuring remote hiking trails where \u201cyou don\u2019t need to do anything special to avoid one another,\u201d said Mario Leblanc, director of a tourism association in the region. Quebec\u2019s Charlevoix region, which has about five people per square kilometre, is promoting a \u201clone wolf\u201d trail running event in a region with 550km (340 miles) of hiking paths, said Mitchell Dion, director of the area\u2019s tourism association, The mostly French-speaking province on Thursday announced a C$753m ($553m), two-year spending package to revive tourism. The popular Paris Plages urban beach event will go ahead this summer but with coronavirus health precautions, the city mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced. The man-made beaches created with several tons of sand along the right bank of the Seine will be installed from 18 July to the end of August as part of an annual event aimed at giving Parisians who cannot get away from the city during the summer a taste of the seaside. Paris Plages is also set up at the Bassin de la Villette in the north of the city, where there will be three floating swimming pools installed in the canal with \u2018beach\u2019 areas nearby. There had been some concerns that because of Covid-19 health fears the event would be cancelled. Instead, some of the usual events may be dropped depending on the rules for large gatherings under phase 3 of France\u2019s progressive end of lockdown, which starts on 22 June. Paris city hall says the full programme will be announced in the coming days. Covid-19 vaccines should be made available as a global public good, the World Health Organization has said, to ensure everyone has fair access to any life-saving products that are developed. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference: Many leaders...have promoted the idea of making any vaccine a global public good, but that should continue to be promoted. More leaders should join the boat, and we need to have a truly global political commitment and global consensus before we even have the product. That is what we are pushing. Tedros was speaking after concerns have been raised that some countries, including the United States, could hoard any vaccines or drugs they develop to combat Covid-19, with poorer countries not getting access to the treatments. The current situation in Brazil, now one of the global hotspots for the virus, was of increasing concern, especially in cities, the WHO\u2019s top emergency expert Dr Mike Ryan said. Brazil\u2019s health system was \u201cstill coping\u201d, although some intensive care units were at a critical stage and under heavy pressure with more than 90% bed occupancy rates, Ryan said. Germany will on Monday night end border checks with its neighbours introduced to fight the coronavirus, the interior ministry told AFP. \u201cThe requirement of a valid reason for entry will... no longer apply\u201d along Germany\u2019s land borders, a ministry spokesman said. The relaxed rules will come into effect at midnight Monday into Tuesday. The EU Commission this week urged a relaxation of travel restrictions within the bloc from 15 June, a move supported by Germany. \u201cFreedom of movement is being restored in the European Union,\u201d Germany\u2019s interior minister Horst Seehofer said before the EU\u2019s official announcement. The EU also called on member states to lift all border restrictions for outside travellers from early July, saying the virus situation was \u201cfast improving\u201d in many countries. Germany introduced an unprecedented warning against all foreign travel in mid-March at the height of the coronavirus outbreak. But from Monday, Germans will be able to travel freely again to EU member states as well Britain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. European governments are under pressure to reopen their economies and ease lockdown restrictions now that the coronavirus is deemed under control in many countries on the continent. Deaths from Covid-19 in Italy climbed by 56 on Friday against 53 the day before, taking the country\u2019s total toll to 34,223. The official tally of new cases rose by just 163 against 379 on Thursday, but this was muddied by a recalculation of past data by the southern region of Campania, which subtracted previous cases and reported a total of -229 on Friday. The northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak was first identified, remains by far the worst affected of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, reporting 272 new infections on Friday. The second highest regional tally was in Emilia-Romagna, on Lombardy\u2019s southern border, which recorded just 33. The total number of confirmed cases nationwide now amounts to 236,305, the seventh highest global tally. People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 28,997 from 30,637 the day before. There were 227 people in intensive care on Friday, down from 236 on Thursday, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 173,085 were declared recovered against 171,338 a day earlier. The agency said 2.784 million people had been tested for the virus as of Friday against 2.746 million on Thursday, out of a population of around 60 million. Pakistan\u2019s ruling party has vowed to double healthcare spending as it unveiled a new budget which dramatically slashed other expenditure as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the economy. To a chorus of boos from the opposition, the government announced plans to cut the overall budget by 11% compared with last year, as revenues dried up and deficits soared in the impoverished nation. \u201cWe have prepared this budget keeping the coronavirus pandemic in mind,\u201d said Hammad Azhar, the minister of planning and industries, during a speech to the lower house of parliament. Pakistan\u2019s economy was already on life support before officials began shuttering large segments of the economy in March as an array of lockdown measures were rolled out in effort to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The country has since called for debt forgiveness from international donors and the IMF as tax revenues cratered, inflation soared, the currency was devalued, and fiscal deficits widened. \u201cIt is difficult to say anything with certainty about the coronavirus\u2019s impact ... but there is no doubt that our GDP - which we thought could grow around 3% - will now go down by around 0.4%,\u201d Azhar told parliamentarians. Pakistan has struggled for decades to collect sufficient taxes, piling pressure on successive governments over the decades to provide ample funding for the country\u2019s ailing healthcare and education sectors. Estimates suggest that only around 1% of the 200 million population filed a return in 2018. The unveiling of the budget came just days after the World Health Organization called on Pakistan to implement \u201cintermittent\u201d lockdowns to counter a surge in coronavirus infections that has come as the country loosened restrictions in recent weeks. The prime minister Imran Khan has repeatedly lambasted the lockdown measures, saying the moves are disproportionately hitting the poor who are unable to absorb the economic damage. Hospitals across Pakistan, however, say they are at or near capacity, and some are turning Covid-19 patients away. The coronavirus outbreak is hitting South Africa\u2019s mainly black townships harder than areas that were once the exclusive preserve of white people, according to new data that highlights the lasting impact of apartheid-era housing policies. More than two decades after the end of white minority rule, South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world, according to the World Bank, with urban areas starkly divided along racial lines. Townships in the Western Cape province, South Africa\u2019s main coronavirus hotspot, are suffering particularly high rates of infection, government tracking shows. Nearly 12% of all infections in the Western Cape are in Khayelitsha, the largest township in Cape Town, even though it has just 6% of the province\u2019s population. By contrast Stellenbosch, known for its winelands and a university town, has just 1% of Western Cape\u2019s cases and makes up about 4% of its population. Other hotspots include Mitchells Plain township, which has 9% of infections, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reports. \u201cWe are seeing townships become virus hotspots because we haven\u2019t dismantled the apartheid city,\u201d said Edward Molopi, a researcher with housing and human rights charity the Socio-Economic Research Institute in Johannesburg. South Africans have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest police brutality in townships in an echo of the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. Human rights defenders have said security forces were deployed to enforce lockdowns mainly in poor black areas like high density townships, where overcrowding made it impossible to properly isolate. South Africa has more than 58,500 confirmed coronavirus cases, and 1,284 deaths according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins university. The government is expecting an escalation of cases ahead of a predicted August/September peak and rising community infection rates in townships. But it is struggling with shortages of test kits, healthcare staff and hospital beds. Molopi said the virus had exposed how little had changed in South African cities since apartheid ended. During apartheid, black people had to live in sub-standard, crowded, unsanitary conditions, far from economic opportunity. Not much has changed. Greece will not be initially accepting passenger flights from Britain as it reopens to tourism on Monday, the government said today. And all passengers from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are to undergo tests upon arrival, the tourism and health ministers said as the country prepares for foreign visitors for the first time since the Covid-19 lockdown in March. \u201cThe ban on (passenger flights from) Great Britain remains in place\u201d for the next two weeks, tourism minister Harry Theoharis said. \u201cOur goal is for Greece to remain a safe country looking forward to the tourism season,\u201d said health minister Vassilis Kikilias. Greece has announced a \u2018bridge phase\u2019 between 15 and 30 June, during which only the airports of Athens and Thessaloniki will receive regular passenger flights. Other regional and island airports will open on 1 July. Until 30 June, tourists from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands will only be able to fly into Athens. UK passenger flights will be allowed from 1 July onwards. Any travellers who test positive will have to quarantine for 14 days at a hotel paid by the Greek state. With fewer than 190 coronavirus deaths among 11 million residents, Greece is looking to market itself as a healthy holiday destination. Tourism is a crucial part of the Greek economy, accounting for 20% of its gross domestic product and the lockdown hit the country hard. Seasonal hotels are to reopen on 15 June, two weeks after all-year hotels returned to business. Staff will be subject to regular tests, as will guests. Rooms have also been set aside to quarantine anyone testing positive for the virus, and each hotel has to have a contracted physician on call. In 2019, Greece posted a record year with over 34 million visitors, but operators say a realistic goal for this season is for up to a third of that number. Japan is aiming to launch a smartphone contact tracking app next week to curb the spread of coronavirus, the health ministry has said. Phones with the app installed can detect each other via Bluetooth and log those who have come into close contact. If a user is found to be infected, people who spent more than 15 minutes within a radius of one metre (3.3 feet) of that individual over the previous 14 days will be notified that they were in close contact with a coronavirus-infected person, and be prompted to seek medical consultation. Messages will only be sent if the infected individual gives consent, and those with a positive diagnosis will remain anonymous to receivers of the notification. \u201cBy knowing the possibility of having come into contact with someone tested positive for the new coronavirus, (app) users can get early support from a public health centre such as an access to a diagnostic test,\u201d a health ministry statement said on Friday. \u201cWe expect an increase in the number of users will help prevent the spread of infection.\u201d My colleagues Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Amrit Dhillon have written a poignant report on how the pandemic has pushed the Indian healthcare system to the bring of collapse. Cases in India, currently at 298,000, are now increasing by 10,000 per day and the country has overtaken the UK to be the fourth-worst hit in the world. India\u2019s biggest cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are not only running out of beds, but also doctors and nurses to treat the unprecedented numbers of patients, and university medical professors have been seconded to work on Covid hospital wards out of desperation. Private hospitals have been charging upwards of 80,000 rupees (\u00a3840) per night for those who are admitted with Covid symptoms, unaffordable prices for even middle-class let alone poorer Indians. You can read the full story here: I\u2019m Amy Walker, taking over the global coronavirus blog while my colleague Jessica Murray takes a break. You can get in touch with me on Twitter (@amyrwalker). Turkey\u2019s top medical association has criticised the decision to ease coronavirus restrictions, saying moves were not backed by science and came too soon, before the country had overcome the pandemic\u2019s initial wave. Since 1 June, Turkey has lifted weekend stay-home orders, ended curbs on intercity travel, resumed some international flights and re-opened cafes, restaurants, parks, beaches and gyms. The government has urged the public to remain cautious, while characterising the handling of the outbreak as a success. Nearly 4,800 have died of Covid-19 so far in Turkey, according to official data, with the daily death toll falling in recent weeks to about 20. But Cavit I\u015f\u0131k Yavuz, a member of the coronavirus research team at the Turkish Medics Association\u2019s (TTB), said there was still no proof that the outbreak was under control, and warned the lifting restrictions was resulting in more infections. Yavuz told an online press conference: At times, there is talk of when the second wave will hit, but we have not yet been able to overcome the first wave. The early re-opening decisions that are not based on scientific facts, especially since June 1, have caused a rise in case numbers and the number of patients receiving treatment in ICUs and needing respirators. Turkey\u2019s daily tally of newly recorded coronavirus cases has hovered just below 1,000 for two weeks, according to government data. The figure had dipped as far as 786 on 2 June after a drop-off last month. On Wednesday, health minister Fahrettin Koca said there had been a rise in daily cases in certain provinces, but said this had stabilised. President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan also warned of an uptick last week even as he revoked the weekend lockdown, citing a public backlash. Yavuz said: We are looking for a scientific basis for nearly all the measures that are being eased, but we cannot find any. We find it odd that in a pandemic where we lost nearly 5,000 citizens, there is an effort to find a success story. Canada\u2019s two largest grocery chains have announced plans to wind down \u2018emergency\u2019 pay for employees, despite taking in record profits during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic\u2014 a move that has prompted outrage from union leaders. Loblaws and Metro have both rolled out a C$2/hour premium during the pandemic in recognition that employees faced increased risk as front line workers. \u201cOur supermarkets and pharmacies are performing well,\u201d Loblaws head Galen Weston said in late March, when the pay increase was rolled out. \u201cAnd the leaders in our business wanted to make sure that a significant portion of that benefit would go straight into the pockets of the incredible people on the front line.\u201d As of 13 June, both companies will end the pay increase. They will pay out a bonus to each employee: full time workers at Loblaws will receive C$140 and those at Metro will be given C$200. Loblaws, which owns a number of grocery store brands across the country, recorded windfall profits in its first quarter, up to C$240m from C$198m the same quarter last year. Metro also reported a surge in profit, banking C$176m in its most recent quarter, compared to C$122m the year before. The decision to wind down pay has outraged union leaders, who say the pandemic is not over and the danger to workers remains present. Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, said in a statement: The pandemic is not over. The danger has not passed. These workers are no less at risk and are no less essential today than they were yesterday. There is no justification for ending pandemic pay now, or ever. Retail workers have always been essential, and they have always deserved much better. The fact is, the pandemic did not make these workers essential and did not create the inequities in retail, it simply exposed them. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was questioned for three hours on Friday by the prosecutor investigating an alleged failure by authorities to quarantine two Lombardy towns at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Conte was questioned, as a witness, by Bergamo prosecutor, Maria Cristina Rota, in Rome. Rota is leading an investigation into the failure to swiftly seal-off Alzano and Nembro, two towns in the worst-hit province of Bergamo, after outbreaks occurred in both. Rota will also hear testimony from Roberto Speranza, the health minister, and the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese. The epidemic has killed over 34,000 in Italy, one of the hardest hit countries in the world, mostly in the country\u2019s north. The investigation has sparked a row between Lombardy\u2019s leaders and central government, with each side claiming that the other was responsible for quarantine decisions. The investigation into criminal negligence has been pushed by the families of Covid-19 victims. The first 50 legal complaints were filed by members of NOI Denunceremo (we will denounce), a Facebook group set up in April, to Bergamo prosecutors on Wednesday. Relatives of the deceased believe authorities made serious errors, especially at the beginning of the outbreak, such as only briefly closing a hospital in the town of Alzano Lombardo after the first coronavirus infection was detected there on 23 February and failing to quarantine the town and the nearby Nembro. On Thursday, Conte said he welcomed the Bergamo investigation and was \u201cnot at all worried\u201d. I will conscientiously set out all the facts of which I have knowledge. All investigations are welcome. The citizens have the right to know and we have the right to reply. The Italian government is under pressure to reboot the economy. On Saturday, Conte will begin nine days of talks with ministers and leaders from various industries to come up with measures linked to the European Union\u2019s proposed \u20ac750bn recovery fund. Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, and Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, are expected to participate via video-link on Saturday. Your questions answered on what type of mask to wear to cut the risk of getting Covid-19: Does it matter what sort of mask you wear? Yes. Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk. The evidence on the protective value of single-use paper masks or reusable cloth coverings is less clear, but still suggests that face masks can contribute to reducing transmission of Covid-19. Analysis by the Royal Society said this included homemade cloth face masks. Are paper surgical single-use masks better or is a cloth mask OK? The evidence on any mask use, outside of surgical masks, is still emerging: there appears to be some benefit, but the exact parameters of which masks are the best and the extent to which they protect the wearer or those around them are still being figured out. A tighter fitting around the face is probably better, but the CDC suggests any covering, including a bandana, is better than none. One US study investigated which household materials best removed particles of 0.3-1.0 microns in diameter, the typical size of viruses and bacteria, and concluded that good options include vacuum cleaner bags, heavyweight \u201cquilter\u2019s cotton\u201d or multiple layers of material. Scarves and bandana material were less effective, but still captured a fraction of particles. The European commission has received a political mandate from EU governments to negotiate on their behalf advance purchases of promising coronavirus vaccines, the EU\u2019s top health official said, urging states to set aside parallel initiatives. EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides told a news conference there was \u201coverwhelming\u201d support from EU governments for a commission plan to use a \u20ac2.4bn ($2.7bn) fund to buy coronavirus vaccines upfront. Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands are already in talks with pharmaceutical companies to buy vaccines, a move that could weaken the EU\u2019s joint approach. Kyriakides said the two initiatives had the same goal, adding: \u201cBoth tracks should converge for the benefits of all 27. This is about working together and not in competition.\u201d A South African court has started hearing a challenge by the main opposition party against a government-imposed ban on personal care services to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Democratic Alliance (DA) party on Monday filed a lawsuit in the Western Cape high court to have the ban \u2013 which prevents hairdressers, beauticians and tattoo artists from working \u2013 declared \u201cinvalid and unconstitutional\u201d. Most other businesses have been allowed to resume their activities since South Africa moved into level three of a strict five-tier lockdown at the start of June. Personal care services such as hairdressing remained shut as they were deemed \u201chigh-risk\u201d activities unable to ensure social distancing requirements. DA leader John Steenhuisen said in a statement: The reality is that the devastation from the continued economic lockdown will see more lives lost than the virus could ever harm. Government must stop driving fear and empower people to work and protect themselves and their livelihoods. South Africa has the continent\u2019s highest number of coronavirus cases, with more than 58,500 infections and at least 1,284 deaths recorded to date. But the economic costs of the lockdown have stoked disagreement between political parties and the opposition has grown increasingly critical of the government\u2019s response to the outbreak. Last month, the DA filed another legal challenge against some other coronavirus lockdown rules, including a ban on e-commerce and a night curfew. Britain\u2019s government has brought in quarantine rules to protect public health, a spokesman for prime minister Boris Johnson has said, declining to comment on legal action brought by British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair. \u201cI would emphasise that we\u2019ve obviously brought these quarantine rules into place to protect public health and ensure we don\u2019t import the virus as cases in the community reduce,\u201d the spokesman told reporters, adding that the government does not comment on \u201congoing legal matters\u201d. French superchef Alain Ducasse is using a ventilation system similar to those in hospital operating theatres to reopen one of his Paris restaurants. Ducasse, whose restaurants have 17 Michelin stars - the most of any chef in the world - is installing the sophisticated system in his historic Allard bistro in the Saint Germain des Pres district of the French capital so it can open later this month. Paris restaurants have been allowed to serve on their terraces for 10 days but strict social distancing rules mean the interiors remain off limits. Diners in Paris bistros and cafes traditionally sit almost elbow to elbow on small tables - a nightmare for restaurateurs who have been told by that tables must now be at least one metre a part. \u201cNo restaurant can survive with only half of its customers,\u201d Ducasse told AFP as he unveiled his air filtration system at the Allard, whose tables will also be screened off with sail cloth blinds. Large white air \u201csocks\u201d decorated with drawings of the gods and goddesses of the wind hang over every table from the overhead ventilation pipes, gently pushing stale air away. And customers will also be offered round transparent \u201cseparators\u201d to be placed on their table for additional safety when French restaurants are due to fully reopen on 22 June. Ducasse said his prototype will \u201cgive extra safety to customers in confined spaces\u201d and was a possible solution for tightly packed bistros which could lose half their tables if distancing rules are rigidly applied. Designer Patrick Jouin, whose work is displayed at MOMA in New York as well as the Paris Pompidou Centre, said he talked to scientists and virologists before coming up with the air system. Norway will allow travel to and from Finland, Iceland and the Swedish island of Gotland from 15 June, but is maintaining existing travel restrictions imposed on mainland Sweden due to its higher level of Covid-19 cases. Denmark, Finland and Norway have lifted some of the travel restrictions they imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19, but they have kept most of the ones imposed on Sweden. \u201cI think we need to be honest and say that in the Nordics this is something of a difficult issue at the moment,\u201d prime minister Erna Solberg told a news conference. She added: At the same time we have a good conversation about how we\u2019re doing it, and the fact that we\u2019re applying objective criteria has been met with understanding. Norway will assess the public health situation of each region in the Nordics separately and will review its travel advice every fortnight, starting 15 June, said Solberg. Gotland, a Baltic island with close to 60,000 inhabitants, is the only Swedish region Norway will allow citizens to travel to without having to undergo a ten-day quarantine when going home. Sweden adopted fewer lockdown restrictions and by 10 June 10 its Covid-19 deaths were 4,717 - four times the number in the other Nordic countries combined. Europe needs to become more independent in supplying itself with face masks and certain medicines as it battles the coronavirus outbreak, German health minister Jens Spahn has said. Spahn told a news conference: It\u2019s not about calling globalisation into question - it\u2019s about finding the right degree of globalisation. When it comes to face masks and certain medications, we\u2019ve seen that we should not make ourselves completely dependent on the global market. Decisions should not be made in China about whether we have protective masks for carers or doctors in Warsaw, Amsterdam or Berlin. Economy minister Peter Altmaier has previously said that the coronavirus pandemic has shown Europe is too reliant on other countries for some medical supplies, and European states should work together to further diversify international supply chains. Deaths from coronavirus in New Delhi are almost twice as high as official figures show, a city leader said, as India overtook Britain with the fourth-highest number of cases worldwide. With India\u2019s lockdown being widely eased, the government has been reporting almost 10,000 new confirmed cases every day with infections totalling almost 300,000, including 8,500 deaths. Densely populated megacities such as Delhi and Mumbai are the worst affected, stretching hospitals to breaking point. But data in Delhi is understating the true scale of the outbreak, said Jai Prakash, standing committee head of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, one of the three sub-districts that make up the capital. Citing data from the city\u2019s busy crematoriums and cemeteries, Prakash said on Thursday that just over 2,000 people have died from the virus across the city - almost twice the official toll. \u201cThese were corona positive cases. We have a separate record of funerals of some another 200 suspected cases,\u201d Prakash told reporters. But the party that governs Delhi as a whole, which has come under fire for its handling of the health crisis, rejected the claims. \u201cThis is a time to unite and save lives of people. This is not the time to make allegations,\u201d the Aam Aadmi Party said in a statement. Financial capital Mumbai is officially India\u2019s worst affected city with almost 2,000 fatalities. Parts of the Dharavi area in Mumbai, one of Asia\u2019s largest slums, have been under strict months-long lockdown. The number of new cases has been easing, with 20 new infections confirmed on Friday. The death toll in the southern city of Chennai is at least 460, more than double the official figure, media reports said this week. Despite the surge in cases nationally, which is being mirrored elsewhere in South Asia, prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has declared the lockdown a success and has been steadily lifting restrictions Ukraine\u2019s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has tested positive for coronavirus, but her husband, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and their two children have tested negative. She wrote on Facebook on Friday: Today I received a positive test for coronavirus. Unexpected news. Especially considering that I and my family continue to follow all the rules \u2013 masks, gloves, a minimum of contacts. Zelenska said she felt well, was not hospitalised, but was isolating from her husband and children. Ukraine has reported 29,753 coronavirus cases, including 870 deaths. President Vladimir Putin has said an \u201cabsolute majority\u201d of Russians back his controversial plan to change the constitution, as he made his first public appearance after weeks of lockdown. Russia, which has the world\u2019s third-largest coronavirus caseload, this week lifted tight restrictions as Putin set the stage for a vote on 1 July that could extend his hold on power until 2036. Putin greeted his compatriots at an open-air flag-raising ceremony in western Moscow to mark Russia Day, a public holiday. He was surrounded by allies, including the prominent paediatrician Leonid Roshal. Appearing without a mask and smiling in the bright sunshine, the 67-year-old leader praised the spirit of the Russian people as well their traditions and culture. He said it was only natural that Russians wanted to see these \u201cfundamental, basic premises\u201d reflected in the constitution. \u201cI am sure that an absolute majority of our citizens share and support such a position,\u201d Putin said. During the ceremony, he also bestowed labour awards on Roshal, popular Soviet-era actor Yury Solomin and others. Putin, who has dominated Russia for two decades, in January unleashed a political storm by proposing an overhaul of the constitution, the first changes to the basic law since 1993. In a carefully choreographed move, he later agreed for the amendments to include a provision that would reset the clock on his term limits to zero, meaning he could potentially stay in power until 2036. Even though Covid-19 infections have been declining in Russia, many doctors and Kremlin critics say the lockdown restrictions have been lifted prematurely in Moscow, the centre of the Russian outbreak. Critics accuse Putin of rushing to drum up support ahead of the vote as his approval ratings fall, according to independent pollsters. On Friday evening, authorities will stage a concert on Red Square, adding that those attending will respect physical distancing rules. Zoom has admitted it suspended the accounts of human rights activists at the behest of the Chinese government and suggested it will block any further meetings that Beijing complains are illegal. On Thursday, the video conferencing platform was accused of disrupting or shutting down the accounts of three activists who held online events relating to the Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary or discussing the crisis in Hong Kong. None were given an explanation by Zoom. Following media reports, late on Thursday Zoom said it had been contacted by the Chinese government in May and early June about four Zoom meetings to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre that were being publicised on social media. The Chinese government informed us that this activity is illegal in China and demanded that Zoom terminate the meetings and host accounts. We did not provide any user information or meeting content to the Chinese government. We do not have a backdoor that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible. The statement raises questions about Zoom bowing to Chinese pressure. Unlike many western social media platforms, it is not blocked in China. The company did not explain under what law the meetings \u2013 which were hosted outside mainland China \u2013 were deemed to be illegal. Beijing has said it will delay primary school students returning to school after three fresh coronavirus cases emerged in the capital \u2013 the first after two months of no infections in the city. China has largely brought domestic coronavirus infections under control, and the majority of cases in recent months have been overseas nationals tested as they return home. On Thursday, local authorities announced one new case with no recent travel history outside the capital, followed by two more cases on Friday. The city\u2019s education commission said on Friday it had cancelled first, second and third-graders\u2019 planned return to school on Monday \u2013 affecting 520,000 students, Xinhua reported. The commission said students who had already returned to school would carry on lessons as normal, but with stricter anti-epidemic measures in place. Beijing students have gradually resumed lessons in waves since late April, after schools had been closed for three months during the coronavirus outbreak. The city\u2019s last case before the recent spike was reported in mid-April. In total, there have been 597 infections reported in the city \u2013 174 of which were imported from overseas \u2013 and nine local deaths, according to official figures. The recent announcements stoked fears of a fresh wave on social media. \u201cI\u2019m living in Fengtai district [where the latest Covid-19 cases live], trembling with fear \u2026 Going to buy more masks. Hope it can be over soon!\u201d wrote one user on Weibo, a Twitter-like social network. Some called for mass Covid-19 testing in Beijing. China conducted similar testing campaigns on millions of residents in Wuhan \u2013 the original epicentre of the outbreak. To protect the capital, Beijing is redirecting international flights through other cities where passengers are quarantined and tested before being allowed to proceed. Afghanistan has declared a \u201cpublic mobilisation\u201d against Covid-19 as the number of confirmed infections passed 23,000. In a WhatsApp message to reporters on Thursday, Ahmad Jawad Omani, the country\u2019s new acting health minister called his five-part plan to fight against the virus \u201chistoric\u201d and said \u201conly a small part of health sector was to fight with coronavirus until today, but from now, all parts of the sector will get coordinated to fight against the virus. Today, I announce public mobilisation against coronavirus\u201d. According to the new plan, \u201cfrom a clinic in a remote area to hospitals in the capital are mobilised to fight against the virus\u201d. Only government hospitals were allowed to treat Covid-19 patients in Afghanistan, but according to the plan, the private sector can now also treat and test. Testing capacity will also be increased, but clinics with no testing labs are instructed to announce new patients through their symptoms. The acting health minister also said a mobile application will be created for health workers to upload new figures to. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s health ministry reported 656 new infections, taking the total to 23,546. The number of deaths in the country has risen by 20, to 446 fatalities. There have been 3,928 recoveries. Most new cases (326) have been reported in the capital, Kabul, the country\u2019s worst-affected area in both number of confirmed transmissions and deaths with 9,466 cases and 92 deaths. Mohammad Yaghoub Heidari, the governor of Kabul, warned earlier this week \u201ca catastrophe\u201d is going on in the capital and the actual number of infections in Kabul is much higher than official figures show, maybe even \u201ca million\u201d. Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the live blog for the next few hours - as always feel free to get in touch with any comments and suggestions - I\u2019ll certainly read them all and do my best to respond to as many as I can: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Germany\u2019s health minister, Jens Spahn, has warned the nation against taking a carefree attitude towards the coronavirus, after the number of active cases in the country fell to around 5,300. A total of 258 new cases were registered overnight, one of the lowest daily increases. He told a German broadcaster this morning: \u201cWe continue to have a low level of the virus, with new infections occurring every day, but on a scale that we can manage well \u2026 but we\u2019re also seeing that from family parties to church services, the virus is still there. \u201cAnd if we make it too easy for the virus, if we are too carefree, then it will spread again very quickly\u201d. Spahn was referring to two local outbreaks that have received much attention. In the city of G\u00f6ttingen, several family gatherings last month are known to have caused the virus to spread, leading to the closure of several schools and many people being sent into quarantine, while in Frankfurt am Main, a service held by a Baptist community also led to the infection spreading rapidly amongst worshippers and their acquaintances. Germany has had 187,826 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The death toll stands at 8,947. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is being questioned by prosecutors investigating the lack of a coronavirus lockdown of two towns in Lombardys Bergamo province that turned into one of the hardest-hit areas of the country\u2019s outbreak. Doctors and virologists have said the two-week delay in quarantining Alzano and Nembro allowed the virus to spread in Bergamo, which saw a 571% increase in excess deaths in March compared with the average of the previous five years. Lead prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota arrived with a team of aides Friday morning at the premiers office in Rome, Palazzo Chigi. In addition to Conte, she is expected to question the health and interior ministers. In previous days, Rota has interviewed the head of the Superior Institute of Health. To date no one has been placed under investigation and it\u2019s unclear what, if any, criminal blame will be assigned to public officials for decisions taken or not in the onetime epicenter of Europe\u2019s outbreak. Among other things, the probe is looking into whether it fell to the national government in Rome, or the Lombardy regional authorities, to create a so-called red zone\u201d around the two towns. After interviewing Lombardy regional officials last month, Rota said it appeared it was the national government\u2019s responsibility. But Conte\u2019s office has pointed to norms that delegate such authority to regions, and noted that other regions have instituted red zones\u201d on their own. Ten towns in the province, as well as a handful of towns outside Lombardy, were immediately locked down by the national government to try to contain the spread. Alzano and Nembro registered their first positive cases two days later, on 23 February, but the government didn\u2019t quarantine them for two weeks until all of Lombardy was locked down 7 March. Asked if, in hindsight, he should have locked down sooner, Conte told La Stampa daily on Friday that he was at peace with the decisions taken. \u201cI acted based on science and conscience,\u201d he said. For doctors and healthcare workers in India\u2019s financial capital Mumbai who are grappling with surging coronavirus infections, the onset of the annual monsoon poses a serious threat - a new wave of patients with vector-borne diseases. Already stretched by a shortage of medics and critical care beds, the situation in Mumbai might turn uglier, health experts warn, as cases of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis and encephalitis are expected to soar in coming months. \u201cMumbai will be dealing with a crisis in the monsoon,\u201d said Kamakshi Bhate, professor emeritus of community medicine at the state-run King Edward Memorial (KEM). Hospital in Mumbai, noting there is typically a surge in hospital bed occupancy due to such diseases during India\u2019s annual June-September monsoon season. Waterlogged streets are a common sight every monsoon across India. But in Mumbai, its most populous city, monsoons can often bring life to a standstill with flooding and water-logging, and result in a surge of diseases. In a report, local NGO Praja Foundation said official data from only government-run hospitals showed Mumbai recorded about 32,000 malaria and dengue cases in 2018, but the NGO said its own household survey indicated more than 200,000 cases of just those two diseases in the city that year. This year, the city\u2019s hospitals are already overrun. Mumbai has been hit the hardest by Covid-19. About 25% of India\u2019s 297,535 coronavirus cases and roughly 29% of the 8,498 deaths recorded have come from the city and its surrounding suburbs. Suresh Kakani, an additional commissioner at Mumbai\u2019s civic authority, said it was asking clinics and dispensaries, some of which had shut during a two-month long nationwide lockdown, to reopen. Drains are being cleaned and stored water in houses were being inspected for larvae, Kakani said, adding that while major hospitals were on treating covid patients, smaller nursing homes would be available to handle other cases. But, with local hospitals already strained by significant staff shortages, heath experts fear the spread of diseases in Mumbai\u2019s slums could compound issues for a healthcare network already reeling from Covid-19 cases. Twitter on Thursday said it removed more than 170,000 accounts tied to a Beijing-backed influence operation that deceptively spread messages favorable to the Chinese government, including some about the coronavirus. The company suspended a core network of 23,750 highly active accounts, as well as a larger network of about 150,000 \u201camplifier\u201d accounts used to boost the core accounts\u2019 content. Twitter, along with researchers who analysed the accounts, said the network was largely an echo chamber of fake accounts without much further traction. Twitter is blocked in China, along with other American social media companies such as Facebook and Instagram. The company also removed two smaller state-backed operations which it attributed to Russia and Turkey, both focused on domestic audiences. Twitter said the Chinese network had links to an earlier state-backed operation dismantled last year by Twitter, Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube that had been pushing misleading narratives about political dynamics in Hong Kong. The new operation likewise focused heavily on Hong Kong, but also promoted messages about the coronavirus pandemic, exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui and Taiwan, the researchers said. Renee DiResta, at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the network\u2019s coronavirus activity increased in late January, as the outbreak spread beyond China, and spiked in March. Accounts praised China\u2019s response to the virus, while also using the pandemic to antagonise the US and Hong Kong activists, she said. The public health crisis caused by the Covid-19 epidemic in Europe is not over yet, the European Union\u2019s top health official warned on Friday, urging governments to remain vigilant and plough ahead with testing and tracing the population. \u201cThis is not behind us yet. We need to be vigilant,\u201d the EU health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, told EU health ministers in a video conference, amid fears of a fresh surge in infections as EU states gradually reopen business and borders and after mass protests in recent days across the continent. People attending an upcoming Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been told they cannot sue if they contract coronavirus. The sign-up page for the president\u2019s upcoming rally includes a disclaimer about the possibility of contracting the disease. The president has implemented a policy that states rally attendees cannot sue the campaign or venue if they contract coronavirus at the event, the New York Times reports: \u2018By clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to Covid-19 exists in any public place where people are present,\u2019 a statement on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign website informed those wishing to attend his June 19 rally in Tulsa, Okla. \u2018By attending the rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors or volunteers liable for any illness or injury.\u2019 The rally will be Trump\u2019s first since the pandemic forced most of the country into lockdown three months ago. Oklahoma, a state Trump won four years ago, began lifting restrictions on businesses on 24 April and moved into phase 3 of its reopening on 1 June, allowing summer camps to open and workplaces to return with full staffing. Beijing city government on Friday reported two new confirmed Covid-19 cases, marking the second consecutive day of new infections being reported in the Chinese capital. The two patients, both male, were reported from a different part of Beijing than the case reported on Thursday. They both work at the same facility for the China Meat Food Comprehensive Research Center, which conducts research on subjects including meat processing, state media reported. It was not immediately clear how the two men were infected.

Armenia said on Friday it had extended a state of emergency over the coronavirus outbreak until 13 July as the number of daily infections continues to rise. Despite the extension of the state of emergency, almost all sectors of the Armenian economy are functioning after businesses reopened in early May to prevent it from collapsing. The government made it mandatory to wear face masks in public to try to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Armenia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Tigran Avinyan, said last week the government planned to reopen international flights from mid-July to help the tourism industry. Armenia, a country of 3 million, had registered 15,281 confirmed coronavirus cases and 258 deaths as of Friday. It is the worst-affected country in the South Caucasus region. Russia reported has reported 8,987 new cases of coronavirus today, bringing its nationwide tally of infections to 511,423. Officials said 183 people had died in the last 24 hours, pushing the official national death toll to 6,715. Earlier this week, an EU report said China and Russia had engaged in mass disinformation about the pandemic. Beijing has responded, saying yesterday that China is in fact the victim of misinformation, and accused the EU of speaking on behalf of the US. The European commission had said Russia and China were running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d. While the charge against Russia has been levelled on many occasions, this was the first time the EU executive has publicly named China as a source of disinformation. On Thursday, China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said the accusation was \u201cbaseless\u201d and was disinformation itself. \u201cAnyone with no bias can see clearly who is the biggest perpetrator to make and spread disinformation about the pandemic,\u201d she said. In the official transcript, Hua did not name any particular country, but a separate editorial in state media site the Global Times suggested it was a reference to the US. British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have launched legal action against the UK government\u2019s quarantine policy, asking for a judicial review to be heard as soon as possible, a statement from BA\u2019s parent IAG said. The airlines said earlier this week they would club together to try to end the 14-day quarantine rule for international arrivals which they say will deter travel and threaten more jobs. Lawyers have said the government would have to show the scientific evidence that underpinned the need for a quarantine if judges allow a judicial review to go ahead. Britain\u2019s chief scientist said earlier in June that politicians decided the policy, adding quarantines worked best for restricting travel from countries with high infection rates. The quarantine came into force on Monday. In their statement, provided by BA\u2019s parent company IAG , the airlines said there was no scientific evidence for such a severe policy. They also dismissed the alternative of \u201cair bridges\u201d, the name given to bilateral deals between countries with low infection rates, which the government has presented as a potential alternative to the quarantine. \u201cThe airlines have not yet seen any evidence on how and when proposed \u2018air bridges\u2019 between the UK and other countries will be implemented,\u201d they said. Thailand will lift a nationwide curfew and ease more restrictions next week, a spokesman for its coronavirus taskforce said on Friday, after the country reported no local transmissions of the virus for 18 days. Thailand is also planning to reopen to foreign visitors by creating so-called travel bubbles with countries that have also managed to contain the virus, though no target date was set, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. \u201cThe curfew will be lifted effective on 15 June along with the easing of some activities,\u201d Taweesin said, adding that strict social distancing rules still needed to be observed in all public activities. Schools with fewer than 120 students, exhibition halls, music concerts, film productions, playgrounds, amusement parks, sports competitions without spectators and sales of alcohol in restaurants can resume next Monday, he said. Meanwhile, pubs, bars and karaoke outlets will remain closed, he said. Travel could be reopened with countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and some Middle East nations, Taweesin said, as well as neighbours like Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia. \u201cThe target group is business travellers as well as those wanting medical services and treatment in Thailand,\u201d he said. No date has been set on the easing of restrictions on international arrivals, which are still banned until the end of June. Thailand has been gradually easing restrictions in an effort to revive its economy and after appearing to contain the virus. It has recorded 58 deaths so far and 3,129 confirmed cases \u2013 most of which have recovered. The Danish government plans to create a 10bn Danish crown ($1.52bn) fund to support companies hit by the coronavirus crisis, it said on Friday. Companies with annual revenue over 500m crowns are eligible, the finance ministry said, and finance minister Nicolai Wammen said about 200 \u2013 none of which he named \u2013 would qualify. The ministry said financial institutions and publicly owned companies would be excluded, and newspaper Borsen quoted Wammen as saying the airline SAS, part-owned by the Danish and Swedish states, would not be on the list either. Wammen said the fund could exceed 10bn crowns if needed. Financing for it may be shared between the government and institutional investors, which will take non-voting stakes in companies that draw on it. The minority Social Democratic government will need support from other parties in parliament the proposal to become law. South Korea will extend prevention and sanitation guidelines against coronavirus until daily new infections drop to single digits, the country\u2019s health minister has said. But he warned warned of a return to tough social distancing measures if needed. The announcement came as such cases persist in the mid-double digits following a series of new clusters in the area around Seoul, the capital, with 56 new cases on Thursday taking the national tally to 12,003, and 277 deaths. Authorities will review whether to return to intensive social distancing if 50 daily infections persist for more than two weeks, the health minister, Park Neung-hoo, told a briefing. \u201cThese guidelines are aimed at cutting the series of infections centered in the Seoul area that could result in a return to social distancing,\u201d he said. Global demand for premium foods like wagyu beef, bluefin tuna and caviar has plunged, with thousands of restaurants shuttered and many economies sliding into recession amid the coronavirus pandemic. As strict lockdown measures to contain the outbreak ravage global economic activity, Reuters reports that the luxury food industry could be among the worst hit since it heavily relies on restaurants and top hotels for demand for deluxe items from caviar to champagne. While some gourmet food producers are tapping consumers directly to stay afloat, others have been forced to cut output as some products have lost nearly half their value since the start of the year. Jean-Marie Barillere, co-chairman of champagne producers\u2019 lobby CIVC in France, said he hoped people would celebrate the easing of lockdown with a bottle of champagne, but expected a difficult end to the year. \u201cThis is really a period that looks like a war time,\u201d he said. The relatively cautious approach taken by Spain to reopening its borders to international visitors is coming under increasing pressure, reports El Pais today. While the government in Madrid planning to reopen borders on 1 July, when it will also lift its requirement for a 14-day quarantine, the EU commissioner for home affairs insisted on the recommendation that internal borders must \u201creopen as soon as possible. Ylva Johansson added on Thursday that the main thing is for all states to open internal borders completely before opening the EU\u2019s external borders to third-country travellers. In a region where live music is everything \u2013 both for audiences and for performers heavily reliant on live appearances to make a living \u2013 the widespread cancellation of festivals across southern Africa has hit the music business hard. Silence Charumbira has written this piece on how coronavirus has forced events including AfrikaBurn and Bushfire to cancel, leaving performers without promotional platforms and income. May should have seen the Bushfire festival in Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Zakifo and AfrikaBurn in South Africa, and Azgo in Mozambique. Next month would have been Zimfest in Zimbabwe. All have been cancelled \u2013 or replaced with online versions \u2013 along with dozens of smaller live events that have been growing in recent years. Britain is learning today what a full month\u2019s lockdown does to the UK\u2019s economy and the data is not pretty: it slumped by 20.4% in April from the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown paralysed the country. Richard Partington has that story here on a day when prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to come under sustained pressure from Conservative MPs to take further steps to open up the economy, amid calls for caution from other quarters. A range of other indicators are also out while the ongoing ramifications of the public health crisis continue to be felt. On that front, lawyers representing 450 bereaved people whose relatives have died due to Covid-19 have called on Johnson and Britain\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock, to hold an immediate public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis to help prevent many more deaths. The global blog is now being picked up here in the UK, where we\u2019ll continue to bring you coverage of developments across the world. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I\u2019m off to frantically clean my apartment before my in-laws arrive for a visit. The brilliant Ben Quinn is here to take over the blog. Thank you to those of you who got in touch with us today \u2013 always much appreciated. Here\u2019s our global wrap of the most important recent developments in the coronavirus pandemic: Three months into lockdown, things have moved on in the land of digital dance, from fun Instagram clips and online classes to some serious choreography. Here are the best of the lot: The British government is expected to backtrack on its Brexit plan to introduce full border checks with the EU from 1 January 2021 over fears of the economic impact of coronavirus, PA Media reports. The cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, is anticipated to make an announcement on Friday over border operations for when Brexit fully comes into effect at the end of the transition period. The UK had committed to introduce import controls on EU goods in the new year, but ministers are expected to adopt a more flexible approach to prevent the departure compounding the chaos from Covid-19. A government source said: \u201cWe recognise the impact that coronavirus has had on UK businesses, and as we take back control of our laws and our borders at the end of this year, we will take a pragmatic and flexible approach to help business adjust to the changes and opportunities of being outside the single market and the customs union.\u201d Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Global infections passed 7.5 million. There are 7,514,481 confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 420,993 known deaths so far. The true figures for deaths and infections are likely to be significantly higher due to time delays, differing testing rates and definitions, and suspected underreporting. Beijing sees first local transmission case in several weeks. In Beijing, a 52-year-old man who has no history of travelling outside the city or contact with anyone coming in has been diagnosed with Covid-19. He is the first local transmission case in China for several weeks.The man lives in Xicheng district. On Wednesday he visited a clinic reporting an intermittent fever, chills and fatigue. He had no other symptoms, and had no relevant travel or contact history in the past two weeks. Fu Xuejie, the wife of Dr Li Wenliang, has given birth to their son. Li was praised as a whistleblower in China, and made headlines earlier this year after he was reprimanded for warning colleagues about the emergence of a new Sars-like virus. Li later contracted the virus himself, and died in hospital on 6 February. Fu told local news she had given birth to a boy earlier this morning, describing him as \u201cthe last gift\u201d Li gave her.\u201cMy husband, can you see us from heaven?\u201d Fu wrote on her WeChat account on Friday morning.\u201cThe last gift you gave me was born today \u2013 I will work hard to love and protect them.\u201d Brazil confirms 30,000 cases in 24 hours. Brazil reported a total of 802,828 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, with 30,412 new infections in the last 24 hours in the world\u2019s second worst outbreak after the US. With a further 1,239 fatalities, the death toll in Brazil has reached 40,919, the health ministry said, the world\u2019s third highest after the US and the UK. WHO warns pandemic accelerating in Africa. The speed the new coronavirus jumped from 100,000 to 200,000 confirmed cases in Africa shows just how quickly the pandemic is accelerating on the continent, the World Health Organization said Thursday. \u201cIt took 98 days to reach the first 100,000 cases, and only 18 days to move to 200,000 cases,\u201d Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, told a video briefing hosted by the UN press association in Geneva. Dow sinks 1,800 as virus cases rise, deflating optimism. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on Wall Street as coronavirus cases in the US increased again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 1,800 points, almost 7%, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 5.9%, its worst day since mid-March, when stocks went through repeated harrowing falls as the virus lockdowns began. US president Donald Trump has introduced a policy stopping attendees at his rallies from suing the campaign or venue if they contract coronavirus at the events. A statement on the campaign website page for a rally in Tulsa says, \u201cBy clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates \u2026 liable for any illness or injury.\u201d Pandemic risks pushing millions more into child labour: UN. A report released on Friday noted that relation between swelling poverty and a surge in child labour appears clear, pointing to studies from some countries indicating that a one-percent increase in poverty leads to at least a 0.7% rise in child labour. The report also stressed that the crisis could push children already working to put in longer hours under worsening conditions. Others could be forced into the worst forms of labour, seriously threatening their health and safety, it said. Brazil, which is the second hardest-hit country after the US, confirmed 30,000 new cases in 24 hours on Thursday, taking its total past 800,000. Under the leadership of Jair Bolsonaro, who has sought to downplay the pandemic, 40,919 people have died. Infections have increased by more than 40% in 21 US states this week, as the effects of relaxed restrictions start to be felt. New Zealand is relaxing its borders to grant exemptions for certain workers and partners of New Zealand citizens to enter the country. The relaxed rules, which will see America\u2019s Cup sailors included, come after 21 days with no new Covid-19 cases across the country and no current live cases. Health officials have said the virus would be considered eliminated after 28 days of no new cases. Tokyo is poised to end all restrictions on businesses next week and karaoke venues, game arcades and pachinko parlours were set to reopen today on Friday. Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, said the city had entered \u201ca new stage of living with the coronavirus,\u201d adding that authorities would expand testing and ensure medical facilities were able to cope with a resurgence of the virus, which is known to have infected more than 17,000 people in Japan and killed 922. Japanese \u201cnon-regular\u201d workers posted its biggest drop on record in April, declining by 970,000 to 2.02 million. Women accounted for 710,000 of the decline. Many of Japan\u2019s women, many women lack the job security of male workers, with more than half holding vulnerable part-time, contract or temporary jobs. Fujifilm Holdings Corp will spend $928m to double capacity at a drug manufacturing facility in Denmark, which it has pledged to use in producing Covid-19 treatments, as the Japanese company steps up its pivot towards healthcare, Reuters reports. Fu Xuejie, the wife of Dr Li Wenliang, has given birth to their son. Li was praised as a whistleblower in China, and made headlines earlier this year after he was reprimanded for warning colleagues about the emergence of a new Sars-like virus. Li later contracted the virus himself, and died in hospital on 6 February. Fu told local news she had given birth to a boy earlier this morning, describing him as \u201cthe last gift\u201d Li gave her. \u201cMy husband, can you see us from heaven?\u201d Fu wrote on her WeChat account on Friday morning. \u201cThe last gift you gave me was born today \u2013 I will work hard to love and protect them.\u201d China is seeking volunteers who work at state-owned companies and are traveling overseas to test two potential vaccines, Reuters is reporting. There is no proven vaccine for the coronavirus yet, although many are in the works and mass trials for some are expected to be underway soon. A vaccine normally has to go through large-scale \u201cphase 3\u201d trials to observe to what extent they provide protection against infection before receiving regulatory approval. That ideally requires exposing people in a real-life environment with relatively high infection risk. Two vaccine candidates being developed in China are being tested on more than 1,000 people each, and employees of state-owned firms can volunteer. The vaccines are among five candidates currently in Chinese clinical trials which showed \u201cno distinct adverse reaction\u201d in the first two phases of human trials. Vaccinating people travelling abroad, especially those going to high-risk areas, is one option for conducting a Phase 3 trial, Zhu Fengcai, deputy director of a local branch of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told financial media service Caixin in April. Other candidate vaccines currently in phase two are also seeking volunteers, South China Morning Post reported this week. In Beijing, a 52-year-old man who has no history of traveling outside the city or contact with anyone coming in has been diagnosed with Covid-19. He is the first local transmission case in China for several weeks. The man lives in Xicheng District. On Wednesday he visited a clinic reporting an intermittent fever, chills and fatigue. He had no other symptoms, and had no relevant travel or contact history in the past two weeks. On Thursday the vice-mayor of Xicheng district told media the man had worn a mask and traveled alone to the hospital. He was one of seven new cases reported in mainland China. The other six, including five people in Shanghai and one in Fujian, were all imported. Mainland China currently has 65 confirmed cases in the country. Four people were discharged on Thursday, according to the national health commission. Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian: New Zealand is relaxing its borders to grant exemptions for certain workers \u2013 including America\u2019s Cup sailors \u2013 and partners of New Zealand citizens to enter the country. The move comes after 21 days with no new Covid-19 cases across the country and no current live cases. Health officials have said the virus would be considered eliminated after 28 days of no new cases. The most significant border rule change, to be enacted from the end of next week, removes the requirement for partners and dependents of New Zealand citizens and residents to travel together to return home. It also establishes new \u201cessential worker\u201d rules, aimed at bringing \u201chigh-value workers\u201d for \u201cprojects of national or regional significance\u201d into the country. This means exemptions will be granted for two America\u2019s Cup sailing challengers who will compete against Emirates Team New Zealand in March 2021. On Thursday, Tokyo reported 22 new infections, with the daily figure staying below 20 over the previous four days. Of the 22, six were connected to nightclubs and similar establishments, while 10 had unidentified transmission routes, according to the Kyodo news agency. The city has reported a total of 5,448 infections, by far the highest among Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures. The Tokyo alert, announced on 2 June, advises the city\u2019s 14 million residents to exercise caution and will be reissued if cases average 20 or more for seven days in a row, if officials are unable to trace infection routes for more than half of the new cases, or if the total number of infections rises from one week to the next. Establishments where it is difficult to avoid the \u201cthree Cs\u201d \u2013 closed spaces, crowded places and close contact \u2013 are expected to reopen on 19 June. They include live music venues and host and hostess clubs where close contact between employees and customers has been blamed for recent Covid clusters in the capital\u2019s entertainment districts. In addition, restaurants will be allowed to stay open beyond midnight. Japan\u2019s seven-week state of emergency, which was lifted in late May, requested that businesses close or reduce their hours, but authorities did not have the legal powers to enforce the restrictions or punish those that refused to comply. Tokyo is poised to end all restrictions on businesses next week after local authorities lifted a citywide \u201cred alert\u201d warning about a possible second wave of coronavirus infections. Karaoke venues, game arcades and pachinko parlors will reopen today (Friday), and restaurants and pubs will be able to extend their hours from 10 pm to midnight, according to Japanese media reports. Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, said the city had entered \u201ca new stage of living with the coronavirus,\u201d adding that authorities would expand testing and ensure medical facilities were able to cope with a resurgence of the virus, which is known to have infected more than 17,000 people in Japan and killed 922. Koike said the number of new daily cases and unidentified transmission routes had stabilised, enabling the city to take another step towards resuming its economic and social life. South Africa accounts for nearly 25% of Africa\u2019s total cases. \u201cThe majority of countries still have fewer than 1,000 reported cases,\u201d said Doctor Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa. \u201cThere is community transmission in more than 50% of countries, however.\u201d Meanwhile more than 70% of the deaths have occurred in just five countries: South Africa, Algeria, Nigeria, Egypt and Sudan. Moeti said that while it was possible that some asymptomatic and mild cases were going undetected, WHO Africa believed that large numbers of severe cases and deaths were not being missed on the continent. Africa\u2019s relatively young population compared to other continents, and in-built experience of dealing with disease outbreaks have been cited as reasons why Africa has not so far seen the death rates experienced on other continents. The speed the new coronavirus jumped from 100,000 to 200,000 confirmed cases in Africa shows just how quickly the pandemic is accelerating on the continent, the World Health Organization said Thursday. According to an AFP tally, Africa topped the 200,000 mark on Tuesday. \u201cIt took 98 days to reach the first 100,000 cases, and only 18 days to move to 200,000 cases,\u201d Doctor Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, told a video briefing hosted by the UN press association in Geneva. \u201cEven though these cases in Africa account for less than three percent of the global total, it\u2019s clear that the pandemic is accelerating.\u201d Africa has reached 5,635 deaths from 210,519 confirmed cases, according to AFP\u2019s count at 11.00 GMT on Thursday. In Africa, \u201cthe pandemic is still concentrated in and around capital cities but we are seeing more and more cases spread out into the provinces,\u201d Moeti said. She said that in most countries on the continent, the virus entered capitals through international flights from Europe. There are 7,500,777 confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 420,993 known deaths so far. The true figures for deaths and infections are likely to be significantly higher due to time delays, differing testing rates and definitions, and suspected underreporting. The US, with more than 2 million cases and 113,803 deaths, is by far the worst-affected country worldwide in terms of number of cases and deaths. Brazil has the next highest known number of cases, with 802,828, and deaths nearing 41,000. Here are the ten countries with the highest number of infections: US: 2,022,488 Brazil: 802,828 Russia: 501,800 United Kingdom: 292,860 India: 286,605 Spain: 242,707 Italy: 236,142 Peru: 214,788 France: 192,493 Germany: 186,691 Please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The White House is exploring the possibility that travel from Mexico may be contributing to a new wave of coronavirus infections, rather than states moves toward reopening their economies, AP reports. The notion was discussed at some length Thursday during a meeting of the administrations coronavirus task force in the White House Situation Room that focused on identifying commonalities between new outbreaks. Officials also considered how to surge response capabilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was deploying teams to Arizona and other hotspots to try to trace the outbreaks and contain them. In addition to Arizona, other states experiencing recent spikes of infections include California, Texas and North Carolina particularly within the Hispanic community. As a result, the task force is looking at whether those spikes may be tied to legal travel between the US and Mexico, which is experiencing an ongoing severe coronavirus outbreak. Two officials familiar with the discussions described them to The Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly describe internal conversations. Millions of children could be pushed into work by the coronavirus crisis, the UN said Friday as it braced for the first rise in child labour in two decades. In a joint brief, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF, the UN children\u2019s agency, noted that the number of children locked in child labour had declined by 94 million since 2000. But the UN agencies warned that \u201cthe Covid-19 pandemic poses very real risks of backtracking.\u201d Friday\u2019s report pointed out that the crisis would likely cause a significant rise in poverty. According to the World Bank, the number of people in extreme poverty could potentially skyrocket by up to 60 million this year alone. \u201cAs the pandemic wreaks havoc on family incomes, without support, many could resort to child labour,\u201d ILO chief Guy Ryder said in a statement. The relation between swelling poverty and a surge in child labour appears clear, the report said, pointing to studies from some countries indicating that a one-percent increase in poverty leads to at least a 0.7% rise in child labour. The report also stressed that the crisis could push children already working to put in longer hours under worsening conditions. Others could be forced into the worst forms of labour, seriously threatening their health and safety, it said. Fujifilm Holdings Corp will spend $928m to double capacity at a drug manufacturing facility in Denmark, which it has pledged to use in producing Covid-19 treatments, as the Japanese company steps up its pivot towards healthcare, Reuters reports. The investment in Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies will expand production lines for bulk drug substances and antibody drugs, Fujifilm announced on Tuesday. It bought the facility in Hillerod, Denmark, in August from Biogen Inc for about $890m. Fujifilm previously announced that the Denmark site would offer future manufacturing capacity to the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to speed-up the response to the global pandemic. It is an initiative launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and two other large charities, aimed at accelerating drug development and identifying a promising Covid-19 therapeutic candidate based on efficacy and safety data demonstrated in clinical trials. Fujifilm\u2019s pharma arm is testing its own anti-flu drug Avigan as a treatment for Covid-19. The company aims to achieve \u200e\u00a5\u200e100bn ($928.68m) in sales in its bio-CDMO business by the fiscal year ending March 2022. Fujifilm shares rose 0.7% in Tokyo versus a 0.2% gain in the broader market. US president Donald Trump has implemented a policy that states rally attendees cannot sue the campaign or venue if they contract coronavirus at the event, the New York Times reports: \u2018By clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to Covid-19 exists in any public place where people are present,\u2019 a statement on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign website informed those wishing to attend his June 19 rally in Tulsa, Okla. \u2018By attending the rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors or volunteers liable for any illness or injury.\u2019 \u2018China\u2019s lifeblood\u2019: street hawkers make surprise return to fire up ailing economy On a quiet street corner in a neighbourhood in Beijing known for families and retirees, Xue Min, 22 a recent graduate, swats her legs, fighting off mosquitoes, as she encourages passersby to browse the earrings and scrunchies she has laid out on a cloth, surrounded by fairy lights. \u201cHave a look,\u201d she says brightly to a couple that pause briefly before moving on. Just before 10pm, two men arrive with a food cart - a gas stove, wok, and counter, attached to a motorbike and begin to prep their menu of fried rice and noodles. Xue and her neighbour, a woman selling books, toothbrushes and trinkets from abroad, murmur and watch with expectation. Business might pick up a little now. Soon, more people begin to stop. Two young men, carrying a bag of cans of beer, browse the books. One picks up a translation of Pride and Prejudice before opting for a collection of stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The other buys a journal. Meng, 35, one of the food stall owners, calls to delivery drivers as they stop their electric bikes by the curb: \u201cHey big brother, what will it be?\u201d It is a scene that should belong to another time, when Beijing\u2019s sidewalks were often crowded with hawkers selling local street food and a surprisingly diverse selection of daily necessities \u2013 socks, flatware, DVDs, text books, lingerie and pets. Street vendors have come to be viewed as backwards and poor, pushed out by many city authorities in an effort to modernise the country\u2019s urban centres. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has long made creating jobs for women central to his economic policy, but now women are suffering a bigger share of the pain as the country heads for its worst economic slump since World War Two, Reuters reports. Helped by a worker shortage, female labour participation hit a decade-high of more than 70% under Abe\u2019s campaign, often dubbed \u201cWomenomics\u201d. The catch: many women lack the job security of male workers, with more than half holding vulnerable part-time, contract or temporary jobs. The number of such \u201cnon-regular\u201d workers posted its biggest drop on record in April, declining by 970,000 to 2.02 million. Women accounted for 710,000 of the decline. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported 4,790 new confirmed coronavirus infections along with 587 additional fatalities on Thursday, bringing the total in the country to 133,974 cases and 15,944 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the official count. In the UK, local authorities have called on the government to suspend the controversial \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d immigration status for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, to prevent thousands from falling into destitution and homelessness. High numbers of people who have this status attached to their visas have been approaching councils for emergency assistance during the pandemic. Many are struggling to survive during the exceptional circumstances of lockdown, with no safety net, according to the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the UK have an immigration status that allows them to work here, but which prevents them from accessing most benefits should they become unemployed. Many have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to feed their families and pay rent. Many face losing their homes once restrictions on evictions are lifted. Brazil reported a total of 802,828 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, with 30,412 new infections in the last 24 hours in the world\u2019s second worst outbreak after the United States. With another 1,239 fatalities, the death toll in Brazil has reached 40,919, the health ministry said, the world\u2019s third highest after the United States and the UK. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on Wall Street as coronavirus cases in the US increased again, deflating recent optimism for a quick economic recovery and raising more doubts about how long the market\u2019s scorching comeback can last, AP reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 1,800 points, almost 7%, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 5.9%, its worst day since mid-March, when stocks went through repeated harrowing falls as the virus lockdowns began. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 44.5% between late March and Monday, erasing most of its losses tied to the pandemic. The selling comes as coronavirus cases rise in the US, with some of the increase likely tied to the reopening of businesses and the lifting of stay-at-home orders. Cases are climbing in nearly half the states, according to an Associated Press analysis, a worrying trend that could intensify as people return to work and venture out during the summer. Investor optimism for a speedy recovery was also dimmed by the Federal Reserve, which warned Wednesday that the road to recovery from the worst downturn in decades would be long and vowed to keep rates low for the foreseeable future. Those factors, along with the recent run-up in stock prices, set the stage for the wave of selling Thursday. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

Stocks fell sharply Thursday on Wall Street as coronavirus cases in the US increased again, deflating recent optimism for a quick economic recovery and raising more doubts about how long the market\u2019s scorching comeback can last. The DOW Jones Industrial Average saw its worst day in weeks, closing down almost 7%. At a press conference on Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell spoke of second wave fears, warning, \u201cIt could hurt the recovery, even if you don\u2019t have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people\u2019s confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not be a positive development.\u201d Powell said US unemployment could remain at levels close to the worst of the GFC at the end of the year, and that a second outbreak could mean that figure was optimistic. Global cases near 7.5 million. There are currently 7,449,476 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 418,846 deaths. Brazil reported a total of 802,828 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, with 30,412 new infections in the last 24 hours in the world\u2019s second worst outbreak after the United States.With another 1,239 fatalities, the death toll in Brazil has reached 40,919, the health ministry said, the world\u2019s third highest after the United States and the UK. Brazilian officials have announced an agreement with China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech to produce its coronavirus vaccine in Sao Paulo, where tests involving 9,000 volunteers are to begin next month. More than a third of employees in some towns in Britain have been furloughed due to coronavirus, according to figures that also reveal the government\u2019s job retention scheme has now cost almost \u00a320bn. British Airways plans to sell some of its multi-million-pound art collection in an effort to help it through the pandemic. The collection includes pieces by Damien Hirst, Bridget Riley and Peter Doig with one work believed to have been valued at more than \u00a31 million.It is understood at least 10 pieces have been identified for sale by the airline. In Australia, only one of the six commissioners on Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s Covid-19 commission has volunteered to release their conflicts of interest, prompting calls for greater transparency from the publicly funded body. The Australian government has refused to release the conflict-of-interest declarations for members of its National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC), a prominent advisory body shaping non-health aspects of the Covid-19 strategy. Almost half of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers detected in Bahrain were found to pose a risk of spreading the virus to others, according to research by the country\u2019s coronavirus taskforce. Deaths from Covid-19 in Italy climbed by 53 on Thursday against 71 the day before, Reuters reports, citing the country\u2019s civil protection agency, pushing the total to death toll from the outbreak to 34,167. European Union officials and experts have said that Europe could face a surge of coronavirus infections in coming weeks as a result of the mass anti-racism protests that have spread across the continent. 10 countries account for nearly 75% of new cases - WHO. Nearly three-quarters of new cases of coronavirus are coming from 10 countries, mostly concentrated in the Americas and south Asia, the director general of the World Health Organization has said.Speaking at the UN health agency\u2019s member state briefing on Thursday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the global situation was deteriorating, even as Europe appeared to be over the worst of the outbreak.",

The executive officer of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Brynn O\u2019Brien, said she had been contacted by investors concerned about BHP\u2019s Aboriginal heritage track record long before Guardian Australia revealed it had received permission to destroy sites in the expansion of its South Flank mine.</p> <p>Rio Tinto and BHP are considered peers in the industry, O\u2019Brien said.</p> <p>\u201cBHP would be very, very unwise to ignore this backlash.\u201d</p> <p>But their conduct has been perfectly legal. Both companies received ministerial consent order to destroy the sites under WA\u2019s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws.</p> <p>The Aboriginal Heritage Act was introduced in 1972 to protect \u201csacred or otherwise culturally significant\u201d sites from destruction by the mining and pastoral industries. It developed a process for registering sites, making it illegal to discover a site and not notify the government.</p> <p>Section 18 allows mining companies and other landholders to apply for ministerial permission to destroy Aboriginal heritage. It does not give traditional owners a right of appeal or even a right of reply.</p> <p>In many cases, as with BHP, the registration of sites and permission to destroy them is sought in a single application. The Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee (ACMC) makes a recommendation to the Aboriginal affairs minister, who grants consent for a site to be destroyed.</p> <p>Between 1 July 2010 and 1 March 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/30/juukan-gorge-rio-tinto-blasting-of-aboriginal-site-prompts-calls-to-change-antiquated-laws\">the ACMC considered 463 section 18 applications from mining companies.

Which is unusual. Normally when there is a concern around upcoming activity around heritage sites I do get contacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation.

Wyatt told parliament that the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage held a pre-arranged meeting with advisers for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people (PKKP) four days before the blast. It told the PKKP advisors there was no way to revoke the section 18 approval, and called Rio Tinto after the meeting. But Wyatt repeated that he was not aware of concerns until after the site was destroyed.</p> <p>Federal Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt, also a Yamatji man and cousin to his West Australian counterpart, admitted lawyers from the PKKP contacted his office on 20 May, seeking an injunction under federal laws.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/31/rio-tinto-apologises-to-traditional-owners-after-blasting-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site\">Rio Tinto apologises to traditional owners after blasting 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wyatt referred them to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has carriage of the federal Aboriginal heritage protection act.

      "bodyText": "Calls are growing for an immediate halt to mining operations in the Pilbara that have been approved under Western Australia\u2019s \u201carchaic\u201d Aboriginal heritage laws and the Senate will hold an urgent inquiry, as international outrage from investors pushes big mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP into damage control. On Thursday, Guardian Australia revealed that BHP Billiton was poised to destroy at least 40 significant Aboriginal sites in the central Pilbara to expand its A$4.5bn South Flank iron-ore mine, even though it was aware the traditional owners are deeply opposed to the move. By day\u2019s end, following public outcry, the company said it would not go ahead without \u201cfurther extensive consultation\u201d with the traditional owners, the Banjima people. The mounting backlash against mining companies for their destruction of Aboriginal heritage grew after Rio Tinto\u2019s destruction of a 46,000-year-old heritage site at Juukan Gorge last month, and their actions have been compared by shareholder groups to widespread bad conduct in the financial services sector before the banking royal commission. Rio Tinto\u2019s global chief, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, made his first public comment on the issue on Friday, saying \u201cwe are very sorry for the distress we have caused the PKKP in relation to Juukan Gorge and our first priority remains rebuilding trust with the PKKP.\u201d The apology came after Rio\u2019s chairman held meetings in London this week to explain their actions to major shareholders. Among them were Aberdeen Standard International (ASI), its seventh-largest shareholder, which said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d. \u201cThe reports on BHP\u2019s activities are also deeply concerning to ASI, and we will similarly be reaching out to BHP to discuss these reports,\u201d said ASI\u2019s Danielle Welsh-Rose. Welsh-Rose said investors should expect companies to go beyond their legal obligations, particularly when local laws fall short of international standards or community expectations. \u201cIn a situation like this, mining companies will face reputational risk as well as the likelihood of being downgraded on ESG factors such as governance, oversight and community relations,\u201d she said. \u201cESG factors\u201d are the environmental, social and governance values of its investments. Even Australian Super, which is notoriously quiet on matters of ESG, told Guardian Australia it was \u201cvery concerned about this situation\u201d and had twice engaged with Rio Tinto about it. This week, Rio Tinto was also stripped of its partner status with Reconciliation Australia. Reconciliation Australia wrote to all its partner organisations, including BHP, \u201cregarding our expectations on the standards we expect of them as partners and what constitutes respectful relationships, including organisations who operate under WA heritage laws\u201d. On Tuesday, about 300 people joined a protest led by Noongar elders outside Rio Tinto\u2019s offices. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, asked protesters to \u201cexpress yourselves in other ways\u201d than gathering during the coronavirus pandemic, even though most wore face masks. \u201cThe approvals for [Rio] were granted in 2013, we didn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d McGowan told reporters. But concerns about mining in the Pilbara have been around for years. The executive officer of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Brynn O\u2019Brien, said she had been contacted by investors concerned about BHP\u2019s Aboriginal heritage track record long before Guardian Australia revealed it had received permission to destroy sites in the expansion of its South Flank mine. Rio Tinto and BHP are considered peers in the industry, O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBHP would be very, very unwise to ignore this backlash.\u201d But their conduct has been perfectly legal. Both companies received ministerial consent order to destroy the sites under WA\u2019s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws. The Aboriginal Heritage Act was introduced in 1972 to protect \u201csacred or otherwise culturally significant\u201d sites from destruction by the mining and pastoral industries. It developed a process for registering sites, making it illegal to discover a site and not notify the government. Section 18 allows mining companies and other landholders to apply for ministerial permission to destroy Aboriginal heritage. It does not give traditional owners a right of appeal or even a right of reply. In many cases, as with BHP, the registration of sites and permission to destroy them is sought in a single application. The Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee (ACMC) makes a recommendation to the Aboriginal affairs minister, who grants consent for a site to be destroyed. Between 1 July 2010 and 1 March 2020, the ACMC considered 463 section 18 applications from mining companies. None were refused. In BHP\u2019s case, permission was granted four days after news broke of Rio Tinto\u2019s detonation at Juukan Gorge. On May 28, the WA minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, a Yamatji man, said he had not known about Juukan Gorge until after the blast happened. He told reporters: \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know. Which is unusual. Normally when there is a concern around upcoming activity around heritage sites I do get contacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation. The first I heard about this was after the explosion. But it has emerged that his department was aware. Wyatt told parliament that the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage held a pre-arranged meeting with advisers for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people (PKKP) four days before the blast. It told the PKKP advisors there was no way to revoke the section 18 approval, and called Rio Tinto after the meeting. But Wyatt repeated that he was not aware of concerns until after the site was destroyed. Federal Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt, also a Yamatji man and cousin to his West Australian counterpart, admitted lawyers from the PKKP contacted his office on 20 May, seeking an injunction under federal laws. Wyatt referred them to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has carriage of the federal Aboriginal heritage protection act. Wyatt told the ABC this week the PKKP lawyers did contact Ley, but \u201cby then it was too late\u201d. His office did not follow-up with Ley until after the sites were destroyed. \u201cBut we have to watch every other site that exists within that Pilbara region and I would urge elders to make sure that they check on those sites to ensure that there is no further damage done in the Pilbara, because some of those other sites are 60,000 years plus old,\u201d he said. On Friday, the Senate agreed to take a look at all states and territories, where Aboriginal heritage is poorly protected under the law. \u201cThis is a very significant outcome,\u201d Labor\u2019s Linda Burney said on Friday. \u201cWe believe that the resources industry is incredibly important to the Australian economy, and we want to see better practices. \u201cWe also make the point very strongly that Aboriginal cultural heritage, as pointed out by Unesco two weeks ago, is the heritage of all Australians.\u201d But WA Labor senator Pat Dodson went further, calling for a moratorium on the granting of section 18s until WA amends the act. \u201cAnd if that holds up production, well that\u2019s a question for the minister to be getting on with these consultations and trying to improve the legislation,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cIt\u2019s an archaic act, the minister makes that admission himself. He\u2019s been trying to amend this for two years or so. There\u2019s gonna be another election before he gets around to introducing a new bill. So, in the meantime, you just cannot have the status quo position prevail. \u201cI cant tell the state what to do, but, you know, there\u2019s got to be some fairness for First Nations peoples.\u201d A long way from machinations in Perth and Canberra, the Banjima traditional owners found themselves in the media spotlight this week, unable to comment specifically due to their agreement with BHP, and reeling from the sudden loss of a beloved senior elder. But in a statement they said: \u201cAs a matter of lore and culture shared with other traditional owners across Australia and the world, the Banjima people do not support the destruction of sites of cultural significance. \u201cWe stand with all Aboriginal traditional owners and particularly our Pilbara brothers and sisters, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura, at this time in our abhorrence at the destruction of the Juukan rock shelters, and those suffering the threat of or having recently experienced similar site destruction.\u201d The Senate inquiry is due to report by 30 September.",

Cuomo also announced an executive order requiring local officials to enact plans to modernize policing strategies in order to be eligible for state funding.</li> \n   <li><strong>A leading prison abolitionist pushed back against attempts to respond to protests by passing police reforms. </strong>\u201cWe can\u2019t reform the police,\u201d Mariame Kaba <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html?referringSource=articleShare\">argued in the New York Times</a>. \u201cThe only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police.</li> \n   <li><strong>A growing number of American companies say they will observe Juneteenth as an official holiday this year, </strong>giving employees a paid day off in honor of the abolition of slavery in the United States. <strong> </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Pop star Taylor Swift demanded Tennessee remove monuments to white supremacy, </strong>as police in Georgia jailed a 55-year-old woman who wrote \u201ctear down\u201d on a Confederate statue in chalk. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee416588f08e3e3b74b551c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-13T00:03:48.225Z\">1.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Leading prison abolitionist: \u2018Yes, we mean literally abolish the police\u2019</h2> \n  <p>As Democratic politicians and media pundits discuss how to interpret the furious demand from protesters across the country to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d longtime prison industrial complex abolitionist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prisonculture\">Mariame Kaba</a> has a response in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html?referringSource=articleShare\">New York Times</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> <em>Congressional Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/democrats-police-misconduct-bill-protests.html\">want</a> to make it easier to identify and prosecute police misconduct; Joe Biden wants to give police departments <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/10/biden-root-out-systemic-racism-not-just-divisive-trump-talk-column/5327631002/\">$300 million</a>.

\u201cThe Room Where It Happened,\u201d the former administration official \u201cargues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump\u2019s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy <strong>\u2014 </strong>and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bolton also criticizes the president for focusing solely on his chances of reelection as he made major policy decisions. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by reelection calculations,\u201d he writes. </p> \n  <p>The book will be released June 23, and if

      "bodyText": "Live reporting continues in Saturday\u2019s blog: We\u2019re wrapping up our live coverage for tonight. An updated recap of some of today\u2019s political news: Trump said he was \u201cgenerally\u201d in favor of banning police chokeholds but said they may be appropriate in some circumstances. \u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview, before addressing how they have been unfairly used against people like George Floyd, who was killed in police custody last month. \u201cIt would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended,\u201d Trump said. The Trump administration has finalized a rule rolling back Obama-era protections for transgender Americans. The new policy could allow healthcare providers and insurance companies that receive federal funding to refuse to provide or cover transition-related care for transgender patients. Human Rights Campaign, among others, have pledged to file a lawsuit challenging the rule change. Seattle\u2019s mayor defended the city against Trump\u2019s fear mongering over the activists who are currently occupying a few city blocks as a police-free zone they have dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. \u201cSeattle is fine,\u201d she said. The Minneapolis city council unanimously passed a resolution to replace the city\u2019s police department with a community-led public safety system in response to the killing of Floyd. The resolution, which comes days after a veto-proof majority of the council voted to disband the police department, will kick off a year-long process to devise a new public safety system. New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed police reform bills passed by the state legislature this week. The bills will criminalize police chokeholds and repeal 50-A, which shielded police misconduct records from the public. Cuomo also announced an executive order requiring local officials to enact plans to modernize policing strategies in order to be eligible for state funding. A leading prison abolitionist pushed back against attempts to respond to protests by passing police reforms. \u201cWe can\u2019t reform the police,\u201d Mariame Kaba argued in the New York Times. \u201cThe only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police. A growing number of American companies say they will observe Juneteenth as an official holiday this year, giving employees a paid day off in honor of the abolition of slavery in the United States. Pop star Taylor Swift demanded Tennessee remove monuments to white supremacy, as police in Georgia jailed a 55-year-old woman who wrote \u201ctear down\u201d on a Confederate statue in chalk. Leading prison abolitionist: \u2018Yes, we mean literally abolish the police\u2019 As Democratic politicians and media pundits discuss how to interpret the furious demand from protesters across the country to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d longtime prison industrial complex abolitionist Mariame Kaba has a response in the New York Times: Congressional Democrats want to make it easier to identify and prosecute police misconduct; Joe Biden wants to give police departments $300 million. But efforts to solve police violence through liberal reforms like these have failed for nearly a century. Enough. We can\u2019t reform the police. The only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police... When people, especially white people, consider a world without the police, they envision a society as violent as our current one, merely without law enforcement \u2014 and they shudder. As a society, we have been so indoctrinated with the idea that we solve problems by policing and caging people that many cannot imagine anything other than prisons and the police as solutions to violence and harm. People like me who want to abolish prisons and police, however, have a vision of a different society, built on cooperation instead of individualism, on mutual aid instead of self-preservation. What would the country look like if it had billions of extra dollars to spend on housing, food and education for all? This change in society wouldn\u2019t happen immediately, but the protests show that many people are ready to embrace a different vision of safety and justice. Suicide help line calls up 20% in Mississippi during pandemic Officials in Mississippi say calls from people in the state to the national Suicide Prevention Lifeline have increased 20% since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the Associated Press reports. \u201cThere is fear, there is pain and there is anxiety in this country and in our state and those cannot be overstated,\u201d Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said at a press conference. \u2022 In the US the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. \u2022 In the UK and Irish Republic contact Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. \u2022 In Australia the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. \u2022 Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. Woman held on $1,500 bail for writing on Confederate statue with chalk A 55-year-old woman was arrested in Georgia yesterday for writing \u201ctear down\u201d in yellow chalk on a confederate statue, the Associated Press reports. Georgia state troopers have charged the woman \u201cwith interference with government property, a felony, and criminal trespass, a misdemeanor,\u201d and jail records indicated that she was still in jail Friday after being arrested on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Her bail was set at $1,500. \u201cDude, it\u2019s chalk,\u201d protest organizer JJ Nicole told the Associated Press. \u201cTake a wet rag and wipe it off.... Surely there\u2019s better things to do with our resources. Per usual, the police response was 10 times more than what it needed to be.\u201d Jamie Loughner, the woman who was arrested for writing on a statue with chalk, uses a walker, Nicole said, and about 10 officers came out of the statecapitol to arrest her. Seattle mayor to Trump: \u2018Don\u2019t be so afraid of democracy\u2019 A federal judge has ordered Seattle police to temporarily stop using tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bang devices to break up largely peaceful protests, the Associated Press reported. Meanwhile, as Trump continues to fearmonger over Twitter about the hundreds of protesters who have occupied several city blocks in Seattle and dubbed them a police-free \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\u201d Seattle\u2019s mayor has responded that \u201cSeattle is fine.\u201d The autonomous zone \u201chas both a protest and street fair vibe, with a small garden, medic station, smoking area, and a \u201cNo Cop Co-op\u201d, where people can get supplies and food at no cost,\u201d Hallie Golden reported for The Guardian yesterday. One activist said the takeover was reminiscent of the Occupy movement. Daily Beast reporter Kelly Weill also noted that claims that local businesses were being harmed by the takeover had been walked back, and that many local business owners were quite supportive of \u201cCHAZ,\u201d although one feared that it might distract attention from the key demands of the Black Lives Matter movement. North Carolina man arrested for threatening to burn black church A 63-year-old white man in North Carolina was arrested today after allegedly threatening to set fire to an African-American church in Virginia, according to federal officials. John Malcolm Bareswill made a phone call to an African American church on June 7, saying \u201cyou [racial slur] need to shut up,\u201d the Justice Department said in a press release. The call was placed \u201cseveral days after one of the church\u2019s leaders took part in a public prayer vigil and peaceful demonstration for George Floyd,\u201d the Justice Department said. The call, made late in the morning to the church\u2019s land line telephone, \u201cwas placed on speakerphone and overheard by two adult members of the church and also several children,\u201d officials said. Bareswill was charged with making a telephonic threat, and faces a maximum penalty of ten years in prison. Taylor Swift calls for removal of racist monuments in Tennessee White pop star Taylor Swift is calling for Tennessee to remove statues commemorating \u201cracist historical figures\u201d like Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest. \u201cVillains don\u2019t deserve statues,\u201d the singer-songwriter argued in a long Twitter thread explaining why the statues must be removed, and why Americans like black investigative journalist activist Ida B. Wells should be honored instead. \u201cWhen you fight to honor racists, you show black Tennesseans and all of their allies where you stand, and you continue this cycle of hurt,\u201d Swift advised fellow white Americans. \u201cYou can\u2019t change history, but you can change this.\u201d In an interview with The Guardian last August, responding to a question about what critics called a narrative of \u201cwhite victimhood\u201d throughout her music career, Swift said that she was trying to recognize her own \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s something that I\u2019m still trying to educate myself on every day.\u201d Swift\u2019s tweets have garnered some positive reactions. As one progressive organizer on Twitter quipped: Human Rights Campaign will sue Trump administration over erasing healthcare discrimination protection for trans people The Human Rights Campaign announced it will file a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end healthcare discrimination protections for Americans based on their gender identity. By rewriting an Obama-administration interpretation of a federal healthcare law, the Trump administration \u201cwill eliminate explicit protections from discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender identity... thereby sanctioning discrimination against LGBTQ people in health care programs and activities,\u201d the Human Rights Campaign said in a statement. Vox journalist Katelyn Burns highlighted the immediate, seriously effects of the Trump administration\u2019s new rule: More companies recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday this year This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live politics coverage from our West Coast office in Oakland. The Washington Post and the New York Times will both observe Juneteenth as a holiday this year, and give employees a paid day off, reporters at the two major newspapers tweeted this afternoon. The announcement comes as both newspapers, and the American media industry more broadly, has been pushed to reckon with the decades of discrimination that black employees have faced within majority-white newsrooms. Current and former black journalists have been speaking out about about the hostile newsroom environments they have faced, and about how widespread racism within the media has pushed some black journalists out of the business, while continuing to undermine accurate coverage of issues crucial to black Americans, including police violence. Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan said the holiday \u201cwas an appropriate and symbolic moment to provide time for reflection on all that has happened.\u201d Juneteenth, the oldest nationally celebrated day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, was created by black Texans in the 1860s. It celebrates June 19, 1865, when formerly enslaved people in Texas were finally told by Union troops that they were free. Widely celebrated by black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the holiday was revived in the Civil Rights era, and first became an official state holiday in Texas in 1979. Other companies, including Vox Media, Twitter and Square had already announced that they would be observing Juneteenth as a holiday this year. Update: since this post was first published, Guardian US informed staff that we, too will be observing Juneteenth as a holiday this year, and that \u201cWe will be marking Juneteenth in this way annually.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said he was \u201cgenerally\u201d in favor of banning police chokeholds but said they may be appropriate in some circumstances. \u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview, before addressing how they have been unfairly used against people like George Floyd, who was killed in police custody last month. \u201cIt would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended,\u201d Trump said. The Trump administration has finalized a rule rolling back Obama-era protections for transgender Americans. The new policy could allow healthcare providers and insurance companies that receive federal funding to refuse to provide or cover transition-related care for transgender patients. The Minneapolis city council unanimously passed a resolution to replace the city\u2019s police department with a community-led public safety system in response to the killing of Floyd. The resolution, which comes days after a veto-proof majority of the council voted to disband the police department, will kick off a year-long process to devise a new public safety system. New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed police reform bills passed by the state legislature this week. The bills will criminalize police chokeholds and repeal 50-A, which shielded police misconduct records from the public. Cuomo also announced an executive order requiring local officials to enact plans to modernize policing strategies in order to be eligible for state funding. John Bolton\u2019s upcoming book will detail \u201cUkraine-like transgressions\u201d by Trump, according to a new press release. In the book, which will be released June 23, the former national security adviser \u201cargues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump\u2019s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy.\u201d Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Trump administration has finalized a rule rolling back Obama-era protections for transgender Americans under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s non-discrimination policy. According to the new version of the policy, the department of health and human services will be \u201creturning to the government\u2019s interpretation of sex discrimination according to the plain meaning of the word \u2018sex\u2019 as male or female and as determined by biology.\u201d This would allow healthcare providers and insurance companies that receive federal funding to refuse to provide or cover transition-related care for transgender Americans. The announcement came on the fourth anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting, when a shooter killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. House majority whip Jim Clyburn said Democrats already have enough votes to pass their Justice in Policing Act, which includes a series of police reforms in response to the killing of George Floyd. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has complained Republicans were excluded from the drafting process of the bill, but he also said there are a number of provisions in the bill that his caucus could support. McCarthy specifically said he would be in favor of a national ban on police chokeholds, which is part of the Democrats\u2019 legislation. However, even if the House approves the bill, it will still need to pass the Republican-controlled Senate, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell will not likely be eager to take up the Democratic bill in its current form. McConnell has tapped senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, to lead a group of several senators working to develop their own police reform proposal. As Trump prepares to resume his campaign rallies and George Floyd protests continue across the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d attendees of large gatherings to wear cloth face coverings in newly issued guidance. According to the guidance, \u201cCloth face coverings are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voice (e.g., shouting, chanting, singing).\u201d Speaking to reporters about the new guidance, Jay Butler, the CDC\u2019s deputy director for Infectious Diseases, dodged questions about what specific events the agency was referring to. \u201cThey are not regulations. They are not commands,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut they are recommendations or even suggestions \u2026 how you can have a gathering that will keep people as safe as possible.\u201d The guidance comes as the Trump campaign asks attendees of the president\u2019s rally in Tulsa next Friday to sign waivers saying they \u201cvoluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19.\u201d The list of Joe Biden\u2019s potential running mates has dwindled to a handful of Democratic women, according to the Associated Press. The AP reports: Democrats with knowledge of the process said Biden\u2019s search committee has narrowed the choices to as few as six serious contenders after initial interviews. Those still in contention include Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, as well as Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. The process remains somewhat fluid, according to those with knowledge, and additional candidates may still be asked to submit to the extensive document review process now underway for top contenders. ... The campaign\u2019s short list includes several black women, including Harris and Rice. Advisers have also looked closely at Florida Rep. Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, both of whom are black, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Latina. Biden said at a fundraiser late last month that he hopes to announce his choice of running mate by August 1. Since the police killing of George Floyd, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has also faced increased pressure to ask a black woman to join his ticket. The Minneapolis city council has unanimously passed a resolution to replace the city\u2019s police department with a community-led public safety system in response to the police killing of George Floyd. The adoption of the resolution will begin a year-long process to devise a new public safety system, and it comes days after a veto-proof majority of the council voted to disband the Minneapolis police department. The resolution creates a \u201cFuture of Community Safety Work Group,\u201d which will have until July 24 to craft preliminary recommendations on engaging with community members and experts on what the new system should look like. \u201cThe City Council will engage with every willing community member in Minneapolis, centering the voices of Black people, American Indian people, people of color, immigrants, victims of harm, and other stakeholders who have been historically marginalized or underserved by our present system,\u201d the resolution states. \u201cTogether, we will identify what safety looks like for everyone.\u201d Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has said he is not in favor of disbanding the police department but he supports \u201cmassive structural reform to revise a structurally racist system.\u201d Census data indicates levels of depression and anxiety have surged among African Americans since the police killing of George Floyd, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: Within a week, anxiety and depression among African Americans shot to higher rates than experienced by any other racial or ethnic group, with 41 percent screening positive for at least one of those symptoms, data from the Census Bureau shows. The findings \u2014 from a survey launched by the federal government originally intended to study the effects of the novel coronavirus \u2014 indicate that the recent unrest, demonstrations and debate have exacted a disproportionate emotional and mental toll on black and Asian Americans, even as rates of anxiety and depression remain relatively flat among white Americans and decreased among Latino Americans. The rate of black Americans showing clinically significant signs of anxiety or depressive disorders jumped from 36 percent to 41 percent in the week after the video of Floyd\u2019s death became public. That represents roughly 1.4 million more people. Among Asian Americans, those symptoms increased from 28 percent to 34 percent, a change that represents an increase of about 800,000 people. The American Psychiatric Association said in a 2018 statement, \u201cConstant depictions of these incidences have had a profound impact on the emotional and psychological well-being of black families and communities, contributing to fear and uncertainty.\u201d The organization recommended \u201cresearch that explores the mental health impact of police brutality and the use of excessive/deadly force on black males and black communities.\u201d Two-thirds of Americans express support for the Black Lives Matter movement, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center. The Pew survey found that 67% of Americans say they support the BLM movement, with 38% saying they strongly support it. The figure is slightly higher among black Americans, 86% of whom say they support it. However, the movement also attracts support from majorities of white Americans (60%), Hispanic Americans (77%) and Asian Americans (75%). Those numbers have increased dramatically from just a few years ago. A 2016 Pew poll found that a minority of American (43%) supported the BLM movement. Democratic senator Michael Bennet is calling for the Russell Senate Office Building to be renamed, as calls intensify to remove the names of Confederate generals from Army bases and replace Confederate statues in the Capitol. \u201cEveryone who works in the Russell Senate Office Building\u2014senators and our staff\u2014has to walk through the doors each morning of a building named after a staunch segregationist,\u201d Bennet said in a tweet. \u201cWe can do a lot better. It\u2019s time to #RenameRussell.\u201d The Russell building is named for longtime Georgia senator Richard Russell Jr, an avowed segregationist who led the opposition to the civil rights movement in the Senate. There have been previous calls to rename the building, particularly after the 2018 death of Republican senator John McCain, with many suggesting his name should replace Russell\u2019s. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer previously introduced legislation to name the building after McCain, but majority leader Mitch McConnell sidelined the proposal, saying a bipartisan group would review ways in which the chamber could honor McCain\u2019s memory. It\u2019s unclear whether that group was ever appointed. Richard Luscombe sends this report from Miami on the rising number of coronavirus cases in Florida: New coronavirus cases in Florida have set a daily record for the second day in a row. State figures released Friday morning show 1,902 more cases of Covid-19, up another 204 on Thursday\u2019s previous record tally. Florida, one of the first US states to reopen, is among those to have seen cases rising again significantly in recent days. According to the Florida Department of Health, new cases have topped 1,000 every day since 2 June, compared to only three of the previous 19 days from 13 May until the end of the month. An increase in testing accounts for some of the spike, but fears remain that Florida opened up too soon. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor, has touted what he calls a \u201csafe, smart\u201d recovery plan, which saw 64 of Florida\u2019s 67 counties moving to Phase Two - including partial reopening of bars, theaters, gyms and vacation rentals - on 5 June. (The three counties most affected by coronavirus, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, remain under tighter restrictions.) On Friday, the Miami Herald published a withering analysis, based on public and non-public data, of how Florida at first flattened the curve from its April peak, then began to reverse that progress as DeSantis pressed ahead with reopening despite federal guidelines not being met. The newspaper also pointed out that in the 64 counties already at Phase Two, new cases of Covid-19 were up almost 42 per cent, with only an eight per cent increase in testing over the same period. \u201cThe governor\u2019s first priority in reopening Florida continues to be maintaining the health and safety of all residents,\u201d Alberto Moscoso, spokesperson for the state\u2019s health department, told the Herald. Experts from the Johns Hopkins school of public medicine, however, said on Monday that Florida\u2019s seven-day average was \u201capproximately equal to its peak in early April and is still increasing.\u201d Before Thursday, Florida\u2019s previous record high of new daily cases was 1,419, set on 4 June. Overall, the state now has 70,391 confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to its department of health database, and has recorded 2,877 deaths. Trump repeated his highly controversial claim that he has done more for the black community than any other US president, although he allowed a potential exception for Abraham Lincoln, who ended slavery. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done more for the black community than any other president, and let\u2019s take a pass on Abraham Lincoln because he did good, although it\u2019s always questionable, you know, in other words, the end result,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Harris Faulkner. Faulkner, who is black, then interjected, \u201cWell, we are free, Mr President, so he did pretty well.\u201d Trump has previously claimed that \u201cnobody has ever done for the black community what President Trump has done,\u201d but fact-checkers have rated that audacious claim as false. During his Fox News interview, Trump seemed to indicate he believed there were situations where police chokeholds might be necessary. \u201cI don\u2019t like chokeholds,\u201d Trump told Harris Faulker. But he went on to say that the specific circumstances should dictate whether a chokehold is used. The president laid out an example of a \u201creally bad person\u201d confronting a police officer and said that situation had played out in recent weeks amid the George Floyd protests. \u201cYou saw some very good people protesting, but you saw some bad people also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you get somebody in a chokehold. What are you going to do now? Let go and say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s start all over again\u2019?\u201d Trump later said be believed chokeholds to be theoretically acceptable, but he acknowledged they are often used inappropriately by police. \u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said, before addressing how they have been unfairly used against people like Floyd. \u201cSo you have to be careful. With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended,\u201d Trump said. A number of cities and states have pushed to ban police chokeholds since the killing of Floyd, and New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation today that would criminalize chokeholds in the state. Trump responded to criticism of his decision to hold a campaign rally on Juneteenth, the holiday commemorating the end of slavery in America, by decribing the event as a \u201ccelebration.\u201d In a Fox News interview with Harris Faulker, Trump was asked whether he had specifically chosen the date of June 19 for its historical significance. \u201cNo, but I know exactly what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThink about it as a celebration. My rally is a celebration.\u201d The president insisted the rally should not be seen as an \u201cinconvenience\u201d and should instead be thought of \u201cvery positively as a celebration.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t done for that reason, but it\u2019s an interesting date, but it\u2019s a celebration,\u201d Trump said. The president and his campaign have received widespread criticism for hosting his first rally in more than three months on Juneteenth in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a deadly 1921 race massacre that targeted African Americans and their businesses. In a pre-taped interview with Fox News, Trump suggested some of the people protesting the police killing of George Floyd did not understand the purpose of the demonstrations. The president had been emphasizing the \u201criots\u201d seen in some cities, but Fox News\u2019 Harris Faulker specifically asked Trump what he would say to the many peaceful protesters who took to the streets in recent weeks. \u201cI think you had protesters for different reasons, and then you had protesting also because, you know, they just didn\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. The president claimed (without evidence) that many protesters could not give a reason for why they chose to join the demonstrations. \u201cThey were there for a reason perhaps, but a lot of them really were there because they\u2019re following the crowd,\u201d Trump said. But the president then interestingly added that many of the protesters were there \u201cbecause what we witnessed was a terrible thing,\u201d which would seem to be at odds with his claim that many were just \u201cfollowing the crowd.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed police reform bills passed by the state legislature this week. The bills will criminalize police chokeholds and repeal 50-A, which shielded police misconduct records from the public. Cuomo also announced an executive order requiring local officials to enact plans to modernize policing strategies in order to be eligible for state funding. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Black Lives Matter protests in the UK have been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d. In a series of tweets, Johnson described the \u201clegitimate feelings of outrage\u201d about the police killing of George Floyd, but he said attacks on UK police have been \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201cabhorrent\u201d. John Bolton\u2019s book will detail \u201cUkraine-like transgressions\u201d by Trump, according to a new press release. In the book, which will be released June 23, the former national security adviser \u201cargues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump\u2019s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Hillary Clinton has critcized Trump for planning a campaign rally for next Friday, despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The former Democratic presidential nominee specifically chastized Trump for asking rally attendees to sign a liability waiver regarding the risks around potentially contracting the virus. \u201cIf your rallies come with a liability waiver, you shouldn\u2019t be holding them,\u201d Clinton said in a tweet. The president intends to hold his first campaign rally in more than three months at the 19,000-seat BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. Oklahoma is in the process of reopening, but the state is still advising residents to \u201cminimize time spent in crowded environments\u201d. In response to that recommendation, the Trump campaign is making rally attendees sign a waiver saying they understand \u201cthat an inherent risk of exposure to Covid-19 exists in any public place where people are present\u201d and they \u201cvoluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19.\u201d The Rev Al Sharpton applauded New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s efforts to crack down on police brutality in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The longtime civil rights activist said Cuomo had \u201craised the bar\u201d for how governors should address police reform. \u201cHe has gone even beyond my expectations,\u201d Sharpton said. Shaprton specifically praised Cuomo\u2019s executive order, which would withhold state funding from localities that do not enact a plan to reinvent and modernize policing strategies. \u201cTo hold funds means he means it,\u201d Sharpton said. The activist joked that Cuomo, with whom he has previously clashed, should \u201cenjoy these few minutes\u201d of his support. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has signed the police reform bills, which will criminalize police chokeholds and repeal a state law that shielded police misconduct records from the public. After signing the bills, the Democratic governor handed out pens to the legislative leaders and activists present for the signing. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would also sign an executive order requiring local governments and police agencies to develop plans to reinvent and modernize policing strategies. Cuomo emphasized local officials needed to lay out a plan to address the use of force among officers, as well as implicit bias training and community-based outreach, in order to \u201crestore trust\u201d among their constituents. The Democratic governor said the plans must be enacted through local legislation by April 1 in order for localities to be eligible for state funding. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily coronavirus briefing, where he said he will soon sign the police reform bills passed by the state legislature. The bills will criminalize police chokeholds and repeal 50-A, which has allowed New York to shield police misconduct reports from the public. Cuomo was joined at the briefing by New York\u2019s legislative leaders, state Assembly speaker Carl Heastie and state Senate majority leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, whom he thanked for ensuring the bills\u2019 passage. The Rev Al Sharpton and the mothers of Eric Garner and Sean Bell were also present for the briefing. Like George Floyd, Garner was killed by a police chokehold in 2014, and Bell was fatally shot by NYPD officers in 2006. Vice President Mike Pence is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, today, where he will participate in a listening session with faith and community leaders. The visit in the latest in a series of trips Pence has made to swing states that will ultimately determine the outcome of the presidential election. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign released a statement criticizing Pence for the trip, accusing the vice president of using the Pennsylvania city as a \u201cprop\u201d to push Trump\u2019s claim that the US economy is making a \u201cgreat comeback.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to Pennsylvanians that Vice President Pence is using Pittsburgh as a prop on the cynically-titled \u2018Great American Comeback Tour\u2019 -- because had the Trump-Pence Administration not bungled the response to the coronavirus pandemic so dramatically, there wouldn\u2019t be a need for such an enormous \u2018comeback,\u2019\u201d said deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. \u201cI hope that Vice President Pence sees today in Pennsylvania the extent of the damage he\u2019s helped cause, and is swayed to finally give real, much-needed relief to the Commonwealth.\u201d Starbucks will allow employees to wear Black Lives Matter attire, marking a reversal after some customers threatened to boycott the coffee company over the issue. Starbucks had previously said employees could not wear BLM attire because it violated the company\u2019s dress code policy, which also prohibits any type of political, religious, or personal accessories or clothing. But the company is now walking back that stance after many customers threatened to boycott the company if they did not allow employees to express support for the George Floyd protests. The company announced the policy change in a new letter to employees, which was signed by chief operating officer Roz Brewer, executive vice president Rossann Williams and diversity officer Zing Shaw. \u201cWe see you. We hear you. Black Lives Matter. That is a fact and will never change,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs we talked about earlier this week, we\u2019re designing new t-shirts with the graphic below to demonstrate our allyship and show we stand together in unity. Until these arrive, we\u2019ve heard you want to show your support, so just be you. \u201cWear your BLM pin or t-shirt. We are so proud of your passionate support of our common humanity. We trust you to do what\u2019s right while never forgetting Starbucks is a welcoming third place where all are treated with dignity and respect.\u201d Behind-the-scenes books like John Bolton\u2019s are often used to draw a flattering picture of that official\u2019s contributions to the White House, and \u201cThe Room Where It Happened\u201d seems to be no exception. According to the press release for the book, the former national security adviser will describe Trump\u2019s Ukraine-like transgressions \u201cand attempts by [Bolton] and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them.\u201d However, critics will likely pounce on Bolton for not publicly raising concerns about these \u201ctrangressions\u201d while they were occurring -- and for later refusing to testify to the House about them. In his new book, John Bolton argues that the House committed \u201cimpeachment malpractice\u201d by focusing solely on Ukraine in its inquiry against Trump, suggesting the president had committed other \u201cUkraine-like transgressions.\u201d However, Bolton\u2019s argument struck some reporters as hypocritical, considering the former national security adviser refused to provide a deposition during the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Bolton signaled he would comply with a Senate subpoena if one were issued during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, but the Republican-controlled chamber voted against calling additional witnesses for the trial. In his new book, former national security adviser John Bolton criticizes the House for focusing on Ukraine in its impeachment inquiry against Trump and details other \u201cUkraine-like\u201d transgressions by the persident. According to a press release for Bolton\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened,\u201d the former administration official \u201cargues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump\u2019s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy \u2014 and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them.\u201d Bolton also criticizes the president for focusing solely on his chances of reelection as he made major policy decisions. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by reelection calculations,\u201d he writes. The book will be released June 23, and if precedent is any indication, it\u2019s likely that Trump will work on discrediting Bolton using the bully pulpit of Twitter in the days leading up to its release. Microsoft won\u2019t sell its facial recognition technology to police departments until federal legislation is passed to regulate its use, the company says. The moratorium is a concession to campaigners, who have called on all the major tech companies to stop selling the technology to law enforcement. It follows IBM declaring a total cessation of sales of \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d facial recognition technology, and Amazon declaring that it would stop selling its own tech to police departments for the next year, in the hope that the pause provides time for a societal conversation. \u201cWe will not sell facial-recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, said on Thursday night. \u201cThe bottom line for us is to protect the human rights of people as this technology is deployed.\u201d Some campaigners have expressed concern about the potential form such legislation could take, however. Microsoft has endorsed privacy laws that activists say are weaker than is necessary, and some worry that the hiatus could lead to a rushed-through law that ultimately harms rights. Trump is once again attacking Democratic lawmakers in Washington state, bemoaning the \u201canarchists takeover\u201d of Seattle, where demonstrators have taken over several city blocks to protest police brutality. The president specifically called out Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan, saying in a tweet, \u201cThese Liberal Dems don\u2019t have a clue. The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it is just wonderful, even the death. Must end this Seattle takeover now!\u201d Durkan said during a press conference yesterday that the story Trump is trying to tell about the city, focused on alleged domestic terrorists, is \u201csimply not true.\u201d Hallie Golden has more on the situation in Seattle: Hundreds of protesters have taken over several blocks of Seattle and transformed it into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or \u2018Chaz\u2019, helping to amplify nationwide protests while offering a real-world example of what a community can look like without police. For three days, protesters have filled several blocks and at least part of a park in the artsy Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, after police abandoned their east precinct, following dangerous clashes between protesters and law enforcement. ... The space has both a protest and street fair vibe, with a small garden, medic station, smoking area, and a \u2018No Cop Co-op\u2019, where people can get supplies and food at no cost. There\u2019s also a trio of shrine-like areas filled with candles, flowers and images of George Floyd and many others who have been killed by police. John Bolton expressed support for General Mark Milley after the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s photo op at St John\u2019s Church last week. \u201cGen. Mark Milley is a dedicated public servant who made a courageous choice to admit a mistake,\u201d Bolton said in a tweet. \u201cHis actions are a powerful example of courage, leadership and patriotism.\u201d The tweet comes one day after Milley said in a prerecorded commencement address that he should not have been at the photo op moments after peaceful protesters nearby were forcibly removed using tear gas. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics,\u201d Milley told the graduates of National Defense University. \u201cAs a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.\u201d Milley\u2019s statement could create tension with the president, which is a matter that Bolton has some experience in. The former national security adviser resigned (or was fired, depending on who you ask) after reports emerged that he pushed back against the president\u2019s later-scrapped plan to meet with the Taliban at Camp David. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. A new poll shows a majority of Americans oppose the movement to defund the police, which has gained steam since the police killing of George Floyd last month. According to the new ABC News/Ipsos poll, 64% of Americans oppose the defund movement, compared to 34% who support it. When respondents were specifically asked if police departments\u2019 budgets should be reduced to reallocate the funds to public health and social programs, 60% opposed the idea, and 39% supported it. However, a majority of black Americans (57%) support the defund movement, and 64% are in favor of reducing and reallocating police departments\u2019 budgets. Only 26% of white Americans support the defund movement, indicating a racial split on the issue. Nelson Mandela\u2019s statue in London has been boarded up amid fears of attacks by the Far Right as concerns about street violence in England this weekend shifted to other cities and towns where extremists and some football supporters are planning to confront Black Lives Matter (BLM) protestors. BLM organisers called off a planned protest at Hyde Park at 1pm on Saturday, warning that \u201cmany hate groups\u201d were threatening the safety of those planning to come. However, while some Far Right groups are still expected to be present on Saturday in London, discussions on their online forums among football gangs has turned to mobilising in other cities and towns including Leeds, Bristol and Sunderland, against perceived threats to contested historical monuments. In Poole, locals have prevented the authorities removing a statue of the founder of the Boy Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell. Chatter among Far Right activists has also turned to targeting statues such as Nelson Mandela, perceived to be associated with their opponents, according to researchers at the campaign group Hope not Hate (HnH). HnH warned of a particular potential flashpoint on Saturday in Leeds, where football groups and the Far Right have more traditionally been more interwined than elsewhere, as well as in towns such as Shrewsbury, which is home to a Clive of India statue as well as the English Border Front, a football hooligan firm of the League One club Shrewsbury Town \u201cOne of our concerns is that, generally, the Metropolitan Police are quite experienced in managing big demonstrations now, but forces in some of the smaller towns are not as experienced,\u201d said Nick Lowles, Chief Executive of HnH. \u201cMany on the far-right who tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care about race, only culture and identity, let the mask slip and openly started talking about whiteness and race again and threatened to pull down the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square,\u201d said Lowles. Earlier today British prime minister Boris Johnson said in an intervention that removing statues is \u201cto lie about our history\u201d and claimed the Black Lives Matters protests \u201chave been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d. A statue of war-time leader Winston Churchill has also been boarded up for protection, after it had \u201cChurchill is a racist\u201d daubed on it last weekend. My colleagues on the photo desk have put together a brilliant picture essay of what it has been like as a black photographer covering the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Brandon Bell in Minneapolis, Flo Ngala in New York, Sylvia Jarrus in Detroit and Jonathan Cherry in Louisville talk about their experiences, and what it has meant to them to cover such an outpouring of anger and grief. Cherry spoke in particular about Breonna Taylor, shot dead in Louisville in her apartment on 13 March this year. Through our anger, we also celebrate the life of Breonna Taylor just a few days later on what should have been her 27th birthday. We shout through tears of sorrow mixed with the sweat of long marches. We dance in commemoration of these lives lost. We aim to show a system that no longer serves us that we only need each other. The involuntary sacrifice of Breonna Taylor sparked a movement that will change the world as we know it. There are some amazing photos in the essay, which you can find here: Capturing the cry for change: photographers on the BLM protests The wave of global protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd has led to a re-appraisal of monuments around the world. Slave-traders in England, monarchs in Belgium, and Christopher Columbus in Virginia have all had their statues removed - some more violently than others. In New Zealand, a statue of the British naval captain that gives the city of Hamilton its name was removed after a local M\u0101ori elder threatened to take it down by force. Associated Press are reporting on new pressure over two statues of Spanish conqueror Juan de O\u00f1ate in New Mexico. A petition drive with more than 1,500 signatures is calling for the removal of an O\u00f1ate statue on the outskirts of Espa\u00f1ola in northern New Mexico, while activists are calling on Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller to remove another O\u00f1ate likeness from a caravan of Spanish colonists set in bronze outside a city museum. \u201cIf NASCAR can do away with Confederate flags at their events, surely our cities can do this,\u201d Moises Gonzales told AP. He is a professor of urban planning at the University of New Mexico, who has long protested the Albuquerque statue as a glorification of white supremacy. O\u00f1ate arrived in present-day New Mexico in 1598. The statue in his honour was erected in the late 1990s. To Native Americans, Onate is known for having ordered the right feet cut off of 24 captive tribal warriors after his soldiers stormed Acoma Pueblo\u2019s mesa-top \u201csky city.\u201d That attack was precipitated by the killing of Onate\u2019s nephew. In 1998, someone sawed the right foot off the statue of O\u00f1ate near Espa\u00f1ola. An online signature petition to remove the stand-alone statue of O\u00f1ate north of Espa\u00f1ola describes the conquistador\u2019s inhumane treatment of indigenous people and invokes solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. There are public protests planned for Monday. To choose the date, to come to Tulsa, is totally disrespectful and a slap in the face to even happen That\u2019s Sherry Gamble Smith, the president of Tulsa\u2019s Black Wall Street Chamber of Commerce, on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to kick-start his re-election campaign with a rally in the Oklahoma city on 19 June. It was the scene of one of the worst ever racial atrocities in US history, and Trump will hold his rally on the Juneteenth anniversary of the final emancipation of enslaved people in the country. Critics accused the president of \u201cracially motivated trolling\u201d and timing akin to \u201cblasphemy\u201d. You can read a full report here: Critics decry Trump election rally in city of Tulsa race massacre on Juneteenth In London, Boris Johnson the British prime minister has sent a series of tweets this morning saying that Black Lives Matter protests in the UK have been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d. Johnson said \u201cWe all understand the legitimate feelings of outrage at what happened in Minnesota and the legitimate desire to protest against discrimination\u201d but added that attacks on police in the UK last weekend during protests had been \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201cabhorrent\u201d. He also condemned the removal of statues, saying: We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come. One of the statues of a slave-owner removed in London had only been placed in its present location in 1997. Demonstrations planned for central London on Saturday have been cancelled for fear that there will be clashes with far-right activists. Read it in full: Boris Johnson says removing statues is \u2018to lie about our history\u2019 Getting Republicans on board for widespread police reform is going to be crucial for turning the energy of the Black Lives Matter movement into real change. This morning CNN have a profile piece on one of the Republicans who could be a key part of that fight - South Carolina senator Tim Scott. It felt like sometimes the good Lord puts you where you need to be before you knew you had to be there. This is an opportunity for me to do what it is I am called to do. I have said it several times before. God made me black on purpose. Perhaps a part of the purpose is where I am right now. Scott is expected to unveil his policing proposal next week, building on legislation he started working on in 2015 after the murder of Walter Scott. The act in his would create a national database of police use-of-force incidents that resulted in death. Read it here: CNN - Tim Scott has for years highlighted racial tension with police. Now he\u2019s leading the GOP\u2019s effort to fix it Axios are being a little bit coy about just what is in it, but a source has given them advance access to the long-awaited book by former national security adviser John Bolton. They say it will \u201coffer multiple revelations about President Trump\u2019s conduct in office, with direct quotes by the president and senior officials\u201d. There is the suggestion that the book will contain more details of Donald Trump\u2019s words over Ukraine, and that Bolton will contend there was \u201cTrump misconduct with other countries\u201d. It seems difficult to believe, with the way the world has changed with coronavirus and the global outpouring of anger and grief over the killing of George Floyd, but it is only 14 weeks since president Trump was acquitted over his behaviour towards Ukraine. Bolton\u2019s book - The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir - will be published on 23 June. LeBron James, arguably America\u2019s most prominent athlete, has stepped up by backing a new campaign group More Than a Vote. James commented earlier in the week about the long voting line that were seen in the Georgia primary on Tuesday. Joining James in the new venture are his business partner Maverick Carter. Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young, Phoenix Mercury\u2019s Skylar Diggins-Smith and former NBA player Jalen Rose. James has cited Muhammad Ali as an inspiration for his involvement in politics. Gabriel Baumgaertner looks at just what LeBron is planning: \u2018How do we fix this?\u2019 - LeBron James takes fight to black voter suppression While Florida Rep Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms have had their names touted as a possible VP pick from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is in a strong position to take the spot. Bloomberg have a piece from Jennifer Epstein this morning running the rule over Biden\u2019s options. It includes this quote from Democratic strategist Karen Finney: If it isn\u2019t all the more obvious in this moment why selecting a black woman isn\u2019t historically the right thing to do, morally the right thing to do, something that our country needs, I don\u2019t know what other sign you need. It seems very obvious and so important in this moment. Biden has already committed to choosing a woman for VP. Read it here: Bloomberg - Harris is on strong footing in Biden\u2019s vice presidential search Hi, welcome to our US politics and protests live blog today. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the key points from yesterday and overnight, and a look at what we can expect later today General Mark Milley apologized for participating in Trump\u2019s church and bible photo op after the forcible removal of peaceful protesters. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d he told the National Defense University Republicans confirmed that Donald Trump will become their nominee for the election in a convention rescheduled to Jacksonville, Florida.

But to sign up, users have to enter their payment details and some have complained that the company makes it very difficult to cancel the free trial \u2013 several claim that although they cancelled before the deadline, money was still taken out of their account.</p> <p>We have also seen emails in which company representatives have asked customers to delete negative Trustpilot reviews or replace them with positive ones.</p> <p>Although Shaw Academy highlights its \u201cexcellent\u201d Trustpilot rating on the front page of its website, this week the review website put a prominent banner notice on the page, stating: \u201cThis company and its reviews are currently under investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Some customers also complain about being bombarded with emails, texts, WhatsApp messages and phone calls, some of which try to persuade them to buy more services.</p> <p>However, Shaw Academy tells Money that \u201c99.5% of customers have zero issues\u201d, adding that its global ratings were \u201cexceptionally high\u201d and that while Covid-19 had been challenging, \u201cwe have worked tirelessly to make improvements\u201d.</p> <p>Founded in 2012 and with its headquarters in Dublin and bases in the US, India and South Africa, it specialises in online video classes aimed at helping people build their business, hobby or career.</p> <p>When Daniel Smith, 40, from&nbsp;Hereford, spotted a Facebook advert for a&nbsp;free four-week online web development course, he could not believe his luck.&nbsp;Wanting to develop his skills, he&nbsp;clicked on Shaw Academy\u2019s Facebook page and saw that it had nearly 1m likes, including from eight of his friends.</p> <p>He signed up and when the final step of registration requested debit/credit card or PayPal details, Smith hesitated. But, feeling safe with PayPal\u2019s customer security, he continued.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/30/the-idea-of-a-national-open-school-is-an-excellent-one-the-bbc-is-ready-to-make-it-happen\">The vision for a national Open School is a good one. The BBC is ready to make it happen | Tony Hall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After choosing when he wanted to schedule his free lessons, a pop-up banner appeared on his phone asking whether he wanted a \u201ctoolkit\u201d containing additional resources for the course for \u00a339.95.</p> <p>\u201cMy background is IT, so I am familiar with pop-ups,\u201d Smith says. \u201cBut&nbsp;the peculiar thing about this one was it took up my entire screen and the \u2018x\u2019 to close it was tiny and right in the corner. So I very carefully made sure I used the edge of my finger to close it.\u201d</p> <p>Then another pop-up appeared, this time for an \u201ce-certificate\u201d. A moment or two later, he says, the toolkit pop-up appeared again. This time, when he was slightly hastier in closing it, a \u201cPayPal payment \u00a339.95 to&nbsp;Shaw&nbsp;Academy\u201d notification appeared on the screen.&nbsp;</p> <p>He emailed Shaw Academy explaining that he did not want a toolkit and did not click on the pop-up \u2013 he clicked on the \u201cx\u201d.&nbsp;Smith says: \u201cWhat came out of these simple requests was a week of torture.\u201d He disputed the payment with PayPal, prompting a \u201clong back and forth\u201d, but a few days later was told he had been refunded the \u00a339.95.</p> <p>A Shaw Academy Facebook group set up in January 2020 claims to have more than 3,500 members and features hundreds of negative comments.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Trustpilot, despite its alert about the investigation, vast numbers of reviews were still appearing this week, many very brief but with five stars. Money counted about 25 in the space of one hour (4pm to 5pm on Tuesday), of which nine were one star.</p> <p>At the time of writing, there were about 3,800 one-star reviews out of 27,200, with many claiming money was taken out of their account even though they had cancelled.</p> <p>Veronika Solnickova, 33, a retail manager living in Dublin, thought that ending her \u20ac179.95 (\u00a3162) yearly membership \u2013 she had signed up to a sports nutrition course \u2013 would be simple.</p> <p>She says she selected an option to be notified one day before the subscription was to end but that did not happen and she was shocked to find she had been charged another \u20ac179.95 for another year. </p> <p>She says she should have been notified before being charged \u2013 she checked all her email folders but says nothing was sent \u2013 and claims the company was in breach of contract, prompting her to file a complaint with PayPal.</p> <p>A couple of days later, after she posted a negative review on Trustpilot, Shaw Academy emailed to say that a refund would arrive in a few days. Sent by a customer support representative \u2013 and seen by Money \u2013 it states: \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if you wouldn\u2019t mind removing your review or giving us a good rating on trustpilot.com, just until I have the chance to rectify the problem for you.\u201d Another similar request followed a few days later.</p> <p>Solnickova did not change her review and did eventually get her money: \u201cI assume Shaw Academy gave the go-ahead to PayPal to proceed with the&nbsp;refund.\u201d She says: \u201cI consider myself to be lucky. Many people all over the world are being taken advantage of during the pandemic. They make it impossible to cancel and keep charging people.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the alert on the Shaw Academy page, Trustpilot tells Money: \u201cWe take the integrity of our platform extremely seriously.

      "bodyText": "Online courses are booming as locked-down Britons and others around the world use this time to learn new skills or take up a hobby. However, Guardian Money can reveal that one of the sector\u2019s biggest players appears to be generating large numbers of complaints from unhappy customers, with many demanding refunds and, as of this week, it is being investigated by the leading reviews website Trustpilot. Shaw Academy may not be a household name but it is one of the biggest companies in online education and claims that 12 million people have \u201cgraduated\u201d from its dozens of courses with an up to tenfold increase in students after the lockdown. Courses range from digital marketing and web design to learning the guitar and wedding photography. They are typically free for four weeks, then \u00a349.99 a month. But to sign up, users have to enter their payment details and some have complained that the company makes it very difficult to cancel the free trial \u2013 several claim that although they cancelled before the deadline, money was still taken out of their account. We have also seen emails in which company representatives have asked customers to delete negative Trustpilot reviews or replace them with positive ones. Although Shaw Academy highlights its \u201cexcellent\u201d Trustpilot rating on the front page of its website, this week the review website put a prominent banner notice on the page, stating: \u201cThis company and its reviews are currently under investigation.\u201d Some customers also complain about being bombarded with emails, texts, WhatsApp messages and phone calls, some of which try to persuade them to buy more services. However, Shaw Academy tells Money that \u201c99.5% of customers have zero issues\u201d, adding that its global ratings were \u201cexceptionally high\u201d and that while Covid-19 had been challenging, \u201cwe have worked tirelessly to make improvements\u201d. Founded in 2012 and with its headquarters in Dublin and bases in the US, India and South Africa, it specialises in online video classes aimed at helping people build their business, hobby or career. When Daniel Smith, 40, from Hereford, spotted a Facebook advert for a free four-week online web development course, he could not believe his luck. Wanting to develop his skills, he clicked on Shaw Academy\u2019s Facebook page and saw that it had nearly 1m likes, including from eight of his friends. He signed up and when the final step of registration requested debit/credit card or PayPal details, Smith hesitated. But, feeling safe with PayPal\u2019s customer security, he continued. After choosing when he wanted to schedule his free lessons, a pop-up banner appeared on his phone asking whether he wanted a \u201ctoolkit\u201d containing additional resources for the course for \u00a339.95. \u201cMy background is IT, so I am familiar with pop-ups,\u201d Smith says. \u201cBut the peculiar thing about this one was it took up my entire screen and the \u2018x\u2019 to close it was tiny and right in the corner. So I very carefully made sure I used the edge of my finger to close it.\u201d Then another pop-up appeared, this time for an \u201ce-certificate\u201d. A moment or two later, he says, the toolkit pop-up appeared again. This time, when he was slightly hastier in closing it, a \u201cPayPal payment \u00a339.95 to Shaw Academy\u201d notification appeared on the screen. He emailed Shaw Academy explaining that he did not want a toolkit and did not click on the pop-up \u2013 he clicked on the \u201cx\u201d. Smith says: \u201cWhat came out of these simple requests was a week of torture.\u201d He disputed the payment with PayPal, prompting a \u201clong back and forth\u201d, but a few days later was told he had been refunded the \u00a339.95. A Shaw Academy Facebook group set up in January 2020 claims to have more than 3,500 members and features hundreds of negative comments. Meanwhile, on Trustpilot, despite its alert about the investigation, vast numbers of reviews were still appearing this week, many very brief but with five stars. Money counted about 25 in the space of one hour (4pm to 5pm on Tuesday), of which nine were one star. At the time of writing, there were about 3,800 one-star reviews out of 27,200, with many claiming money was taken out of their account even though they had cancelled. Veronika Solnickova, 33, a retail manager living in Dublin, thought that ending her \u20ac179.95 (\u00a3162) yearly membership \u2013 she had signed up to a sports nutrition course \u2013 would be simple. She says she selected an option to be notified one day before the subscription was to end but that did not happen and she was shocked to find she had been charged another \u20ac179.95 for another year. She says she should have been notified before being charged \u2013 she checked all her email folders but says nothing was sent \u2013 and claims the company was in breach of contract, prompting her to file a complaint with PayPal. A couple of days later, after she posted a negative review on Trustpilot, Shaw Academy emailed to say that a refund would arrive in a few days. Sent by a customer support representative \u2013 and seen by Money \u2013 it states: \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if you wouldn\u2019t mind removing your review or giving us a good rating on trustpilot.com, just until I have the chance to rectify the problem for you.\u201d Another similar request followed a few days later. Solnickova did not change her review and did eventually get her money: \u201cI assume Shaw Academy gave the go-ahead to PayPal to proceed with the refund.\u201d She says: \u201cI consider myself to be lucky. Many people all over the world are being taken advantage of during the pandemic. They make it impossible to cancel and keep charging people.\u201d Asked about the alert on the Shaw Academy page, Trustpilot tells Money: \u201cWe take the integrity of our platform extremely seriously. Should we become aware of any company breaching our guidelines and trying to mislead consumers, we will take action. Our investigation continues but we have already issued formal cease-and-desist proceedings and if we don\u2019t receive a satisfactory response we will take further enforcement action.\u201d James Egan, the chief executive of Shaw Academy, says \u201cthe positives outnumber the negatives by many multiples\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have tried to respond during this crisis as best we could and we appreciate that, at times, the influx of new students combined with the global lockdown has created suboptimal experiences for a very small percentage of users relative to the many millions we have educated.

Shaw Academy says the requests to change Trustpilot reviews were against company policy \u201cand was not sanctioned\u201d. It says: \u201cWe are working with the individuals involved to ensure this does not happen again. We would not want to undermine the trust that customers place in either us or Trustpilot.\u201d In response to Smith\u2019s case, Shaw Academy says it has refunded him: \u201cIn terms of the toolkit purchase, Mr Smith had the option to close the ad, move to a different part of the page, close the web page altogether or just not make the purchase.\u201d In response to Solnickova\u2019s case, it says that as she had not cancelled her subscription, technically she was not entitled to a refund but that it provided one \u201cas it was the right thing to do given the circumstances\u201d. Setting the standards The coronavirus crisis has turned online learning into an even bigger industry. The UK\u2019s CPD Standards Office, an accreditation service for training and learning, said in March that those looking for a course should choose one that has been externally verified. If they don\u2019t, they may run the risk of signing up for something that does not teach them what was advertised, or contains outdated or incorrect material.

      "bodyText": "HS2 protesters have been accused of practising early morning yoga, swimming naked in a lake and \u201chowling at the moon\u201d as a council seeks a high court injunction to stop direct action against the project. HS2 Rebellion activists say the legal action by Hillingdon council in west London is the latest in a raft of injunctions aiming to quash the campaign against the \u00a378bn high-speed railway. HS2 is seeking the extension of a separate injunction to enable the eviction of campaigners from the path of bulldozers in west London. Twenty-nine protesters are named in the HS2 court proceedings. All could be pursued for their assets, including their homes, if they are subsequently found to have breached injunctions at the HS2 site in the Colne Valley. Sailesh Mehta, a barrister representing one of the protesters, Sarah Green, said the case \u2013 due in the high court later in June \u2013 was a significant one for the legal right to protest in England and Wales. \u201cThis case is about the right to peacefully protest against what could be a huge environmental catastrophe as a result of large-scale piling operations on top of one of London\u2019s most important drinking water reservoirs,\u201d said Mehta. \u201cAt the time when many other peaceful protests are taking place worldwide, HS2\u2019s actions become more significant \u2013 and from the defendant\u2019s point of view, of far greater concern.\u201d Green, an environmental campaigner and local businesswoman, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not an offence to be against HS2 and it can\u2019t be an offence to protest.\u201d She said she and other protesters named in the court proceedings were concerned at the threat of losing their assets as a result of their protests. A nine-month injunction is in place to keep campaigners away from parts of ancient woodlands in the West Midlands, which anti-HS2 activists claim is to stop them witnessing what they allege is the illegal disturbance of nesting birds and badgers. This injunction has led to the eviction of protesters from land around the construction sites by bailiffs working for a private company employed by HS2. High Court Enforcement Group is allowed to use minimum force to remove trespassers from HS2 land under powers granted by the 2017 High Speed Rail Act. About 30 protesters are camped in woods and in treehouses beside fishing lakes and the Hillingdon Outdoor Activity Centre, a popular facility that will be forced to relocate because of HS2. In a witness statement, Michael Rees, the secretary and HS2 coordinator for Harrow Angling Society, claimed protesters had made the activity centre\u2019s lake \u201cunfishable\u201d by churning up muddy footpaths. \u201cThe protesters were using the lake for swimming. This they did quite regularly naked whilst their dogs were running around unattended,\u201d he said. Ian Kempster, the fisheries manager for the lake, complained about the protesters\u2019 \u201cmorning yoga sessions\u201d. He added: \u201cOn a number of occasions I have witnessed some of the protesters howling and chanting at the moon,\u201d and he noted complaints about \u201cbongo playing at all times of the day and night\u201d. It is also alleged that protesters last year stole \u201cfishery maintenance equipment\u201d \u2013 scaffolding poles and boards \u2013 for their \u201cramshackle and unsafe tents and shelters\u201d. Larch Maxey, an HS2 Rebellion campaigner in the camp, said the claims against the protesters were \u201cspurious, tenuous and out of date\u201d. He said: \u201cOne person swam naked in the lake once some time ago and he\u2019s left the campaign. Some of us are local people; most local people are very supportive of us and we want to keep it that way. We\u2019ve had multiple local people saying how tidy the site is.\u201d Ron Ryall, a garage owner who lives in the Colne Valley and is facing the loss of his home and business to HS2 by compulsory purchase, welcomed the presence of the protesters camped behind his house. \u201cThe protesters have given me no problems whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they\u2019re in HS2\u2019s way. But we all have the right to free speech. The protesters are standing up for what they believe in.\u201d An HS2 spokesperson said: \u201cThese protesters are not peaceful. They are often violent, their actions becoming increasingly criminal in nature. Injunctions are put in place to prevent these protesters from trespassing on land that is possessed legally by HS2, and to keep the public and our workers safe.\u201d According to the spokesperson, HS2 workers have on one occasion had urine thrown on them by protesters, and workers and security staff have been verbally abused and physically assaulted during the coronavirus lockdown. The spokesperson added: \u201cWe have nothing but respect for how the [enforcement team] have conducted themselves during countless difficult situations while risking their health to protect these protesters.\u201d Of allegations of wildlife crimes committed by HS2 workers, the spokesperson said: \u201cHS2 takes its legal obligations seriously, and all our ecology work is carried out in accordance with the law. Licenses from Natural England ensure that we have the right safeguarding in place to protect wildlife species, and that all protections are met. No occupied birds\u2019 nests have been destroyed and no trees supporting any bat maternity roosts have been felled in the maternity season.\u201d Hillingdon council did not respond to a request for comment.",

I studied the Golden Age of Spain for my coursework, but my A-level curriculum skipped&nbsp;multiple events and characters, such as Queen Juana \u201cthe Mad\u201d of Castile, who I found really interesting. I really enjoyed delving into a more detailed version of the past and that\u2019s led me to reconsider my degree.&nbsp;I enjoy the discussion side of history and that there\u2019s no right answer, whereas computer science can be very black and white.&nbsp;</p> <p>The university I applied to was in Scotland, and I\u2019m now looking at other universities, including Oxbridge, to study history. I\u2019m scared of losing the place I already have, though, as I know the competition will be tougher next year. I\u2019m waiting to get my grades to make a final choice \u2013 whether to defer or go through clearing.&nbsp;If I defer, I\u2019ll spend a year continuing to look into history and who I want to be, now I don\u2019t have to worry about exams. </p> <p>It has been sad that all the final events I was going to have with my friends have been taken away, but as the world has been going more online we\u2019ve found new ways of reaching out to each other. So although it has taken some of the expectations of leaving school I had, it\u2019s given me a sense of community I didn\u2019t have before.\u201d</p> <p><br><br></p>",

I studied the Golden Age of Spain for my coursework, but my A-level curriculum skipped multiple events and characters, such as Queen Juana \u201cthe Mad\u201d of Castile, who I found really interesting. I really enjoyed delving into a more detailed version of the past and that\u2019s led me to reconsider my degree. I enjoy the discussion side of history and that there\u2019s no right answer, whereas computer science can be very black and white. The university I applied to was in Scotland, and I\u2019m now looking at other universities, including Oxbridge, to study history. I\u2019m scared of losing the place I already have, though, as I know the competition will be tougher next year. I\u2019m waiting to get my grades to make a final choice \u2013 whether to defer or go through clearing. If I defer, I\u2019ll spend a year continuing to look into history and who I want to be, now I don\u2019t have to worry about exams. It has been sad that all the final events I was going to have with my friends have been taken away, but as the world has been going more online we\u2019ve found new ways of reaching out to each other. So although it has taken some of the expectations of leaving school I had, it\u2019s given me a sense of community I didn\u2019t have before.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Victoria Beckham has an office in her Cotswolds house, where she spent lockdown, but when she answers the phone, that\u2019s not where she is. \u201cUm, no, Harper\u2019s taken over my office. She\u2019s trying to do all her schoolwork and, well, she\u2019s kind of decided that\u2019s her space now. So I\u2019m downstairs\u2026 we\u2019re all dotted around the house, me and David and the boys, trying to work, trying to get schoolwork done. There\u2019s often someone holding a laptop up to a window, trying to get reception.\u201d Whoever you are, 2020 has had its challenges.</p> <p>As a patron of <a href=\"https://www.graduatefashionweek.com/\" title=\"\">Graduate fashion week</a>, Beckham is on the line to answer questions sent in by fashion students from all over the country. \u201cTo be honest, I feel like I have so many more questions than I do answers, right now \u2013 like everyone else,\u201d she says. Still, she is optimistic that this strangest of final terms will prove a valuable learning experience. \u201cThe generation coming into adulthood now will have experienced something that none of the rest of us have. I feel like this has taught all of us a lot about how to work together as teams, both in our home lives and professionally. This crisis will have expanded the horizons of all of us, in a way.\u201d </p> <p>Harper has been required by her school to wear uniform at home, \u201cwhich at first I thought was a bit strange, I wasn\u2019t expecting it. But for her it helps, because it keeps her routine going.\u201d For the rest of the family, sartorial standards have slipped a little. \u201cI\u2019d love to say my lockdown look has been all about a vintage kaftan, but that\u2019s not the case. I still get up early and exercise every day, then I dress for work and for comfort. A pair of old jeans, a T-shirt or a jumper. I\u2019m not quite at the elasticated waistband stage yet \u2013 I still want to feel good about myself. We\u2019ve been going out on country walks every day, so the only shoes I wear are an old pair of trainers. It\u2019s so nice just to do things with the family and not think too much about getting dressed. So, definitely no heels.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Right now there\u2019s always music on in the house, whether that\u2019s me playing it or David or the kids</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beckham\u2019s own lockdown got off to a shaky start. The planned furloughing of 30 staff at her label led to a backlash, and the decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/30/victoria-beckham-reverses-decision-to-furlough-fashion-label-staff\" title=\"\">was reviewed</a>. Since then, working remotely with her design team, she has been trying to figure out what the next few seasons look like. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about the clothes, or the design \u2013 it\u2019s about the mood, what feels right. And all the practical issues \u2013 like, how do we shoot anything? I\u2019ve also been trying to use this time to find inspiration for business strategy. A lot is going to change. I\u2019ve been focusing not just on the collection coming up, but on what is the calendar going to look like? The concept of the fashion show needs to be rethought, but what does that mean? Will it be smaller presentations? Will it be digital? It\u2019s impossible to know what the future will bring.\u201d</p> <p>In the not-too-distant future, Beckham is looking forward to getting back into her London workspace. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get the atelier up and running again. There is so much that you can do digitally now, but at a certain point you need to be able to put your hands on the clothes.\u201d She might be ready to ditch the jeans and trainers soon, too. \u201cI do miss getting dressed. A nice pub lunch with family and friends, a few glasses of wine. I\u2019m really grateful for the family time, but I\u2019m ready to be a little bit sociable now.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds like a good moment to hand over to the students\u2026</p> <h2><strong>Has there ever been a time when you felt confused about your</strong><strong> personal style?</strong></h2> <p><em>Isabelle Hill, fashion management </em><em>and communication, Sheffield Hallam University</em></p> <p>No, not really. When I was in the Spice Girls there were stylists who dressed the group, but in my personal life I have never worked with a stylist. I used to wear lots of structured dresses with corsetry, and I do still have some of those dresses, but my personal style has become more relaxed. Looking back, I guess it was a sign of insecurity that I would always wear clothes that were very tight, very fitted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e4d95bd8394a17fbd7a4c8e1129b31a4d0a555b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d95bd8394a17fbd7a4c8e1129b31a4d0a555b6/0_0_1731_2941/589.jpg\" alt=\"With David Beckham in London, 1999.\" width=\"589\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With David Beckham in London, 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Goff/UK Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the business took off and I got busier, my style changed, because I just can\u2019t run around the studio doing everything in high heels. I\u2019m juggling a lot: being a mum, being a wife, being in the studio every day. I remember one time at a show in New York where I wore a pair of masculine trousers and trainers, and everyone went crazy, \u201cOh my God, she\u2019s wearing trainers!\u201d My confidence has definitely grown as I\u2019ve got older. I know what works on me, what looks good, what makes me feel confident and comfortable. I don\u2019t feel I have anything to prove now in the way I dress.</p> <h2><strong>Do you listen to a playlist when you\u2019re designing? Who\u2019s on it?</strong></h2> <p><em>Alex Copeland, </em><em>fashion </em><em>marketing, University of East London</em></p> <p>Music has always been such a huge part of me and who I am, and not just because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/spicegirls\" title=\"\">Spice Girls</a>. When I\u2019m in the atelier, I love listening to whatever the team are into \u2013 it might be a new band I haven\u2019t heard of that one of the team went to see the night before. A couple of seasons ago we went through a phase of listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin.</p> <p>Right now there\u2019s always music on in the house, whether that\u2019s me playing it or David or the kids. The new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/justin-bieber-changes-review\" title=\"\">Justin Bieber </a>album has been a bit of a lockdown family favourite. It depends who has taken control of the docking station. David is sitting outside right now, listening to 90s soul and R&amp;B.</p> <h2><strong>How do you think the</strong> <strong>coronavirus pandemic will influence the fashion industry, and your brand in particular?</strong></h2> <p><em>Weronika Ozimek, </em><em>fashion </em><em>design, Cardiff Metropolitan University</em></p> <p>I don\u2019t know. If you know, please tell me! This is what everyone is talking about. Will the presentation of collections be more digital? I\u2019ve always been interested in the digital space; we had an e-commerce site before we had a bricks-and-mortar store. I believe that people will be travelling less, which I hope will make the industry a more level playing field. It will be less about those crazily expensive shows that only the biggest brands can afford, and more about creativity. And the timetable is going to have to adjust, because doing so many collections each year seems like it\u2019s going to feel outdated after this.</p> <h2><strong>Why did you choose an eponymous brand name? Did you have any other name ideas?</strong></h2> <p><em>Harriet Scott, fashion communication, Northumbria University</em></p> <p>It seemed obvious that it had to be Victoria Beckham. I knew there were preconceptions attached to my name, but that was a challenge I was prepared to take on. Honestly? There was never really any other option.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"059ca5c2efa175c9df94893eba9c75d5e667f594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/059ca5c2efa175c9df94893eba9c75d5e667f594/0_350_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Beckham\u2019s London fashion week show in February this year, watched by Romeo, Cruz, David and Harper Beckham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Beckham\u2019s London fashion week show in February this year, watched by Romeo, Cruz, David and Harper Beckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/BFC/Getty Images for BFC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What has been the most useful piece of</strong> <strong>criticism </strong><strong>given to you?</strong></h2> <p><em>Selina Borji, fashion communication, Liverpool John Moores University</em></p> <p>I always want to better myself, so criticism is always useful. I started out with just 10 dresses in my first collection, and as the brand grew I learned so much from people who taught me the shape of what a proper fashion collection looks like. They showed me that a fashion brand isn\u2019t just about what you put on the catwalk, it\u2019s about price points, what the customer wants and when. I had a lot to learn when I started out, and I had to surround myself with people who knew about all that stuff.</p> <h2><strong>Do you like the revival of 90s fashion? If so, what\u2019s your favourite 90s trend that\u2019s come back?</strong></h2> <p><em>Lara Hammersley, </em><em>fashion </em><em>communication </em><em>and </em><em>promotion, Norwich University of the Arts</em></p> <p>I\u2019m always inspired by the 90s. The colour, the simple shapes. There probably isn\u2019t a designer who isn\u2019t inspired by that decade. For me, it\u2019s not so much about the street fashion of the 90s, but Martin Margiela, and Jil Sander. Not just the collections, but the shows, the models, the music.</p> <h2><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to a fashion student graduating during the pandemic?</strong></h2> <p><em>Emily Hewitt, </em><em>fashion </em><em>design, Liverpool John Moores University</em></p> <p>Get as technologically savvy as you can, because that is going to be key. It\u2019s also true that this is going to be a hard moment, economically. We are likely to be in a period of recession. So it will be important to think outside of the box in terms of how and where you can make a living. Everyone is going to have to work that little bit harder to succeed in their chosen field, while we all navigate coming out of this situation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"196def9bc086e3de3e2c0ae239a8ab0d7e0e78da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/196def9bc086e3de3e2c0ae239a8ab0d7e0e78da/87_61_3138_3922/800.jpg\" alt=\"Beckham\u2019s show at Tate Britain last year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beckham\u2019s show at Tate Britain last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Where do you visit or look to for inspiration for your collections?</strong></h2> <p><em>Nikki Abbott, fashion,</em><em> Solent University, Southampton</em></p> <p>I\u2019m fortunate to have had the opportunity to travel extensively, and a lot of inspiration has come from places I\u2019ve been. Moving forward, we won\u2019t be travelling so much, I guess. But then I live in London, and where is more inspiring than London? The art is incredible. Tate Britain is a favourite place, which is why I was so thrilled when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/17/victoria-beckham-london-fashion-week-2019-show\" title=\"\">we did our show there</a> a few seasons ago. When I was in New York, I used to love going to the <a href=\"https://www.frick.org/\" title=\"\">Frick Collection</a> \u2013 I think it would be hard to find an environment that was more beautiful for looking at art.</p> <h2><strong>Do you get creatively blocked? If so, how do you move past it?</strong></h2> <p><em>Daniella James, </em><em>fashion </em><em>media and </em><em>marketing, Plymouth College of Art</em></p> <p>Sometimes I can get a little bit overwhelmed. There\u2019s just so much to do, with eyewear and beauty and everything else. I don\u2019t ever want to get stuck in a rut, so sometimes it\u2019s about finding inspiration in something that you find challenging, something that is a bit out of your comfort zone. Sometimes inspiration comes from looking at something that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily wear, and thinking about how to get from that place to creating something I find beautiful. It\u2019s a balance, because I don\u2019t want the brand to be predictable \u2013 but it still has to be believably \u201cme\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What piece of fashion advice would you give to a younger Victoria Beckham?</strong></h2> <p><em>Gracie D\u2019Silva, </em><em>fashion </em><em>design, Leeds Arts University</em></p> <p>Enjoy the journey. I have. Also, go with your gut instinct. I always say I can handle mistakes that were made by me, but not mistakes that were made against my instinct. Trust that gut \u2013 it\u2019s there for a reason.</p> <h2><strong>Do you ever get knock</strong><strong>backs? How do you cope with them?</strong></h2> <p><em>Kelsie March, </em><em>fashion </em><em>design, University of Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t call them knockbacks. I\u2019m a glass-half-full kind of person. Everyone has challenges. The thing is to learn from them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b3e62fccc358a89fd28e82ed4f529751b4ca669\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b3e62fccc358a89fd28e82ed4f529751b4ca669/0_726_4954_2973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Beckham with the Spice Girls in Paris, 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had a lot of fun with the Spice Girls, but I don\u2019t miss those days.\u2019 Paris, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Roney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Which career did you enjoy</strong> <strong>most, being a fashion designer or a pop star, and why?</strong></h2> <p><em>Ravina Kazim, </em><em>fashion, University for the Creative Arts, Rochester</em></p> <p>I love what I do now, because it is a true creative output for me. I love making women feel like the best version of themselves. I had a lot of fun with the Spice Girls, but I don\u2019t miss those days and I don\u2019t miss being on stage. That was then and this is now. Fashion is where I feel comfortable, and where I feel excited. I\u2019m looking forward to the future in this industry, actually.

      "bodyText": "Victoria Beckham has an office in her Cotswolds house, where she spent lockdown, but when she answers the phone, that\u2019s not where she is. \u201cUm, no, Harper\u2019s taken over my office. She\u2019s trying to do all her schoolwork and, well, she\u2019s kind of decided that\u2019s her space now. So I\u2019m downstairs\u2026 we\u2019re all dotted around the house, me and David and the boys, trying to work, trying to get schoolwork done. There\u2019s often someone holding a laptop up to a window, trying to get reception.\u201d Whoever you are, 2020 has had its challenges. As a patron of Graduate fashion week, Beckham is on the line to answer questions sent in by fashion students from all over the country. \u201cTo be honest, I feel like I have so many more questions than I do answers, right now \u2013 like everyone else,\u201d she says. Still, she is optimistic that this strangest of final terms will prove a valuable learning experience. \u201cThe generation coming into adulthood now will have experienced something that none of the rest of us have. I feel like this has taught all of us a lot about how to work together as teams, both in our home lives and professionally. This crisis will have expanded the horizons of all of us, in a way.\u201d Harper has been required by her school to wear uniform at home, \u201cwhich at first I thought was a bit strange, I wasn\u2019t expecting it. But for her it helps, because it keeps her routine going.\u201d For the rest of the family, sartorial standards have slipped a little. \u201cI\u2019d love to say my lockdown look has been all about a vintage kaftan, but that\u2019s not the case. I still get up early and exercise every day, then I dress for work and for comfort. A pair of old jeans, a T-shirt or a jumper. I\u2019m not quite at the elasticated waistband stage yet \u2013 I still want to feel good about myself. We\u2019ve been going out on country walks every day, so the only shoes I wear are an old pair of trainers. It\u2019s so nice just to do things with the family and not think too much about getting dressed. So, definitely no heels.\u201d Beckham\u2019s own lockdown got off to a shaky start. The planned furloughing of 30 staff at her label led to a backlash, and the decision was reviewed. Since then, working remotely with her design team, she has been trying to figure out what the next few seasons look like. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about the clothes, or the design \u2013 it\u2019s about the mood, what feels right. And all the practical issues \u2013 like, how do we shoot anything? I\u2019ve also been trying to use this time to find inspiration for business strategy. A lot is going to change. I\u2019ve been focusing not just on the collection coming up, but on what is the calendar going to look like? The concept of the fashion show needs to be rethought, but what does that mean? Will it be smaller presentations? Will it be digital? It\u2019s impossible to know what the future will bring.\u201d In the not-too-distant future, Beckham is looking forward to getting back into her London workspace. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get the atelier up and running again. There is so much that you can do digitally now, but at a certain point you need to be able to put your hands on the clothes.\u201d She might be ready to ditch the jeans and trainers soon, too. \u201cI do miss getting dressed. A nice pub lunch with family and friends, a few glasses of wine. I\u2019m really grateful for the family time, but I\u2019m ready to be a little bit sociable now.\u201d It sounds like a good moment to hand over to the students\u2026 Has there ever been a time when you felt confused about your personal style? Isabelle Hill, fashion management and communication, Sheffield Hallam University No, not really. When I was in the Spice Girls there were stylists who dressed the group, but in my personal life I have never worked with a stylist. I used to wear lots of structured dresses with corsetry, and I do still have some of those dresses, but my personal style has become more relaxed. Looking back, I guess it was a sign of insecurity that I would always wear clothes that were very tight, very fitted. As the business took off and I got busier, my style changed, because I just can\u2019t run around the studio doing everything in high heels. I\u2019m juggling a lot: being a mum, being a wife, being in the studio every day. I remember one time at a show in New York where I wore a pair of masculine trousers and trainers, and everyone went crazy, \u201cOh my God, she\u2019s wearing trainers!\u201d My confidence has definitely grown as I\u2019ve got older. I know what works on me, what looks good, what makes me feel confident and comfortable. I don\u2019t feel I have anything to prove now in the way I dress. Do you listen to a playlist when you\u2019re designing? Who\u2019s on it? Alex Copeland, fashion marketing, University of East London Music has always been such a huge part of me and who I am, and not just because of the Spice Girls. When I\u2019m in the atelier, I love listening to whatever the team are into \u2013 it might be a new band I haven\u2019t heard of that one of the team went to see the night before. A couple of seasons ago we went through a phase of listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin. Right now there\u2019s always music on in the house, whether that\u2019s me playing it or David or the kids. The new Justin Bieber album has been a bit of a lockdown family favourite. It depends who has taken control of the docking station. David is sitting outside right now, listening to 90s soul and R&amp;B. How do you think the coronavirus pandemic will influence the fashion industry, and your brand in particular? Weronika Ozimek, fashion design, Cardiff Metropolitan University I don\u2019t know. If you know, please tell me! This is what everyone is talking about. Will the presentation of collections be more digital? I\u2019ve always been interested in the digital space; we had an e-commerce site before we had a bricks-and-mortar store. I believe that people will be travelling less, which I hope will make the industry a more level playing field. It will be less about those crazily expensive shows that only the biggest brands can afford, and more about creativity. And the timetable is going to have to adjust, because doing so many collections each year seems like it\u2019s going to feel outdated after this. Why did you choose an eponymous brand name? Did you have any other name ideas? Harriet Scott, fashion communication, Northumbria University It seemed obvious that it had to be Victoria Beckham. I knew there were preconceptions attached to my name, but that was a challenge I was prepared to take on. Honestly? There was never really any other option. What has been the most useful piece of criticism given to you? Selina Borji, fashion communication, Liverpool John Moores University I always want to better myself, so criticism is always useful. I started out with just 10 dresses in my first collection, and as the brand grew I learned so much from people who taught me the shape of what a proper fashion collection looks like. They showed me that a fashion brand isn\u2019t just about what you put on the catwalk, it\u2019s about price points, what the customer wants and when. I had a lot to learn when I started out, and I had to surround myself with people who knew about all that stuff. Do you like the revival of 90s fashion? If so, what\u2019s your favourite 90s trend that\u2019s come back? Lara Hammersley, fashion communication and promotion, Norwich University of the Arts I\u2019m always inspired by the 90s. The colour, the simple shapes. There probably isn\u2019t a designer who isn\u2019t inspired by that decade. For me, it\u2019s not so much about the street fashion of the 90s, but Martin Margiela, and Jil Sander. Not just the collections, but the shows, the models, the music. What one piece of advice would you give to a fashion student graduating during the pandemic? Emily Hewitt, fashion design, Liverpool John Moores University Get as technologically savvy as you can, because that is going to be key. It\u2019s also true that this is going to be a hard moment, economically. We are likely to be in a period of recession. So it will be important to think outside of the box in terms of how and where you can make a living. Everyone is going to have to work that little bit harder to succeed in their chosen field, while we all navigate coming out of this situation. Where do you visit or look to for inspiration for your collections? Nikki Abbott, fashion, Solent University, Southampton I\u2019m fortunate to have had the opportunity to travel extensively, and a lot of inspiration has come from places I\u2019ve been. Moving forward, we won\u2019t be travelling so much, I guess. But then I live in London, and where is more inspiring than London? The art is incredible. Tate Britain is a favourite place, which is why I was so thrilled when we did our show there a few seasons ago. When I was in New York, I used to love going to the Frick Collection \u2013 I think it would be hard to find an environment that was more beautiful for looking at art. Do you get creatively blocked? If so, how do you move past it? Daniella James, fashion media and marketing, Plymouth College of Art Sometimes I can get a little bit overwhelmed. There\u2019s just so much to do, with eyewear and beauty and everything else. I don\u2019t ever want to get stuck in a rut, so sometimes it\u2019s about finding inspiration in something that you find challenging, something that is a bit out of your comfort zone. Sometimes inspiration comes from looking at something that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily wear, and thinking about how to get from that place to creating something I find beautiful. It\u2019s a balance, because I don\u2019t want the brand to be predictable \u2013 but it still has to be believably \u201cme\u201d. What piece of fashion advice would you give to a younger Victoria Beckham? Gracie D\u2019Silva, fashion design, Leeds Arts University Enjoy the journey. I have. Also, go with your gut instinct. I always say I can handle mistakes that were made by me, but not mistakes that were made against my instinct. Trust that gut \u2013 it\u2019s there for a reason. Do you ever get knockbacks? How do you cope with them? Kelsie March, fashion design, University of Hertfordshire I wouldn\u2019t call them knockbacks. I\u2019m a glass-half-full kind of person. Everyone has challenges. The thing is to learn from them. Which career did you enjoy most, being a fashion designer or a pop star, and why? Ravina Kazim, fashion, University for the Creative Arts, Rochester I love what I do now, because it is a true creative output for me. I love making women feel like the best version of themselves. I had a lot of fun with the Spice Girls, but I don\u2019t miss those days and I don\u2019t miss being on stage. That was then and this is now. Fashion is where I feel comfortable, and where I feel excited. I\u2019m looking forward to the future in this industry, actually. I feel like we can all come out of this better, personally and professionally. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

      "body": "<p>The British Medical Association has demanded an explanation from the government following reports that pages containing recommendations to protect black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities were removed from last week\u2019s Covid-19 disparity report.</p> \n<p>In a letter sent to health secretary Matt Hancock, shared exclusively with the Guardian, the head of the BMA called for the missing pages and recommendations to be published immediately.</p> \n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul CBE, the BMA council chair, noted his concern over reports that 69 pages covering seven recommendations were removed from last week\u2019s Public Health England\u2019s report.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m finding it inexplicable the government did not release the full report at a time not only when the BAME community suffered so disproportionately with the virus, but also at a time when there was global outcry and outrage to racial inequalities,\u201d Nagpaul said.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2020/jun/11/bame-coronavirus-protection-advice-unpublished-says-senior-academic\">a senior academic disclosed </a>that the advice for the government on how to protect BAME communities from coronavirus has yet to be published.</p> \n<p>The safeguarding proposals were drawn up in a document separate from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">review published last week showing that Covid-19 kills disproportionately high numbers of people from ethnic minorities</a>. The review was widely criticised for failing to investigate possible reasons for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them.</p> \n<p>Last week, Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, told the Commons that Public Health England (PHE) was unable to make any recommendations in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">report on BAME people and coronavirus</a> because some of the data needed was not available.</p> \n<p>But Prof Raj Bhopal, a scientist who had been asked to peer-review the unpublished recommendations file, told the BBC that parliament had \u201cnot been told the full truth\u201d.</p> \n<p>Bhopal, from the University of Edinburgh, described the recommendations document as an \u201copen secret\u201d and said it had \u201cevery hallmark of a [government] report ready to go to the press\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIf you consult the public, you must publish the results. Otherwise, you\u2019ve wasted their time, you\u2019ve wasted your own time, you\u2019ve wasted taxpayers\u2019 money, and you\u2019ve lost trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>PHE said the recommendations would be published next week at the same time that they were submitted to ministers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe feel [the review] hasn\u2019t done justice to the aims of having an investigation and it has not done justice to the BAME community,\u201d Nagpaul said. \u201cThe raison d\u2019etre of the review was for it to be a basis for change.

      "bodyText": "The British Medical Association has demanded an explanation from the government following reports that pages containing recommendations to protect black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities were removed from last week\u2019s Covid-19 disparity report. In a letter sent to health secretary Matt Hancock, shared exclusively with the Guardian, the head of the BMA called for the missing pages and recommendations to be published immediately. Dr Chaand Nagpaul CBE, the BMA council chair, noted his concern over reports that 69 pages covering seven recommendations were removed from last week\u2019s Public Health England\u2019s report. \u201cI\u2019m finding it inexplicable the government did not release the full report at a time not only when the BAME community suffered so disproportionately with the virus, but also at a time when there was global outcry and outrage to racial inequalities,\u201d Nagpaul said. On Thursday, a senior academic disclosed that the advice for the government on how to protect BAME communities from coronavirus has yet to be published. The safeguarding proposals were drawn up in a document separate from the review published last week showing that Covid-19 kills disproportionately high numbers of people from ethnic minorities. The review was widely criticised for failing to investigate possible reasons for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them. Last week, Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, told the Commons that Public Health England (PHE) was unable to make any recommendations in its report on BAME people and coronavirus because some of the data needed was not available. But Prof Raj Bhopal, a scientist who had been asked to peer-review the unpublished recommendations file, told the BBC that parliament had \u201cnot been told the full truth\u201d. Bhopal, from the University of Edinburgh, described the recommendations document as an \u201copen secret\u201d and said it had \u201cevery hallmark of a [government] report ready to go to the press\u201d. He added: \u201cIf you consult the public, you must publish the results. Otherwise, you\u2019ve wasted their time, you\u2019ve wasted your own time, you\u2019ve wasted taxpayers\u2019 money, and you\u2019ve lost trust.\u201d PHE said the recommendations would be published next week at the same time that they were submitted to ministers. \u201cWe feel [the review] hasn\u2019t done justice to the aims of having an investigation and it has not done justice to the BAME community,\u201d Nagpaul said. \u201cThe raison d\u2019etre of the review was for it to be a basis for change. So a review without the recommendation was basically a statistical analysis, and it wasn\u2019t the review we were all expecting to be published. And now we know the reason why it wasn\u2019t published, was because it wasn\u2019t the full report.\u201d In the letter, the BMA\u2019s chair wrote: \u201cA clear response is needed as to why these pages and important recommendations were omitted from publication, especially when it is so critical that action is taken to save lives now and reduce race inequalities.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cThe BMA called for this review and contributed our views to it, and we were extremely disappointed that the points raised in our submission were not addressed in the report published on 2 June.

This was published in full on the 2 June. \u201cIn parallel, Prof Kevin Fenton, on PHE\u2019s behalf, engaged with a significant number of individuals and organisations within the BAME community, to hear their views, concerns and ideas about the impact of Covid-19 on their communities. \u201cThis important engagement work will inform the work the equalities minister is now taking forward.

It makes them more likely to gain a decent degree and then a job, and it is sold as a life-changing experience. But second-year students across the country are realising they may now have to try to immerse themselves in a new culture from a laptop in their bedroom.</p> <p>Some universities, including <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/global/go-abroad\">Edinburgh</a> and Newcastle, have confirmed they are cancelling all plans for a year abroad in the first semester because of the uncertainty. Many students starting their third year in September are still waiting to find out if they can leave for teaching assistant jobs, work placements, or university courses overseas this year. With the coronavirus placing a question mark over where and when students can travel safely, universities are scrambling to come up with options.</p> <p>Some students are asking to defer their course for a year so they can have a year abroad alongside the following year\u2019s cohort, leaving universities with the prospect of overloaded final-year courses when they return.</p> <p>Jack worries that skipping his year abroad will set him and his coursemates back in what is likely to be a fiercely competitive jobs market. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that there will be students ahead of me and behind me who will be graduating with better language skills. I think companies would prefer someone who has spent a proper chunk of time abroad.\u201d</p> <p>Research supports him: students who study or work abroad outperform their peers in the classroom and jobs market, and are 19% more likely to gain a first and 20% less likely to be unemployed, according to a <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/gone-international-expanding-opportunities-.aspx\">study</a> by Universities UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/06/i-feel-like-a-number-unhappy-uk-students-blocked-from-deferring-studies\">'I feel like a number': unhappy UK students blocked from deferring studies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Edinburgh University, more than 200 students and parents have signed a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/university-of-edinburgh-demand-uni-of-edinburgh-for-transparency-on-cancellation-of-year-abroad\">petition</a> to demand the university explain why it has cancelled semester placements starting in September in countries already easing their lockdowns. The petition says: \u201cWith many European countries starting to make plans to welcome tourists to their shores from the start of next month, it is clearly far too early to reach such a compromising decision\u201d.</p> <p>Toby Gay, a second-year Spanish and linguistics student at Edinburgh, who organised the petition, says: \u201cThe teachers have done a great job, but quite frankly the year abroad is when you learn the language. Our degree results are dependent on it and so are our future prospects.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of students and they are frustrated about the lack of communication. It is all a mess and no one knows what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Edinburgh said it made the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to cancel overseas placements in semester one \u201cdue to ongoing global restrictions and to protect the health and safety of our students\u201d.</p> <p>Academics feel sad for their students. Prof Adam Watt, head of the department of modern languages and cultures at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofexeter\">Exeter Universit</a>y, says: \u201cThe year abroad is a relatively small part of what counts towards your degree. But in experiential life terms, it is huge.\u201d</p> <p>But Watt understands what is at stake for universities, who are tasked with keeping their students safe. He spent the beginning of the year bringing back around 200 students from abroad, some from areas such as China and northern Italy. Many didn\u2019t want to come home but the university had to insist, he says.</p> <p>Unlike Edinburgh, Exeter has not cancelled semester one placements, which remain up in the air. Watt says it could be that students set off for different countries at different times. \u201cIf government guidance is that travel is OK, and the student and the host institution are both OK, that would get our blessing,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/22/thousands-of-a-level-students-could-lose-their-unconditional-university-offers\">Thousands of A-level students could lose their unconditional university offers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, Exeter will use the pool of \u201cvirtual year abroad\u201d resources being co-ordinated by the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML), and will shoehorn extra language classes into students\u2019 schedules. Partner universities abroad are offering online courses, and some work placements are going ahead online, where employees may be working from home.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had to be honest with students and say that none of the options are particularly desirable,\u201d Watt says. \u201cWe can\u2019t replace that life experience, but we can put in place activities that will develop you as linguists and thinkers who are ready for your final year.\u201d</p> <p>Like many other universities, Exeter has said language students can skip their year abroad altogether and go straight to their final year, but Watt says packing four years of language learning into three &nbsp;will be an incredibly hard option.</p> <p>Currently only a few of his students are asking about deferring. He suspects more have \u201cchewed it over\u201d and realised they might struggle to get a job and be unable to travel.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/newcastleuniversity\">Newcastle University</a> Prof Richard Davies, global pro vice chancellor, says his university has decided \u201cwith a very heavy heart\u201d to cancel all years abroad chosen by students as an optional add-on, rather than a mandatory part of a language degree.</p> <p>The university has also cancelled all September travel for its language students, but hopes to send them off in the new year. \u201cOne possibility we\u2019ve discussed is that we might need to go through each country individually to assess the risk,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Claire Gorrara, chair of the UCML and professor of French at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/cardiffuniversity\">Cardiff University</a>, says the council\u2019s 100 university members \u201cwant to get as many students to their host country as they can\u201d, but students will have to accept some uncertainty. She says students shouldn\u2019t regard having \u201can immersive experience\u201d on their laptop in the UK for some of the year as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d.</p> <p>However, many students remain unconvinced. Isabella Ponsonby, 20, from Nottingham, who is studying history with politics and French at Newcastle University, will be going straight to her final year. She says: \u201cI worried that if I arranged to go abroad in January it might all still fall apart and that would be so disappointing. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s easier to just sack off the year abroad.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2020 to remove Cambridge from the list of universities that had announced they were cancelling studying abroad in the next semester. </p> <p><br></p>",

But second-year students across the country are realising they may now have to try to immerse themselves in a new culture from a laptop in their bedroom. Some universities, including Edinburgh and Newcastle, have confirmed they are cancelling all plans for a year abroad in the first semester because of the uncertainty. Many students starting their third year in September are still waiting to find out if they can leave for teaching assistant jobs, work placements, or university courses overseas this year. With the coronavirus placing a question mark over where and when students can travel safely, universities are scrambling to come up with options. Some students are asking to defer their course for a year so they can have a year abroad alongside the following year\u2019s cohort, leaving universities with the prospect of overloaded final-year courses when they return. Jack worries that skipping his year abroad will set him and his coursemates back in what is likely to be a fiercely competitive jobs market. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that there will be students ahead of me and behind me who will be graduating with better language skills. I think companies would prefer someone who has spent a proper chunk of time abroad.\u201d Research supports him: students who study or work abroad outperform their peers in the classroom and jobs market, and are 19% more likely to gain a first and 20% less likely to be unemployed, according to a study by Universities UK. At Edinburgh University, more than 200 students and parents have signed a petition to demand the university explain why it has cancelled semester placements starting in September in countries already easing their lockdowns. The petition says: \u201cWith many European countries starting to make plans to welcome tourists to their shores from the start of next month, it is clearly far too early to reach such a compromising decision\u201d. Toby Gay, a second-year Spanish and linguistics student at Edinburgh, who organised the petition, says: \u201cThe teachers have done a great job, but quite frankly the year abroad is when you learn the language. Our degree results are dependent on it and so are our future prospects.\u201d He adds: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of students and they are frustrated about the lack of communication. It is all a mess and no one knows what is going on.\u201d A spokesperson for Edinburgh said it made the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to cancel overseas placements in semester one \u201cdue to ongoing global restrictions and to protect the health and safety of our students\u201d. Academics feel sad for their students. Prof Adam Watt, head of the department of modern languages and cultures at Exeter University, says: \u201cThe year abroad is a relatively small part of what counts towards your degree. But in experiential life terms, it is huge.\u201d But Watt understands what is at stake for universities, who are tasked with keeping their students safe. He spent the beginning of the year bringing back around 200 students from abroad, some from areas such as China and northern Italy. Many didn\u2019t want to come home but the university had to insist, he says. Unlike Edinburgh, Exeter has not cancelled semester one placements, which remain up in the air. Watt says it could be that students set off for different countries at different times. \u201cIf government guidance is that travel is OK, and the student and the host institution are both OK, that would get our blessing,\u201d he says. In the meantime, Exeter will use the pool of \u201cvirtual year abroad\u201d resources being co-ordinated by the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML), and will shoehorn extra language classes into students\u2019 schedules. Partner universities abroad are offering online courses, and some work placements are going ahead online, where employees may be working from home. \u201cI\u2019ve had to be honest with students and say that none of the options are particularly desirable,\u201d Watt says. \u201cWe can\u2019t replace that life experience, but we can put in place activities that will develop you as linguists and thinkers who are ready for your final year.\u201d Like many other universities, Exeter has said language students can skip their year abroad altogether and go straight to their final year, but Watt says packing four years of language learning into three will be an incredibly hard option. Currently only a few of his students are asking about deferring. He suspects more have \u201cchewed it over\u201d and realised they might struggle to get a job and be unable to travel. Meanwhile, at Newcastle University Prof Richard Davies, global pro vice chancellor, says his university has decided \u201cwith a very heavy heart\u201d to cancel all years abroad chosen by students as an optional add-on, rather than a mandatory part of a language degree. The university has also cancelled all September travel for its language students, but hopes to send them off in the new year. \u201cOne possibility we\u2019ve discussed is that we might need to go through each country individually to assess the risk,\u201d he says. Claire Gorrara, chair of the UCML and professor of French at Cardiff University, says the council\u2019s 100 university members \u201cwant to get as many students to their host country as they can\u201d, but students will have to accept some uncertainty. She says students shouldn\u2019t regard having \u201can immersive experience\u201d on their laptop in the UK for some of the year as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d. However, many students remain unconvinced. Isabella Ponsonby, 20, from Nottingham, who is studying history with politics and French at Newcastle University, will be going straight to her final year. She says: \u201cI worried that if I arranged to go abroad in January it might all still fall apart and that would be so disappointing. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s easier to just sack off the year abroad.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2020 to remove Cambridge from the list of universities that had announced they were cancelling studying abroad in the next semester.",

It has transformed the landscape of fatherhood, giving new dads who can work from home far more time to bond with their babies. Several friends with teenagers confess to a bittersweet nostalgia for lockdown, which has bought time with restless offspring they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had. Denied the company of their friends, even surly 15-year-olds may eventually be bored enough to talk to their parents, although the days of hanging out as a family are ending now as teens seize on the easing of lockdown to reclaim more freedom than the rules would strictly allow. But while one lost summer feels like a tragedy to teenagers, it may turn out to have been more critical for toddlers, now missing out on an entire developmental stage\u2019s worth of learning to share, play and listen with other toddlers, which is half the battle in getting ready for school. For other children too small to understand exactly what\u2019s happening but old enough to have soaked up their parents\u2019 anxiety and grief, there will be consequences. By all means get the schools back, as soon as safely possible. But don\u2019t imagine that will be anything like enough. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people have taken part in Black Lives Matter and pro-refugee protests and marches across Australia, with refugee advocates in Sydney defying a court order to take to the city\u2019s streets. The protests came as Victoria recorded eight new coronavirus cases in the past day, including a GP who worked at three medical clinics while he may have been infectious. At Perth\u2019s Black Lives Matter event, the turnout was at least double the 8,000 organisers had expected, despite a torrential downpour midway through the rally. Organisers ignored the pleas of the West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, and Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic was over. But social distancing requests were largely adhered to by attendees, most of whom wore face masks and used available hand sanitiser. Human rights lawyer and activist Hannah McGlade, a Noongar woman, called for an independent investigation of the 432 Indigenous deaths in custody recorded in Australia in the past 30 years. \u201cThe premier and Minister Wyatt said we should cancel today,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cThey told us not to come. They told us to be silent. \u201cWe will not be silent.\u201d McGlade acknowledged Yamatji woman Ms Dhu, who died in custody in August 2014 after being locked up in South Hedland for $3,622 in unpaid fines. The 22 year old, whose first name is not used for cultural reasons, was later found to have been treated inhumanely. Others spoke of Aboriginal boy Elijah Doughty, who was riding a dirt bike when he was run down and killed by its white owner near Kalgoorlie in 2016. The man was charged but later acquitted of manslaughter, before being convicted of dangerous driving causing death and serving half of a three-year jail term. \u201cWe will say their names,\u201d McGlade said. \u201cThis is what we now have to say to the premier and the government: stop the killings of Aboriginal people and racial violence and hate crimes.\u201d In Darwin, more than 1,000 people marched through the city chanting \u201cWhose lives matter? Black lives matter.\u201d The rally was organised by two young Indigenous Larrakia women, cousins Sharna Alley and Mililma May, both aged 21. The women organised a similar rally in Darwin last November after the fatal police shooting in Yuendumu of Indigenous 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker. \u201cOn Larrakia land children have been stolen, Aboriginal language and culture has been stolen,\u201d May told the crowd. \u201cOn Larrakia land, Aboriginal children make up 100% of the Don Dale youth detention centre. On Larrakia and surrounding land, Aboriginal people are killing themselves at the highest rate in the world. \u201cOur Aboriginal men, women and children are targeted by police.\u201d In Sydney, the Refugee Action Coalition (RAC) pushed ahead with its event, despite the supreme court on Thursday night ruling it a prohibited public assembly. A group of about 70 protesters chanted slogans, stood in front of town hall and did laps of the block as part of the \u201cFree the refugees: national day of action\u201d event on Saturday. The rally was watched by a 100-strong police presence, including officers on horseback. Protesters largely obeyed social distancing rules and one of the organisers moved among the crowd handing out face masks. NSW police had opposed the event on health grounds amid the coronavirus pandemic. RAC\u2019s James Supple defended the decision to go ahead with the rally despite Justice Michael Walton ruling that the public health risks did not outweigh \u201cthe rights to public assembly and freedom of speech in the present context\u201d. \u201cPeople are attempting suicide, their mental health is deteriorating rapidly, their medical issues are not being properly treated, there\u2019s an urgent issue there for the people who need to be released,\u201d Supple said. Meanwhile, about 300 refugee activists blockaded the Kangaroo Point Central Hotel in Brisbane, demanding the government cease transferring the asylum seekers and return people who have already been moved. About 40 men holding signs saying \u201cWhere Is Justice\u201d and \u201cRefugees Are Without Crime\u201d stood on the hotel\u2019s balconies waving as the protest kicked off. Supporters of about 120 detainees briefly surged past security into the hotel compound in a failed bid to unite one of the asylum seekers with his wife and child. The protesters pulled back on request of one of the detained men, who said their actions could lead to the asylum seekers being punished. Some of those at the hotel have been in detention for years after coming to Australia for medical treatment. The organisers are also demanding the men be granted freedom of movement. \u201cThey cannot go out to exercise for their health. We demand they be allowed to walk around and get some fresh air,\u201d protest spokesman Sam Watson said. Protesters also met across eight Melbourne locations to call for freedom for refugees stuck in indefinite detention, including at a hotel in the northern suburb of Preston, Mantra Bell City, where some refugees have been held for at least seven months. Asylum seekers who were transported from Manus Island for medical treatment could be seen looking out of hotel windows to watch as up to about 30 protesters spread out outside in order to comply with health authority social distancing and gathering requirements. Victoria reported eight new coronavirus cases on Saturday, including the GP, with six of those in quarantine. The male GP is asymptomatic and caught the potentially deadly virus from a close contact, who also showed no symptoms. He worked at three clinics in the state including Croyden, Lilydale and Coburg, according to the department. Another recently diagnosed coronavirus case was a close contact of a Rydges worker. Four new Covid-19 cases were identified in New South Wales on Saturday. Of those, two cases are travellers now in hotel quarantine. The third is a locally acquired case under investigation, a man in his 20s. Rose Bay Public School in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs was closed on Friday due to a staff member with a likely case of Covid-19. The fourth case is the now-confirmed case related to the school. One person has tested positive to the virus in Queensland on Friday night, bringing the total number of active Covid-19 cases in that state to five. Earlier on Saturday both the Australian deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, and the Australian opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, had tried to dissuade protesters from attending the Black Lives Matter and \u201cFree the refugees\u201d events. \u201cThese people who want to go into protest, they ought to think long and hard about their actions,\u201d McCormack said in Tumut, NSW, where he was on the Eden-Monaro byelection campaign trail with his Nationals candidate Trevor Hicks. \u201cThe courts say no.

      "body": "<p>It was on the morning of 18 March, when Glastonbury was confirmed cancelled, that Sarah Gresty, BA course leader in fashion at Central Saint Martins (CSM), realised that the class of 2020 would be a graduating year unlike any other. \u201cThat was when we thought: OK, this is only heading one way. After that, everything happened really fast. That evening many of the international students started getting sent home, and were literally grabbing their things from the studios and heading to the airport.\u201d Within days, all students were told that there would be no final show. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d says Gresty. \u201cFor many of them, that show is a moment they had been dreaming about since they were children.\u201d</p> <p>I have spent the last week talking to class of 2020 graduates from all over the country, and a word I have heard time and again is \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.

I can wait more than three months for a brand to do a show</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fashion has become bloated. Collections are too big and too frequent. \u201cWe have too much product,\u201d as Joseph Altuzarra put it bluntly to Vogue recently, and it is produced to a trend cycle that has become unintelligible. Coats now have to go on sale in July to shift them before the sundresses hit the shop floor in November. The internal workings of a schedule yoked to outmoded department-store logic has come unmoored from common sense. Giorgio Armani has announced that his next haute couture collection will be seasonless, with pieces for all climates, and denounced the churn of high-speed fashion as \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d. Designers Dries Van Noten and Marine Serre, and retailers Selfridges in the UK and Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and mainland China, are among the signatories of an open letter proposing a \u201creset\u201d to the seasons. They want collections to be on sale for longer, with less emphasis on the \u201cextra\u201d seasons of resort and high summer. The late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/20/azzedine-alaia-obituary\">Azzedine Ala\u00efa</a>, who refused to conform to Paris fashion week schedules and showed his collections as and when he felt they were ready and appropriate, is being hailed as ahead of his time. \u201cI\u2019ll wait four years for Frank Ocean to make an album,\u201d notes Dazed Digital\u2019s Hope Allwood. \u201cI can wait more than three months for a brand to do a show.\u201d</p> <p>But the fashion show \u2013 for all its bad press as a gaudy totem of excess \u2013 still has a magic, one many designers want to rediscover in a new, more modern form. For the rest of 2020 at least, social distancing seems set to put paid to fashion weeks as we have known them. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that if the September shows do happen&nbsp;\u2013 and that\u2019s a very big if at this point \u2013 they will be completely different,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/sep/09/imran-amed-business-of-fashion-interview-is-this-fashions-most-influential-man\">Imran Amed</a>, founder and CEO of the Business of Fashion. \u201cI look back to the shows in February, where we were all squeezed in like sardines, and that seems like another world. I don\u2019t think fashion week will look the same this year \u2013 and then the question is, does that change become permanent?\u201d</p> <p>The fashion show at its best can be an electric collective experience, immersive theatre at its best. But in the last decade, Hollywood-scale set-building and guests flown in from all over the world have contributed to a&nbsp;spectacle of excess, pickled in champagne and reeking of carbon. There is&nbsp;a strong desire to bring back the magic, without the circus. For many labels,&nbsp;cost-cutting will be an economic necessity \u2013 and even for the luxury houses best placed to ride this out, there is the matter of tone. \u201cThe narrative&nbsp;of fashion as a symbol of excess isn\u2019t always warranted,\u201d says Hope Allwood, \u201cbut in a post-pandemic world brands will not want to be seen to embody it.\u201d</p> <p>This vintage of graduates are firmly generation Z, the first to have grown up fully digital native. They are perfectly poised to do what fashion designers have been attempting to do, but not quite pulling off, for the past two decades, and reinvent the fashion show as a digital-first event. \u201cUntil now, digital has always been peripheral to fashion week,\u201d says Amed. \u201cDigital has meant a show produced for a live audience and then broadcast. Or an Instagrammable moment \u2013 but that depends on a live audience who are there Instagramming it. This could be the moment when fashion week becomes, by necessity, created primarily for digital consumption.\u201d Why stop at Instagram and YouTube: Fashion Week x Netflix, anyone?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Big brands need to work with young trailblazers, who know how to be engaging and fun</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The crisis has, Amed points out, broken down outmoded fashion snobberies toward digital. With conferences and shows cancelled, many of the grandest names have found their way on to less polished forms of communication. Marc Jacobs loves a Zoom chat; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/09/olivier-rousteing-balmain-rihanna-fashion-paris\">Olivier Rousteing</a>, creative director of Balmain, is on TikTok. \u201cThere is an opportunity for young people here, because there are still so many brands who really have no idea when it comes to digital content. Now is the time for them to be working with the young trailblazers who understand how to create work that is fun and engaging. This is going to be a more marketable skill than ever before,\u201d says&nbsp;Amed.</p> <p>Many of this year\u2019s graduates are ahead of this curve. Earlier this year, long before the logistical impact of the pandemic was being felt, Heriot-Watt University in Scotland had already decided to replace the traditional fashion show with a new, more sustainable format showing final work digitally through video, film and photography. At CSM, five of this year\u2019s 109 graduates had opted for entirely virtual final collections before the crisis began to unfold. Scarlett Yang, a student who has been collaborating with brands on 3D animations and virtual reality showcases, tells me she now \u201chas more offers of work than I had before\u201d. Jessica Gray, 23, a matchesfashion.com scholar at CSM, says her final collection \u201crepresents the overwhelming effect of the screen interfering in our lives. If that wasn\u2019t a premonition, I&nbsp;don\u2019t know what is!\u201d</p> <p>The crisis has accelerated a shift towards a more waste-conscious mindset. One student who had had his heart set on a beautiful silk that ended up shuttered in a locked-down Italian factory has made his final collection using a bedsheet donated by his parents instead. Another, with bracing can-do spirit, is embroidering on to loo roll. And while some internships in Paris and Milan have been cancelled, others are happening online. The savings on travel and accommodation not only make for a smaller carbon footprint, but opportunities that are more accessible to students with less financial support, as Gresty points out.</p> <p>The coming generation have the opportunity to make sustainability a core value. \u201cYoung people will emerge from this period wanting to buy for the future, to buy secondhand \u2013 just to make better choices, even if that\u2019s buying something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/15/maria-raga-the-ceo-behind-gen-zs-favourite-shopping-app-\">on Depop</a> knowing you can flip it again later,\u201d says Hope Allwood. \u201cIf your business doesn\u2019t care about leaving the world in a better shape through your practice, you will make yourself irrelevant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b9e515e385f04dd6771791c0c340c011cf92bd7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9e515e385f04dd6771791c0c340c011cf92bd7d/0_350_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerian influencer Angel Obasi wearing a face mask in Lagos, Nigeria May 2020\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigerian influencer Angel Obasi wearing a face mask in Lagos, Nigeria May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Temilade Adelaja/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s 20-year-olds, who have grown up with the climate emergency at the centre of their world view, see environmental impact as an essential part of thinking about fashion, rather than a notion at loggerheads with it. \u201cI think the entire seasonal cycle should adapt itself to the climate crisis,\u201d says Saskia Purr, a student at Nottingham Trent University. \u201cClimate change is making our winters warmer and our summers longer.\u201d</p> <p>It is becoming fashionable, in industry circles, to propose that the way forward for fashion is to turn the clock back. \u201cYou know what fashion should have done? We should have stuck to our guns,\u201d says Bebe Moratti, founder of the Italian ethical luxury brand Redemption. The fashion system, he says, should step away from the mass-consumption gravy train. \u201cPeople say you can\u2019t go back to the old ways, but that\u2019s exactly what the brands that have survived the longest have done. Look at Herm\u00e8s. That is what the dynamic of fashion should be \u2013 an investment in something that\u2019s beautifully made, something that you love, a transaction that supports the person that made it. So, is my business model crazy, to go back to a place where we cherish what we buy, where we cherish the workers, where we cherish the environment? No. It\u2019s not crazy at all. It works.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis crisis has made the nation less materialistic,\u201d says Bournemouth student Ffion McCormick-Edwards. \u201cWe have stayed connected by talking about what we are looking forward to: things like a family barbecue, or a party with friends, or seeing our grandparents.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the blow of missing out on graduation, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this term has been all loss,\u201d says fashion knitwear student Rhiannon Davies. \u201cMy collection has become a lot more authentic to me, because doing it at home has cut off the many voices that I would find distracting at university. Facing myself \u2013 and my own company \u2013 is something I don\u2019t usually do a lot of. I&nbsp;almost feel I\u2019ve found myself in the process.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the class of 2020 has been dealt a harsh blow. \u201cI think the biggest loss is not the show itself, but the camaraderie around it,\u201d says Gresty. \u201cThe last seven weeks before a show is sheer hard work, tears, panic, but also this amazing energy, supporting each other through the fatigue \u2013 and then coming together in celebration. Not having that is tough.\u201d Despite the hardships of this term, she sees a bright future. \u201cStudents keep saying to me, \u2018We\u2019re so unlucky to be in this year \u2013 why us?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Are you joking? You are lucky. This is such a special year. This is the year that everyone will remember for ever.\u2019\u201d</p>",

They are perfectly poised to do what fashion designers have been attempting to do, but not quite pulling off, for the past two decades, and reinvent the fashion show as a digital-first event. \u201cUntil now, digital has always been peripheral to fashion week,\u201d says Amed. \u201cDigital has meant a show produced for a live audience and then broadcast. Or an Instagrammable moment \u2013 but that depends on a live audience who are there Instagramming it. This could be the moment when fashion week becomes, by necessity, created primarily for digital consumption.\u201d Why stop at Instagram and YouTube: Fashion Week x Netflix, anyone? The crisis has, Amed points out, broken down outmoded fashion snobberies toward digital. With conferences and shows cancelled, many of the grandest names have found their way on to less polished forms of communication. Marc Jacobs loves a Zoom chat; Olivier Rousteing, creative director of Balmain, is on TikTok. \u201cThere is an opportunity for young people here, because there are still so many brands who really have no idea when it comes to digital content. Now is the time for them to be working with the young trailblazers who understand how to create work that is fun and engaging. This is going to be a more marketable skill than ever before,\u201d says Amed. Many of this year\u2019s graduates are ahead of this curve. Earlier this year, long before the logistical impact of the pandemic was being felt, Heriot-Watt University in Scotland had already decided to replace the traditional fashion show with a new, more sustainable format showing final work digitally through video, film and photography. At CSM, five of this year\u2019s 109 graduates had opted for entirely virtual final collections before the crisis began to unfold. Scarlett Yang, a student who has been collaborating with brands on 3D animations and virtual reality showcases, tells me she now \u201chas more offers of work than I had before\u201d. Jessica Gray, 23, a matchesfashion.com scholar at CSM, says her final collection \u201crepresents the overwhelming effect of the screen interfering in our lives. If that wasn\u2019t a premonition, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d The crisis has accelerated a shift towards a more waste-conscious mindset. One student who had had his heart set on a beautiful silk that ended up shuttered in a locked-down Italian factory has made his final collection using a bedsheet donated by his parents instead. Another, with bracing can-do spirit, is embroidering on to loo roll. And while some internships in Paris and Milan have been cancelled, others are happening online. The savings on travel and accommodation not only make for a smaller carbon footprint, but opportunities that are more accessible to students with less financial support, as Gresty points out. The coming generation have the opportunity to make sustainability a core value. \u201cYoung people will emerge from this period wanting to buy for the future, to buy secondhand \u2013 just to make better choices, even if that\u2019s buying something on Depop knowing you can flip it again later,\u201d says Hope Allwood. \u201cIf your business doesn\u2019t care about leaving the world in a better shape through your practice, you will make yourself irrelevant.\u201d Today\u2019s 20-year-olds, who have grown up with the climate emergency at the centre of their world view, see environmental impact as an essential part of thinking about fashion, rather than a notion at loggerheads with it. \u201cI think the entire seasonal cycle should adapt itself to the climate crisis,\u201d says Saskia Purr, a student at Nottingham Trent University. \u201cClimate change is making our winters warmer and our summers longer.\u201d It is becoming fashionable, in industry circles, to propose that the way forward for fashion is to turn the clock back. \u201cYou know what fashion should have done? We should have stuck to our guns,\u201d says Bebe Moratti, founder of the Italian ethical luxury brand Redemption. The fashion system, he says, should step away from the mass-consumption gravy train. \u201cPeople say you can\u2019t go back to the old ways, but that\u2019s exactly what the brands that have survived the longest have done. Look at Herm\u00e8s. That is what the dynamic of fashion should be \u2013 an investment in something that\u2019s beautifully made, something that you love, a transaction that supports the person that made it. So, is my business model crazy, to go back to a place where we cherish what we buy, where we cherish the workers, where we cherish the environment? No. It\u2019s not crazy at all. It works.\u201d \u201cThis crisis has made the nation less materialistic,\u201d says Bournemouth student Ffion McCormick-Edwards. \u201cWe have stayed connected by talking about what we are looking forward to: things like a family barbecue, or a party with friends, or seeing our grandparents.\u201d Despite the blow of missing out on graduation, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this term has been all loss,\u201d says fashion knitwear student Rhiannon Davies. \u201cMy collection has become a lot more authentic to me, because doing it at home has cut off the many voices that I would find distracting at university. Facing myself \u2013 and my own company \u2013 is something I don\u2019t usually do a lot of. I almost feel I\u2019ve found myself in the process.\u201d Still, the class of 2020 has been dealt a harsh blow. \u201cI think the biggest loss is not the show itself, but the camaraderie around it,\u201d says Gresty. \u201cThe last seven weeks before a show is sheer hard work, tears, panic, but also this amazing energy, supporting each other through the fatigue \u2013 and then coming together in celebration. Not having that is tough.\u201d Despite the hardships of this term, she sees a bright future. \u201cStudents keep saying to me, \u2018We\u2019re so unlucky to be in this year \u2013 why us?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Are you joking? You are lucky. This is such a special year. This is the year that everyone will remember for ever.\u2019\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I wrote my latest novel<strong>, </strong><em>Remain Silent,</em> with a 9cm tumour pushing my brain over its midline. But I didn\u2019t know about it. I was deep into researching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/14/men-exploited-intimidated-migrant-workers-court\">Operation Pheasant</a>, a team tackling modern day slavery in the Wisbech area. I was busy arranging a trip to Lithuania, where I travelled the neighbourhoods of Klaipeda to try and understand what makes a person leave. I was relishing the company of DI Manon Bradshaw, the detective protagonist of my crime novels. And I was plotting a cancer storyline, not yet knowing that I had cancer.</p> <p>I wish I could go back now and put in the specificity. So much of the experience of cancer is the waiting rooms, the hard chairs, the inequality between patients and medical staff \u2013 you feel so vulnerable in your elasticated slacks with your terrible hair, while they march about, passes swinging, blow-dried and in their normal world clothes. Waiting for them, terrified, in the Room of Bad News.</p> <p>It has been easier, weirdly, to cope with my illness during lockdown, because I\u2019m not the only one whose life is on hold, not the only one terrified of dying. My treatment has been seamless: the monthly meeting with my consultant now happens on the phone and the chemo is couriered to me. The hospital, where I go for blood tests, is empty, making the whole process much quicker. Things are trickier coming out of lockdown: I face the prospect of other people returning to their lives while I remain locked in. The only thing I\u2019ll return to is envy.</p> <p>Christopher Hitchens is brilliant on this in his book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review\">Mortality</a></em>, a series of seven unapologetically angry essays about his struggle with oesophageal cancer. He describes how the ambulance comes to take the sick to a different world, after which they can only look on the normal world from a distance, desperate to get back. I feel this \u2013 as if I am behind a thick pane of glass watching others get on with their lives. Cancer means stasis; no travel, no big plans for the future, everything on hold. A bit like lockdown, you spend your time in treatment, saying to yourself \u201cI just have to get through this, then I\u2019ll get my life back\u201d. Which is unwise, in the event of a bad scan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"563c0d47faee93b695246da57143f2f8668fc167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/563c0d47faee93b695246da57143f2f8668fc167/0_1375_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Hitchens wrote seven brilliant essays about his struggle with oesophageal cancer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Hitchens wrote <em>Mortality</em>, a collection of seven brilliant essays about his struggle with oesophageal cancer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One thing you can do a lot of when you\u2019re a patient is reading. It has been my lifeline, both in hospital and in the months during radiation therapy and chemotherapy when a lot of time was spent in bed. My reading needs have changed over the course of a year of cancer treatment. In the turmoil just after diagnosis, I was hungry for fellow feeling. And if you\u2019re interested in what I\u2019ve been through then do read <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adambblain?lang=en\">Adam Blain</a>\u2019s <em>Pear Shaped</em> (his tumour was shaped like a pear). I devoured his funny book and I have since read it twice more because each time I\u2019m further along in the same journey and so looking for different things. Now, however, we are parting ways, because although he has enjoyed five years of remission, I have not had the same luck.</p> <p>As I was being wheeled into theatre for brain surgery, I very much wished I had <em>not</em> read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/30/do-no-harm-stories-brain-surgery-review-henry-marsh\">Do No Harm</a></em> by neurosurgeon Henry Marsh. I knew far too much about the big gamble that is pulling a tumour away from brain \u2013 if it is sticky the patient is wrecked. But if you\u2019re not having brain surgery any time soon then it is an extremely gripping read, not unlike <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/18/the-examined-life-stephen-grosz-review\">The Examined Life</a></em> by Stephen Grosz, with patients providing their separate stories.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/23/emperor-maladies-biography-cancer-siddhartha-mukherjee-review\">The Emperor of All Maladies</a></em> is a book to make you glad you are being treated in 2020 and not 1880. Its author Siddhartha Mukherjee creates a thriller-ish experience out of his biography of cancer. Contrary to popular belief, cancer is not a new illness. It was merely outshone by the likes of tuberculosis, typhoid fever and smallpox. Once these were remedied, cancer came galloping up on the inside lane and will soon be affecting one in two of us. \u201cBy 1926, cancer had become the nation\u2019s second most common killer just behind heart disease.\u201d He describes the positively medieval surgeries performed without anaesthetic and how, in a world without scans, cancer could only be detected when tumours popped out of the body in a big lump, or when they killed. This may have been an advantage \u2013 nothing has made me sicker than treatment.</p> <p>The concerted efforts of the world\u2019s scientists to find a vaccine against coronavirus has stuck in my throat: there is no such concerted effort to find a treatment for glioblastoma (the disease that killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/13/the-people-politician-tessa-jowell-obituary\">Tessa Jowell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/31/beau-biden-dies-of-brain-cancer\">Beau Biden</a>), though perhaps if 30,000 people died from it, there would be. What is also remarkable is that cancer treatment has barely advanced since the war. The cut-it-out, radiate-it, poison-it treatment model that I have just gone through was devised towards the end of the second world war. We are very much due a breakthrough. But this will only leave room for another killer (in you come, coronavirus).</p> <p>I very much hope the next biography of cancer will describe the great medical advance that will turn the tide: will it be immunotherapy? Or a DNA-specific vaccine? In the meantime it falls to writers to make sense of the terror of illness, because people who are suffering \u2013 people who are lonely, sick and bereaved \u2013 need the solace that stories provide, to see their suffering reflected in the suffering of characters. I\u2019m not sure that I will want to read lockdown novels: it\u2019s bad enough living it. There are an additional 35,000 bereaved people or families out there now. That seems a more pressing need: to talk about grief.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has been easier, weirdly, to cope with my illness during lockdown, because I\u2019m not the only one whose life is on hold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Six hours of brain surgery changed me: I didn\u2019t like telly any more.

      "bodyText": "I wrote my latest novel, Remain Silent, with a 9cm tumour pushing my brain over its midline. But I didn\u2019t know about it. I was deep into researching Operation Pheasant, a team tackling modern day slavery in the Wisbech area. I was busy arranging a trip to Lithuania, where I travelled the neighbourhoods of Klaipeda to try and understand what makes a person leave. I was relishing the company of DI Manon Bradshaw, the detective protagonist of my crime novels. And I was plotting a cancer storyline, not yet knowing that I had cancer. I wish I could go back now and put in the specificity. So much of the experience of cancer is the waiting rooms, the hard chairs, the inequality between patients and medical staff \u2013 you feel so vulnerable in your elasticated slacks with your terrible hair, while they march about, passes swinging, blow-dried and in their normal world clothes. Waiting for them, terrified, in the Room of Bad News. It has been easier, weirdly, to cope with my illness during lockdown, because I\u2019m not the only one whose life is on hold, not the only one terrified of dying. My treatment has been seamless: the monthly meeting with my consultant now happens on the phone and the chemo is couriered to me. The hospital, where I go for blood tests, is empty, making the whole process much quicker. Things are trickier coming out of lockdown: I face the prospect of other people returning to their lives while I remain locked in. The only thing I\u2019ll return to is envy. Christopher Hitchens is brilliant on this in his book Mortality, a series of seven unapologetically angry essays about his struggle with oesophageal cancer. He describes how the ambulance comes to take the sick to a different world, after which they can only look on the normal world from a distance, desperate to get back. I feel this \u2013 as if I am behind a thick pane of glass watching others get on with their lives. Cancer means stasis; no travel, no big plans for the future, everything on hold. A bit like lockdown, you spend your time in treatment, saying to yourself \u201cI just have to get through this, then I\u2019ll get my life back\u201d. Which is unwise, in the event of a bad scan. One thing you can do a lot of when you\u2019re a patient is reading. It has been my lifeline, both in hospital and in the months during radiation therapy and chemotherapy when a lot of time was spent in bed. My reading needs have changed over the course of a year of cancer treatment. In the turmoil just after diagnosis, I was hungry for fellow feeling. And if you\u2019re interested in what I\u2019ve been through then do read Adam Blain\u2019s Pear Shaped (his tumour was shaped like a pear). I devoured his funny book and I have since read it twice more because each time I\u2019m further along in the same journey and so looking for different things. Now, however, we are parting ways, because although he has enjoyed five years of remission, I have not had the same luck. As I was being wheeled into theatre for brain surgery, I very much wished I had not read Do No Harm by neurosurgeon Henry Marsh. I knew far too much about the big gamble that is pulling a tumour away from brain \u2013 if it is sticky the patient is wrecked. But if you\u2019re not having brain surgery any time soon then it is an extremely gripping read, not unlike The Examined Life by Stephen Grosz, with patients providing their separate stories. The Emperor of All Maladies is a book to make you glad you are being treated in 2020 and not 1880. Its author Siddhartha Mukherjee creates a thriller-ish experience out of his biography of cancer. Contrary to popular belief, cancer is not a new illness. It was merely outshone by the likes of tuberculosis, typhoid fever and smallpox. Once these were remedied, cancer came galloping up on the inside lane and will soon be affecting one in two of us. \u201cBy 1926, cancer had become the nation\u2019s second most common killer just behind heart disease.\u201d He describes the positively medieval surgeries performed without anaesthetic and how, in a world without scans, cancer could only be detected when tumours popped out of the body in a big lump, or when they killed. This may have been an advantage \u2013 nothing has made me sicker than treatment. The concerted efforts of the world\u2019s scientists to find a vaccine against coronavirus has stuck in my throat: there is no such concerted effort to find a treatment for glioblastoma (the disease that killed Tessa Jowell and Beau Biden), though perhaps if 30,000 people died from it, there would be. What is also remarkable is that cancer treatment has barely advanced since the war. The cut-it-out, radiate-it, poison-it treatment model that I have just gone through was devised towards the end of the second world war. We are very much due a breakthrough. But this will only leave room for another killer (in you come, coronavirus). I very much hope the next biography of cancer will describe the great medical advance that will turn the tide: will it be immunotherapy? Or a DNA-specific vaccine? In the meantime it falls to writers to make sense of the terror of illness, because people who are suffering \u2013 people who are lonely, sick and bereaved \u2013 need the solace that stories provide, to see their suffering reflected in the suffering of characters.

Who is in denial, me or you? We live in an age when physical vulnerability is seen as personal weakness so it is books (in particular fiction) that tell us about a more subtle and emotionally painful state that goes along with illness. There is humiliation. There is neediness. There is shame. And there is total inequality with other people. Why has it happened to me and not you?

Last year it caused the deaths of more than 16,000 people, a rate of more than <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer#:~:text=Bowel%20cancer%20mortality,all%20cancer%20deaths%20(2017).\">45 individuals a day</a>. Tumours spread aggressively if left untreated but can be pinpointed \u2013 using special screening techniques \u2013 in their early stages. As a result, doctors can cut out tumours before they spread and patients often make complete recoveries.</p> <p>However since March, bowel cancer screening has been effectively halted because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cCancer screening has become a very serious problem and bowel cancer screening is a particular concern,\u201d said Professor Clare Turnbull, of the Institute of Cancer Research.</p> <p>\u201cBowel cancer is common but treatable if you detect it promptly. And unlike many other cancers, it is possible to pinpoint cases in their early stages.

      "bodyText": "A dramatic rise in bowel cancer cases is set to sweep Britain in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, doctors and scientists have warned. They said they feared that the halting of screening for the condition will lead to thousands of people dying early from the disease. Bowel cancer is the UK\u2019s second biggest cancer killer after lung cancer. Last year it caused the deaths of more than 16,000 people, a rate of more than 45 individuals a day. Tumours spread aggressively if left untreated but can be pinpointed \u2013 using special screening techniques \u2013 in their early stages. As a result, doctors can cut out tumours before they spread and patients often make complete recoveries. However since March, bowel cancer screening has been effectively halted because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cCancer screening has become a very serious problem and bowel cancer screening is a particular concern,\u201d said Professor Clare Turnbull, of the Institute of Cancer Research. \u201cBowel cancer is common but treatable if you detect it promptly. And unlike many other cancers, it is possible to pinpoint cases in their early stages. The trouble is, since March that screening has been halted.\u201d The early detection of bowel cancer is carried by spotting blood in stool samples. Test kits are posted to men and women over the age of 60 \u2013 individuals who have the highest risk of getting bowel cancer, along with those who are obese or have family histories of the disease. Stool samples are then sent to test centres. Those found to have blood in their samples are asked to attend clinics where they are examined using an endoscope, a long tube fitted with a camera that will show if a tumour is growing on their intestine wall. \u201cIn fact, only a small fraction of people called in for examination with endoscopy turn out to have bowel cancer,\u201d added Turnbull. \u201cUsually, less serious sources are are found to be the cause.\u201d Nevertheless, several thousand cases of bowel cancer are detected this way every year. Patients can have their tumours removed through surgery. In many cases, these patients can return to normal life. Nearly everyone survives bowel cancer if it is diagnosed at the earliest stage, although survival rates drop the later the disease is tackled, states Bowel Cancer UK. However, test kits for identifying individuals who have blood in their stools are no longer being sent out while endoscopy examinations have been stopped except for a handful of emergency cases, effectively halting all UK bowel cancer screening. And that cessation of a life-saving service is now a major concern, said Professor Mark Lawler, of Queens University, Belfast. \u201cIf a person with bowel cancer is not identified early on, their tumour will continue to grow. It will develop until it reaches an advanced stage when it will be much, much more difficult to tackle. \u201cAnd that is what is now occurring across the UK,\u201d added Lawler. \u201cPeople who could have been successfully treated \u2013 by having their tumour detected early and removed surgically \u2013 are not being screened and will therefore die far earlier than would have been the case a few months ago.\u201d This point is clearly backed by statistics.

Hogan is allowed into Ascot, as the trainer, and McAuley also expects to gain admission as the horse\u2019s groom, but the other two men will watch from home.</p> \n<p>There will be much more tension. Sceptical is not some handicapper trying to pick up a few quid. He is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite for next Saturday\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Stakes, a top-class sprint that carries a purse of \u00a3250,000. Frankie Dettori is booked to ride.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a fairy tale,\u201d McAuley says. He remembers the calculations they made while Sceptical was in the auction ring, knowing the horse had trouble breathing because Godolphin had made that clear. The good news was that seemed to be putting off other buyers. \u201cWe factored it in, it\u2019s gonna cost us \u20ac1,500 to get his wind done. Is he worth \u00a34,300? It was a no-brainer. He was a fine horse. We\u2019d have been more than prepared to pay a fair bit more than that.\u201d</p> \n<p>McAuley\u2019s assessment has been justified in spades and Sceptical is being called the fastest horse in Ireland. \u201cWe\u2019ve proved that already,\u201d his proud owner says. \u201cWhen he won [ar Naas] on Monday, that was the best that\u2019s on offer over here.</p> \n<p>\u201cHis last run in Dundalk [in March], he was upsides a line of horses with a furlong to go and then won six and a half lengths, running away. I don\u2019t know about English sprinters but certainly over in Ireland we don\u2019t see horses doing that.\u201d</p> \n<p>McAuley\u2019s team had a similar success at a lower level with Hathiq last year, having given him time to recover from a pelvic injury that had made him affordable. \u201cWe look very clever now. But if you buy cheaper horses, some of them don\u2019t work out. If that happens, we don\u2019t even try to sell them for small money, where you don\u2019t know where they go. We find them homes as riding horses.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/03/berlin-tango-in-mix-for-the-derby-after-classic-trial-victory-at-kempton-horse-racing\">Talking Horses: Royal Ascot prize fund for 2020 slashed by 50%</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Suspicion can attach to the sort of low-profile race McAuley\u2019s horses sometimes find themselves in and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board is still mulling over the result of a Dundalk claimer in March, when he and Hogan had the first two finishers.

Next week will be very different, primarily, because of coronavirus and the restrictions under which the sport must continue. Hogan is allowed into Ascot, as the trainer, and McAuley also expects to gain admission as the horse\u2019s groom, but the other two men will watch from home. There will be much more tension. Sceptical is not some handicapper trying to pick up a few quid. He is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite for next Saturday\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Stakes, a top-class sprint that carries a purse of \u00a3250,000. Frankie Dettori is booked to ride. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a fairy tale,\u201d McAuley says. He remembers the calculations they made while Sceptical was in the auction ring, knowing the horse had trouble breathing because Godolphin had made that clear. The good news was that seemed to be putting off other buyers. \u201cWe factored it in, it\u2019s gonna cost us \u20ac1,500 to get his wind done. Is he worth \u00a34,300? It was a no-brainer. He was a fine horse. We\u2019d have been more than prepared to pay a fair bit more than that.\u201d McAuley\u2019s assessment has been justified in spades and Sceptical is being called the fastest horse in Ireland. \u201cWe\u2019ve proved that already,\u201d his proud owner says. \u201cWhen he won [ar Naas] on Monday, that was the best that\u2019s on offer over here. \u201cHis last run in Dundalk [in March], he was upsides a line of horses with a furlong to go and then won six and a half lengths, running away. I don\u2019t know about English sprinters but certainly over in Ireland we don\u2019t see horses doing that.\u201d McAuley\u2019s team had a similar success at a lower level with Hathiq last year, having given him time to recover from a pelvic injury that had made him affordable. \u201cWe look very clever now. But if you buy cheaper horses, some of them don\u2019t work out. If that happens, we don\u2019t even try to sell them for small money, where you don\u2019t know where they go. We find them homes as riding horses.\u201d Suspicion can attach to the sort of low-profile race McAuley\u2019s horses sometimes find themselves in and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board is still mulling over the result of a Dundalk claimer in March, when he and Hogan had the first two finishers. The form suggested one was a more likely winner, the betting market spoke firmly in favour of the other one and the well-backed runner won. McAuley says he has nothing to hide, had no bet on the race and adds that Yuften, the runner-up, finished lame. He sounds like a man who can put such worries to the back of his mind. Sceptical is also a laid-back character, a trait that seems to help. \u201cIf you were to see him in his stable, you could genuinely put a child up on him and let him walk around,\u201d McAuley says. \u201cFor some reason, the bookies have been giving a price about him, so we\u2019ve had substantial bets on him. \u201cWe went down to the stable yard one day and he was asleep with his head resting on the door, about half an hour before the race. We were saying: \u2018Come on, now, wake yourself up.\u2019 But that\u2019s just him. Everything just comes so easy to him.\u201d",

Welcome to post-lockdown Saturday Sportwatch.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a while, so forgive me if things take a while to whirr into action. There\u2019s also only a reduced diet of sport to snack on for the time being, so if you\u2019re not a fan of the major footy codes, you might want to find some creative ways of remaining engaged (I\u2019m here for eight hours, so don\u2019t think I\u2019m not open to suggestions). </p> <p><strong>The return of the AFL</strong> has captured our attention twice already this week with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/it-doesnt-matter-the-afls-return-was-a-stinker-its-good-just-to-have-the-footy-back\">Collingwood and Richmond</a> conspiring to please absolutely nobody in their low-scoring draw, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jun/12/afl-2020-geelong-cats-hawthorn-hawks-round-2-draw-team-news-bounce-footy-game-kick-off-tonight-live-scores-stats-updates-teams-lineups-season-fixture-ghmba-stadium-australia\">Geelong demonstrated against Hawthorn</a> that with home ground advantage and the stellar trio of Joel Selwood, Gary Ablett, and Patrick Dangerfield on song, they could be a dark horse for this year\u2019s premiership. </p> <p>The action continues today with <strong>Brisbane v Fremantle (1.45pm), Carlton v Melbourne (4.35pm), Gold Coast v West Coast (7.40pm),</strong> as well as the main event, the Showdown between<strong> Port Adelaide and Adelaide (7.40pm). </strong></p> <p>The<strong> NRL </strong>seems positively pass\u00e9 by comparison, heading into round five with an increasing sense of normality around the competition.

After that it\u2019s an all-top-five affair with <strong>Melbourne</strong> traveling to <strong>Newcastle</strong> <strong>(5.30pm)</strong> before <strong>Wests</strong> host <strong>Canberra</strong> in prime time <strong>(7.30pm)</strong>. <br></p> <p>But that\u2019s not all.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for your company today/tonight. It\u2019s been a long old ride, but a fun one. Port Adelaide demand honours for team of the day, but the Knights v Storm clash was my favourite contest, while the return of a proper crowd for Super Rugby Aotearoa brought a lump to my throat. It\u2019s good to have some footy back, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s do this all again soon. Cheerio! A huge upset result for Gold Coast against West Coast. A possible turning point for the beleaguered club too with the emergence of Matt Rowell. This was a contest for ten minutes. Thereafter it was a procession, a glorious one for Port Adelaide fans who saw their young team playing with incredible verve. An absolute stinker of a night for the Crows. The Showdown has a new record margin of victory. AFL: Q4: 7 mins remaining: Suns 13.6 (84) v Eagles 6.8 (44) - In other AFL news, the Suns are home and hosed. 18-year-old Matt Rowell sounds like he\u2019s been best on ground with two goals, six tackles and 23 possessions. AFL: Q4: 10 mins remaining: Power 15.8 (98) v Crows 5.4 (34) - Adelaide continue to front up, which is to their credit. A name check for young Fogarty on this score who must be on his third guernsey of the night after persistently putting his body on the line, ending up in a few scrapes along the way. Meanwhile, Dixon kicks his second and Power continue their march to a few months of loud bragging. There\u2019ll be a few Crows fans hoping for the retention of social distancing measures a little longer after this. Indeed, I might start winding this up over the final quarter. Forgive the lack of goal-by-goal reports. (Brad Crouch just got one at the start of the final quarter, by the way.) AFL: 3QT: Suns 11.4 (70) v Eagles 6.8 (44) - The Suns remain on course for a huge and unlikely victory. After scoring just 29 points in the opening round of the season they are leading the highly-fancied Eagles with a bit to spare heading into the final quarter. AFL: 3QT: Power 14.7 (91) v Crows 4.3 (27) - Anyone for the mercy rule? AFL: Q3: 1 min remaining: Power 14.7 (91) v Crows 4.3 (27) - Is that the start of a late comeback? No chance. Duursma kicks his third after more Power midfield mauling. Rory Sloane is now iced up on the bench resting that corked hip. AFL: Q3: 3 mins remaining: Power 13.7 (85) v Crows 4.3 (27) - Perhaps the low point of the night for Port Adelaide. Robbie Gray has just hit the post from 15m out on the run unopposed. Adelaide then go coast to coast to snap a nine-goal streak against them. They were made to work for it, especially in the first half when Wests defended doggedly (or tigerishly), but the Raiders came through in the second-half, helped in no small part by Russell Packer\u2019s sin-binning. Canberra join Melbourne, who won earlier today, on four wins, leading the chse of the unbeaten Eels. AFL: Q3: 6 mins remaining: Power 13.5 (83) v Crows 3.3 (21) - Training ground stuff from the Power now, players streaming forward at pace, confident the clearance will be theirs (it is) and knowing a forward will present (they do). Justin Westhoff bags the latest goal. AFL: Q3: 8 mins remaining: Power 12.5 (77) v Crows 3.2 (20) - Motlop gets another, mopping up after Marshall brought the ball to ground then dancing around a couple of hapless Crows. This cannot end soon enough for Adelaide. AFL: Q3: 11 mins remaining: Power 11.5 (71) v Crows 3.2 (20) ... and now a speccy from Steven Motlop that he honours with a 45m set shot from the right boundary line. Boy oh boy. As a two-parter, that must be a goal of the year contender. AFL: Q3: 13 mins remaining: Power 10.5 (65) v Crows 3.2 (20) - Dixon goals. Sloane has a nasty cork to his right hip. This is turning into a dream night for Port Adelaide. It\u2019s as though Port are playing on a different speed setting to the Crows tonight. Despite what must have been a fearsome half-time address from Matthew Nicks Adelaide are just struggling to keep up. AFL: Q3: 15 mins remaining: Power 9.4 (58) v Crows 3.2 (20) - Duursma smashes in a goal from point blank range seconds after the restart. This could get very ugly very quickly for the Crows. AFL: Second-half underway at Adelaide Oval. NRL: 60 mins: Tigers 6-12 Raiders - An Mbye penalty milks some of that sin-bin time off the clock and brings the Tigers back within a score. Spot on, exuberance is exactly what\u2019s so much fun about these Power kids. NRL: 55 mins: Tigers 4-12 Raiders - Russell Packer hasn\u2019t played for 12 months, and it\u2019s an unhappy return for the big man. He\u2019s binned for ten minutes for interfering with a play-the-ball, and from the resulting penalty Canberra use their man advantage to kick early in the set and allow the flying Cotric to dive over unopposed in the right corner. A brilliant touchline conversion extends the lead to 8 points. After all that backs to the wall defence in the opening half the game is slipping away from the Tiges. NRL: 51 mins: Tigers 4-6 Raiders - Jack Wighton has finally breached the resolute Wests Tigers defence, picking the tiniest of gaps and bulldozing his way to the line. AFL: HT: Suns 6.2 (38) v Eagles 5.5 (35) - The Golden boys continue to surprise the Eagles in the battle of the Coasts. AFL: HT: Power 8.4 (52) v Crows 3.2 (20) - One-way traffic in the Showdown. A big half-time break for the Crows. AFL: Q2: 2 mins remaining: Power 8.4 (52) v Crows 3.2 (20) - I am thoroughly enjoying watching Port Adelaide tonight. Their energy and intent is a coach\u2019s dream. Some of the ball skills need polishing, but the desperation around the ground is something to behold. Another 50m gift, this time to Boak after some needless lip following the award of a free-kick on the arc, extends the lead to 32 points. AFL: Q2: 5 mins remaining: Power 7.4 (46) v Crows 3.1 (19) - Unfortunately for Crows fans the opposite of all the effervescent and brio is is true for their side. Power are gifted another goal after yet another entry inside 50 ends with a free-kick, upgraded to a 50m penalty and a walk-in goal for Brad Ebert, sporting a natty head bandage. AFL: Q2: 6 mins remaining: Power 6.4 (40) v Crows 3.1 (19) - Smooth from Butters, volleying a bouncing, skidding ball from 20m out straight through the big sticks. There is a vibrancy and freedom in Port Adelaide that is glorious to watch. They have drafted some terrific young players and they are loving their football. This does feel like the start of something very fun for Power fans. AFL: Q2: 7 mins remaining: Power 5.4 (34) v Crows 3.1 (19) - Duursma adds a bit more reality to the scoreboard, fed by - who else - Rozee, bursting out the side of a stoppage like Chris Judd. AFL: Q2: 8 mins remaining: Power 4.4 (28) v Crows 3.1 (19) - Ha! Wouldn\u2019t you know it, Adelaide kick the next goal. The Crouchs combine for a rare clearance that sets up Lynch to hammer the ball forward. Once there the Crows keep it inside 50 successfully, eventually channelling the ball out to Brodie Smith who snaps superbly from 40m out high into the South Australian sky. AFL: Q2: 10 mins remaining: Power 4.4 (28) v Crows 2.1 (13) - Adelaide haven\u2019t been allowed to settle at all so far tonight, Port\u2019s midfield and small forwards are buzzing like angry hornets, turning up the intensity to 11. There\u2019s a lack of class with ball in hand, for now, but you sense once the dam breaks Power could run away with this comfortably. AFL: Q2: 13 mins remaining: Power 4.4 (28) v Crows 2.1 (13) - Zak Butters misses on the narrow side from a set shot after neat build up play from Gray and Ebert. Bad news for the Crows with Jake Kelly ruled out for the night with concussion. AFL: Q2: 14 mins remaining: Power 4.3 (27) v Crows 2.1 (13) - Rozee already has five clearances to his name and that ability to get first hands on the footy is something the Crows are going to have to figure out if they\u2019re going to get a foothold in this contest. It\u2019s all crash and bash and suiting Port\u2019s hustle at the moment. Thanks Dr Rudi, I\u2019ll take you up on that. I shall remain a sceptic until then. I\u2019ll leave you with this. NRL: 33 mins: Tigers 4-0 Raiders - A low scoring affair in the final NRL clash of the night. AFL: QT: Suns 2.0 (12) v Eagles 1.4 (10) - An unexpected scoreline in Queensland with the Suns edging the Eagles at the first break. AFL: QT: Power 4.2 (26) v Crows 2.1 (13) - Breathless stuff at Adelaide Oval, but the longer it went on the better Port Adelaide looked. AFL: Q1: 1 min remaining: Power 4.2 (26) v Crows 2.1 (13) - It\u2019s all Port Adelaide now, Justin Westhoff getting in on the act after good hands from Daniel Motlop. Motlop received the ball after the Power were hungrier at the breakdown following good work overhead by Dixon. They are eager beavers Port Adelaide tonight. AFL: Q1: 2 mins remaining: Power 3.2 (20) v Crows 2.1 (13) - Two in a minute for the Power who are starting to make their ascendancy around the ground tell on the scoreboard. 21-year-old Marshall with his second of the night after more good work from Rozee. Rozee is some player. AFL: Q1: 3 mins remaining: Power 2.2 (14) v Crows 2.1 (13) - It\u2019s still chaotic with neither side getting any time in possession and skill errors plaguing the spectacle. Port Adelaide are enjoying an increasing territorial advantage though and it eventually tells when 20-year-old Connor Rozee spins and snaps from 30m out after one of the many melees. AFL: Q1: 7 mins remaining: Power 1.1 (7) v Crows 2.0 (12) - It\u2019s still frantic out there and at this pace it\u2019s inevitable there are turnovers and skill errors aplenty. Port Adelaide are starting to build, Motlop and Gray getting their hands on the footy in midfield, but neither side has established a pattern as yet. AFL: Q1: 9 mins remaining: Power 1.1 (7) v Crows 2.0 (12) - Port hit back quickly, Todd Marshall sharking in the goal square after leaning his man under the ball from a massive bomb inside-50. AFL: Q1: 10 mins remaining: Power 0.1 (1) v Crows 2.0 (12) - Adelaide have definitely settled quicker. Sloane again finds the ball, this time on the right flank, and he delivers onto the chest of Darcy Fogarty and the big forward thumps the set shot home from 50m. He is a solid unit young Fogarty, built like a cruiserweight, and he needs those broad shoulders to carry Mark Ricciuto\u2019s #32 on his back. AFL: Q1: 11 mins remaining: Power 0.1 (1) v Crows 1.0 (6) - Rory Sloane kicks the first major of the night. Fogarty contests a Walker inside-50, bringing it to ground and from the crumbs an onrushing Sloane finds a yard of space and dribbles the Sherrin into the unguarded goal. AFL: Q1: 12 mins remaining: Power 0.1 (1) v Crows 0.0 (0) - Still a scorching hot footy with neither side stringing any chains of possession together. Adelaide have come the closest but after Walker did well bringing the ball to ground at the top of the square Port Adelaide smothered any resulting danger. AFL: Q1: 15 mins remaining: Power 0.0 (0) v Crows 0.0 (0) - Frantic stuff to begin with. Very very hot footy. Who can settle quickest? The few hundred Port fans are belting out Never Tear Us Apart, a sublime song, not for me as a pregame pump up though. Someone convince me I\u2019m wrong. While I\u2019m on this riff, is there a worse pregame crowd-lifter than Melbourne City\u2019s appropriation of Happy Together by The Turtles? The teams are out in the middle of Adelaide Oval, Port in their Eddie McGuire-baiting prison bar guernsey. There are a few hundred fans in attendance in South Australia, so there is something resembling an atmosphere. Ok, I\u2019ve made myself a cuppa, now it\u2019s time to turn our attention to the Showdown between Port Adelaide and Adelaide. This will be the focus for the remainder of the night with updates from Gold Coast v West Coast and Wests Tigers v Canberra along the way. Huge win on the road for Melbourne, set up by a brilliant first half and a nuggety second, one that contained no little good fortune when it mattered at the death. NRL: 78 mins: Knights 12-26 Storm - It\u2019s all going Melbourne\u2019s way now. A slow set ends with a Munster kick returning his way for a repeat set, and from that Brandon Smith forces his way over the line from close range like a supercharged wombat, with three Knights hanging off him for company. Cameorn Smith continues his flawless record with the boot. Game over. NRL: 75 mins: Knights 12-20 Storm - Storm have controlled the past few minutes and they\u2019re winding down the clock professionally. Minimising risk and errors. The Knights think they have an opening when Melbourne concede a turnover deep in Newcastle territory but Smith is straight in with a captain\u2019s challenge and the decision is overturned and brought back to centre field for an off the ball hit by Klemmer on Finucane. This time the veteran elects to take the shot at goal and Storm move eight points clear. That was a huge moment. NRL: 72 mins: Knights 12-18 Storm - Melbourne earn a repeat set and cycle the ball through plenty of hands but with Vunivalu in space outside him Papenhuyzen spills the ball in contact and the Knights breathe a sigh of relief. NRL: 70 mins: Knights 12-18 Storm - Oh my! Melbourne look certain to score, Vunivalu bursting down the right then kicking smartly infield only for the bounce of the ball to wrong-foot Cameron Smith. The ball gets recycled back to the right wing where Vunivalu is again waiting to cross for four points but he slips and Lee flies into him conceding an unfortunate high tackle. Smith rejects the option of a shot at goal. NRL: 67 mins: Knights 12-18 Storm - Melbourne look rattled this second half, typified by Vunivalu occupying dummy half on the right wing on the fifth tackle with no obvious receiver. Do the Knights have enough to pierce the Storm defence one more time? NRL: 62 mins: Knights 12-18 Storm - Here we go! The Knights are storming back into this in the second half. Superb from Ponga 10m out creating space on the left wing where Edrick Lee dives over after the ball goes smartly through hands. Ponga adds the extras from the touchline. There are walking wounded all over Central Coast Stadium with players from both sides struggling to remain upright. Cracking finish in store. Super Rugby: Highlanders 28 - 27 Chiefs - A banner night for Super Rugby Aotearoa ends with Bryn Gatland landing a drop-goal at the death to deny the Chiefs, and dad Warren, the win. The Demons survive, by a point, after leading by 32 at quarter-time. Heartbreak for Carlton. NRL: 54 mins: Knights 6-18 Storm - I turn away from the rugby league for a second and Newcastle score, Bradman Best chasing a kick-through down in the left corner and touching over - just - that took the TMO an age to confirm there was no knock-on. Ponga misses the conversion. AFL: 4Q: 3 mins remaining Carlton 7.11 (53) v Melbourne 8.6 (54) - Melbourne sneak one behind ahead again. AFL: 4Q: 5 mins remaining Carlton 7.11 (53) v Melbourne 8.5 (53) - Scores are level! Jack Martin hits the post with a set shot. What is going on at Marvel Stadium!? AFL: 4Q: 6 mins remaining Carlton 7.10 (52) v Melbourne 8.5 (53) Patrick Cripps has just taken a huge contested mark and nailed the set shot from 40m. This is wild! NRL: 50 mins: Knights 2-18 Storm - The Knights are stepping up the pace and earn a repeat set on the Storm line after Vunivalu fumbles a bomb. Their halves can\u2019t seem to make the right decision under pressure though, playing into trouble with spaces begging left and right until Pearce spills a shocking pass over his right shoulder. Oh my! NRL: 45 mins: Knights 2-18 Storm - It\u2019s been all Newcastle in the second half and it took a superb tackle - man and ball on Tuala - from Addo-Carr to keep the Knights try-less. Three or four Newcastle players are clearly playing hurt, but for now they\u2019re battling on. AFL: 4Q: 12 mins remaining Carlton 5.8 (38) v Melbourne 8.5 (53) Carlton couldn\u2019t, could they? Back underway in the big NRL clash, while the AFL contest between Carlton and Melbourne is into its closing stages, and the Blues have just kicked a goal! AFL: 3QT: Carlton 4.6 (30) v Melbourne 8.5 (53) The Blues are back in this contest after outscoring the Demons 4.6 to 3.3 since quarter-time. They remain at arm\u2019s length thanks to some Christian Petracca brilliance near the interval. NRL: HT: Knights 2-18 Storm - A vintage half from Melbourne Storm, practically flawless in defence and patient in attack, converting weight of possession into three converted tries. Cameron Smith excelled, conducting his side one way then the other, laying on a brace of tries with expertly timed passes. The Knights kept their heads up and could easily have shipped more points. They also profited from a penalty on the siren to get on the board. AFL: Ok, so maybe I went early on this one. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of Dees fans shaking their heads knowing it was too good to be true. NRL: 35 mins: Knights 0-18 Storm - The Knights have defended desperately for 20 minutes but the dam breaks again. Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui secures his maiden try, hitting the line at pace on an angle, scything through what was left of Newcastle\u2019s defence just five metres out. Again, it was Smith orchestrating play, timing his pass from dummy half to perfection. NRL: 30 mins: Knights 0-12 Storm - Melbourne have stepped up a level and Newcastle are clinging on by their fingernails. Papenhuyzen, Munster and Smith are sending the Knights one way then the other, and whenever they hand the ball over it\u2019s regained in the blink of an eye. Big test towards half-time for Newcastle. NRL: 25 mins: Knights 0-12 Storm - Vintage Suliasi Vunivalu! The Storm pound their way through the middle of the ground until Cameron Smith spots his flying right winger one-on-one out wide and the Fijian takes full advantage, stepping inside from a standing start and dashing the ten metres to the line, dragging a couple of Knights with him, including Edrick Lee, who was left for dead by Suli\u2019s step. Smith backs up his beautiful assist with a touchline conversion. NRL: 21 mins: Knights 0-6 Storm - Miraculous double save from Papenhuyzen, first stopping Ponga one-on-one on his line then capturing an awkwardly bouncing Pearce dribbler. There is a bristling intensity to this one. NRL: 17 mins: Knights 0-6 Storm - After surviving an almighty effort from the Storm the Knights have responded well. A try in the right corner went begging after the crucial pass following the capture of a high kick went astray, then Saifiti burst clear to set up good field position only for a soft turnover on the Melbourne line to undo the good work. NRL: 13 mins: Knights 0-6 Storm - Four sets in a row from the Storm who are playing smart footy, doing the simple things well, using their forwards to hit up hard then looking to Munster and Papenhuyzen to probe around the edges. Munster has kicked superbly so far, using his grubbers to force the Knights to concede repeat sets in their in-goal. The Knights are defending stoutly though, withstanding some serious pressure. Newcastle will get great encouragement after emerging form that barrage unscathed. NRL: 9 mins: Knights 0-6 Storm - It\u2019s been a pretty conservative forward-heavy start to this contest with both sides happy to drive up the guts for the most part, that one Storm try-scoring break aside. AFL: HT: Carlton 2.5 (17) v Melbourne 7.4 (46) Despite a couple of Carlton goals in the shadow of half-time this is an ugly shellacking. Expect plenty of heat on the Blues this week in the pressure cooker of Victorian footy media. NRL: 3 mins: Knights 0-6 Storm - What a try from the Storm! It was a solid opening few sets from both teams before Munster set a play in motion down the left wing that ended with Addo-Carr kicking neatly infield towards the posts where a flying Ryley Jacks catches the Knights defence napping, touching down with a full length dive ahead of Herman Ese\u2019ese. NRL: The second contest of the day is imminent with the Knights hosting the Storm in front of a smattering of fans at Central Coast Stadium in Gosford. AFL: 2Q: 10 mins remaining: Carlton 0.1 (1) v Melbourne 5.3 (33) The Blues are on the board... with a behind. Carlton have reported that Nic Newman has suffered a patella tendon injury and will be assessed during the week. Super Rugby: 6 mins: Highlanders 3-0 Chiefs It\u2019s hard to turn away from the Rugby, what with its crowd in the stands and authentic human reactions pouring through the speakers. I am very jealous of those Dunedinites. Rugby: But while there\u2019s reason to celebrate across the water, Australian rugby is fighting for its life, as Bret Harris reports. There is speculation Fox Sports initially wanted RA to pay for the broadcast of the domestic Super Rugby competition themselves, but then relented and offered a much reduced deal, which RA had no choice but to accept. It is understood RA has assured the Super Rugby clubs they will be economically viable for the rest of this year, but what about next year and the year after that? Whatever deal has been done to enable the game to survive 2020 and the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, it is only the entr\u00e9e before the main course, which is the next broadcast deal from 2021 to 2025. Rugby: While we\u2019re in rugby territory, this is a nice read on Sam Kane, the new All Blacks captain. Like former All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, who learned his craft on the pastoral planes of the Mackenzie Country, the freshly appointed Cane\u2019s rural background has become a fundamental part of his present day. He is quick to credit his farming upbringing for fostering the work ethic and readiness to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d that he has brought from his days as a prodigious 20-year-old talent pulling on the black jersey in in 2012, to one the most coveted positions in New Zealand leadership. Super Rugby: There are some speeches pregame in Dunedin, celebrating the return of live sport, commemorating those that have lost their lives in the pandemic, and thanking the frontline workers. True to form they are note perfect, treading just the right side of grandstanding. Kiwis have every right to be proud of their efforts right now. AFL: QT: Carlton 0.0 (0) v Melbourne 5.2 (32) I\u2019m sure Blues fans won\u2019t mind me overlooking this one after all. Carlton have gone scoreless in the opening quarter against Melbourne and Nic Newman has left the ground on a stretcher. The Blues have no marks inside-50, they\u2019re operating at just 60% disposal efficiency, and they have 15 clangers from just 69 possessions. Jayden Hunt is the only multiple goalkicker, while Christian Petracca leads the way with ten touches. Super Rugby: Oh my. I\u2019ve just turned over to Super Rugby Aotearoa and the sight of a ground with more than a handful of fans has made me choke up. Onya New Zealand. Highlanders v Chiefs from Dunedin kicks off shortly. South Sydney had to beat Gold Coast today and kickstart their 2020 campaign, and they did. Moreover, in doing so they demonstrated how potent their abundance of talented backs could prove as the season progresses. Latrell Mitchell was instrumental from fullback, Dane Gagai snagged a brace on the wing and Adam Reynolds and Cody Walker probed dangerously in the halves. They didn\u2019t have it all their own way though. The Titans had the game on their terms after about the 30-minute mark but they were unable to convert that dominance into points. Instead, some Mitchell magic iced the game late on. NRL: 75 mins: Rabbitohs 32-12 Titans: Latrell Mitchell take a bow. The fullback has iced this one for the Rabbitohs, creating Dane Gagai\u2019s second try of the day with a beautiful step off his left foot to send his right winger over in the corner. Reynolds continues his superb kicking day with another beauty from the whitewash. Harsh on the Titans, but that ability to manipulate space within inches of the try line is what has separated the two teams this afternoon. The Dockers nearly snuck it, but they always felt like they were chasing the game once Charlie Cameron caught fire early on. It was another example of how fast these restart rounds are proving. I wonder how long that will last? NRL: 71 mins: Rabbitohs 26-12 Titans: Jaydn Su\u2019A is on report for a bone shuddering hit on Sam Lisone that replays confirm was a smidgen shoulder-chargey. NRL: 69 mins: Rabbitohs 26-12 Titans: End to end now at Bankwest Stadium where Tatola is held up over the line after struggling to hold onto the ball with a try at his mercy. Time running out for the Titans. NRL: 67 mins: Rabbitohs 26-12 Titans: Now it\u2019s Gold Coasts\u2019s turn to have the TMO rule against them with Bryce Cartwright\u2019s effort ruled out for a knock-on by Don in the aftermath of a high kick towards the right corner. AFL: Carlton v Melbourne is about to get underway at Marvel Stadium. I\u2019m going to level with you all, I\u2019m not going to follow that one closely. In an eight-hour shift of live sport watching, something\u2019s got to give, and I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not going to get my full attention. NRL: 63 mins: Rabbitohs 26-12 Titans: Dane Gagai crosses in the right corner but it\u2019s ruled out by the TMO for an inside-10 offside call against Junior Tatola. NRL: 60 mins: Rabbitohs 26-12 Titans: The past half-hour or so has been all Gold Coast but they remain unable to pressure Souths on the scoreboard. More than once this half they\u2019ve looked destined to score int he right corner only to fluff their lines at the last minute. For the Rabbits, the free-flowing attacking footy of the opening half has been replaced by backs to the wall storm-weathering. NRL: 50 mins: Rabbitohs 26-12 Titans: Meanwhile in the NRL the Gold Coast have started the second term brightly and they have reduced the deficit to 14 points. Agonising for Fremantle who clung on throughout an exhausting final quarter, but after Michael Walters\u2019 brilliance edged them in sight of victory they didn\u2019t have enough in the tank to get across the line. Instead, Dayne Zorko put the result beyond doubt with just second remaining for Brisbane\u2019s first win of the season. The superstars all stood up with Neale, Fyfe, Walters and Cameron dominating the stats sheet. AFL: Q4: 1 min remaining: Brisbane 11.9 (75) v Fremantle 10.9 (69) Brisbane very cannily chewed up some time then banged the ball inside 50 where Tom Berry on debut floated with the flight to take a spectacular mark, redolent of Nick Riewoldt or Jonathan Brown in their primes. Ooooh, instead of icing the game all he can do is snag a point! AFL: Q4: 3.30 mins remaining: Brisbane 11.7 (73) v Fremantle 10.9 (69): Fyfe, to Walters, goal! Just a kick in it now at the Gabba! Fremantle have refused to give in and Michael Walters has willed himself through a sea of exhausted bodies to impose himself on this contest. Grandstand finish in store. AFL: Q4: 5 mins remaining: Brisbane 11.7 (73) v Fremantle 9.8 (62): Here we go! Michael Walters has lit up the Gabba with some superb individual skill. First he gobbled up a chaos ball and offloaded it with the quickest of hands, then he spun around to accept the return handball before kicking a vital goal across his body from the left forward pocket. Terrific play that keeps this one alive at the death. Motorsport: Bad news continues to stalk F1 with the announcement of further Covid-19 related cancelations to the 2020 calendar. But Lewis Hamilton has enhanced his reputation during lockdown, the Englishman becoming increasingly outspoken on issues of race and inequality, as Andrew Lawrence reports. Given the wide array of sports figures that have engaged in the broader conversation around racial inequality since Floyd\u2019s brutal murder, from Michael Jordan to Tiger Woods, doubtless some will be seduced into thinking that Hamilton is just hopping on the bandwagon \u2013 or worse: doing it for clout. But the unimpeachable truth is, Hamilton has kept this same energy his whole career. Where Woods runs from race, famously describing himself as \u201cCablinasian\u201d, Hamilton is unequivocal. \u201cI don\u2019t wrestle with race at all; I\u2019m black,\u201d Hamilton told me when I profiled him for Sports Illustrated during the 2015 United States Grand Prix. \u201cWhen I arrive here, I don\u2019t feel different, but I know I am different.\u201d Where Jordan famously \u201cjoked\u201d that \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too\u201d as explanation for not publicly supporting a black mayor\u2019s historic Senate campaign in his home state of North Carolina, Hamilton never drives his Merc out of the paddock without first slipping on an outsize, over-colored helmet with the phrase \u201cStill I Rise\u201d scrawled on the back. I wondered, Was that a Maya Angelou shoutout? \u201cNah, bruv,\u201d he quipped, flashing that trademark gapped-tooth smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s Tupac.\u201d AFL: Q4: 10 mins remaining: Brisbane 11.5 (71) v Fremantle 8.8 (56): Freo are pushing hard in this final quarter but they\u2019ve so far been unable to impose themselves on the scoreboard. This one is becoming a little tighter and more stoppage heavy, which suits Brisbane with their slender lead. Who wants some golf news? NRL: HT: Rabbitohs 26-6 Titans: Gold Coast enjoyed a good spell in the ten minutes or so leading up to half-time but they were unable to turn it into points. Instead, Souths extended their lead by a couple after Adam Reynolds accepted an easy penalty just seconds before the hooter. That was exactly the half the Bunnies required after their difficult start to 2020. They\u2019re clearly a work in progress, but with such a mercurial set of backs they will generate reams of highlights this season. Cricket: This is a lovely read from Ali Martin on the origins of the West Indian cricket anthem Rally, which will be heard on their tour of England, beginning in July. Rally hit the sweet spot in a different way, its rousing lyrics and tropical melody becoming such a favourite at Test venues across the Caribbean over the decade following its release that when the West Indies board searched for an anthem before a series against Australia in 1999, there was only ever one winner. AFL: 3QT: Brisbane 11.5 (71) v Fremantle 8.5 (53): Brisbane will take a handy lead into the final interval but, not for the first time today, a Nat Fyfe goal near the siren has kept the Dockers alive. Fyfe (3.1 from 20 disposals) and Lachie Neale (2.0 from 20) are having their own private duel for best on ground. NRL: 24 mins: Rabbitohs 24-6 Titans: Every time the Rabbitohs attack they look like they\u2019re going to score. Their backs are just too skilful, too quick, and too creative for the Titans in this mood. Braidon Burns is the latest to add his name to the scoresheet, and like the Mitchell try earlier there\u2019s a bit of fortune involved when a juggle lands his way after chasing the latest dangerous grubber from one of his halfbacks. This is the 16th game in a row the titans have conceded at least 20 points. We\u2019re only one quarter through this one. NRL: 20 mins: Rabbitohs 18-6 Titans: Another one for Souths! More excellent play by the Bunny backs, Latrell Mitchell in particular, creates the opportunity for the quicksilver Dane Gagai to cross in the right corner. The latest in a series of superb conversions sails through the uprights. AFL: Q3 10 mins remaining: Brisbane 10.2 (62) v Fremantle 7.4 (46) The goals continue to rain at the Gabba with Brisbane extending their half-time lead. Not for the first time in his career Lachie Neale is having a day out with two goals and 18 touches already. In poorer news for Brisbane, big Stefan Martin has left the ground with a knee injury and he looks unlikely to return today. NRL: 12 mins: Rabbitohs 12-6 Titans: It\u2019s try time again at Bankwest and Souths are back in front. Following a delay for a failed captain\u2019s challenge by the Titans, the Rabbitohs attacked down the left, Cody Walker clipped a grubber into the corner where Alex Johnston completed the simple task of collecting and grounding the ball unopposed. NRL: 8 mins: Rabbitohs 6-6 Titans: Gold Coast hit back quickly, Phillip Sami rounding off a straightforward move through hands to the right wing where the fullback backed his strength against a couple of Rabbitohs defenders. Ashley Taylor turns four into six with a magnificent kick from the right touchline. NRL: 4 mins: Rabbitohs 6-0 Titans: Of course, that previous post means the Bunnies immediately score, and who else but the maligned Mitchell. The fullback profited from a juggle that wrong-footed the Titans\u2019 defence after he hit the line at speed, spilling the initial pass. Mitchell\u2019s first try in the green and red hoops. NRL: We\u2019re underway at Bankwest Stadium where the Rabbitohs dare not lose to the Titans. It\u2019s not started well for the Bunnies though with Latrell Mitchell belting the kick-off out on the full then seeing Gold Coast\u2019s Anthony Don inches away from pulling down a bomb into the right corner. A sidenote: Jai Arrow\u2019s hairstyle has to be seen to be believed. He needs the Jonathan Van Ness treatment and soon. Cricket: We may have heard the last of Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s, grandma, auntie and their sticks of rhubarb on a live cricket broadcast after the veteran Englishman was not offered a new contract by the BBC last week. Andy Bull wrote a coruscating column asking why it took Test Match Special so long to cut ties with such a controversial figure. Boycott is right, it is a surprise he lasted as long at the BBC as he did. A surprise he lasted 22 years after he was convicted of assaulting Margaret Moore. A surprise he lasted nine years after he appeared to make fun of Michael Yardy\u2019s mental health on air \u2013 \u201cHe must have been reading my comments about his bowling,\u201d he said when Yardy pulled out of the 2011 World Cup because he was struggling with depression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he\u2019s not good enough at this level.\u201d And a surprise he lasted three years after he said he should \u201cblack me face\u201d to get the knighthood he was so sure he deserved, because the honour was \u201chanded out like confetti\u201d to West Indian players. Former teammate and colleague Vic Marks offered some balance. While some revelled in his bombast about Brexit, the honours system or uncovered wickets, I enjoyed chatting to him about his early days and was increasingly struck by the warmth and respect he showed when recalling some of his peers. Players such as Brian Close and, in the end, Fred Trueman, with whom he had a few fierce arguments over the years, and his old opening partner for England, Bob Barber, who, he gratefully noted, \u201clooked after me at the start\u201d. Believe it or not, he has mellowed a bit. AFL: HT: Brisbane 8.2 (50) v Fremantle 7.3 (45) Nat Fyfe was barely sighted in a quiet opening half until he sparked Fremantle into life with his first goal, midway through the second quarter, then he showed his true colours, eventually keeping the Dockers in touch with his second in the shadow of the siren. Otherwise the Lions enjoyed the upper hand courtesy of Charlie Cameron\u2019s 4.1, and they seemed set for a much handier half-time lead before Fyfe\u2019s intervention. Another high-scoring contest is very much in the balance at the main break. Anyone for tennis? Kevin Mitchell has written about Roger Federer\u2019s decision to write off the 2020 ATP Tour season, a move that inevitably raises questions about the future of a man who will be 39 when he next steps on court. It is Federer\u2019s misfortune to be growing old when two of the greatest players of all time, Nadal and Djokovic, seem to have survived their own injury trials and are looking hungry to surpass him in the record books. What is more certain is that Federer will not go quietly. As he reminded us \u2013 and as he repeats whenever asked about retirement: \u201cI will be missing my fans and the Tour dearly but I will look forward to seeing everyone back on Tour at the start of the 2021 season.\u201d In Federer\u2019s absence Rafael Nadal will have the opportunity to draw level with his long-time rival on 20 career grand slams, while Novak Djokovic - with 17 slams in his trophy cabinet - must now be favoured to reach retirement as the greatest of them all. But despite being the two favourites for the next scheduled major, the US Open, neither may travel to Flushing Meadows to add to their hauls. AFL: Q2 12 mins remaining: Brisbane 6.2 (38) v Fremantle 4.0 (24) Charlie Cameron is up to four goals already and another shootout is in store at the Gabba. Thursday\u2019s low-scorer is fading in the rearview mirror. H\u00e9ritier Lumumba is continuing his push for public recognition from Collingwood about the racism he experienced during his 199-game stay at the Magpies. Earlier today he tweeted the latest in a series of detailed threads about his concerns and the specific questions he wants asked of coach Nathan Buckley and president Eddie McGuire. I like this presentation of QT stats from the Dockers social media team. Just don\u2019t go all Mick Morgan on me Harry. AFL: QT: Brisbane 4.2 (26) v Fremantle 3.0 (18) This one took a while to get going but once ex-Docker Lachie Neale opened the scoring with a superb individual effort it eased through the gears. Charlie Cameron already has 2.1 from four touches in a typically livewire showing. To quote Jonathan Brown, Brisbane Coach \u201cChris Fagan will be ropable\u201d after a Jarryd Lyons indiscretion saw a free-kick in the centre square reversed and result in Lachie Schultz dribbling through a goal as the siren sounded for quarter-time. Hello everybody - it\u2019s good to be back. Settle into your comfiest chair, surround yourself with snacks, and invite the canned crowd noise of a full day of live sport to soundtrack your every move. Welcome to post-lockdown Saturday Sportwatch. It\u2019s been a while, so forgive me if things take a while to whirr into action. There\u2019s also only a reduced diet of sport to snack on for the time being, so if you\u2019re not a fan of the major footy codes, you might want to find some creative ways of remaining engaged (I\u2019m here for eight hours, so don\u2019t think I\u2019m not open to suggestions). The return of the AFL has captured our attention twice already this week with Collingwood and Richmond conspiring to please absolutely nobody in their low-scoring draw, before Geelong demonstrated against Hawthorn that with home ground advantage and the stellar trio of Joel Selwood, Gary Ablett, and Patrick Dangerfield on song, they could be a dark horse for this year\u2019s premiership. The action continues today with Brisbane v Fremantle (1.45pm), Carlton v Melbourne (4.35pm), Gold Coast v West Coast (7.40pm), as well as the main event, the Showdown between Port Adelaide and Adelaide (7.40pm). The NRL seems positively pass\u00e9 by comparison, heading into round five with an increasing sense of normality around the competition. There have already been wins for Manly, New Zealand, and most significantly, Parramatta, with the Eels laying down a marker against the high flying Panthers last night. Today, South Sydney will be out to put the start of their troubled campaign behind them against whipping boys Gold Coast (3pm). After that it\u2019s an all-top-five affair with Melbourne traveling to Newcastle (5.30pm) before Wests host Canberra in prime time (7.30pm). But that\u2019s not all. If you prefer your sport without social distancing, Super Rugby Aotearoa is here! Round one of that revised competition begins at 5.05pm with the Highlanders welcoming the Chiefs to delightful Dunedin. There\u2019s plenty more besides going on, and this isn\u2019t going to be a blow-by-blow account of every match, so feel free to divert the conversation wherever you want it to go. It could be the impact of Roger Federer\u2019s season-ending knee surgery, the cancelling of Geoffrey Boycott, the A-League now being the only major Australian sport without a TV deal allowing it to restart its season, the return of professional golf, snooker, whatever, we\u2019re open for business below the line, on Twitter @JPHowcroft or via email jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s get cracking!",

      "body": "<p>Parts of Beijing have reimposed lockdown measures after a cluster of locally transmitted coronavirus cases emerged nearly two months after the Chinese capital appeared to have stamped out the virus.</p> <p>The outbreak, linked to a major wholesale food market, raised serious questions about the challenges of keeping the disease at bay, even in countries such as China where authoritarian rule allows harsh containment regulations and invasive tracing systems.</p> <p>The first case in the new outbreak was discovered on Thursday after a 52-year old man tested positive, prompting the district where he lives to raise its risk level to medium.</p> <p>Beijing had previously gone 55 days in which the only new infections were citizens returning from other countries. The city had largely returned to normal life, with restaurants and shops opening and daily rush-hour traffic resuming.</p> <p>As it became clear there were dozens of cases, mostly linked to the Xinfadi food market, there was an abrupt reversal. Southern Fengtai district, where the market is located, has more than 2 million residents, and 11 residential compounds and several schools near the market have been closed.</p> <p>Movement restrictions were also brought back across the capital, sports events were <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-06/13/c_139135808.htm\">suspended</a>, tourism from other parts of the country barred and plans to reopen primary schools put on hold.</p> <p>The new infections sparked a panic about salmon, which was pulled from supermarkets around the country after cutting boards used to prepare imported salmon were among surfaces that tested positive for the virus. Fish cannot be infected by coronavirus.</p> <p>Six new domestic infections were reported on Saturday, three workers at the Xinfadi market, two people who had visited and a work colleague of one of the visitors.</p> <p>Mass testing of hundreds of people working at the market uncovered a further 45 asymptomatic cases. The market claims to be the largest wholesale agricultural market in Asia, and <a href=\"http://www.bjnews.com.cn/\">Beijing News reported</a> that it supplies nearly 90% of the city\u2019s fruit and vegetables.tT</p> <p>Officials have quarantined 139 close contacts of people infected.

More than 10,000 people who work there will now be tested.</p> <p>\u201cIn accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,\u201d said Chu Junwei, a district official. The district is in a \u201cwartime emergency mode\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Underlining government concerns, volunteers were going door to door in distant parts of the city on Saturday asking if anyone had visited the Xinfadi market recently. There will be mass testing of anyone who has been there since the end of May.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Parts of Beijing have reimposed lockdown measures after a cluster of locally transmitted coronavirus cases emerged nearly two months after the Chinese capital appeared to have stamped out the virus. The outbreak, linked to a major wholesale food market, raised serious questions about the challenges of keeping the disease at bay, even in countries such as China where authoritarian rule allows harsh containment regulations and invasive tracing systems. The first case in the new outbreak was discovered on Thursday after a 52-year old man tested positive, prompting the district where he lives to raise its risk level to medium. Beijing had previously gone 55 days in which the only new infections were citizens returning from other countries. The city had largely returned to normal life, with restaurants and shops opening and daily rush-hour traffic resuming. As it became clear there were dozens of cases, mostly linked to the Xinfadi food market, there was an abrupt reversal. Southern Fengtai district, where the market is located, has more than 2 million residents, and 11 residential compounds and several schools near the market have been closed. Movement restrictions were also brought back across the capital, sports events were suspended, tourism from other parts of the country barred and plans to reopen primary schools put on hold. The new infections sparked a panic about salmon, which was pulled from supermarkets around the country after cutting boards used to prepare imported salmon were among surfaces that tested positive for the virus. Fish cannot be infected by coronavirus. Six new domestic infections were reported on Saturday, three workers at the Xinfadi market, two people who had visited and a work colleague of one of the visitors. Mass testing of hundreds of people working at the market uncovered a further 45 asymptomatic cases. The market claims to be the largest wholesale agricultural market in Asia, and Beijing News reported that it supplies nearly 90% of the city\u2019s fruit and vegetables.tT Officials have quarantined 139 close contacts of people infected. The marketis closed and surrounded by military and police on 24-hour watch. More than 10,000 people who work there will now be tested. \u201cIn accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,\u201d said Chu Junwei, a district official. The district is in a \u201cwartime emergency mode\u201d, he said. Underlining government concerns, volunteers were going door to door in distant parts of the city on Saturday asking if anyone had visited the Xinfadi market recently. There will be mass testing of anyone who has been there since the end of May.",

A biography of the first lady published last year (title: Free, Melania) describes her as \u201can enigma\u201d and that language has been echoed repeatedly elsewhere. But Melania is not a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. She\u2019s just an opportunist wrapped in Chanel. \u2018Breonna\u2019s Law\u2019 passed in Louisville, Kentucky \u201cNo-knock\u201d search warrants have been banned in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old emergency technician killed by police in March while asleep in her own home. It is great that Taylor is getting legislation named after her, but you know what would be make it even better? Actually seeing justice get done. The police officers who killed her still haven\u2019t been arrested or fired. What makes this even more infuriating is the fact that there have been sexual assault allegations against Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in Taylor\u2019s shootings. Egypt wages war against young TikTok stars In recent months Egyptian authorities have arrested a number of female social media influencers, accusing them of spreading \u201cimmorality\u201d. One of the women in question was charged with \u201cpromoting debauchery\u201d after posting a TikTok video in which, sobbing, she said she had been gang-raped. Malta\u2019s abortion taboo leaves women in despair The Catholic island nation is the only EU country that has a total ban on abortion \u2013 there aren\u2019t even any exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother. This is awful at the best of times, but border closures during the coronavirus crisis have made things even worse. A charity that helps people travel from Malta to countries with more liberal laws says it saw a huge increase in calls to its hotline when borders closed in March: \u201cThe contacts we are getting are a lot more frantic.\u201d Audrey Gelman steps down as CEO of the Wing Gelman\u2019s resignation comes after numerous controversies and accusations by employees that the trendy (and expensive) women\u2019s club \u201cdoesn\u2019t practice the intersectional feminism that it preaches to the rest of the world\u201d. Anna Wintour is a \u2018colonial broad\u2019 That\u2019s according to Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, the former Vogue editor-at-large. \u201cShe\u2019s part of an environment of colonialism,\u201d the 71-year-old said in an interview. \u201cShe is entitled and I do not think she will ever let anything get in the way of her white privilege.\u201d Samira Nasr is the first black editor-in-chief of Harper\u2019s Bazaar It only took the publication 153 years to catch up with the times. The first US woman to walk in space dives to deepest point in the ocean It is safe to say that Kathy Sullivan is having a rather more productive lockdown than the rest of us. NYC Health has hole-some tips for safe coronavirus sex The New York City health department\u2019s updated advice for \u201csafer sex and Covid-19\u201d has raised a number of eyebrows as it rather seems like they\u2019re endorsing glory holes.",

      "body": "<p>London to Glasgow is a small hop for an Airbus A320 jet. But it will be a significant leap out of lockdown for easyJet when its first scheduled flight since late March takes to the skies at 7am on Monday.</p> <p>No passenger has climbed into its orange-and-white planes since 11 weeks ago, when the airline shut down operations after flying its last holidaymakers from Tenerife back to Gatwick. At dizzying speed, European airlines have seen a virus whose risks had seemed distant and marginal put their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/airline-job-losses-could-be-on-scale-of-1980s-mining-industry-report-warns\" title=\"\">entire existence in doubt</a>.</p> <p>Revenues have dried up, thousands of staff have been furloughed or given notice of redundancy, and airport terminals have been closed or left eerily empty, while airlines sought emergency loans to survive.</p> <p>Now, even though Covid-19 is in retreat (at best), airlines are praying for business to return. Some have kept flying a few routes throughout the restrictions, but this week will see a first, small ramp-up of services, among which easyJet\u2019s resurrection is the most significant in the UK.</p> <p>Only 10 aircraft of its fleet of more than 300 will be in service on Monday, operating domestic flights between airports including Bristol, Liverpool, Belfast and Newcastle, as well as services within continental Europe around Switzerland, France, Italy and Portugal. A total of 310 flights are scheduled this week.</p> <p>Ryanair has maintained a skeleton service between Dublin and British airports and a handful of flights from Stansted to Europe while grounding 99% of its aircraft. Next Sunday it adds 79 routes between the UK and Ireland and Poland, which has reopened borders and lifted restrictions this weekend. From July, the airline hopes to bring back 40% of its schedule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There will be enough reminders plastered around to not touch anything as to make the hardiest traveller a nervous germophobe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>British Airways \u2013 the flag carrier now branded a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d by MPs for its plans to cut jobs and alter conditions \u2013 had announced its intention to restart flying in earnest from July. Now it says schedules will remain under review because of the quarantine rules instigated last week, which outraged airlines just as they were making plans to \u201csave summer\u201d.</p> <p>The row still rages. The three biggest UK carriers, easyJet, BA and Ryanair, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/ba-easyjet-and-ryanair-begin-court-action-over-uk-quarantine-rules\" title=\"\">launched legal action</a> to tackle what BA\u2019s owner, IAG, has labelled the \u201cirrational and disproportionate\u201d rules that make passengers flying into the UK self-isolate for 14 days. As tourism and travel bosses have emphasised, the restrictions effectively kill any possible leisure travel, inbound or outbound.</p> <p>Another spat has blown up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/uk-air-passengers-urged-not-to-take-hand-luggage-on-planes\" title=\"\">about the safety of hand luggage</a>, after the government published its advice \u2013 drawn up with the industry \u2013 on what safe air travel might look like. Ryanair swiftly described it as nonsense.</p> <p>In any event, life on board will be, for now, very different. Face coverings are to become mandatory on planes and advisory throughout the airports, as on all UK public transport from Monday.</p> <p>Trolley service is to be scrapped or reduced, distancing enforced where possible, toilet visits discouraged, and enough reminders plastered around to wash hands and not touch anything as to make the hardiest traveller a nervous germophobe. While most will welcome the focus on safety, the experience is likely to become \u2013 more than ever \u2013 an endurance test rather than a pleasure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c27993214a742f3a0bee420db65ef5f99aebb1a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c27993214a742f3a0bee420db65ef5f99aebb1a6/0_368_2841_3549/801.jpg\" alt=\"A girl with her suitcase wearing an animal-face face mask\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EasyJet is promising special face coverings for children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Alexander/PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Captain David Morgan, easyJet\u2019s director of flight operations, who will take the first flight out of Gatwick, acknowledges the changes could be a shock to some. \u201cWe\u2019ll have \u2026 enhanced aircraft disinfection, customers and crew will be required to wear masks on board, and initially we won\u2019t serve any food or drinks.\u201d The measures will he says, remain for as long as is needed while coronavirus remains a threat \u2013 certainly, most would assume, the next few months. It\u2019s probably bearable for necessary travel, but hardly enticing for leisure.</p> <p>Morgan concedes that \u201cthe airport environment could feel a little different for younger travellers when flying over the summer holidays\u201d. If few parents can ever have happily contemplated the airport stage of a family trip, the lurking threat of a deadly virus may push the dread too far, even despite easyJet\u2019s efforts to ease the pain by issuing comic face mask covers (for kids).</p> <p>And yet, according to the initial experience of airlines abroad, passengers appear ready to fly. John Strickland, a consultant, points to France and Turkey, where internal flights have restarted. \u201cThe domestic market looks quite buoyant \u2026 destinations are opening up and there has been a spike in travel and searches,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as the straitjacket is taken off by government, people seem to be booking travel.\u201d</p> <p>Load factors \u2013 the average proportion of seats on a flight that are occupied \u2013 have surpassed 70% in Turkey. In the UK, however, optimism over bookings has been quashed by quarantine restrictions, and Strickland is downbeat about their prospects. \u201cThere is risk to adding capacity: airlines need a lead time to generate sufficient bookings. Even if the government was to change tack or introduce air bridges, it would take weeks. The summer season is already under way. It\u2019s good to see these hesitant signs of interest in travelling \u2013 but there is a lot of work to be done still to build confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Aviation bodies have seized on the European commission\u2019s calls to lift all intra-EU travel restrictions from Monday to stress that passengers can fly safely. The International Air Transport Association has claimed that enhanced biosafety measures make \u201cairport and aircraft environments exceptionally sanitised and controlled public spaces\u201d. Patrick Ky, the executive director of the EU air safety agency, Easa, said: \u201cWe are confident that, providing individuals behave responsibly and abide by the measures being put in place by airports and airlines, passengers can return to the skies with confidence.\u201d</p> <p>But while the cooped-up population may be emboldened to take a quick break in Portugal, a rally for the long-haul travel that once filled BA\u2019s coffers looks further off. \u201cRecovery on long haul will be years out \u2013 and business travel will be reduced significantly,\u201d says Strickland.</p>",

But it will be a significant leap out of lockdown for easyJet when its first scheduled flight since late March takes to the skies at 7am on Monday. No passenger has climbed into its orange-and-white planes since 11 weeks ago, when the airline shut down operations after flying its last holidaymakers from Tenerife back to Gatwick. At dizzying speed, European airlines have seen a virus whose risks had seemed distant and marginal put their entire existence in doubt. Revenues have dried up, thousands of staff have been furloughed or given notice of redundancy, and airport terminals have been closed or left eerily empty, while airlines sought emergency loans to survive. Now, even though Covid-19 is in retreat (at best), airlines are praying for business to return. Some have kept flying a few routes throughout the restrictions, but this week will see a first, small ramp-up of services, among which easyJet\u2019s resurrection is the most significant in the UK. Only 10 aircraft of its fleet of more than 300 will be in service on Monday, operating domestic flights between airports including Bristol, Liverpool, Belfast and Newcastle, as well as services within continental Europe around Switzerland, France, Italy and Portugal. A total of 310 flights are scheduled this week. Ryanair has maintained a skeleton service between Dublin and British airports and a handful of flights from Stansted to Europe while grounding 99% of its aircraft. Next Sunday it adds 79 routes between the UK and Ireland and Poland, which has reopened borders and lifted restrictions this weekend. From July, the airline hopes to bring back 40% of its schedule. British Airways \u2013 the flag carrier now branded a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d by MPs for its plans to cut jobs and alter conditions \u2013 had announced its intention to restart flying in earnest from July. Now it says schedules will remain under review because of the quarantine rules instigated last week, which outraged airlines just as they were making plans to \u201csave summer\u201d. The row still rages. The three biggest UK carriers, easyJet, BA and Ryanair, have launched legal action to tackle what BA\u2019s owner, IAG, has labelled the \u201cirrational and disproportionate\u201d rules that make passengers flying into the UK self-isolate for 14 days. As tourism and travel bosses have emphasised, the restrictions effectively kill any possible leisure travel, inbound or outbound. Another spat has blown up about the safety of hand luggage, after the government published its advice \u2013 drawn up with the industry \u2013 on what safe air travel might look like. Ryanair swiftly described it as nonsense. In any event, life on board will be, for now, very different. Face coverings are to become mandatory on planes and advisory throughout the airports, as on all UK public transport from Monday. Trolley service is to be scrapped or reduced, distancing enforced where possible, toilet visits discouraged, and enough reminders plastered around to wash hands and not touch anything as to make the hardiest traveller a nervous germophobe. While most will welcome the focus on safety, the experience is likely to become \u2013 more than ever \u2013 an endurance test rather than a pleasure. Captain David Morgan, easyJet\u2019s director of flight operations, who will take the first flight out of Gatwick, acknowledges the changes could be a shock to some. \u201cWe\u2019ll have \u2026 enhanced aircraft disinfection, customers and crew will be required to wear masks on board, and initially we won\u2019t serve any food or drinks.\u201d The measures will he says, remain for as long as is needed while coronavirus remains a threat \u2013 certainly, most would assume, the next few months. It\u2019s probably bearable for necessary travel, but hardly enticing for leisure. Morgan concedes that \u201cthe airport environment could feel a little different for younger travellers when flying over the summer holidays\u201d. If few parents can ever have happily contemplated the airport stage of a family trip, the lurking threat of a deadly virus may push the dread too far, even despite easyJet\u2019s efforts to ease the pain by issuing comic face mask covers (for kids). And yet, according to the initial experience of airlines abroad, passengers appear ready to fly. John Strickland, a consultant, points to France and Turkey, where internal flights have restarted. \u201cThe domestic market looks quite buoyant \u2026 destinations are opening up and there has been a spike in travel and searches,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as the straitjacket is taken off by government, people seem to be booking travel.\u201d Load factors \u2013 the average proportion of seats on a flight that are occupied \u2013 have surpassed 70% in Turkey. In the UK, however, optimism over bookings has been quashed by quarantine restrictions, and Strickland is downbeat about their prospects. \u201cThere is risk to adding capacity: airlines need a lead time to generate sufficient bookings. Even if the government was to change tack or introduce air bridges, it would take weeks. The summer season is already under way. It\u2019s good to see these hesitant signs of interest in travelling \u2013 but there is a lot of work to be done still to build confidence.\u201d Aviation bodies have seized on the European commission\u2019s calls to lift all intra-EU travel restrictions from Monday to stress that passengers can fly safely. The International Air Transport Association has claimed that enhanced biosafety measures make \u201cairport and aircraft environments exceptionally sanitised and controlled public spaces\u201d. Patrick Ky, the executive director of the EU air safety agency, Easa, said: \u201cWe are confident that, providing individuals behave responsibly and abide by the measures being put in place by airports and airlines, passengers can return to the skies with confidence.\u201d But while the cooped-up population may be emboldened to take a quick break in Portugal, a rally for the long-haul travel that once filled BA\u2019s coffers looks further off. \u201cRecovery on long haul will be years out \u2013 and business travel will be reduced significantly,\u201d says Strickland.",

The knee has always been on our neck and we can\u2019t breathe. Enough is enough with overt racism, covert racism, the microaggressions every day!\u201d Cheers ripple down the park. A sign reading \u2018Treat Racism Like Covid\u2019 bobs high, while Hayles calls for local schools to recruit black governors and for children to be taught a decolonised history. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think St Albans has a problem, wake up \u2013 we have it massively and we need you allies. We need every race to stand up.\u201d</p> <p>The protest to show solidarity with Black Lives Matter has been organised by Sanya Qayyum, a 21-year-old British Pakistani accountant. \u201cDo not fear, this is your fight,\u201d she says, addressing the black attendees. \u201cYou will not fight alone: we are with you.\u201d The park takes a knee for the excruciating eight minutes and 46 seconds that Floyd brutally bore one on his neck.</p> <p>Hayles has no experience of leading protests and works as a childminder. \u201cSt Albans has never seen anything like this.

Despite the pandemic, hundreds of peaceful demonstrations have taken place over the last week with more than 155,000 protestors gathering organically, by word of mouth and social media, without networks or experience.</p> <p>In British towns from Ledbury to Prestwich, Darlington to Blackpool, anger and frustration at generations of racial injustice has burned up young, first-time activists. A DIY sense of community is palpable; scrappy homemade signs and face masks replace glossy placards and loudspeakers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m asthmatic. I\u2019ve been shielding for 12 weeks and I know the Covid risks are even higher for me as they are for all BAME people, but this is life and death too,\u201d says Khady Gueye who has lived in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, her whole life.</p> <p>Gueye and Eleni Eldridge-Tull, both 24-year-old students, tell the <em>Observer</em> that they pitched \u201ca celebration of BAME culture\u201d in Bathurst Park, Gloucestershire. Having secured agreement from the police, the local and district councils, they methodically planned for up to 1,200 people to attend the event on Friday socially distanced by cones set three metres apart. Gueye weathered significant racist abuse for her efforts but was also surprised by the support received. Yet, at the 11th hour on Thursday evening, Lydney council withdrew its support in a letter signed by the mayor in a decision taken without the knowledge or vote of other councillors.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am used to these things being a trend \u2013 white people move on quickly \u2013 but this feels different.

I\u2019ll get told \u2018this is classic, pathetic black behaviour, you always feel sorry for yourself\u2019. It\u2019s sad I can\u2019t express my emotions and am allowing [others] to control the way I behave, but the area I live in means I would rather not get emotionally involved in case I hinder the movement as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>In Ramsgate, 2,000 people marched peacefully on Saturday afternoon along the coast to Broadstairs, a follow-up to a similarly well-supported demonstration last week. \u201cI almost had a heart attack last weekend \u2013 we were expecting 500 and 3,000 turned up,\u201d says Ayaan Bulale.</p> <p>Bulale, a 46-year-old British-Somali mother from Margate, says she is \u201ca keyboard warrior\u201d with no prior experience of organising street protests but she is undeterred by threats of violence from the far right and football gangs, which led to a number of protests being cancelled.</p> <p>\u201cI was 17 when I watched the video of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/22/rodney-king-riots-25-year-anniversary-los-angeles\">Rodney King beaten by the LAPD </a>and I can never watch one of those videos again. My own daughter is 17 now and this has set her on fire. I am used to these things being a trend \u2013 white people move on very quickly \u2013 but this feels different. It\u2019s like people are waking up, they\u2019re understanding they need to be part of the conversation and reprogramme themselves to be anti-racist. They\u2019re asking me for book recommendations, that\u2019s never happened before.\u201d</p> <p>The district has been hit hard by the coronavirus, with an unemployment rate the highest in Kent at 9%. In some wards, child poverty runs at 50%. Yet on Wednesday, local Tory MP Craig McKinlay called for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/edward-colston-statue-retrieved-bristol-harbour-black-lives-matter\">statue of Edward Colston</a>, toppled in Bristol by anti-racist campaigners and dunked in the Avon river, to be rehoused in Ramsgate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c33dec04dc6e741b5fc7aa74f2c48eb024a73c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c33dec04dc6e741b5fc7aa74f2c48eb024a73c88/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Verulamium Park, St Albans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Verulamium Park, St Albans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur own MP has also claimed racism doesn\u2019t exist here,\u201d says Bulale. \u201cNo racism, but we had the only Ukip council in the country?\u201d</p> <p>Although the momentum is still building, older campaigners in the UK are unsure how the movement will harness energy for change. The vacuum in leadership is another concern.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter UK, which has taken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/donations-to-black-lives-matter-uk-and-other-groups-top-1m\">more than \u00a31m in donations</a> in recent weeks, had remained dormant until recently and has regrouped with a core of around 10 activists. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshua-virasami\">Joshua Virasami</a>, who has been with the movement since its incarnation, says the left must unite unequivocally if the battle is to be won.</p> <p>\u201cSectarianism will be the death of us \u2013 but people are really belligerent about their politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, there is something unique about the fact Black Lives Matter is a ubiquitous slogan people can call out. You don\u2019t have to be a black Marxist or a person of colour to understand that it\u2019s about being for justice. For now, it\u2019s an umbrella for everyone.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dismal grey clouds hang low and gloomy in St Albans on Friday evening as more than 1,000 people space out in Verulamium Park. Lightning energy comes in the form of Shelley Hayles, a black mother born and raised in the city, who takes the mic on a plywood table turned makeshift stage. \u201cGeorge Floyd can\u2019t just be another name. The knee has always been on our neck and we can\u2019t breathe. Enough is enough with overt racism, covert racism, the microaggressions every day!\u201d Cheers ripple down the park. A sign reading \u2018Treat Racism Like Covid\u2019 bobs high, while Hayles calls for local schools to recruit black governors and for children to be taught a decolonised history. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think St Albans has a problem, wake up \u2013 we have it massively and we need you allies. We need every race to stand up.\u201d The protest to show solidarity with Black Lives Matter has been organised by Sanya Qayyum, a 21-year-old British Pakistani accountant. \u201cDo not fear, this is your fight,\u201d she says, addressing the black attendees. \u201cYou will not fight alone: we are with you.\u201d The park takes a knee for the excruciating eight minutes and 46 seconds that Floyd brutally bore one on his neck. Hayles has no experience of leading protests and works as a childminder. \u201cSt Albans has never seen anything like this. For the first time in my life, I feel change is coming.\u201d This small Hertfordshire city on the commuter belt is overwhelmingly white but the crowd is broadly mixed in ethnicity, age and class. Parents have been brought by their children and vice versa. The last time Kate Cooper and Nick Scott say they demonstrated was against the poll tax in 1990. \u201cWe had to be here and do something,\u201d says Cooper, \u201cif you don\u2019t speak out now, you are tolerating racism.\u201d To the surprise of established activists, Black Lives Matter protests mushrooming across the country have not been divided by racial lines, nor co-opted by experienced leaders. Despite the pandemic, hundreds of peaceful demonstrations have taken place over the last week with more than 155,000 protestors gathering organically, by word of mouth and social media, without networks or experience. In British towns from Ledbury to Prestwich, Darlington to Blackpool, anger and frustration at generations of racial injustice has burned up young, first-time activists. A DIY sense of community is palpable; scrappy homemade signs and face masks replace glossy placards and loudspeakers. \u201cI\u2019m asthmatic. I\u2019ve been shielding for 12 weeks and I know the Covid risks are even higher for me as they are for all BAME people, but this is life and death too,\u201d says Khady Gueye who has lived in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, her whole life. Gueye and Eleni Eldridge-Tull, both 24-year-old students, tell the Observer that they pitched \u201ca celebration of BAME culture\u201d in Bathurst Park, Gloucestershire. Having secured agreement from the police, the local and district councils, they methodically planned for up to 1,200 people to attend the event on Friday socially distanced by cones set three metres apart. Gueye weathered significant racist abuse for her efforts but was also surprised by the support received. Yet, at the 11th hour on Thursday evening, Lydney council withdrew its support in a letter signed by the mayor in a decision taken without the knowledge or vote of other councillors. \u201cThey underlined All Lives Matter three times in the letter,\u201d says Eldridge-Tull. \u201cWe were forced to cancel.\u201d The slogan \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d is often used as a hostile rebuttal and a critique that overlooks the premise that if all lives did matter equally, then the Black Lives Matter movement would not need to exist. \u201cThis is a very white area and that\u2019s why I felt it was extra important to have this positive message, to help people become aware,\u201d says Gueye. \u201cI am upset, but I can\u2019t be the angry black girl. I\u2019ll get told \u2018this is classic, pathetic black behaviour, you always feel sorry for yourself\u2019. It\u2019s sad I can\u2019t express my emotions and am allowing [others] to control the way I behave, but the area I live in means I would rather not get emotionally involved in case I hinder the movement as a whole.\u201d In Ramsgate, 2,000 people marched peacefully on Saturday afternoon along the coast to Broadstairs, a follow-up to a similarly well-supported demonstration last week. \u201cI almost had a heart attack last weekend \u2013 we were expecting 500 and 3,000 turned up,\u201d says Ayaan Bulale. Bulale, a 46-year-old British-Somali mother from Margate, says she is \u201ca keyboard warrior\u201d with no prior experience of organising street protests but she is undeterred by threats of violence from the far right and football gangs, which led to a number of protests being cancelled. \u201cI was 17 when I watched the video of Rodney King beaten by the LAPD and I can never watch one of those videos again. My own daughter is 17 now and this has set her on fire. I am used to these things being a trend \u2013 white people move on very quickly \u2013 but this feels different. It\u2019s like people are waking up, they\u2019re understanding they need to be part of the conversation and reprogramme themselves to be anti-racist. They\u2019re asking me for book recommendations, that\u2019s never happened before.\u201d The district has been hit hard by the coronavirus, with an unemployment rate the highest in Kent at 9%. In some wards, child poverty runs at 50%. Yet on Wednesday, local Tory MP Craig McKinlay called for the statue of Edward Colston, toppled in Bristol by anti-racist campaigners and dunked in the Avon river, to be rehoused in Ramsgate. \u201cOur own MP has also claimed racism doesn\u2019t exist here,\u201d says Bulale. \u201cNo racism, but we had the only Ukip council in the country?\u201d Although the momentum is still building, older campaigners in the UK are unsure how the movement will harness energy for change. The vacuum in leadership is another concern. Black Lives Matter UK, which has taken more than \u00a31m in donations in recent weeks, had remained dormant until recently and has regrouped with a core of around 10 activists. Joshua Virasami, who has been with the movement since its incarnation, says the left must unite unequivocally if the battle is to be won. \u201cSectarianism will be the death of us \u2013 but people are really belligerent about their politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, there is something unique about the fact Black Lives Matter is a ubiquitous slogan people can call out. You don\u2019t have to be a black Marxist or a person of colour to understand that it\u2019s about being for justice. For now, it\u2019s an umbrella for everyone.\u201d",

With little to \u2018counter-protest\u2019, groups including veterans, football hooligans and far-right extremists descended into rioting and attacks on officers who were stationed to \u2013 wait for it \u2013 protect those very statues. There were reports of heavy drinking, chants of \u201cEngland\u201d and Nazi salutes, which is very confusing given they were supposedly there to \u2018protect\u2019 the statue of Churchill who, er, led Britain in war against the Nazis. Nope, me neither. </li> \n   <li><strong>The home secretary Priti Patel said these were acts of \u201cunacceptable thuggery\u201d and \u201cperpetrators should feel the full force of the law\u201d. </strong>The appalling, riotous scenes were swiftly condemned by MPs and other public figures. However, the prime minister Boris Johnson, who has previously condemned violent minorities hijacking BLM protests as \u201cthugs\u201d, has yet to comment on today\u2019s activities.</li> \n   <li><strong>Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protests took place across England.</strong> Among them was a large, socially distanced demonstration on the Brighton seafront and marches in Newcastle, Bristol and St Albans.</li> \n   <li><strong>A socially distanced military ceremony was held at Windsor in place of Trooping the Colour to mark the Queen\u2019s official birthday. </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll rose by 181 to 41,662.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p> That\u2019s all from us today on the UK side.

And if the grandparents have two or more children who live alone, they will have to choose between them.</p> \n  <p>Downing Street has acknowledged not everyone will benefit from the change, although officials have hinted at a further loosening of the rules if the coronavirus outbreak continues to decline.</p> \n  <p><em>Can households form more than one bubble?</em><br>No. The arrangement must be exclusive with no switching of bubble partners.</p> \n  <p><em>Will people have to formally register these bubble arrangements?</em><br>No, it will be taken on trust. No 10 says the public has shown \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d in following the social distancing rules so far.</p> \n  <p><em>Is there any limit on the distance between households in a bubble?</em><br>No, although officials are suggesting people should try to \u201cstay local\u201d where possible.</p> \n  <p><em>What about vulnerable people who are shielding due to their age or health problems?<br></em>At the moment, officials say it is too soon for them to be able to join support bubbles.</p> \n  <p><em>What about parents who are separated but who currently share childcare, with the children moving between the two households?</em><br>That will continue. If the parents are the only adult in the household they can form a bubble with another household \u2013 meaning the children could potentially be in two bubbles, one for each parent.</p> \n  <p><em>What happens if someone in a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms?</em><br>All members of both households in the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days.</p> \n  <p><em>Does this apply only to England?</em><br>A scheme in Northern Ireland has also been brought in from Saturday. This is for a person who lives alone, and can visit someone else\u2019s private dwelling, including staying one or more nights. If they have a child or children living with them they do not qualify.

With little to \u2018counter-protest\u2019, groups including veterans, football hooligans and far-right extremists descended into rioting and attacks on officers who were stationed to \u2013 wait for it \u2013 protect those very statues. There were reports of heavy drinking, chants of \u201cEngland\u201d and Nazi salutes, which is very confusing given they were supposedly there to \u2018protect\u2019 the statue of Churchill who, er, led Britain in war against the Nazis. Nope, me neither. The home secretary Priti Patel said these were acts of \u201cunacceptable thuggery\u201d and \u201cperpetrators should feel the full force of the law\u201d. The appalling, riotous scenes were swiftly condemned by MPs and other public figures. However, the prime minister Boris Johnson, who has previously condemned violent minorities hijacking BLM protests as \u201cthugs\u201d, has yet to comment on today\u2019s activities. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protests took place across England. Among them was a large, socially distanced demonstration on the Brighton seafront and marches in Newcastle, Bristol and St Albans. A socially distanced military ceremony was held at Windsor in place of Trooping the Colour to mark the Queen\u2019s official birthday. The UK death toll rose by 181 to 41,662. That\u2019s all from us today on the UK side. If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Rightwing demonstrators, who announced they would turn out on Saturday to protect London\u2019s monuments from anti-racism protesters, were involved in scuffles with police outside Parliament. In and around Parliament Square, hundreds of people wearing football shirts, chanting \u2018England, England\u2019 and describing themselves as patriots, gathered alongside military veterans at the Cenotaph war memorial. The group sang songs in support of rightwing activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who goes by the name of Tommy Robinson. \u2018Winston Churchill, he\u2019s one of our own,\u2019 they also chanted, near his statue which last weekend was sprayed with graffiti reading: \u2018Churchill was a racist\u2019. Police officers have entered the crowd and are now talking to demonstrators who remain in Parliament Square in the capital, PA Media reports. The 5pm curfew has passed and around 200 people are still in the area, with most focused around the statue of Churchill. A police helicopter continues to fly overhead. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood has called for the man in the picture below, who was part of the far-right gathering in Westminster today, to be identified. The image shows a man urinating on a memorial erected to honour PC Keith Palmer, the police officer who was killed while protecting Parliament during the Westminster Bridge terrorist attack in 2017. Ellwood had desperately performed CPR on Palmer at the time of the attack but the officer could not be saved. The plaque was erected outside the Houses of Parliament last February as a lasting tribute to Palmer\u2019s bravery and sacrifice. Away from the violent scenes involving far-right groups in Westminster, the Rt Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, Bishop of Dover, addressed a peaceful Black Lives Matter march in Canterbury and spoke of the need for people to be the change they want to see. Greeting protesters outside Canterbury Cathedral, she said: Let\u2019s together, in harmony, make the change that needs to happen. And if there is anyone in this crowd who has any idea of anything else, please, I\u2019m telling you, that takes away from what we are wanting to achieve. So let\u2019s work together - I am with you. The crowd at the London protest has thinned out after one of the exits to Parliament Square was opened, according to PA. A few hundred people remain in the area around the Houses of Parliament and the statue of Churchill. They remain gathered around an hour ahead of the 5pm deadline imposed by police for protests to end. A very interesting thread from the Telegraph\u2019s Ed Clowes at the riot in Whitehall Demonstrators at the Bristol cenotaph shouted \u201cScum\u201d and \u201cFascists\u201d at supporters of Black Lives Matter, PA Media reports. They also repeatedly sang \u201cThere\u2019s only one Winston Churchill...,\u201d and then broke into a rendition of God Save The Queen. A man briefly climbed on top of the plinth where slave trader Edward Colston\u2019s statue had stood for more than 100 years in Bristol city centre until it was torn down last week by supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. To a large round of applause and singing, he unfurled a union flag and waved it around before getting down. Here are some images from a peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration in Newington Green, London. In Bristol, a large group of bikers drove off to a round of applause from those gathered at the cenotaph. After they left there was some shouting between some of the protesters and a passing group of young adults and breaking glass could be heard. Uniformed police officers spoke to several of the men and the situation calmed down. Nearby, around a dozen supporters of the Black Lives Matter group gathered holding handwritten placards and stood in silence watching the main demonstration. A large number of police stood between the two groups. At the London protests several lines of police are now facing up against around 200 demonstrators near the Cenotaph. Protesters continue to shout and some are still trying to push through the barriers. More police are arriving to support those at the barrier, including at least two with police dogs. There is a large amount of broken glass on the street behind the officers after bottles were thrown, and a small number of protesters continue to guard the Cenotaph itself within the police cordon. A further 67 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in hospital in England. This takes the total number of recorded deaths in hospitals in England to 27,927, NHS England said. In Northern Ireland people living alone are able to reunite with their families on Saturday after three months of coronavirus lockdown. They will be able to meet with one other household to combat loneliness caused by the social-distancing restrictions, the first minister, Arlene Foster, said. It means an isolated grandparent will be able to see and hug their grandchildren again, and partners separated by the pandemic since March can meet up without needing to observe a 2-metre distance. People can also stay overnight if they wish. The number of people who can meet outside has increased from six to 10, but social distancing must still be observed by these groups to limit the risk of transmission. Elsewhere on Saturday, several hundred people attended a demonstration outside Belfast\u2019s city hall to protect war memorials after several statues were threatened in England and elsewhere. The demonstration passed off without any incidents. The Police Service of Northern Ireland had urged people to avoid attending public gatherings and \u201cto put public safety first and stay away\u201d. It said health protection guidelines are still in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. All non-essential shops and shopping centres were able to reopen on Friday as Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to make the move. Shops in the Irish Republic opened on Monday, with shopping centres to open next week. On Friday, the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) published its latest figures which includes all fatalities where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate. By 5 June, it had recorded 779 deaths in total and it said such deaths had now fallen for the sixth consecutive week. Protesters have been partly kettled by police in Parliament Square, with all exits now apparently blocked by police in riot gear. Although numbers have thinned since earlier, some protesters who have remained are becoming confrontational with police now, chanting and arguing with officers on police lines. There were confrontations with officers at Westminster Bridge earlier, now protesters are facing off with police at Great George Street. An officer said one road from the square had been left open for people to leave. Earlier the Metropolitan police said a section 60 order had been imposed on the entire area, allowing officers to stop and search without suspicion. Public Health Wales has said a further six people have died after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of deaths to 1,441. There were 45 new confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total to 14,703 since the beginning of the outbreak. Two further coronavirus-linked deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, taking the total recorded by the Department of Health to 541. There were three new confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total to 4,841 since the pandemic began. This, from Danny Wallace, will be left here. This is from the shadow home office minister Jess Phillips Public Health Wales said a further six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total there to 1,441. A very important point raised by the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall. The Black Lives Matter protest was called off amid fears of clashes with right-wing counter-protesters, who have been clashing violently with police for the last few hours. Back in central London, demonstrators have clashed with police close to Westminster Bridge, with glass bottles thrown towards the officers and their vans, PA Media reports. At least one officer held up a baton towards the protesters who are chanting \u201cYou let your country down\u201d at the police. Other protesters in Parliament Square have marched towards the boarded-up monument of Churchill. Singing Rule Britannia and the national anthem, some had started banging on the sides of the hoarding. This is from LBC\u2019s EJ Ward A total of 2,447 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by five from 2,442 on Friday, the Scottish government has announced. New statistics show that 15,730 people have tested positive for the virus there, up by 21 from 15,709 the previous day. There are 983 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a rise of 69 in 24 hours. Of these patients, 20 were in intensive care, down by one from the previous day. More than 1,000 protesters have gathered in Brighton to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter demonstrations worldwide. Forming a mile-long line along the seafront, activists wearing black clothes and masks and carrying signs held a silent protest on Saturday afternoon. Observing social distancing where possible, the Brighton protesters joined together in applause in the balmy sun. Before the silent protest, the organiser Ellie Ruewell said to those planning to attend: We will be lining the closed Madeira Drive road along the seafront to show solidarity to all BIPOC (black, indigenous, people of colour) communities who continuously and tirelessly have their human rights challenged and fear dangerous oppression from authorities and governments alike. I need to again stress this is a peaceful, silent protest where we stand in solidarity. Protesters held signs calling out racism and prejudice, with one saying: If you had time to watch Tiger King, you had time to learn. Another echoed the phrase chanted across the world: No justice. No peace. The demonstration was watched over by Sussex police, with officers on foot and motorcycle seen at the edges of the crowd. Many of the protesters were later expected to join a separate event, marching through the streets of the East Sussex city. Several hundred people have gathered at the Cenotaph in Bristol city centre, PA Media reports. Protesters held up \u201cAll lives matter\u201d banners, but said they were not far-right supporters. One read: Not far right just ordinary people of all races from Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, Newport etc. United to defend the Cenotaph to defend the memory of people who died so that we are able to have the freedom to protest. Among those gathered was a large contingent of bikers who parked their motorbikes next to the war memorial. Video footage posted on social media showed several protesters removing the Black Lives Matter placards which had been left at the plinth where the Edward Colston statue stood until last weekend when it was pulled down and dumped in Bristol Harbour. There was a large police presence in the centre of Bristol watching those gathered, although from a distance. Among the dozens of police on duty were dog handlers and mounted officers. The gathering comes six days after a Black Lives Matter demonstration in the city during which the statue of the slave trader Colston was torn down. As we\u2019ve been reporting, thousands of right-wing protesters have descended on central London in spite of police and government warnings to stay away amid the coronavirus pandemic. A Black Lives Matter demonstration planned for today was brought forward a day over fears there would be clashes with far-right groups, and organisers urged people not to stage anti-racism rallies this weekend. However, people watching the events unfold are unsure about what the \u201ccounter-protesters\u201d are trying to achieve, or what they\u2019re actually angry about. It has been pointed out that they claim to want to \u201cdefend\u201d symbols of British history, yet they are violently clashing with police officers who are there to, er, protect the monuments. Then there is video footage which appears to show demonstrators \u201cdefending\u201d Churchill\u2019s statue and the Cenotaph by performing Nazi salutes and chanting \u201cEng-er-land\u201d. This, again, is very confusing. These are from Hope Not Hate From the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani In Parliament Square, several thousand mainly white protesters milled around, many of them drinking. Many police present were equipped with riot gear, but they carried their helmets rather than wearing them. The atmosphere was rowdy, with rumours of the arrival of \u201cAnteefa\u201d met with a surge towards the Victoria Street corner of the square and a face-off with police. Protesters hurled cans and a smoke canister at mounted police, who were initially pushed back but then advanced again to regain their previous positions. The incident passed without serious violence erupting, but police began strengthening their positions around the square. One protester told the Guardian that Antifa counter-protesters had made appearances a couple of times already at the demonstration. Protesters could be overheard asking each other: \u201cwhere are Antifa?\u201d and speculating over whether antifascist counter-protesters would arrive. Earlier, on Parliament Street, at the opposite corner of the square, hundreds standing at a police line chanted \u201cEn-ger-land\u201d and sang God Save the Queen. They broke into applause when a parade of veterans arrived, passing behind the police line carrying a flag with regimental colours. In the square, several statues, including those of Winston Churchill and Gandhi, had been boarded off. On the statue of Churchill, someone had stuck up a poster with a silhouette of a second world war soldier and a message that read: \u201cDo not destroy our history. Keep our history and learn from it so the same mistakes don\u2019t happen again.\u201d According to Hope Not Hate, a press photographer suffered a broken nose in a confrontation with some protesters. Video on the antiracist group\u2019s Twitter feed showed him being led away by police. The Guardian chose not to engage directly with protesters and ask for interviews. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, hascondemned those \u201cwho seem intent on causing violence and division\u201d and called scenes of violence against police officers \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Police on horseback are pushing demonstrators back from the other end of Parliament Square, near the boarded-up statues of Nelson Mandela and Gandhi, PA Media reports. Many of the protesters began running towards the other end of the square. Several bottles and cans were thrown at the officers, and a device emitted dark smoke into the crowd. Some of the demonstrators are blocking others in their group from the police horses. From LBC\u2019s Matthew Thompson From JOE\u2019s Oli Dugmore This is from Dan Sabbagh The home secretary, Priti Patel, has called acts of violence towards the police by right-wing protesters in Westminster \u201cunacceptable thuggery\u201d and said perpetrators \u201cshould expect to feel the full force of the law\u201d. Video footage shows protesters drinking alcohol, chanting \u201cEngland, England, England\u201d and throwing glass bottles at officers blockading Whitehall. The BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani reports that the Met police have imposed a Section 60 power, which allows officers greater use of stop-and-search powers. Police on horseback and with shields and helmets have arrived at the right-wing demonstration in London, PA Media reports. Around 100 protesters have returned to the barrier manned by officers near the Cenotaph, chanting Lee Rigby\u2019s name and singing the national anthem. Cans and glass bottles, including a large vodka bottle, have been thrown towards officers. Demonstrators have gathered in Newcastle city centre in a second show of solidarity with the global Black Lives Matter movement. Activists from Stand Up To Racism North East urged protesters to observe physical distancing and wear face coverings during the demonstration. A counter-protest by Defenders of Newcastle also gathered in the city centre, where there is a heavy police presence this afternoon. At Hyde Park on Saturday morning it looked as if most Black Lives Matter protesters had heeded calls to stay away from central London, with just a few antifascists present and two stalls run by the Socialist party selling news papers. The London Antifascist Assembly (LARAF), a group that has rallied to oppose nearly all rightwing mobilisations in London in recent years, became the latest group to call off its protest late on Friday night, and encouraged its supporters to attend local BLM protests instead. The decision to call off the rally came after a crackdown by the Metropolitan police on would-be protesters. Officers visited some people at their homes by police, the Guardian was told. Three protesters affiliated with green anarchist groups were arrested at Friday\u2019s BLM rally in Hyde Park and police also raided a squatted anarchist social centre in Islington on Friday night, according to the anarchist newspaper Freedom. Daisy, 26, from Pimlico, passed demonstrators in Parliament Square as she went for a run at around 10.30am and said many were already drinking alcohol. There were also reports of drinking and bottles being thrown at police by far-right groups in Whitehall. She told PA: They were all drinking beers and there was already loads of cans lying round on the floor treating it like it was some sort of football away-day. It was a really tense and hostile atmosphere. I didn\u2019t stay too long ... it was really uncomfortable. This is from JOE\u2019s Oli Dugmore A right-wing protest is underway in central London as the official Black Lives Matter march was called off. These are from the Guardians\u2019 Dan Sabbagh in Whitehall The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has waded into the debate about the role of statues and monuments in public history. In a letter sent to MPs, peers and councillors, Dowden said heritage should be used to educate people about all aspects of Britain\u2019s morally complex past \u201crather than air brushing history\u201d. He said he had spoken to Heritage England to ensure its approach remained against removing \u2018contested heritage\u2019. This is from Huck magazine And here are some more pictures from the scene in Whitehall. As several hundred demonstrators block roads around Parliament Square, police officers are encouraging them to move back on to the pavements, PA Media reports. A demonstrator from south London, who gave her name as Victoria, was in the square with a banner reading \u201cAll lives matter\u201d. Discussing controversial statues, she told PA: It\u2019s the past. You\u2019ve just got to learn to live with it, they\u2019ve done what they\u2019ve done but it\u2019s still in the records they did good things. I\u2019ve got things I don\u2019t want to remember, but I wouldn\u2019t go smashing things up because of it. Other police officers remain in a line blocking access to the Cenotaph on Whitehall, with some holding shields. Starting today, single adult households in England are able to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d with another household. Here is a handy guide to the new rules put together by PA. Who is covered by the new arrangements? Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of 18. What will they be able to do that they could not before? They can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes \u2013 staying overnight if they wish \u2013 and they will not have to observe the 2-metre social-distancing rule. Who might benefit? Older people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter, enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents, allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. Couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other. If one half of a couple shares a flat or house with one or more other people, they can see their partner as long as they live alone, but if their partner also shares a home they cannot see each other. And if several people share a flat or house and all have partners who live alone, only one will be able to see their partner, which could lead to some interesting conversations. This will affect large numbers of young people living in towns and cities. What about households where both grandparents are still living - can they now visit their children and grandchildren? At this stage only if their son or daughter is the only adult in the other household in the bubble. And if the grandparents have two or more children who live alone, they will have to choose between them. Downing Street has acknowledged not everyone will benefit from the change, although officials have hinted at a further loosening of the rules if the coronavirus outbreak continues to decline. Can households form more than one bubble? No. The arrangement must be exclusive with no switching of bubble partners. Will people have to formally register these bubble arrangements? No, it will be taken on trust. No 10 says the public has shown \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d in following the social distancing rules so far. Is there any limit on the distance between households in a bubble? No, although officials are suggesting people should try to \u201cstay local\u201d where possible. What about vulnerable people who are shielding due to their age or health problems? At the moment, officials say it is too soon for them to be able to join support bubbles. What about parents who are separated but who currently share childcare, with the children moving between the two households? That will continue. If the parents are the only adult in the household they can form a bubble with another household \u2013 meaning the children could potentially be in two bubbles, one for each parent. What happens if someone in a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms? All members of both households in the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days. Does this apply only to England? A scheme in Northern Ireland has also been brought in from Saturday. This is for a person who lives alone, and can visit someone else\u2019s private dwelling, including staying one or more nights. If they have a child or children living with them they do not qualify. This will be be reviewed on Monday. Here are some more videos from the Queen\u2019s socially distanced birthday ceremony, which was held at Windsor in place of Trooping the Colour. Several hundred people are now gathered in central London, with many centred around the Cenotaph, PA Media reports. A large crowd of demonstrators are on Whitehall singing the national anthem. Several were seen wearing military-style hats or jackets. A line of police officers has advanced, blocking more protesters from accessing the Cenotaph. The Queen\u2019s official birthday has been marked with a brief but poignant ceremonial tribute from the military \u2013 executed with precision despite social distancing. Soldiers from the Welsh Guards, who a few weeks ago were manning Covid-19 test centres, staged the unique event in the grounds of Windsor Castle, as the head of state made her first official public appearance since the lockdown was imposed. The traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony, which normally features hundreds of servicemen and women and thousands of spectators, was ruled out because of the coronavirus pandemic. But the Household Division \u2013 made up of the British\u2019s Army\u2019s most prestigious regiments \u2013 has a close affinity with the Queen and was keen to mark the milestone with a ceremony dubbed mini-Trooping. Lance Corporal Chusa Siwale, 29, originally from Zambia, had a central role in the ceremony which was created by Garrison Sergeant Major Warrant Officer Class 1 Andrew Stokes. The guardsman, whose regiment is part of the Household Division, said it was a \u201chuge privilege\u201d to be given the key role performing the drummer\u2019s call, during a \u201cvery difficult\u201d time for the country. He said: Only four weeks ago I was involved with testing key workers for Covid-19 as part of the Welsh Guards\u2019 contribution to the battle against the virus; now I am on parade performing in front of Her Majesty. This is a very proud day for me. As the Queen arrived in Windsor Castle\u2019s quadrangle the ceremony began when she took her place on a dais and the royal salute was given by the troops and the national anthem was played. An event like this marking the sovereign\u2019s birthday has not been staged at Windsor since 1895, when a ceremony was held in honour of Queen Victoria. Normally guardsmen stand shoulder-to-shoulder during drills or when formed up on the parade ground, allowing them to maintain \u201cdressing\u201d - staying in line with one another. But in keeping with Covid-19 guidelines, they stood 2.2 metres apart, measured by three turns of the garrison sergeant major\u2019s pace stick. Here is the live stream from ITV News The crowd at Parliament Square has now grown to around 150 people, largely white men. Paul Golding, leader of the far-right group Britain First, said they had turned out to \u201cguard our monuments\u201d, telling the PA news agency: I am extremely fed up with the way that the authorities have allowed two consecutive weekends of vandalism against our national monuments. Anyone who comes along today to try and vandalise them will probably be dealt with by all of these Englishmen that turned up, and they\u2019re fed up as well. When asked about the other boarded-up statues in Parliament Square, including one of Nelson Mandela, Golding said: Why should we have a communist terrorist mass murderer in the capital city of England? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. We would like to see that one go, on good grounds, but the rest of them are our historical heritage. When asked why demonstrators had gathered during a pandemic, with few present wearing masks, Golding referenced the large anti-racism gatherings of previous weeks. If it\u2019s good for one, it\u2019s good for the other. Soldiers from the Welsh Guards and musicians from the Massed Band of the Household Division have marched on to the parade area at Windsor Castle ahead of the start of the Queen\u2019s official birthday celebrations (see 10.01am.). The ceremony has been created in just over two weeks and allows the guardsmen to show their precision marching skills while maintaining a social distance of just over two metres. The event replaces the Trooping the Colour ceremony normally staged in central London which could not be held in its traditional form because of coronavirus. The British Medical Association (BMA) has demanded an explanation from the government following reports that pages containing recommendations to protect BAME communities were removed from last week\u2019s Covid-19 disparity review. In a letter sent to the health secretary Matt Hancock, Dr Chaand Nagpaul CBE, the head of the BMA, called for the 69 missing pages containing seven recommendations to be published immediately. He said: I\u2019m finding it inexplicable the government did not release the full report at a time not only when the BAME community suffered so disproportionately with the virus, but also at a time when there was global outcry and outrage to racial inequalities. Last week, Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, told the Commons that Public Health England (PHE) was unable to make any recommendations in its report on BAME people and coronavirus because some of the data needed was not available. But Prof Raj Bhopal, a scientist who had been asked to peer-review the unpublished recommendations file, told the BBC that parliament had \u201cnot been told the full truth\u201d. He described the recommendations document as an \u201copen secret\u201d and said it had \u201cevery hallmark of a [government] report ready to go to the press\u201d. You can read the full story here. A small crowd has gathered around the boarded-up statue of Winston Churchill opposite Parliament, PA Media reports. Around 50 people, including Paul Golding, the leader of far-right political group Britain First, have assembled in Parliament Square. Some of the group have also gathered around the nearby Cenotaph, which has also been boarded up. Several police officers were in attendance and a vehicle carrying police horses was also seen in the area. The mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the decision to board up statues in the capital had been taken on intelligence that the protests would likely be hijacked by counter-demonstrations by far-right groups. (see 9.37am.). Police have said those affiliated to the Black Lives Matter protests must remain north of a police barrier erected on Whitehall, while far-right protesters must remain to the south of the line. Shetland Staands wi Black Lives Matter is holding an inter-island socially distanced protest \u2013 where islanders take posters on their daily walk and photograph themselves for an accompanying online gallery \u2013 as well as an accompanying gathering in Lerwick. The global wave of protest following George Floyd\u2019s death has also swept through the islands, with organisers of Shetland\u2019s main Up Helly Aa Viking festival \u2013 which is also infamous for excluding women - announcing that the use of blackface \u201cwill not be tolerated\u201d amidst growing pressure for an outright ban. Mara Ival-Duncan, 19, told the Guardian that Shetland locals had started to educate themselves about the racism she has experienced herself growing up mixed race: Because Shetland is such a majority white community, they don\u2019t understand microaggressions, don\u2019t realise the many different forms racism comes in and don\u2019t even realise what they\u2019re doing. But with the momentum here and all around the world I can see people starting to educate themselves. The reforms to Up Helly Aa are particularly significant, she says. There are still people who are hurt by the fact blackface is now been banned but I think it\u2019s going to shake those people who are still stubborn and don\u2019t want to learn. In such small and sheltered community, with minimal diversity and lack of exposure to different cultures, being able to stand out against the crowd is a big deal. Following a plea from the home secretary for the public not to attend protests this weekend amid the public health emergency (see 9.37am.), the Met commander Bas Javid, brother of former chancellor Sajid, said he understood the depth of feeling of protesters, but asked people not to come to London while shutdown rules are still in force. If you were planning to come to London, I again would urge you to reconsider, but if you are still intent, please familiarise yourself with what the conditions are. Please keep yourself safe by complying with government guidance on social distancing. The Queen\u2019s official birthday will be marked by a new ceremony created amid the \u201cdevastating\u201d Covid-19 outbreak, a senior Army officer has said. Major General Christopher Ghika, whose men will pay tribute to the Queen on Saturday, said the event offers a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to commemorate the head of state\u2019s milestone. Windsor Castle will host the ceremony - in place of Trooping the Colour - featuring a small number of Welsh Guardsmen and military musicians taking part in a display of precision marching created to observe social distancing rules. Ghika, who commands the Household Division and all military support for London\u2019s civil response to coronavirus, said: The circumstances of the requirement to perform the birthday tribute at Windsor Castle this year are clouded in tragedy. The effects of Covid-19 have been devastating in terms of loss of life and the threatening of livelihoods of so many across the country. People have had to endure separation from loved ones, great uncertainty and the suspension of so much of what is special about our national life. Servicemen from the Household Division - which includes the Welsh Guards - have been formed into a Covid Support Force, with the soldiers carrying out coronavirus tests at regional and mobile sites. The Welsh Guards and many of those on parade have recently been deployed within the United Kingdom as part of the nation\u2019s response to the virus and so the context of the ceremony is particularly poignant. Normally Guardsmen stand shoulder-to-shoulder during their drills or when formed up on the parade ground, allowing them to maintain \u201cdressing\u201d or staying in line with one another. But in keeping with Covid-19 guidelines, each soldier will be tasked with standing 2.2 metres apart, measured by three turns of the Garrison Sergeant Major\u2019s pace stick. When the Queen arrives in the castle\u2019s quadrangle she will receive a royal salute which will be followed by a set of military drills before the colour of the Welsh Guards is trooped. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Llewelyn-Usher, the ceremony will last around 20 minutes and broadcaster Huw Edwards will host a BBC One programme covering the event live. Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Nicholas Soames, has said he was \u201cdeeply upset\u201d after his grandfather\u2019s statue was defaced. It has been boarded up ahead of more expected anti-racism protests in London. The former Conservative minister told the Daily Telegraph (paywall) the incident, in which the word \u201cracist\u201d was scrawled on the monument, shows British society has \u201clost its compass\u201d. Soames said the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was right to heed police advice and board up the statue and the nearby Cenotaph. I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way. These people who are marching did not set out to do this, but a very, very small, extremely explosive group of people who have made a practice of hijacking entirely responsible demonstrations are behaving in an unspeakable and cowardly manner. It feels like a society that has lost its compass. Good morning. With further Black Lives Matter demonstrations planned for this weekend, the home secretary, Priti Patel, has re-issued warnings that there is a \u201csevere public health risk\u201d and that large gatherings at this time remain \u201cillegal\u201d. In London, the mayor, Sadiq Khan, also urged people to stay away from central London and defended the decision to board up the statue of Winston Churchill and other monuments. He said the decision was taken amid concerns they could become a \u201cflashpoint for violence\u201d if the protests are hijacked by counter-demonstrations by far-right groups. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We had intelligence that extreme far-right groups are coming to central London, ostensibly they say to protect the statues. We think that these statues may be a flashpoint for violence and we are worried about extreme far-right groups getting involved in violence, vandalism, disorder with those protesting as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. That is one of the reasons I am asking people to stay away from central London. Those affiliated to the Black Lives Matter protests must remain north of a police barrier erected on Whitehall, while far-right protesters must remain to the south of the line. Khan also accused the home secretary of seeking to score \u201cpolitical points\u201d after she criticised the decision. She needs to see the intelligence that we have seen that the far right are intending to come to central London. One of their justifications for doing so is to protect these statues but also they are intending to remove statues of people like Nelson Mandela, so I think we have done the wise, precautionary thing. Rather than seeking to make political points out of this, what I hope is that central government would work with regional government and the police to make sure there isn\u2019t violence, vandalism or disorder or inadvertently the spreading of the virus. Police have told those planning on protesting in London that they must be off the streets by 5pm. Khan said protestors who did not disperse after 5pm risked being arrested, including people protesting peacefully. He told BBC Breakfast: The police can arrest, detain and charge, ultimately if you breach the conditions. Please feel free to get in touch to share news tips or stories we should be covering here.

      "bodyText": "This week the Australian stock market ended a run of seven days of rises, a run that has happened only three times in the past two and half years. It was a nice example that the stock market does not reflect your reality. The first thing to remember is that you would be hard-pressed to find a major economic measure that correlates with its performance. From early 1992 through to about 2012 there was a semi-decent relationship with the annual growth of the ASX200 (the best indicator of the Australian stock market) and what would happen to nominal GDP growth nine months later, but since 2012 that relationship has completely broken down. Movements in the stock market can be as much due to perception as reality. A company can announce a record profit but its share price can fall because investors were expecting a bigger profit. They are also generally more responsive to the announcement of bad news than to ongoing bad news. When the coronavirus hit, stock markets around the world sank as fast as they ever have. Both here and in the US, the market fell about 35% in less than a month. That at least makes sense to people: the economy is about to shut down so you would expect the value of companies\u2019 stocks to fall. But over the past three months the Australian stock market has risen strongly and by Wednesday was back to where it was in February last year and only about 15% below the peak of February this year. In the US things were even \u201cbetter\u201d. The S&amp;P500 was down just 5% on the pre-virus peaks, and the technology based Nasdaq Index had not only recovered all the losses of February and March it was breaking records. So the bad news is over? We\u2019re back and fully functioning again? Well, no. While there may be some link with reality and the value of stocks, a large proportion of what we\u2019re seeing is a reaction to things seemingly not being as bad as first thought, and also a wilful desire to pretend things are not as bad as they are. In America more than 5,500 people are still dying each week, and 150,000 people each week are still being diagnosed with Covid-19. This week it recorded 2m cases \u2013 and half have occurred since the end of April. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s Weekly Economic Index, which takes into account 20 economic measures, remains at a point that suggests America\u2019s GDP will fall 10% below what it was a year ago. In Australia, news that things are opening up is certainly based on better health news, but the economy remains profoundly damaged. This week the secretary of the Treasury told the Senate committee on Covid-19 that it has been \u201csteadily revising down our expectations of how high the unemployment rate will rise, because of the fact that the health scenario has continued to improve\u201d. Treasury now expects the unemployment rate to peak around 8% rather than its previous estimate of 10%. And yet, as I noted last month, had 490,000 people not left the labour force entirely the unemployment rate in April would have hit 9.7%. The underutilisation rate in April was 1.8 percentage points higher than the previous record set during the 1990s recession. We remain in a state where large sections of our economy \u2013 especially the education and tourism sectors \u2013 face precarious futures given ructions with China. And we have a government desperate to wind back stimulus measures and declare victory. But while reality and the stock market may at time stop conversing, the estrangement can only go on for so long. And thus on Thursday and Friday reality came over for a visit. In America the stock market fell 6%, the ASX 3% and then on Friday the ASX fell another 1.9%.

The Roberta Perkins Law Project, named after the transgender and sex worker legal advocate who died in 2018, is a partnership between the St Kilda Legal Service and Transgender Victoria, with a social innovation pilot funded by the City of Melbourne, and provides free legal services for trans and gender diverse people based in Victoria. Lawyer for the service, Sam Elkin, told Guardian Australia that since the project\u2019s quiet launch last year it had dealt with issues ranging from discrimination around access to healthcare to issues with name changes, and confusion surrounding the federal government\u2019s draft religious discrimination bill. \u201cI think the religious discrimination bill debate over the last 12 months has certainly created a lot of fear and confusion about what the law currently is in relation to whether GPs can refuse to treat transgender and gender diverse people and under what circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just doctors, it\u2019s osteos and physical therapists, and pharmacists.\u201d The federal government has yet to indicate when it will introduce religious discrimination legislation that will allow religious organisations and people to discriminate against people, including those in the LGBTIQ community, on the basis of their religious beliefs. A second consultation on the draft religious discrimination legislation ended in January just when the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold in Australia, and it is increasingly unlikely the legislation will land in parliament this year, with many of those both for and against the legislation unhappy with the draft bill. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said last month that cabinet had not considered it for some time because of the crisis. Elkin said even without the legislation these issues were already playing out in areas such as employment. \u201cWe\u2019ve had issues with people making complaints around people being told they\u2019ll be sacked if they come into work in feminine clothing \u2026 and we have people who have been terminated in their employment after asking their employer to use gender neutral pronouns or change the name on their name badge.\u201d The cases can be brought to bodies such as the Fair Work Commission, the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission, or the Australian Human Rights Commission. At the same time, the Human Rights Law Alliance, a legal fund offshoot of the Australian Christian Lobby, has been taking on similar cases but acting on the opposite side.

Elkin said the legal service would also be pushing for the Victorian government to expand anti-vilification legislation to cover trans and gender diverse people. The service worked with a transgender client, Veronica, who had privately rented a property in inner Melbourne, and within days of moving in was being harassed by neighbours in the common area of the apartment complex. She received abuse about her transgender history, as well as sexist and homophobic slurs when she left home. \u201cOne of her neighbours made explicit reference to her genitals in very humiliating terms, which made her feel particularly distressed and fearful,\u201d Elkin told the Victorian parliament in March. But there was no avenue of complaint because Victorian anti-discrimination laws did not cover the situation, and despite going to the police, it was determined that the behaviour didn\u2019t amount to criminal conduct, and she received no assistance from police in obtaining a personal safety intervention order. Veronica was ultimately forced to leave the apartment, copping the costs of breaking the lease and moving out. \u201cThis example is far from a unique experience,\u201d Elkin said.

      "bodyText": "Since late 2016, much of New South Wales has been in the grip of \u201cthe big dry\u201d \u2013 the most intense drought in living memory. In recent months, the story of the water crisis has been dominated by the Black Summer fires and the global coronavirus pandemic. Yet, bucking of the trend of the world\u2019s horror 2020, heavy rainfall between February and early May has brought a sense of quiet optimism and hope to rural communities. Many regions have recorded more than 300mm of rain so far this year, eclipsing the entire annual totals of both 2018 and 2019. While pockets of intense drought persist in the far west, northern tablelands and south-east, large parts of the state are now in the early stages of recovery. Dew gathers on the grass at Lisa and Ambrose Doolan\u2019s property on a foggy morning. Life is returning to drained waterways. Farmers are restocking and planting for winter. For towns such as Coonabarabran, the water crisis has eased. In early March the emergency bores providing the town\u2019s water were switched off, with residents now enjoying water from the local Timor Dam for the first time since early 2018. I recently returned to the area to catch up with farmers I first visited at the onset of the drought. For producers like Ambrose and Lisa Doolan, their property is almost unrecognisable compared with just a few months ago. From my first visit I can vividly recall the strain on Ambrose\u2019s face as he and Lisa set about what was then a new feeding operation for their substantial herd of cattle. The ongoing cost of providing feed was effectively a gamble on the family\u2019s future. Clockwise from top: Lisa and Ambrose Doolan on their newly green property, cattle in the growing produce. As recently as January the couple, who are fourth-generation farmers, watched as an intense dust storm tore through their property. \u201cIt was beginning to feel almost personal,\u201d Ambrose says of the drought, which, according to his historical records, was the worst since his family first arrived on the same land in 1902. An aerial view of the Little Llangothlin Nature Reserve Just weeks after that dust storm, the region was hit by the same rains that caused flash floods across Sydney, and soon brought a transformation Ambrose and Lisa had thought they might never see. Adding to the joy has been the purchase of the neighbouring farm by their daughter Emily and her partner Joe. During the height of the drought, Emily had moved back home to help her parents and, despite moments of despair, the experience brought the family closer together, in a move that\u2019s now permanent. \u201cWe are optimistic, without getting ahead of ourselves just yet.\u201d Ambrose, Emily and Lisa walk on their property.. Further north, the small town of Warialda was last year at the epicentre of the drought. Shortly before the onset of the big dry, Elizabeth Hollow had bought her dream property, built a house and stocked the farm with cattle. That dream soon turned into a three-year battle to stay afloat, hand-feeding stock in the dark before heading to a full-time job. Elizabeth Hollow at work on her property in Warialda. Today, the farm is largely remade, and so too the prospects of continued life on the land for Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beautiful change,\u201d Hollow says. \u201cFarmers up here have been quietly enjoying the reprieve, though it will take years to recover financially. \u201cI sometimes like to just sit and listen to the sounds of the herd just munching away at the grass.\u201d Near to the small town of Guyra, the Little Llangothlin nature reserve, a world heritage-listed wetland, was last year bone dry. Today, life is returning. Nesting water birds can be spotted, and the sounds of life echo across this important patch of wilderness. Nesting waterbirds spotted in the Little Llangothlin nature reserve. Back south to Coonabarabran and the sprawling property Marlborough, owned by farmers Coral, Greg and Tanya Jerry. It is here that has seen perhaps seen the most dramatic transformation of the properties I\u2019ve visited. The Jerry family had for years been treading water financially in what became a very public struggle during the drought. After the 2018 pictures of their farm were published by the Guardian, the family experienced intense interest from local and international media. Network TV soon arrived to interview the family, and last year a GoFundMe campaign was set up, which raised a substantial amount of money for the family. Top to bottom: sheep on Coral and Greg Jerry\u2019s property, and Greg Jerry. Greg tells me a decent chunk of this money went to helping others in the district. For the family, it helped them fend off bankruptcy just long enough for the rains to arrive, and not a moment too soon. Today, patches of red earth give way to sweeping green fields and crops planted after the rainfall. The property once again resembles the lush farm on which Greg grew up. The deluge in February was the first substantial relief at Marlborough since October 2016. For Coral, who continues to live alone in her small weatherboard house on the property, the change has been something of a miracle. Ambrose Doolan\u2019s property in 2018 and in 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of rapid growth,\u201d says Coral of the waist-high crops around us. \u201cIt\u2019s been really remarkable. We thought it would take months after rain for the property to recover, but it\u2019s happened fast, real fast.\u201d Coral\u2019s daily trips on her quad bike around a property are now a joy. Gone are the emaciated sheep and cattle, replaced by well-nourished stock and a sense of calm after the daily struggle of years past. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave this place,\u201d says Coral, as she wanders back to the small shack that has been home her entire adult life. Affected farmland near the town of Warialda in 2019 and in 2020. The process of recovery from the most intense drought on record is tenuous. Decent winter rainfall is needed to consolidate the earlier falls. Some areas are still as dry as before. On my way back to Sydney, Ambrose Doolan reminds me via text of the old proverb, \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d \u2013 a nice reminder to stay positive during the current gloom.",

For Prof Bill Mitchell, the University of Newcastle economist who developed the radical idea of modern monetary theory, we are living with the consequences of reforms introduced decades ago. \u201cThis is the end point of a long series of legislative and regulatory decisions that have allowed a disproportionate amount of freedom to financial markets,\u201d he says, highlighting the deregulation of banks that have turned once sober lenders into \u201ccasinos\u201d and the introduction of negative gearing, which created speculation around real estate. \u201cWe need to revisit these components of neoliberalism in Australia that have enriched a small proportion of the population, just about preserved the middle class, but eaten away at the bottom 40%.\u201d Politicians may bridle at the idea of sweeping new regulations but there are calls for change. Greens leader, Adam Bandt, says there is \u201ca real risk\u201d that the massive government coronavirus subsidies would just be used for \u201cspeculation\u201d, prolonging existing problems and doing nothing to reduce inequality. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to let this happen,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government should spend big on the infrastructure and services we need to address the jobs crisis, the economic crisis and the climate crisis. We need government-led investment in renewable energy, manufacturing, public housing and public transport, as well as expanding the education and training system needed to skill up the workforce.\u201d Jim Chalmers, the shadow treasurer, says the government\u2019s \u201cinaction and incompetence\u201d in the lead-up to the crisis left the Reserve Bank to do all the heavy lifting. \u201cWhile the Reserve Bank is doing its bit to support the economy, the Morrison government is putting jobs at risk through their bungling of key programs like jobkeeper and having no plan for a stronger, inclusive and sustainable recovery,\u201d he says. However, there is a wider political difficulty to consider in the wake of the street protests that have erupted in the United States over race and which have spread around the world, including to Australia. They show urban populations in the mood to revolt, so governments face a new challenge: any reform taken now could make economic damage worse in the short-term. Eleanor Creagh points out that the current system is so skewed by years of cheap money that markets are not functioning properly because capital is not being allocated to productive areas. But the alternative of reshaping the economy would involve a lot of pain, she says, such as allowing weaker businesses to go bust \u2013 the so-called zombie companies that cannot refinance their debts and many of which are surviving the crisis only through government support. \u201cThe alternative might be where you would allow a reset, you allow zombie companies to fail,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that would be palatable for governments, central banks and other participants. \u201cThere is already a lot of discontent, as the street protests have shown. We expect to see more unrest and more expressions of discontent as underlying problems are exacerbated by economic issues.\u201d So as another bubble takes shape and the world lurches back to the status quo, stand by for the third part of the Market Meltdown franchise \u2013 perhaps it might be called Zombie Company Apocalypse.",

      "body": "<p>Spare the briefest of thoughts for Britain\u2019s capital-owning classes. FTSE 100 companies are forecast to pay out \u00a39.5bn less in dividends to shareholders for the 2019 trading year, according to investing platform AJ Bell, as the coronavirus crisis ravages their income. That\u2019s 11% less money going to shareholders\u2019 pockets compared with the previous year.</p> <p>Some 48 FTSE 100 firms have announced some kind of reduction to, or suspension of, payments to shareholders, compared with 47 that have kept or increased them since the start of the year, AJ Bell says. Worse is expected, with National Grid\u2019s delayed annual results statement on Thursday the latest date circled in red pen on the calendars of nervous investors.</p> <p>Before the crisis, National Grid, the owner of the UK\u2019s high-voltage electricity network, was trundling along, as utilities are wont to do (apart from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/british-gas-owner-centrica-to-cut-5000-jobs\" title=\"\">British Gas owner Centrica</a>). Profits of \u00a32.47bn are expected for the year to 31 March, but that only includes eight days of the UK\u2019s lockdown.</p> <p>Beyond that, any detail on what to expect has essentially been limited to the investor equivalent of \u201chere be dragons\u201d. Financial performance was in line with previous guidance, according to the company\u2019s last update in early April, with the glaring caveat that this was \u201cbefore any Covid-19 impacts\u201d. That leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre, and falling energy use during the crisis suggests National Grid\u2019s customers, electricity generators, will have less to spend.</p> <p>Given what is going on in health systems around the rest of the world, there are not violins small enough to mourn the losses of shareholders who miss out on a chunky cheque while they sit at home. But the dividend freeze taking over the FTSE 100 has broader implications.</p> <p>Simply put, what is bad news for infrastructure providers such as National Grid is also bad news for those who rely on their technology \u2013 which in the case of the electricity grid includes everyone in Britain save the odd apocalypse prepper.

      "bodyText": "Spare the briefest of thoughts for Britain\u2019s capital-owning classes. FTSE 100 companies are forecast to pay out \u00a39.5bn less in dividends to shareholders for the 2019 trading year, according to investing platform AJ Bell, as the coronavirus crisis ravages their income. That\u2019s 11% less money going to shareholders\u2019 pockets compared with the previous year. Some 48 FTSE 100 firms have announced some kind of reduction to, or suspension of, payments to shareholders, compared with 47 that have kept or increased them since the start of the year, AJ Bell says. Worse is expected, with National Grid\u2019s delayed annual results statement on Thursday the latest date circled in red pen on the calendars of nervous investors. Before the crisis, National Grid, the owner of the UK\u2019s high-voltage electricity network, was trundling along, as utilities are wont to do (apart from British Gas owner Centrica). Profits of \u00a32.47bn are expected for the year to 31 March, but that only includes eight days of the UK\u2019s lockdown. Beyond that, any detail on what to expect has essentially been limited to the investor equivalent of \u201chere be dragons\u201d. Financial performance was in line with previous guidance, according to the company\u2019s last update in early April, with the glaring caveat that this was \u201cbefore any Covid-19 impacts\u201d. That leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre, and falling energy use during the crisis suggests National Grid\u2019s customers, electricity generators, will have less to spend. Given what is going on in health systems around the rest of the world, there are not violins small enough to mourn the losses of shareholders who miss out on a chunky cheque while they sit at home. But the dividend freeze taking over the FTSE 100 has broader implications. Simply put, what is bad news for infrastructure providers such as National Grid is also bad news for those who rely on their technology \u2013 which in the case of the electricity grid includes everyone in Britain save the odd apocalypse prepper. One would hope that it would cut short-term returns to shareholders before its \u00a35bn annual investment needs are hit; but any historian of capitalism this side of the millennium would urge you not to take that for granted. National Grid is one the companies most central to the UK\u2019s net-zero ambitions. The UK\u2019s energy network is changing shape, with coal and nuclear stations closing and vast wind and solar generation coming online. At the same time, the advent of battery electric vehicles \u2013 which could be the only option for car buyers by 2035 or earlier \u2013 means demands for electricity will be far greater. A major irony of this squeeze is that the pandemic has given a glimpse \u2013 albeit at an intolerably high cost \u2013 of another world: one with less traffic, cleaner air, and radically lower carbon emissions. The concurrence of drastically lower energy usage and the sunniest and driest British spring since at least 1929 means the UK was, at the time of going to print, still setting a new record for the UK\u2019s longest period of coal-free electricity generation since 1882, when a power station in Holborn, London, first fired up. Yet the ominous signs for the future are already there. \u201cWe are starting to see some delays and disruption to our capital programme,\u201d National Grid said in its April update.

Being able to know what\u2019s going on with your loved ones when they were taken into hospital, waiting by the TV listening to the number of deaths rising every day, being glued to the TV for any sort of news and not being able to know where to go or who to turn to.</em><br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Mussilhy also drew parallels between the UK government\u2019s response to Covid-19 and the aftermath of Grenfell. <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>The government has been criticised for not reacting quick enough: making sure the NHS has the right equipment and is supported in the right way to be able to tackle the pandemic. They just didn\u2019t react quick enough.</em></p> \n   <p><em>It\u2019s also three years on, people always say that time changes, time is the best thing for healing, but in this case it feels like it just gets worse and so many things are happening that have so many similarities to what happened to us, and what continues to happen to us.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In tribute to each victim who died in the catastrophic blaze at the west London tower block, bells of London churches will on Sunday toll 72 times and green lights will glow from tower block windows as remembrance and commemoration moves online due to the pandemic. <br></p> \n  <p>Faith leaders will conduct sermons and reflections online throughoutthe day and after dark from 10.30pm, and people in homes across the UK are asked to play a bright green light from their screens to show solidarity with the bereaved and survivors, said the Grenfell United group. <br></p> \n  <p>Mussilhy said the lack of face-to-face contact with other victims and those who are bereaved is \u201cmaking this year\u2019s anniversary a lot more difficult\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>He described feeling \u201creally weird and heavy this year\u201d, adding: \u201cI guess going through extremely tough times, the one thing that\u2019s helped me the most is being able to be around people and be around friends and family. Not being able to do that, it\u2019s just been extremely tough.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Grenfell United said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is a day of remembrance and mourning. This year will be different to the last two years. We are living through another tragedy - Covid 19 and it has affected our community. Please join from home to remember 72 lives lost &amp; reflect on our ongoing journey to justice &amp; change. Even apart we remain together until justice comes.</em><br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government spokeswoman said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>The safety of residents is our priority and we took immediate steps after the tragic Grenfell Tower fire to ensure nothing like it could ever happen again. <br></em></p> \n   <p><em>This included setting up the Building Safety Programme and testing process to quickly identify all high-rise buildings with ACM cladding.

However the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July.<br><br>It follows protests last weekend, when people took to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\">437 known Aboriginal deaths </a>since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow. The protests were sparked in solidarity with the US following the brutal death of unarmed man <strong>George Floyd</strong> on 25 May.</p> \n  <p>One man was diagnosed with the virus following the Melbourne protests, with health authorities saying he was likely infected prior to the rally. Victoria police issued fines of $1,652 each to the three people who organised the protest.</p> \n  <p>On Saturday, refugee activists plan to hold eight rallies of 20 people each throughout Melbourne in order to comply with restrictions on crowd numbers. In Brisbane, supporters of detained asylum seekers have vowed to ramp up their blockade of a hotel. Protesters claim authorities are intent on relocating asylum seekers who\u2019ve been in long-term detention at the Kangaroo Point Central hotel and have staged a series of balcony protests.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile about 200 refugee supporters will protest the indefinite detention of refugees in Sydney. And thousands of protesters will gather in Perth for Saturday\u2019s protest at Langley Park. Organisers have ignored premier <strong>Mark McGowan\u2019s </strong>pleas to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic is over.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-13T03:49:04.660Z\">at 4.49am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Here some key developments from the last few hours at a glance: Egypt saw a record daily rise in infections and deaths, as it confirmed 1,677 new coronavirus cases and 62 deaths on Saturday. In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 42,980 cases including 1,484 deaths, the ministry said in a statement. Infections in Turkey have been increasing since travel restrictions were lifted and facilities reopened at the beginning of the month. Israel has noted a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, leading to 177 schools and educational institutions throughout the country closing again after 493 students and teachers tested positive for the virus. France reported 24 new coronavirus deaths over the 24 hours to Saturday, taking the total to 29,398 and marking the fourth day with under 30 fatalities. The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, reproached citizens on Saturday for their reduced adherence to health measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. Algeria will further relax its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, easing a curfew, allowing public transport to resume in the cities and reopening some more businesses, the government said on Saturday. Travellers from Germany, Iceland and Norway are to be permitted to enter Denmark from Monday as long as they have booked accommodation for at least six nights, as the country gradually lifts its coronavirus-related travel restrictions. Lebanese protesters took to the streets in Beirut and other cities on Saturday in mostly peaceful protests against the government, calling for its resignation as the small country sinks deeper into economic distress amid lockdown restrictions. This is all from me, I\u2019m off to bed. Thanks for reading and writing in, as always. Foreign visitors have begun to trickle back to the white sands and warm waters of Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast as its popular beaches gradually reopen to tourism with new sanitary measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck in New York City in my apartment for three months, so I decided that on the beach somewhere open was probably a good call,\u201d web designer Sam Leon, 31, told Reuters after arriving Saturday at the airport of the resort town Cancun. He said he planned to head to the trendy beach of Tulum with a friend, and said he had no qualms about possibly picking up the virus while traveling because he was in good health. Others were similarly undeterred, even as Mexico reported record infection levels in recent days and in certain areas is at the peak of the pandemic. Mexico has registered 16,448 overall deaths. \u201cWe travel all the time... we\u2019re really not super concerned,\u201d said Canadian national Brad Kendell, 32, who lives in Panama. He had been in Mexico City with his wife last March when Panama put the country on lockdown. They chose to decamp to Cancun for a \u201cchange of pace\u201d while waiting for travel restrictions to ease. \u201cThe most important thing right now is to revive the state\u2019s economy, but we have to be careful with the health of our people,\u201d Carlos Joaquin, governor of Quintana Roo state which includes Cancun, said last week. A full recovery for Mexico\u2019s tourism sector - which represents 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product and employs 4.5 million people - looks far off, however. Mexico registered only 86,000 foreign visitors in April, down from 2.8 million the same month the year before, according to official data. Brazil has registered 21,704 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 850,514. The health ministry reported 892 new deaths on Saturday, and said the official total death toll had now reached 42,720. More than half of people in Britain support an extension to the Brexit transition period, while three quarters believe the UK should work very closely with the EU to combat coronavirus, a survey suggests. A study from the Health Foundation indicated that 54 per cent of the public support an extension to the Brexit transition period to allow the British government to focus on Covid-19. Cabinet office minister Michael Gove formally told the EU on Friday that the UK would not ask for a delay, despite concerns the departure would compound the economic chaos inflicted by the pandemic. Overall, people aged 18-24 taking part in the survey were far more likely to support an extension (85%). The survey of 1,983 people in Britain found overwhelming public support (95%) for the UK to work closely with the EU in its response to the pandemic. While coronavirus headlines about the US, the UK, Brazil and Italy drop on a daily basis, Belgium, a country that has been hit hard by the virus, is often omitted from the daily news round-ups. Belgians were able to move freely during the first weekend since restaurants and cafes were allowed to open, after the country entered the third phase of its deconfinement strategy on Monday. According to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, Belgium has had 9,650 coronavirus deaths \u2014 which, at more than 84 per 100,000 people, is the highest rate in the world. As a small, densely populated nation of 11.5 million people in the heart of Europe, it was necessarily going to be at risk in a way that the Scandinavian nations or those of eastern Europe were not, the Times reports. The British government is working to ensure all schools can open in September and to provide support packages to help children catch up on lost learning, the office of prime minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday. Schools shut to most pupils in March due to the coronavirus pandemic but selected age groups have been able to return since the beginning of June, although some educators decided not to re-open because they said it was not safe. The decision to gradually re-open schools has divided opinion, with Britain suffering one of the world\u2019s worst death tolls from Covid-19 and some critics warning of the need for caution to prevent a second wave of the virus. Johnson has asked for measures to be drawn up to help children over the summer and further into the future, said the statement. For social justice reasons help was especially needed for those who had less support at home, it added. Algeria will further relax its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, easing a curfew, allowing public transport to resume in the cities and reopening some more businesses, the government said on Saturday. The government will end the curfew in 19 provinces and shorten it in the remaining 29, including in the capital Algiers, where it will run from 8pm to 5am instead of 7pm-7am currently, the prime minister\u2019s office said, according to Reuters. Buses and taxis in urban areas will also resume services with a limited number of passengers, while taxi drivers are ordered to take one client only. Some businesses such as clothing and shoe shops, car rentals and hair salons will reopen. The government last week allowed the reopening of business such as men\u2019s barbershops and cattle markets. The authorities also decided to end a paid leave given in March to 50 per cent of state employees, although pregnant women and those with children will continue to benefit from the leave. Algeria has so far reported 10,810 coronavirus cases, with 760 deaths. Travellers from some countries are to be allowed to enter Denmark again from Monday, as the country gradually lifts its coronavirus-related travel restrictions. Travellers from Germany, Iceland and Norway are to be permitted to enter Denmark as long as they have booked accommodation for at least six nights, DPA reports. The Danish police are expecting large numbers, with Germans alone expected to head for some 14,000 holiday homes they have booked in advance. Denmark\u2019s police advised travellers to expect delays and to follow traffic updates, and to avoid travelling at the busiest times of day, where possible. The police said they would provide ongoing updates about the traffic situation in Danish, English and German, through Twitter and other channels. Denmark reopened its border crossing to Germany near the southern town of Padborg on Saturday. Denmark had closed all but three of its 13 border crossings on 14 March. 597 people are confirmed to have died in the country from Covid-19 so far. As my colleague Helena Smith reported earlier, Greek\u2019s holiday resorts are readying themselves for the beginning of the country\u2019s tourist season. Vasilis Theodorou, the owner of Pelican, a new restaurant on the Greek island of Mykonos, expects a slow slummer but says he\u2019s in a hurry to get back to business, the Associated Press reports. And so is the rest of the country. Heavily reliant on tourism, the country is officially reopening to foreigners on Monday after closing its borders to most during the coronavirus pandemic. Its hopes are pinned on popular tourist destinations such as Mykonos and the islands of Rhodes, Corfu, Crete and Santorini, where regular ferry service already resumed and direct international flights are set to restart on 1 July. Mykonos would normally be packed in early June, but it\u2019s beaches were empty. \u201cTourism might be down by as much as 80 per cent this year, so we\u2019re waiting for the 20 per cent, and we\u2019re happy,\u201d Theodorou said. \u201cNo matter how much we wish for it and want it, it won\u2019t be more than that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect that tourists from central Europe will come first, and hopefully Americans at a later stage. They are our best customers.\u201d Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged Saturday that Greece is prepared for a huge drop from the 33 million tourists who came to visit last year. France reported 24 new coronavirus deaths over the 24 hours to Saturday, taking the total to 29,398 and marking the fourth day with under 30 fatalities. The government also reported the number of people in hospital fell by 215 to 10,909 and those in intensive care units fell by eight to 871, with both tallies continuing weeks-long downtrends, according to Reuters. Egypt confirmed 1,677 new coronavirus cases and 62 deaths on Saturday, the health ministry said, the highest daily increase for both counts. In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 42,980 cases including 1,484 deaths, the ministry said in a statement. Covid-19 has killed at least 427,495 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP on Saturday. At least 7,711,490 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 196 countries and territories. Of these, at least 3,458,300 are now considered recovered with 4,523 deaths and 136,525 cases logged over the past 24 hours. The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. In the absence of help from Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, cartels in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro have gone from pushing drugs to distributing medical supplies. Gangs now also enforce curfews, social distancing and organise food handouts for the neediest, CNN reports. Lebanese protesters took to the streets in Beirut and other cities on Saturday in mostly peaceful protests against the government, calling for its resignation as the small country sinks deeper into economic distress. The protests come after two days of rallies spurred by a dramatic collapse of the local currency against the dollar. Those rallies degenerated into violence, including attacks on private banks and shops, the Associated Press reports. The local currency, pegged to the dollar for nearly 30 years, has been on a downward trajectory for weeks, losing over 60 per cent of its value. But the dramatic collapse this week deepened public despair over the already troubled economy, a crisis that was further compounded by the coronavirus pandemic. The government was faced with handling the coronavirus pandemic soon after prime minister Hassan Diab took office earlier this year, and implemented a lockdown lasting months. Diab\u2019s government is supported by the powerful militant group Hezbollah and its allies, but has already been weakened by the economic crisis. In a speech Saturday, Diab urged the public to be patient, saying there were a great many political hurdles, including from rivals he said sought to undermine his government. Diab offered no solutions to the crisis, nor did he name his opponents, but said his government was working to fight corruption and uphold the power of the state. Confirmed coronavirus cases in the US have increased by 22,317 to 2,038,344 since Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Saturday. The CDC said that the number of deaths had risen by 711 to 114,625. Israel has noted a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, the Haaretz newspaper reports. 177 schools and educational institutions throughout the country have closed after 493 students and teachers tested positive, and 25,821 people within the Israeli education system are currently in preventative quarantine. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu tested negative for coronavirus after three of his security personnel tested positive, and an employee at president Reuven Rivlin\u2019s residence also tested positive on Saturday. 18,972 infections have so far been recorded in the country, rising by 177 since Friday. 300 people have died. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, 597 people tested positive and two people have died. In the Gaza Strip, 72 people were diagnosed and one person has died. The number of new coronavirus cases in Turkey rose to 1,459 in the last 24 hours from 1,195 a day earlier, health ministry data showed on Saturday. Infections have been increasing since travel restrictions were lifted and facilities reopened at the beginning of the month, according to Reuters. In the last 24 hours, 14 people died, bringing total fatalities to 4,792. The overall tally of detected Covid-19 cases in Turkey now stands at 176,677. Thousands of demonstrators marched in cities and towns across Switzerland on Saturday to denounce racism and police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the United States. Despite rules banning gatherings of more than 300 people to prevent the spread of Covid-19, several cities saw huge crowds come out to join a growing global movement denouncing racism and disproportionate police violence against black and brown people, AFP reports. In the biggest demonstration, more than 10,000 people, most of them dressed in black, protested in Switzerland\u2019s largest city Zurich, according to police. Police said the Zurich demonstration was largely peaceful, but that it had been marred in the late afternoon by a few hundred people headed by known members of the radical leftwing autonomous scene who threw rocks, bottles and other objects at police. One officer was injured and a number of people arrested, Zurich police said. Three activists of Algeria\u2019s Hirak protest movement were ordered to be held in pre-trial detention for offences including \u201cendangering the lives of others during the [coronavirus] confinement period\u201d, a prisoners\u2019 defence group said on Saturday. The Hirak movement led peaceful protests in 2019 after Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his candidacy for a fifth presidential term, calling for Bouteflika\u2019s immediate resignation. The National Committee for the Release of Detainees (CNLD) said that Merzoug Touati, Yanis Adjila and Amar Beri appeared in court in the northeastern town of Bejaia. The three formed part of a group of around 20 people arrested on Friday for trying to hold a protest in support of the release of other Hirak activists. The rest were detained only briefly and released, Agence France-Presse reports. They are to go on trial 17 June for incitement, \u201cpublication that could damage the national interest\u201d and b\u201cendangering the lives of others during the confinement period\u201d, CNLD spokesman Kaci Tansaout said. He said Beri also faced charges of \u201cdamaging the person of the president of the republic\u201d, Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Weekly anti-government protests rocked Algeria for more than a year and only came to a halt in March because of the coronavirus outbreak, with the authorities banning marches. According to the CNLD, some 60 people are currently detained on charges linked to the protest movement, most of them over posts on Facebook. Airlines are slowly trying to return to business after the pandemic grounded entire fleets of planes around the globe for months and put their very existence in doubt. My colleague Gwyn Topham reports. Chile\u2019s president Sebastian Pi\u00f1era has replaced the country\u2019s health minister Jaime Manalich, the La Tercera newspaper reports. After just one year in office, his departure comes amid criticism of the health ministry\u2019 reaction to the pandemic, mainly in two areas: the delay in taking preventive measures, such as quarantines, and a controversy over the number of total deaths due to Covid-19. Pi\u00f1era thanked Manalich for his \u201cnoble service\u201d, and replaced him with Oscar Enrique Paris, a former president of the national medical college and reportedly a supporter of abortions. Chile has so far 167,355 confirmed coronavirus infections, the highest number of confirmed cases per million people in Latin America, and 3,101 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. In late May, Pi\u00f1era had warned that the country\u2019s healthcare system was \u201cvery close\u201d to collapsing, following a rapid rise in infections over a short period of time that brought the country\u2019s total infections close to 70,000. At the time, Chile had recorded 718 deaths from Covid-19. Coronavirus studies carried out in haste can lead to errors among researchers that can have fatal consequences, a leading scientist has said. Jonathan Kimmelman, the director at the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University in Montreal, told the Die Zeit newspaper that faulty or incomplete studies on effective treatments for Covid-19 led to patients being given medication \u201cthat is ineffective at best and dangerous at worst\u201d, as in the case of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. \u201cWe know that the drug can have dangerous side effects, but that it actually helps patients has not been proven. A few rushed publications claimed that giving it was helpful, while others claimed that it increased the risk of death, neither of which has yet been confirmed,\u201d Kimmelman said. \u201cThere have always been medical studies with significant weaknesses. The force with which the corona crisis hit us, of course, creates the need for rapid growth in knowledge of Sars-CoV-2. The corresponding studies are therefore usually published in a great hurry. It is no wonder that they often have deficits in design, implementation and evaluation because time, money, employees and the number of subjects are limited. Researchers should work particularly carefully right now.\u201d The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, reproached citizens on Saturday for their reduced adherence to health measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. \u201cThe respect of measures by our dear people has been great\u201d and 80% or people had played by the rules between 20 April and 20 May, Agence France-Presse reported him as saying in a televised speech. He said it was disturbing, however, to see that the proportion \u201chas greatly diminished... with only 18 to 20 percent of people respecting\u201d the rules since. The health ministry on Saturday announced 71 new deaths from the disease over the last 24 hours and 2,410 new infections. Rouhani also expressed concerns about measures at the holy shrine of Imam Reza in Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan Razavi province and a main pilgrimage site in the country. \u201cOfficials must make greater efforts - reports on mask wearing, social distancing and collective prayer are not satisfactory,\u201d Rouhani said. Since announcing its first cases in the Shia holy city of Qom in February, Iran has struggled to contain what quickly became the Middle East\u2019s deadliest outbreak of Covid-19. Official figures show that 8,730 people in the country have of the disease and 184,955 have been confirmed as infected. There has been scepticism at home and abroad about Iran\u2019s official figures, with concern the real toll could be much higher. Italy\u2019s official coronavirus death toll rose by 78 to 34,301 on Saturday, according to officials. The total number of confirmed infections in the country climbed by 346 to 236,651. Operators of nightspots in Japan will have to keep a record of their customers\u2019 names and contact information and ensure physical distancing rules as part of measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, according to government guidelines released on Saturday, the Kyodo News agency reports. Twenty-four new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Tokyo on Saturday, with four cases from nightspots in the Shinjuku entertainment district bringing the total for the capital to 5,497. Other measures in the guidelines included maintaining a distance of at least one metre and the use of face masks or shields. High-fives with the audience are to be avoided in live music venues, and nightclubs are urged to adjust the volume of music to lower levels to prevent customers from talking loudly and emitting droplets during face-to-face socialising. The mayors of two neighbouring cities in Poland and Germany hugged and celebrated with champagne on Saturday as Poland opened its border for the first time in three months. Ren\u00e9 Wilke, the mayor of Frankfurt on the Oder river, and Mariusz Olejniczak, the mayor of S\u0142ubice, shook hands and embraced as a border fence was opened. When the border was closed in mid-March, commuters were initially unable to go to work, but some later qualified for a special permit to cross the border. Poland\u2019s border with Lithuania was opened on Friday, Euronews reports. The European commission has recommended all of the bloc\u2019s internal borders should reopen by Monday. Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Mattha Busby. If you have any relevant updates to flag, please feel free to either email me or message me on Twitter @JedySays. The countdown to the tourist season in Greece has begun with the country\u2019s leader promising that no concessions will be made when it comes to health and safety. Ahead of international flights resuming on Monday, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has flown to the Cyclades island of Santorini, one of Europe\u2019s most popular destinations, to deliver a message that Greece is open for business again. \u201cWe want visitors to come and feel safe,\u201d he said after visiting the island\u2019s general hospital. \u201cOur intention is to welcome without making any concessions on safety and security.\u201d The tourist-dependent nation is hoping to capitalise on the success it has had in handling the pandemic after enforcing stringent lockdown measures early on. With infection rates far lower than other European states, the death toll to date remains below 200. Tourism accounts for 20% of Greece\u2019s GDP, and reopening the sector is key for an economy that had only started to recover from a decade-long debt crisis when the epidemic hit. The centre-right government is also aware, however, that admitting tourists is a calculated risk and one that could backfire. It announced draconian measures on Friday to boost health systems on islands, many of them small and remote with only rudimentary services. The measures included a network of doctors and support staff being deployed to the outposts, medics in floating ambulances, increased Covid-19 testing facilities and futuristic \u201ctransit capsules\u201d to transport patients to intensive care units. \u201cEach island will be attached to a fully equipped mainland hospital,\u201d said the health minister, Vasillis Kikillas, as he presented the policies. Not everyone, however, is happy. Syriza, the leftwing main opposition party has accused the government of being lax, insisting that health services need to be further reinforced especially on Covid-free islands now bracing for tourists. Greek epidemiologists advising the government say it is inevitable that as the country opens up the virus will be imported with visitors, making for what the opposition Syntaktwn newspaper described as a \u201can explosive mix in the coming months.\u201d Russia has more than doubled its official coronavirus death toll for April to 2,712 after changing how it classifies fatalities. Officials warned that May\u2019s death toll was likely to be even worse in Russia, which has the world\u2019s third largest number of cases with 520,129. The country has today reported 8,706 new cases after its number of new infections peaked in mid-May. The capital Moscow - the nation\u2019s worst affected city - lifted tight lockdown measures last week. We reported earlier (see 9.01am) that Russia had reported 8,706 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of people who have been infected by the virus to 520,129. Authorities said 114 people had died of the virus in the last 24 hours, raising the official national death toll to 6,829. It comes after 8,987 new cases were announced on Friday. Russia\u2019s death toll has been much lower than in other countries with large outbreaks, raising questions over possible underreporting of deaths. The April figures from Rosstat, the official statistics agency, include 1,270 deaths where the virus was the main cause. But they now also include deaths where the victim tested positive for the virus but it was not the main cause of death, AFP reported. In April there were 435 deaths where the virus had a \u201csignificant influence\u201d and 617 where it was present but did not play a major role, the agency said. The statistics also include 390 cases where the person initially tested negative to coronavirus, but it was later ruled to be the main cause of death. The previously announced toll for April was 1,152. A further 80 people have died from coronavirus in the UK, according to official figures showing deaths recorded in the last 24 hours. The UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will publish its overall toll later. It usually differs from the cumulative totals because of variations in data collection. DHSC said on Friday that 41,481 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Thursday, up by 202 from 41,279 the day before. The government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 52,000. Far-right protesters in London, UK, have clashed with police throughout the day, after organisers cancelled an anti-racist protest for fear of violence. Around 200 demonstrators near the Cenotaph \u2013 a war memorial outside the prime minister\u2019s residence \u2013 were facing off with police with some trying to push through the barriers following a day of disorder. Several hundred anti-racism demonstrators have also gathered in Trafalgar Square. All protesters must disperse by 5pm, though many are now being contained by police lines. It comes after the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged people to stay away from central London and defended the decision to board up the statue of Winston Churchill and other monuments. Peaceful anti-racism protests were held elsewhere in the UK. Moving back to the anti-racism protests, about 2,000 people have demonstrated in Paris to denounce police brutality and entrenched racism which many believe France\u2019s national doctrine of colour blindness has failed to eradicate. Myriam Boicoulin, 31, who was born in the French Caribbean island of Martinique, said she was demonstrating because she wanted to be heard. \u201cThe fact of being visible is enormous,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a black woman living in mainland France, I\u2019m constantly obliged to adapt, to make compromises, not make waves to be almost white, in fact. It\u2019s the first time people see us. Let us breathe.\u201d The march in Paris was led by supporters of Adama Traor\u00e9, a French black man who died in police custody in 2016 in circumstances that remain unclear despite four years of autopsies. His death marked one of France\u2019s most high-profile cases of alleged police brutality. \u201cWe are all demanding the same thing \u2013 fair justice for everyone,\u201d Traore\u2019s sister Assa told the crowd. There were no charges made following his death. Associated Press reported that angry shouts rose from the peaceful and racially diverse crowd as a small group of white extreme-right activists climbed a building overlooking the protest and unfurled a huge banner denouncing anti-white racism. Police did not arrest the counter-demonstrators, but residents in the building tore part of the banner down, one raising his fist in victory. Officers prevented people attending the main rally from approaching the far-right activists. Officers surrounded the intended march route, bracing for potential violence after scattered clashes at some previous demonstrations around France also inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd\u2019s death in the US. Paris police had ordered the closure of restaurants and shops, which had recently reopened after the coronavirus lockdown because they were along the route of the march (see 11.46am). Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands have signed a contract with AstraZeneca to supply European citizens with a coronavirus vaccine, Italy\u2019s health minister said on Saturday. The contract with the British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical company is for 400m doses of the vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford. The trial phase is already advanced and expected to end in the autumn, Roberto Speranza wrote on Facebook. He added that a first batch of doses would be made available by the end of this year. However, AstraZeneca\u2019s CEO, Pascal Soriot, could not guarantee the vaccine would work in an interview last month and said several would be required, though he expressed confidence. The European commission received a mandate from EU governments on Friday to negotiate advance purchases of promising coronavirus vaccines, the EU\u2019s top health official said, but it was unclear whether there would be enough money available. It comes after AstraZeneca secured a deal with two US government agencies and Vanderbilt University to create antibodies to be used to treat and prevent Covid-19, Bloomberg reported. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford announced in April their agreement for the global development and distribution of the university\u2019s potential vaccine aimed at preventing Covid-19 infection. \u201cWe\u2019re trailblazing here because we are not following the standard process, we are partnering with regulators both in the UK and the US, we\u2019re working hand in hand with the [Food and Drug Administration], we are sharing data on a day to day basis and they have committed themselves to help look at our data as they come so by the time we finish the first [trial] program in August they can rapidly approve the vaccine,\u201d Soriot told CNN in May. He claimed that drug companies are competing against the virus, not against each other, and that AstraZeneca \u2013 among other manufacturers \u2013 was doing this for no profit. It has received $1bn from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine. The prime minister of Italy, Giuseppe Conte, called today for a \u201ccourageous plan\u201d when he launched virtual talks with EU and IMF leaders to rescue Italy\u2019s economy and society from the \u201cunprecedented shock\u201d triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. European Union leaders \u201cmust show that they have understood that it is about defending mutual interests,\u201d Conte said in an opening speech transmitted to leading executives in Brussels. The EU\u2019s third largest economy is expected to contract by at least 8.3% in 2020, under the most optimistic estimate from Italy\u2019s national statistics agency. To stimulate activity in EU countries most affected by the Covid-19 crisis, the European Commission has proposed a \u20ac750bn recovery plan \u2013 \u20ac500bn in grants and the rest in loans. Italy is expected to receive around \u20ac172bn of this sum. \u201cWe must also take advantage of (the moment) to transform the crisis into an opportunity to eliminate all the obstacles that slowed (the country) down for the last 20 years,\u201d Conte said. He said he shared European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s view that \u201cwe cannot allow ourselves to return to the pre-crisis status quo\u201d. Conte\u2019s approval ratings rose during the coronavirus emergency. He has suggested a task force headed by former Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao to come up with recommendations on how to get Italy\u2019s economy back on track. Proposals include digitising Italy\u2019s onerous public administration, modernising infrastructure and restructuring the national university system. New clothes? New rules. In the UK, which had the second highest death toll from Covid-19 until Brazil overtook it late yesterday, England is planning to relax government restriction on retail on Monday. For one of the country\u2019s biggest department store chains, John Lewis, that means new shopping diktats \u2013 including not trying on clothes, and a gap of eight steps between people on escalators. Department stores, bookshops, electrical outlets and toy retailers will be among the businesses opening when non-essential shops welcome back customers after an enforced three-month shutdown. The first domestically transmitted cases of Covid-19 in Beijing for 55 days have seen a city recently returned to normal life do an about-face, as China fears a second wave. Partial lockdown has been instituted in some residential areas of the capital, and thousands of people will be tested after dozens of cases were confirmed at the city\u2019s largest wholesale meat market. Lily Kuo in Beijing and Emma Graham-Harrison are following the story: Researchers in Thailand began collecting samples from horseshoe bats to test them for coronavirus amid concerns they may pose a threat to local residents, the government has announced. They plan to collect 300 bats over three days from a cave in the Chanthaburi province in the south-east of the country. The bats will be released following the tests. Thailand has 23 species of the horseshoe bat but there has not been an investigation before. The source of the virus remains a matter of debate after it emerged in China late last year. The World Health Organization (WHO) in April said all available evidence suggests it originated in bats in China but it was not clear how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans. The research team in Thailand includes Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, who identified the country\u2019s first case of Covid-19 in January as it became the first country outside China to record a case of the virus. It has so far reported 3,134 cases and 58 deaths \u201cThe reason we need to investigate the horseshoe bat is because there are reports from China that the Covid-19 virus is similar to the virus found in the horseshoe bat,\u201d Supaporn said. Researchers from the National Parks department, Chulalongkorn hospital and Kasetsart University entered the cave on Thursday evening and re-emerged in the early hours of Friday with samples of bat blood, saliva and faeces. Hello everyone, I\u2019ll be taking over the reins here for a bit. Do feel free to email me at chris.michael@theguardian.com or find me on Twitter The latest developments: Covid-19 has killed at least 426,029 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. China reported 11 new coronavirus cases on Saturday. This included six domestic cases in the capital, which raised concerns about a resurgence as hundreds of troops were deployed to the site of a new cluster at a wholesale food market (see 10.35am). A spike in deaths in refugee camps in Darfur, western Sudan, has sparked fears about the invisible spread of the coronavirus as elderly people fall sick and die at extremely concerning rates, officials said (see 8.58am). India has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus cases, adding 11,458 confirmed infections and taking its total count to more than 300,000, according to official data, amid reports of people being turned away from hospitals. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections has passed 24,000 in Afghanistan as a key testing laboratory paused work due to lack of kits as violence rages across the country (see 9.53am). Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll figures have been on hold for almost a week, causing uncertainty about the state of the epidemic, which has claimed more than 27,000 lives in the country (see 10.19am). Multiple Black Lives Matter and refugee rights rallies occurred around Australia, many breaking strict public health orders as the country tries to maintain its low infection rate. The Dalai Lama has said his thoughts are with those suffering in the coronavirus pandemic as he implored humankind to develop \u201ca sense of oneness\u201d (see 11.23am). He believed this could be one of the positive things to come out of the coronavirus crisis. He added that developing peace of mind was imperative and people across the world should place a greater focus on doing so. Authorities in Botswana have declared a strict lockdown in the capital Gaborone after the discovery of 12 new cases of coronavirus. Under the measures, no one will be allowed to leave the region around the capital, said Kereng Masupu, the head of the Covid-19 task force. No movement will be permitted without a permit and only essential services allowed to stay open. Half of the cases were in the capital of the landlocked southern African country of 2.2 million people. This brought the total number of infections in the country to 60, with one death. The World Health Organization warned on Thursday the pandemic is accelerating in Africa. Moving back to coronavirus news for now, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said he is \u201ctotally calm\u201d after giving prosecutors a full account of how he handled the coronavirus pandemic that devastated Italy. He said he did not fear a judicial probe would be opened after the three hour session about his handling of the emergency on Friday. \u201cI explained everything to prosecutors. I am totally calm,\u201d Conte told La Stampa newspaper. \u201cI detailed all the stages in these terrible days during which we fought an invisible enemy. I have nothing to fear.\u201d He said he believes he \u201cacted based on science and conscience\u201d, adding: \u201cI have the serenity of one who always carried out each step with the scientific technical committee\u201d offering advice. \u201cI am not expecting to receive a notice of an opening of a judicial investigation. I have never feared one,\u201d he added. The epidemic has killed more than 34,000 people in Italy, one of the hardest-hit countries in the world, mostly in the northern regions. Chief prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota and her team are investigating why a lockdown was not enforced earlier in the health emergency around the towns of Nembro and Alzano in the northern province of Bergamo. Experts have said many lives would have been saved has a quarantine been swiftly imposed. Prosecutors have already met with senior officials in Lombardy, who say it was up to Rome to decide whether certain areas should be shut. Conte has said regions had full discretion to close certain areas where the virus had begun to flare in late February and early March before he introduced a nationwide quarantine on 10 March. In Taiwan, hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered in central Taipei on Saturday, with a group of indigenous Taiwanese drawing attention to discrimination against the island\u2019s original inhabitants. The rally, attended by more than 500 people, mostly foreigners, was peaceful with only a very light police presence, Reuters reported. Savungaz Valincinan, an ethnic Bunun from central Taiwan, detailed the difficult past of indigenous Taiwanese, who make up less than 3% of the island\u2019s population, and called for broad opposition to any form of discrimination. Although indigenous Taiwanese \u201cmight not face as direct threats to our lives or fear like black Americans face in the US\u201d, many in Taiwanese society discriminate against them. For example, by refusing to rent accommodation to indigenous people, said Savungaz, from the Indigenous Youth Front group. We don\u2019t want any special treatment. What we want are the most basic rights that we deserve as human beings. We are coming out today to support this movement not because of sympathy - it is because we have also gone through the hurt of being discriminated against. Paris police have ordered the closure of restaurants and shops, which had recently reopened after the coronavirus lockdown in France because they are along the route of a march against police brutality and racism. The march between the Place de la R\u00e9publique in eastern Paris and the capital\u2019s main opera house is expected to be the biggest of several demonstrations around France this weekend inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. The Paris police chief ordered sidewalks along the march route to be cleared of anything that could be used against officers. Any gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France because of virus containment measures. The Paris march was organisd by supporters of Adama Traor\u00e9\u2013 a French black man who died in police custody in 2016 in circumstances that remain unclear \u2013 with crowds expected to demand justice for him and all victims of police brutality. Protests are also expected Saturday in Marseille, Lyon and other French cities, with the government under growing pressure to address long-running accusations of excessive violence by police, particularly against minorities. Researchers have documented racial profiling by French police, and investigations were opened recently into racist comments in private Facebook and WhatsApp groups for police officers. The interior minister promised this week to stamp out racism and announced a ban on police chokeholds during arrests, however police are now to start experimenting with expanding the use of stun guns. The Dalai Lama has said his thoughts are with those suffering in the coronavirus pandemic as he implored humankind to develop \u201ca sense of oneness\u201d. The leader of Tibetan Buddhism, 84, told the BBC that despite widespread fears over coronavirus, climate change, and other social and environmental issues, there has been much to inspire and celebrate. Many people don\u2019t care about their own safety but are helping, it is wonderful. When we face some tragic situation, it reveals the deeper human values of compassion. Usually people don\u2019t think about these deeper human values, but when they see their human brothers and sisters suffering the response comes automatically. If there is a way to overcome your situation then make effort, no need to worry. If truly there is no way to overcome then it is no use to worry, you can\u2019t do anything. You have to accept it, like old age. The spiritual leader of Tibet said it was pointless for people to consider themselves too old and that while young people had fresh minds which could contribute to a better world \u2013 along with greater physical ability \u2013 they are \u201ctoo much excited\u201d. Older people have more experience they can help by teaching the young. We can tell them to be calm ... When I was in Tibet, I had no knowledge about the environment. We took it for granted. We could drink water from any of the streams. I came here to Dharamshala [northern India] in 1960. That winter lots of snow, then each year less and less and less. We must take very seriously global warming ... No matter how rich your family is, without the community you cannot survive. In the past there was too much emphasis on my continent, my nation, my religion. Now that thinking is out of date. Now we really need a sense of oneness of seven billion human beings. He said that this sense of oneness could be one of the positive things to come out of the coronavirus crisis, which the world reacted to relatively quickly \u2013 as opposed to the climate crisis. The Dalai Lama added that developing peace of mind was imperative and people across the world should place a greater focus on doing so, speaking ahead of the release of his first album Inner World, next month \u2013 a selection of teachings and mantras set to music. The whole world should pay more attention to how to transform our emotions. It should be part of education not religion. Education about peace of mind and how to develop peace of mind. That is very important. Malaysia has reported 43 new coronavirus cases, raising the total to 8,445 infections. The health ministry also reported one new death, taking total fatalities from the outbreak in the country to 120. Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia has reported 1,014 new cases and 43 new deaths. Dozens of people have tested positive for coronavirus in Beijing as parts of the city are locked down and a district in the city put itself on a \u201cwartime\u201d footing after the emergence of a new cluster linked to a wholesale food market. People were ordered to stay at home at 11 residential estates in south Beijing\u2019s Fengtai district and the nearby Xinfadi market was closed as authorities raced to contain the outbreak (see 5.13am) that has raised fears of a resurgence in local transmission as hundreds of troops were deployed to the area. A number of the new symptomatic cases were linked to the meat and vegetable market, China\u2019s National Health Commission said, with another 45 asymptomatic cases detected after mass testing of at least 500 people at the market on Friday, according to officials who said those carrying the virus have been placed under medical observation. Another worker tested positive at a farmers\u2019 market in the city\u2019s north-western district of Haidian. They were a close contact of one of the confirmed cases linked to Xinfadi, AFP reported. Beijing\u2019s first Covid-19 case in two months, announced on Thursday, had visited Xinfadi market last week and had no recent travel history outside the city. China\u2019s domestic outbreak had been brought largely under control through strict lockdowns. These measures had mostly been lifted as the infection rate dropped, and the majority of cases reported in recent months were citizens living abroad who were tested as they returned home during the pandemic. The chairman of the Xinfadi market told state-run Beijing News that the virus was detected on chopping boards used to handle imported salmon, with city officials ordering safety inspections focusing on fresh and frozen meat, poultry and fish in supermarkets, warehouses and catering services. Major supermarket chains including Wumart and Carrefour reportedly removed all stocks of salmon overnight in the capital, while some Beijing restaurants were not serving any salmon on Saturday. Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll figures have been on hold for almost a week, causing uncertainty about the state of the epidemic that has claimed more than 27,000 lives in the country. The health ministry\u2019s emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon, who for months has given a daily briefing on the pandemic\u2019s evolution, has acknowledged the \u201castonishment\u201d and \u201cconfusion\u201d generated by the figures. On 25 May, the ministry changed its method of collecting data on confirmed cases and fatalities, initially giving a daily death toll of between 50 and 100, AFP reports. But the figure then fell to fewer than five per day and on some days there were no deaths at all. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told parliament there had been \u201cno deaths\u201d for several days, prompting a backlash from rightwing opposition figures who have since accused him of hiding the real number of fatalities. Experts have said the overall number of deaths had remained static as a result of discrepancies arising from alleged delays in submissions of regional data. Since 7 June, the number of dead has remained at 27,136 while the regional authorities \u201creview the information on deaths ... [until] they can give a precise death date which will give a clearer sequence,\u201d according to Simon. But some regions have insisted they have submitted all the required data. Andalusia\u2019s health minister, Jesus Aguirre, recently criticised the central government\u2019s \u201ctotal lack of respect for the dead\u201d in publishing lower figures than those said to have been submitted by the southern region. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections has passed 24,000 in Afghanistan as a key testing laboratory paused work due to lack of kits as violence rages across the country. The health ministry has detected 556 new cases from 1,065 tests in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 24,102. At least five patients also died overnight, including three in Kabul, meaning the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll now stands at 451. There have been 4,201 recoveries. The ministry has so far tested 54,770 patients. Local officials in Kabul have warned that the actual number of infections in the capital is significantly higher than what official figures show. The laboratory which has halted work is located in the western province of Herat, where a number of other patients died overnight, which borders Iran \u2013 previously the centre of the virus. The first case of the virus was reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants returned from the neighbouring country in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Testing capacity remains low in Afghanistan and experts warn that the actual number of infections is much higher. But, according to a new official plan, testing capacity will be increased in the country while clinics with no testing capacity are to be instructed to announce new patients through their symptoms. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, the new acting health minister, has warned that a large number of the country\u2019s population is infected with Covid-19. Omani called his five-part plan to fight against the virus \u201chistoric\u201d and said \u201conly a small part of health sector was to fight with coronavirus until today, but from now, all parts of the sector will get coordinated to fight against the virus.\u201d Meanwhile, violence continues across the country, with two separate attacks killing at least 18 people amid a wave of violence across the country, local officials have said. A local police chief in western Ghor, Fakhrudin, said Taliban insurgents stormed a police checkpoint late Friday night and killed 10 police officers. According to the country\u2019s national security council, 89 civilians were killed in Taliban attacks during last two weeks. \u201cWhile the government has continued to advance the cause of peace, the Taliban continued their campaign of violence against the Afghan people during Eid and the weeks after that. In the last two weeks, they killed 89 civilians and wounded 150 across 29 provinces\u201d said Javid Faisal, spokesman for the office of national security council. The Taliban has rejected the numbers released by the government today about civilian casualties in the last two weeks. Police in Nepal have arrested 10 people, including seven foreigners, as demonstrations against the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis continued with hundreds of protesters gathering in the capital city, Kathmandu, officials said. The Himalayan nation imposed a complete lockdown in March after reporting its second confirmed coronavirus case. But the number of infections has since increased to 5,062, with 16 deaths, and the government has come under fire for not doing enough to contain the outbreak. Police officials said an estimated 1,000 people had gathered on a major thoroughfare in Kathmandu for the third day, where the seven foreign nationals were arrested. \u201cThe foreigners were arrested for interfering in Nepal\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d police official Basant Lama said. Earlier this week, police used baton charges, water cannonand teargas to break up protests near the prime minister\u2019s residence. Protesters are demanding better quarantine facilities, more tests and transparency in the purchase of medical supplies to fight the crisis. \u201cQuarantine facilities lack water, sanitation and safety,\u201d protester Ramesh Pradhan said. \u201cThey are becoming the breeding centres for the coronavirus. This must be improved.\u201d Deputy prime minister, Ishwor Pokhrel, who is leading the country\u2019s coronavirus response, said in a statement: \u201cThe government is committed to increase tests, boost medical services and improve the quarantine facilities.\u201d India has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus cases, adding 11,458 confirmed infections and taking its total count to more than 300,000, according to official data. Cases in India, which has the fourth-most confirmed cases in the world, are steadily increasing despite a nationwide lockdown that began in late March and has since been loosened. Confirmed cases in the worst-hit western state of Maharashtra moved past the 100,000 mark, while 2,000 new cases were confirmed in New Delhi, where the health system has been under particular strain. Despite the rising case load, the recovery rate of patients was improving, with more than 147,000 people having recovered, the federal government said on Friday. India has 145,779 active cases, and has recorded 8,884 deaths. Russia has reported 8,706 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of people who have been infected by the vi to 520,129. Authorities said 114 people had died of the virus in the last 24 hours, raising the official national death toll to 6,829. It comes after 8,987 new cases were announced on Friday. A spike in deaths in refugee camps in Darfur, western Sudan, has sparked fears about coronavirus\u2019s invisible spread as the elderly fall sick and die at extremely concerning rates, officials have said. Nationwide, Sudan has reported 6,879 coronavirus infections and 433 deaths, according to the health ministry. Of those, 193 cases and 54 fatalities have been confirmed across Darfur, a figure experts believe is a significant lower than the true figure. Doctors in the region\u2019s few functioning hospitals report an influx of patients with symptoms like a lost sense of taste, breathing troubles and fevers, the Associated Press reported. The official causes of their deaths remain unknown. \u201cPeople in the camps are suffocating, they can\u2019t breathe,\u201d said Mohamed Hassan Adam, director of Abushouk displacement camp in North Darfur. Just a corner of the camp saw 64 unexplained deaths in one month, he said. His four neighbours, all in their sixties, grew feeble and died one by one. \u201cThey get exhausted then they die. There is no way to tell what happened,\u201d he said. Dr Abdullah Adam, a radiology doctor, said he knew of 47 people who died the past month after showing coronavirus symptoms in villages around Kabkabiya, near El-Fasher. We\u2019re losing a whole generation, said Gamal Abdulkarim Abdullah, the director of Zam Zam camp, adding he had documented the deaths of 70 people over the past week. When El Fasher, in north Darfur, saw a spike in over 200 mysterious fatalities in just two weeks, officials launched an investigation and around 50 fatalities were attributed to Covid-19, but this was believed likely an undercount. Doctors in West and Central Darfur provinces also reported an unusual increase in deaths. Some camps in the north saw 10 to 15 people a day dying the past week, compared to the normal rate of 5 to 10 a month, said Adam Regal, a spokesman for a local organisation that runs some camps. Authorities are scrambling to curb the spread of contagion amid a fragile democratic transition after protests last year toppled longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. There are limited medical facilities in the region where years of conflict have left some 1.6 million people in refugee camps. The sharp mortality increase in Darfur is mostly linked to Covid-19, although not purely, said Dr Babikir El Magboul, the director of the health ministry\u2019s emergency and epidemiology department. Amidst the pandemic, people with other illnesses are struggling to find treatment, while local authorities have clamped down on reporting. After two female journalists published an article about the high mortality rate in El Fasher and the lack of protective equipment for doctors, they were promptly harassed and threatened with arrest by a military officer, according to the Darfur Journalist Association. Hello everyone, I\u2019ll be bringing you all the main developments over the upcoming hours. If you would like to get in touch you can message me on Twitter or on mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk A bereaved relative whose uncle died in the Grenfell Tower fire has drawn parallels between living through the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath of the blaze in the UK ahead of the third anniversary of the disaster. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle Hesham Rahman, lived on the top floor of the tower in west London, told of how the pandemic has been \u201creally tough\u201d for many of the bereaved, and survivors, of the inferno which killed 72 people. Ahead of the third anniversary of the fire on Sunday, the vice chairman of the Grenfell United group told the PA news agency: Especially in the beginning, there were a lot of similarities to what was happening just after the fire. Being able to know what\u2019s going on with your loved ones when they were taken into hospital, waiting by the TV listening to the number of deaths rising every day, being glued to the TV for any sort of news and not being able to know where to go or who to turn to. Mussilhy also drew parallels between the UK government\u2019s response to Covid-19 and the aftermath of Grenfell. The government has been criticised for not reacting quick enough: making sure the NHS has the right equipment and is supported in the right way to be able to tackle the pandemic. They just didn\u2019t react quick enough. It\u2019s also three years on, people always say that time changes, time is the best thing for healing, but in this case it feels like it just gets worse and so many things are happening that have so many similarities to what happened to us, and what continues to happen to us. In tribute to each victim who died in the catastrophic blaze at the west London tower block, bells of London churches will on Sunday toll 72 times and green lights will glow from tower block windows as remembrance and commemoration moves online due to the pandemic. Faith leaders will conduct sermons and reflections online throughoutthe day and after dark from 10.30pm, and people in homes across the UK are asked to play a bright green light from their screens to show solidarity with the bereaved and survivors, said the Grenfell United group. Mussilhy said the lack of face-to-face contact with other victims and those who are bereaved is \u201cmaking this year\u2019s anniversary a lot more difficult\u201d. He described feeling \u201creally weird and heavy this year\u201d, adding: \u201cI guess going through extremely tough times, the one thing that\u2019s helped me the most is being able to be around people and be around friends and family. Not being able to do that, it\u2019s just been extremely tough.\u201d Grenfell United said: It is a day of remembrance and mourning. This year will be different to the last two years. We are living through another tragedy - Covid 19 and it has affected our community. Please join from home to remember 72 lives lost &amp; reflect on our ongoing journey to justice &amp; change. Even apart we remain together until justice comes. A Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government spokeswoman said: The safety of residents is our priority and we took immediate steps after the tragic Grenfell Tower fire to ensure nothing like it could ever happen again. This included setting up the Building Safety Programme and testing process to quickly identify all high-rise buildings with ACM cladding. Since then we have worked tirelessly with councils to ensure buildings at risk are made safe - backed by \u00a31.6bn in funding. We will ensure everyone affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy continues to receive the support they need with over \u00a3158m committed to supporting the community so far. The public inquiry into the disaster was paused in March because of the pandemic and is due to restart on 6 July. I might leave you there for now but Mattha Busby is here to guide you through the rest of the day. The major events of the last few hours are: Multiple Black Lives Matter and refugee rights rallies occurred around Australia, many breaking strict public health orders as the country tries to maintain its low infection rate. Police have urged Londoners not to attend today\u2019s planned protest due to health concerns and warnings that far-right groups may also attend the rally with intent to cause trouble. China reported 11 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, including six domestic cases in the capital that raised concerns about a resurgence. The mayor of Mexico City said the Mexican capital will next week lift restrictions on car traffic and public transport, and allow 340,000 factory workers to get back to work, even though new cases of coronavirus are still rising. New Zealand hasn\u2019t recorded any new cases of Covid-19 for 22 days. Following the recovery of an Auckland woman on Monday, New Zealand has no known active cases of Covid-19, and no one is in hospital with the virus. White House infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said US president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies are \u201ca danger\u201d and \u201crisky\u201d. He urged those attending to wear a mask and use hand sanitiser. In the city of Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia, there is concern that multiple patients could have contracted Covid-19 after a doctor worked at three medical clinics while infectious. \u201cThe doctor did not have any symptoms at the time and went into isolation immediately upon being informed they were a close contact of a confirmed case,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Victorian department of health. He worked at three clinics between the 9 and 11 June. \u201cAll sites are being appropriately cleaned. The Department is contacting all potentially affected patients,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs the doctor is asymptomatic, the risk of transmission is low, however, if anyone is experiencing any symptoms they should get tested and self-isolate.\u201d Victoria recorded 8 new cases in the past day, a jump from the low single digits the state has become accustomed to in the past week. Six of the remaining cases were from returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one was connected to an existing cluster. Refugee activists have defied a court order and taken to the streets in Sydney, Australia, but the small event ended without confrontation with police. A group of about 70 protesters chanted slogans, stood in front of Town Hall and did laps of the block as part of the \u201cFree the refugees: national day of action\u201d event on Saturday, with 100 police officers watching on. The Refugee Action Coalition pushed ahead with the event, despite the New South Wales supreme court on Thursday night ruling it a prohibited public assembly. NSW police opposed the event on health grounds amid the coronavirus pandemic. Just under 300 people registered their intention to attend the event on Facebook, with another 1200 expressing their interest, but, the turnout was far smaller. Organisers had planned to hold an \u201cexercise protest\u201d by having participants jog and cycle around the streets to get around the 20-person limit on public gatherings. Instead, about half the protesters walked laps of the block chanting slogans such as \u201cfree, free the refugees\u201d, while another group stood in front of Town Hall. James Supple, from the Refugee Action Coalition, defended the decision to go ahead with the rally. \u201cPeople are attempting suicide, their mental health is deteriorating rapidly, their medical issues are not being properly treated, there\u2019s an urgent issue there for the people who need to be released,\u201d Supple said. Prior to the rally, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, begged protesters to stay home, while NSW police warned anyone taking part that they risked being fined or arrested. People joining the Black Lives Matter demonstrations on Saturday must be off the streets by 5pm, according to conditions laid down by the Metropolitan police. The force fear the anti-racism protests \u2013 that were sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US last month \u2013 could be met with counter-demonstrations by far-right groups. On Friday, statues in Parliament Square including Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi were boarded up to prevent them being targeted by either side. \u201cObviously there are some people who are generally concerned about the protection of their statues and monuments, but many people are coming for a fight, and they are talking openly about it on their social media accounts,\u201d Nick Lowles, chief executive of the activist group Hope not Hate, told BBC radio this morning. Met commander Bas Javid, brother of former chancellor Sajid, said he understood the depth of feeling of protesters, but asked people not to come to London while lockdown rules were still in force. \u201cIf you were planning to come to London, I again would urge you to reconsider, but if you are still intent, please familiarise yourself with what the conditions are,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease keep yourself safe by complying with government guidance on social distancing.\u201d You can read the full story below: Here is the latest global report on Covid-19 from The Guardian. Authorities fear rallies and protests will present an infection risk, a Brazilian city prepares to exhume bodies to free up more space, and fresh domestic cases cause alarm in Beijing. Protests are well and truly underway throughout Australia. About 300 protesters are blockading a Brisbane hotel, accusing the government of seeking to silence detained asylum seekers by moving them. Supporters of about 120 detainees have vowed to continue preventing authorities from accessing the Kangaroo Point Central Hotel. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk previously warned people not to attend the rally due to coronavirus fears. Supporters of about 120 detainees have vowed to continue preventing authorities from accessing the Kangaroo Point Central Hotel. Protesters say authorities are intent on relocating asylum seekers who\u2019ve staged a series of balcony protests over their long-term detention at the hotel. About 40 men holding signs stood on the hotel\u2019s balconies waving as the protest kicked off. Some of those at the hotel have been in detention for years after coming to Australia for medical treatment. The organisers are also demanding the men be granted freedom of movement. \u201cThey cannot go out to exercise for their health. We demand they be allowed to walk around and get some fresh air,\u201d protest spokesman Sam Watson said. Meanwhile protesters are meeting across eight Melbourne locations to call for freedom for refugees stuck in indefinite detention. They are spreading out in order to comply with health authority social distancing and gathering requirements. At a hotel in the northern suburb of Preston, Mantra Bell City, where some refugees have been held for at least seven months, up to about 30 protesters are standing outside. Asylum seekers who were transported from Manus Island for medical treatment can be seen peering out of hotel windows to watch the rally, AAP reports. In Sydney, a small rally for refugees is being held in the city. Protesters there are also adhering to social distancing rules. But thousands of people have now gathered in support of Black Lives Matter in Perth at Langley Park. The Western Australian premier urged protesters not to gather due to health risks, but health minister Roger Cook revealed on Friday his wife Carly Lane, would attend the rally. \u201cRoger\u2019s wife Carly is her own person,\u201d McGowan told reporters. \u201cThis is about trying to save people\u2019s lives and stop any potential community spread of the virus. We\u2019ve been very clear with people organising the rally and the police have been in contact with them to that effect. This is about trying to save people\u2019s lives and stop any potential community spread of the virus.\u201d EU leaders are set to join Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday for talks on jumpstarting the nation\u2019s economy, but opposition figures have shunned the hastily organised \u2013 and roundly criticised \u2013 initiative. Despite a bevy of A-list political speakers, Italians such as far-right leader Matteo Salvini planned to sit out Conte\u2019s conference, casting it as a media stunt designed to boost the premier\u2019s profile, AFP reports. Although his approval ratings rose during the coronavirus emergency, Conte now faces political challenges as the country faces a deep recession. He has convinced European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to join via video conference, along with International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva, according to the Italian news agency AGI. Other top European Union officials were also reportedly on board, while European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde was scheduled but had yet to confirm, AGI said. As of Friday afternoon, Conte\u2019s office had not published a public agenda for the closed door sessions that were to continue through Monday. Conte publicly launched the idea last week, saying he wanted to unite \u201cthe country\u2019s strongest forces\u201d and compile the \u201cmost effective ideas\u201d for an economic rebound following two months of lockdown. The EU\u2019s third largest economy is expected to contract by at least 8.3% in 2020, under the most optimistic estimate from Italy\u2019s national statistics agency. Some protests occurring throughout Australia today are clearly exceeding limits set by health authorities for public gatherings. Statues of public figures have also been targeted in the protests, organised by refugee and Black Lives Matter advocates. Bronze busts of former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard have been sprayed with red paint in the regional town of Ballarat, Victoria. The statues along the Prime Minister\u2019s Avenue in the Botanical Gardens were defaced with paint on Saturday morning, Victoria Police said. The bust stands were also daubed with offensive symbols between midnight and 2.15am, a spokesman confirmed. \u201cOur city does not condone any form of graffiti or vandalism on its public assets, regardless of people\u2019s beliefs or rising public sentiment, and I am certain our residents will be equally as disgusted by these actions,\u201d City of Ballarat chief executive Janet Dore said. On Friday, Perth police charged a man after the Captain James Stirling statue on Hay Street outside Town Hall was spray painted. The statue\u2019s neck and hands were painted red and an Aboriginal flag was painted over the inscription at the base. Thousands have gathered for a Black Lives Matter protest in Perth again on Saturday, despite calls from the premier Mark McGowan to delay them. However, the protesters, from images, appear to be socially distancing. China reported 11 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, including six domestic cases in the capital that raised concerns about a resurgence, AFP reports. The majority of China\u2019s cases in recent months were overseas nationals tested as they returned home, with the domestic outbreak brought largely under control after the disease first emerged in the central city of Wuhan last year. But the new cases have prompted Beijing officials to delay the return of students to primary schools, and suspend all sporting events and group dining. City authorities on Friday also closed two markets visited by one of the known cases. The chairman of the Xinfadi meat wholesale market told state-run Beijing News that the virus was detected on chopping boards used to handle imported salmon. Major supermarket chains including Wumart and Carrefour removed all stocks of salmon overnight in the capital, but said supplies of other products would not be affected, Beijing Daily reported Saturday. AFP reporters saw dozens of police officers deployed at the two markets. The novel coronavirus is believed to have jumped from an animal to humans at a Wuhan market that sold wildlife. The first new case in Beijing after two months \u2013 who had no recent travel history outside the city \u2013 was reported on Thursday, and authorities confirmed two more infections the next day. The other five cases reported Saturday were brought in from overseas. Black Lives Matter protests have begun around Australia, with more set to start throughout the day. In the Northern Territory, 700 to 1000 people have gathered, walking slowly through the streets of the capital city, Darwin. Currently, the legal gathering limited in the NT is 500 but organisers lodged a safety plan with the government allowing the protest to go ahead. The territory currently has no active cases of Covid-19. In Queensland, a protest has begun in the city of Rockhampton, and in the town of Innisfail in the state\u2019s far north, where around 300 people turned out in the rain. Attendees had to register to join the march and Queensland police have discouraged residents from attending the rallies. More protests are set to begin shortly around Australia including in the state capitals of Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. Police in New South Wales have warned anyone attending the Sydney protest risked being fined and arrested. Last weekend, tens of thousands of people protested in downtown Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane against racism and the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody. Matilda Boseley reports that attendees of Friday night\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests in Sydney say they were left terrified after an officer appeared to flash a hand symbol associated with the white power movement. Black Lives Matter protesters gathered in the Sydney CBD to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody, despite health warnings not to gather due to health risks from Covid-19. Protester Jen Atherton filmed the video after the group was moved out of Hyde park by dozens of police officers and both parties made their way to Town Hall. \u201cIt was just really shocking,\u201d Atherton said. The symbol is extremely similar to the \u201cOK\u201d hand gesture but has been used by white power movements in recent years. \u201cYou can\u2019t really ever confirm but \u2026 I don\u2019t see why he would be saying everything was OK in that moment,\u201d Atherton said. NSW police have denied the gesture was in any way related to the white power movement. In a statement, a spokesperson said: The officer has been spoken to and did not intentionally make a gesture that could be deemed offensive. Further, the officer indicated he was responding to a group of women about the night being \u2018OK\u2019 and used a hand symbol as he was wearing a face mask. He did not know the gesture had any other meaning. The NSW police force works closely to foster a strong and cohesive partnership with Aboriginal communities and other groups and does not appreciate irresponsible inflammatory commentary in this space. Read the full story here: China reported 11 new Covid-19 cases and seven asymptomatic cases for 12 June, the national health authority said on Saturday. The National Health commission said in a statement that five of the new confirmed patients were so-called imported cases involving travellers from overseas. The six locally transmitted cases were all in Beijing. The commission reported seven confirmed cases and one asymptomatic case a day earlier. The total number of Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 83,075, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. China does not count asymptomatic patients, who are infected with the virus but do not display symptoms, as confirmed cases. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said last week that removing statues of controversial figures is \u201cto lie about our history\u201d, as he argued that national protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the US had been taken over by extremists. In a lengthy Twitter thread in response to the boarding up of the Cenotaph in Whitehall and Winston Churchill\u2019s statue in Parliament Square, the prime minister expressed anger at the targeting of monuments, the Guardian reported. Well, Australia\u2019s treasurer Josh Frydenberg has now weighed in on Twitter, saying Churchill \u201csaved families and the world from Nazi tyranny\u201d. His comments prompted a swift backlash, with many telling Frydenberg he needed to educate himself on Churchill\u2019s views on racial hierarchies and eugenics. In an opinion piece, Richard Toye wrote for CNN that: Churchill is often the subject of false or exaggerated allegations. But in truth, he said enough horrifying things that there is no need to invent more. He said that he hated people with \u2018slit eyes and pig tails\u2019. To him, people from India were \u2018the beastliest people in the world next to the Germans\u2019. He admitted that he \u2018did not really think that black people were as capable or as efficient as white people\u2019. Similar calls to remove statues are occurring during Black Lives Matter and refugee protests in Australia, with rallies to be held throughout the country on Saturday despite Covid-19 health restrictions banning mass gatherings. In Sydney, Australia, a refugee activist group is planning to flout a supreme court ban by holding an \u201cexercise protest\u201d in the city. The Refugee Action Coalition is pushing ahead with the event, planned to take place at Town Hall at 2pm on Saturday, despite the court on Thursday night ruling it a prohibited public assembly. Organisers say they would still hold the event. However, they are now planning an \u201cexercise protest\u201d to get around regulations. Under public health orders, a gathering of more than 20 people is prohibited in New South Wales, however, public exercise is not. The organisers posted this on Facebook: Join an exercise protest by riding your bike, walking or jogging in small groups around the block around Sydney Town Hall. You can even wear your exercise gear if you like. If people try to stop you and ask if you are part of the protest, you can tell them you are simply exercising, which is not illegal. NSW Police has warned that anyone attending the protest risks being fined and arrested. A 24-year-old woman was fined $1,000 for disobeying a police move-on order during a Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney city on Friday night. New Zealand news service Newshub reports the latest figures from the ministry of health show no new cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. It means New Zealand hasn\u2019t recorded any new cases for 22 days in a row. Following the recovery of an Auckland woman on Monday, New Zealand has no known active cases of Covid-19, and no one is in hospital with the virus. In Australia four new Covid-19 cases have been identified in New South Wales overnight. Of those, two cases are travellers now in hotel quarantine. The third is a locally acquired case under investigation, a man in his twenties. All close contacts of this case are being contacted. It is understood the man did not attend any recent mass gathering, including protests. Rose Bay Public School in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs was closed on Friday due to a staff member with a likely case of Covid-19. The fourth case is the now-confirmed case related to the school. Meanwhile, one person has tested positive to the virus in Queensland overnight. It brings the total number of active Covid-19 cases in that state to five. An evangelical church in Argentina reopened as a bar in protest against the lockdown on religious services that remains in place despite the gradual opening up of other activities in this country. \u201cWe are standing here today dressed like this, carrying a tray, because it seems this is the only way we can serve the word of god,\u201d pastor Daniel Cattaneo, dressed as a waiter, said opening the \u201cworship bar\u201d at the Comunidad Redentor (Redeemer Community) evangelical church in the city of San Lorenzo, in Argentina\u2019s central province of Santa Fe Wednesday. \u201cSo apart from the breaded veal headed for table four, here goes the word of god from the house of the lord to all nations.\u201d Bar tables were placed inside the church and pastors dressed up as waiters carried bibles on their trays in a mock service meant to draw attention to the evangelist\u2019s demand that religious services be allowed despite Argentina\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. \u201cWe want to exercise our constitutional right to practice our faith,\u201d pastor Cattaneo told local media. \u201cBars can open, shops can open, why are they discriminating against us?\u201d Although the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly in Argentina\u2019s capital city of Buenos Aires and its surrounding Greater Buenos Area the rest of the country remains relatively Covid-free. The province of Santa Fe, where Cattaneo\u2019s church is located, has been especially successful at containing the virus and has started reopening activities, including bars, but churches are still being allowed to receive a maximum 10 people per service. Read the full story here: Australia\u2019s opposition leader Anthony Albanese has told reporters that people should follow the chief medical officer\u2019s health advice and \u201cshouldn\u2019t protest\u201d. The comments come as police have warned they will be out in force if protesters proceed with a prohibited rally in Sydney\u2019s city on Saturday amid the coronavirus pandemic. The state\u2019s supreme court earlier this week prohibited the \u201cFree the refugees\u201d protest scheduled for Saturday afternoon on the basis the health risks from Covid-19 \u201coutweigh the rights of public assembly and free speech\u201d. It comes after more than 600 officers flooded the CBD on Friday night as about 300 people protested against Aboriginal deaths in custody. Further, refugee and Black Lives Matter protests are also planned for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth on Saturday. Melbourne protests will occur in different locations, in groups of 20, to comply with health regulations. During a press conference on Saturday morning, Albanese said: There are a range of ways that people can express their views. They don\u2019t have to gather in mass gatherings, against the health advice. And I\u2019d say to people \u2013 you can protest in different ways, you can even put people together so they\u2019re not in the same place. Many Australians have had Zoom meetings. I had one with I don\u2019t know how many hundred people the other day. That would be far better to express opinions over any issue at all. Our democracy is important, so that people can have their say. There are a range of ways you can have your say without breaching the advice of the health experts. People who do attend protests are being urged to keep their distance from others, wear masks, use hand sanitiser, avoid shouting as this can spread droplets, and to quarantine if they later develop symptoms. Those with health issues and who are elderly are being urged not to attend. The mayor of Mexico City said the Mexican capital will next week lift restrictions on car traffic and public transport, and allow 340,000 factory works to get back to work, even though new cases of coronavirus are still rising. Reuters reports that Mexico City and the adjacent urban sprawl are home to more than 21m people, and the region accounts for more than 40% of some 139,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country. On Friday Mexico reported a record of more than 5,000 new cases. \u201cWe think next week the city can begin a process of very orderly transition,\u201d mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said, noting there had been a slight drop in hospital occupancy rates and that the city\u2019s contagion alert level was close to coming down a notch. Curbs on vehicle traffic and public transport are due to be eased on Monday and factories will start opening on Tuesday under strict sanitary protections, the city government said. On Thursday, small shops will have permission to reopen, while professional services and scientific workers linked to \u201cindustry\u201d can go back as of Friday. As US president Donald Trump continues to fearmonger over Twitter about the hundreds of protesters who have occupied several city blocks in Seattle and dubbed them a police-free \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\u201d Seattle\u2019s mayor has responded that \u201cSeattle is fine\u201d. The autonomous zone \u201chas both a protest and street fair vibe, with a small garden, medic station, smoking area, and a \u201cNo Cop Co-op\u201d, where people can get supplies and food at no cost,\u201d Hallie Golden reported for The Guardian yesterday. One activist said the takeover was reminiscent of the Occupy movement. Daily Beast reporter Kelly Weill also noted that claims that local businesses were being harmed by the takeover had been walked back, and that many local business owners were quite supportive of \u201cCHAZ,\u201d although one feared that it might distract attentionfrom the key demands of the Black Lives Matter movement. The ABC reports that thousands of sheep stranded in Western Australia after the crew of an export ship contracted coronavirus will finally be sent to the Middle East, despite a shipping ban. The federal department of agriculture this month refused to grant the export ship Al Kuwait an exemption to travel during the northern summer, to prevent sheep suffering from heat stress. But the ABC reports that the majority of the sheep can now travel on a different ship, which meets animal welfare requirements. It is understood that the ship will sail by Wednesday. It follows the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, being forced to acknowledge last month that his state\u2019s health department was notified of sick crew members on board the vessel before it docked in Fremantle. White House infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said his advice to people who want to attend US president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies is the same for Black Lives Matter and anti-Trump protestors. He said the gatherings are \u201ca danger\u201d and \u201crisky\u201d. He urged those attending wear a mask and use hand sanitiser. Fauci made the comments during an interview on ABC News podcast Powerhouse Politics. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a danger to the people who are trying to control the demonstration,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a danger to the people who are demonstrating. So at the end of the day, it is a risky procedure.\u201d When asked whether his advice applied to Trump campaign rallies, Fauci said, \u201cI am consistent. I stick by what I say.\u201d Trump announced his campaign rallies are planned for 19 June, known as Juneteenth in the US, a holiday marking the end of slavery. Trump has insisted he did not choose the date on purpose. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m having a rally on that day \u2013 you can really think about that very positively as a celebration,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cBecause a rally to me is a celebration. It\u2019s an interesting date. It wasn\u2019t done for that reason, but it\u2019s an interesting date.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. As authorities in many countries are still struggling to contain the virus, protests are being held throughout the world following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd in the US on 25 May. A police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s protests of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. The event sparked organisers from the Black Lives Matter movement to organise protests, which have been occurring throughout the US, Australia and the UK. US president Donald Trump has since announced he will be holding an election campaign rally on 19 June, known in the US as Juneteenth, one of the oldest official celebrations commemorating the end of slavery. Attendees are being encouraged to sign a liability waiver to acknowledge that by attending, they are at risk of acquiring or spreading Covid-19. Meanwhile, in an interview with Fox news where Trump was asked to address the way chokeholds have been unfairly used by police against African Americans like George Floyd, Trump responded that: \u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect.\u201d He added, however that \u201cgenerally\u201d speaking, chokeholds should not be used. White house infectious disease expert and member of the White House coronavirus task force, Anthony Fauci, said that attending a protest is \u201crisky\u201d. Black Lives Matter advocates and refugee activists will hold protests throughout Australia on Saturday, despite warnings from health authorities they could lead to Covid-19 outbreaks. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday: \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous.\u201d However the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July. Brazil\u2019s death toll has overtaken the UK\u2019s. There have been 41,828 deaths in Brazil, the country\u2019s health ministry said, with only the US having more fatalities. The UK\u2019s death toll is 41,566, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Breastfeeding mothers do not seem to be passing on Covid-19 to their infants, a World Health Organisation expert has said. New mothers infected with the virus should generally continue breastfeeding if they wish to and should not be separated from their babies, the WHO said, stressing that the benefits outweighed the risks. Black Lives Matter advocates and refugee activists will hold protests throughout Australia on Saturday, despite warnings from health authorities they could lead to Covid-19 outbreaks. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous\u201d. However the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July. It follows protests last weekend, when people took to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been 437 known Aboriginal deaths since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow. The protests were sparked in solidarity with the US following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd on 25 May. One man was diagnosed with the virus following the Melbourne protests, with health authorities saying he was likely infected prior to the rally. Victoria police issued fines of $1,652 each to the three people who organised the protest. On Saturday, refugee activists plan to hold eight rallies of 20 people each throughout Melbourne in order to comply with restrictions on crowd numbers. In Brisbane, supporters of detained asylum seekers have vowed to ramp up their blockade of a hotel. Protesters claim authorities are intent on relocating asylum seekers who\u2019ve been in long-term detention at the Kangaroo Point Central hotel and have staged a series of balcony protests. Meanwhile about 200 refugee supporters will protest the indefinite detention of refugees in Sydney. And thousands of protesters will gather in Perth for Saturday\u2019s protest at Langley Park. Organisers have ignored premier Mark McGowan\u2019s pleas to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic is over.",
