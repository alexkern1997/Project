      "bodyText": "Tullow Oil may emerge as the latest casualty of the coronavirus this week as it prepares to lay bare the toll of a difficult year, amid growing investor concern for the oil industry in the months and years ahead. The troubled exploration company has already lost more than half its market value since the start of 2019 as the Covid-19 outbreak punctured rising oil markets and cast doubt on the size of world energy demand in the year ahead. The FTSE 250 group warned investors in January that it would take a \u00a31.5bn writedown due to the economic impact of the virus, which has stalled growth in China and threatens productivity across the globe. Since then, oil prices have tumbled to a one-year low of below $50 a barrel, from almost $69 at the beginning of the year, as traders warned the market to be prepared for \u201czero growth\u201d in oil demand this year. Tullow\u2019s financial woes began before the coronavirus outbreak hit the globe\u2019s appetite for oil. In December, its shares plunged to a 16-year low after the company surprised investors by slashing its production forecasts, scrapping its dividend and announcing that its chief executive and exploration director had left. Tullow has been plagued by problems in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. It planned to tap the oil-rich reserves off the Guyanese coast but was forced to admit this year that that \u201ctransformational\u201d project had turned out to be a damp squib. But the impact of a global oil-market downturn, combined with mounting concerns over global heating, is likely to magnify the existing weaknesses of the company \u2013 and many of its peers. Tullow is one of a handful of exploration and production companies listed on the UK\u2019s premium stock markets that are entirely exposed both to the short-term pain of the coronavirus outbreak and the long-term existential risk of the climate crisis. The market has been particularly unforgiving for Premier Oil, which faces a $4bn debt refinancing and has suffered a precipitous plunge in market value, from more than 117p a share at the start of the year to about 62p last week. The combination of weak oil prices and wary investor sentiment means there has never been a worse time to be reliant on fossil fuels and saddled with debt. Oil industry brokers at Peel Hunt slashed their share price targets for companies across the sector late last week. On average, the valuation of all listed oil companies in its sights have fallen by about 15%. The world\u2019s oil supermajors \u2013 Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Repsol \u2013 may be able to keep investors on side by charting a greener future, but UK oil companies such as Tullow, Premier Oil and EnQuest have fewer options, and limited capital, available to weather the coming storm. Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund and Tullow\u2019s fifth-largest investor, made its position on fossil fuel investment clear earlier this month. Larry Fink, the boss of the $7tn fund, said the climate emergency was altering how investors viewed the long-term prospects of companies and warned of a \u201csignificant reallocation of capital\u201d. Weeks later, Jim Cramer, the influential host of the US investment television show Mad Money, said he was \u201cdone with fossil fuels\u201d because they had entered a \u201cdeath-knell phase\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The new Pachamama rooftop bar in Cairns is usually pumping from Friday night through to Sunday. Two months ago there was a throng of young tourists draped on banana lounges around the pool or dancing to the house beats of DJ duo Mark and Anya. But on Sunday, it was deserted. The tourists are gone and just a couple of families are taking advantage of the locals\u2019 Sunday special of sangria jugs as their children swim in the pool. Mark and Anya spin decks to an empty dance floor. The combined economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak and the bushfires have kept visitors away from Australia and nowhere is this more acutely felt than north Queensland. The wet season from January has traditionally been a low season for the Queensland tourism industry in the far north, so the growing Chinese market has been a much-needed boost for a region in recent years. However, since Chinese New Year this year, Chinese tourist numbers have dried up because of cancelled inbound flights from China. It\u2019s been a tough blow for region already suffering a struggling market since last year\u2019s floods, the summer\u2019s bushfires and the international attention on coral bleaching. Down the road from the Bailey Hotel on the usually bustling Cairns Esplanade, travel agent Simon, who did not want his surname used, is waiting for walk-ins at the travel agency he has worked in for the last five years. \u201cWithout a doubt everyone is feeling the pinch of the coronavirus, 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any figures but just from conversations with people they are all suffering, a lot of suppliers are having problems. \u201cYou just have to look at the number of specials businesses are offering at the moment, that tells you straight away numbers are down and that people are struggling. Who needs to offer a discount if they are doing OK? A lot of companies are doing that and that rings alarm bells for me. \u201cAlso, a lot of the hotels here are doing it tough, I know of one large hotel that running at under 10% occupancy. \u201cThis is normally a quiet time of year, but it\u2019s not normally this quiet.\u201d However, Simon believes the media is unfairly portraying the situation. \u201cYes the impacts of the coronavirus have been big, but what is it? It\u2019s just a bad flu. \u201cLet\u2019s get a bit of balance in the conversation.\u201d Two blocks from the Esplanade, in Cairns city centre, Jess Miller, a barista, cleans and restocks while waiting for customers. Miller said she had never seen business so bad and that many hospitality businesses were struggling. \u201cI know of couple cafes that are on the verge of closing. A lot of my friends in hospitality can\u2019t find enough work. \u201cI was working at a cafe at the airport six weeks ago, but when all the flights from China were cancelled during Chinese New Year, the work just dried up. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how important the Chinese tourists were until they stopped coming because of coronavirus.\u201d One of those tourists, Chinese national Lisa Liu, an interpreter from Beijing, has been holidaying in Australia for the last two months with her husband and two young children. \u201cWe originally only came to Australia for a month, but then with the outbreak we decided to stay an extra month. \u201cThere was no point going home as the schools are all closed and we would be stuck at home under quarantine \u2013 the kids would have driven us crazy so we continued our vacation here instead. \u201cFrom an individual point of view this has been great for us, no big crowds and very quiet, but it must be very hard for the local businesses. \u201cWith many signs in Chinese around town, and Chinese menus, it\u2019s obvious it is a popular place for Chinese people, but there are hardly any Chinese tourists here right now.\u201d Liu said they had encountered some negative responses from people during their visit. \u201cWe walked into a shop and two ladies reacted badly to my children, because they were Chinese thinking they would catch the virus, but the virus is everywhere now.\u201d Lui said in Beijing people were working together as a community to overcome the crisis. \u201cEveryone is helping each other, and when we return people will help us to deal with this, it\u2019s really important that we all work together to get through this.\u201d The chief executive of the region\u2019s industry peak body Tourism Tropical North Queensland, Mark Olsen, said the Cairns economy was projected to have suffered a $300m loss of revenue for the first quarter of this year due to bushfires and coronavirus.

He warned that people, including health professionals, should not continue to go to work if they have symptoms. \u201cDon\u2019t soldier on ... we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard.\u201d New South Wales health authorities, meanwhile, were seeking to track down passengers on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha after a man in his 70s was among six new cases of the deadly virus diagnosed in the state. The state government on Saturday announced that an additional six cases of Covid-19 had been discovered, bringing the NSW total number to 34. All the new cases were close contacts or family members of previously confirmed cases except for a man who contracted the virus after visiting Italy. He fell ill day the day after flying back to Sydney via Qatar. NSW Health said it was attempting to contact passengers on Qatar Airways flight QR908 which left Doha on 1 March. \u201cScreening continues at Sydney international Airport,\u201d NSW Health said in a statement. \u201cAs at midnight 7 March, a total of 23,814 passengers have been assessed, and a total of 77 were sent for testing.\u201d With Australian Associated Press",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Monday\u2019s blog: We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along. Some highlights and links: Trump used a freewheeling CDC press conference, intended to provide updates on the coronavirus, as an opportunity to attack Democrats, praise his own intelligence, lash out at CNN and spread false and misleading information about the status of the outbreak. The president made false statements about the availability of tests. Trump also said he wanted exposed passengers to remain on a cruise abroad so that the number of cases wouldn\u2019t increase in the US. The president insulted the governor of Washington state, who is currently overseeing the most serious coronavirus outbreak. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign sued CNN for publishing an opinion piece that argued Trump did not stop Russia from helping the campaign during the presidential election. The president escalated his attacks on Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive health. In a newly released documentary, Bill Clinton claimed the reason for his 1995 extramarital affair with then White House intern Monica Lewinsky was \u201cto manage [his] anxieties\u201d. Trump announced Congressman Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff. The next debate will be Biden v Sanders, with the latest qualifications ensuring Tulsi Gabbard, who is still a candidate, will not join them on the stage. A number of prominent Illinois Democrats endorsed Biden. The president called Elizabeth Warren mean, but praised her attacks on Mike Bloomberg. Some more on Mark Meadows, who Trump just announced as his new chief of staff: The conservative four-term congressman from North Carolina previously chaired the Freedom Caucus and has long been a close ally to the president. He\u2019s also been a staunch proponent of Trump\u2019s border wall in Congress. He replaces Mick Mulvaney, who was acting chief, and who will now become the US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Trump said in his Friday evening tweet: Mulvaney was a key figure during the impeachment proceedings. Trump has just announced Congressman Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff, replacing Mick Mulvaney: Some commentators are calling Trump\u2019s CDC coronavirus press conference today one of his \u201cmost frightening\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d appearances in recent memory, given his political rants, misinformation, bizarre boasting and callousness: He used the press event as an opportunity to attack Democrats, praise his own intelligence, slam CNN and spread false and misleading information about the status of the coronavirus outbreak. While wearing his red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d re-election campaign hat, the president went on a rant criticizing Washington state governor Jay Inslee as a \u201csnake\u201d and saying he disagreed with his vice president\u2019s complimentary remarks toward the Democratic governor. Inslee, who ran for president last year, is overseeing the most serious outbreak in the US. In a moment that has sparked intense scrutiny, the president also said he would prefer that cruise ship passengers exposed to the virus be left abroad so that they don\u2019t add to the number of total infections in the US. \u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d said Trump, who appeared to be explicitly acknowledging his political concerns about the outbreak: \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d The president further implied that the coronavirus test was available to anyone who needs it, even though his own administration has acknowledged that there is currently a shortage among US health care providers. He called the test \u201cperfect\u201d. More on the latest here: The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the pro-Israel lobby group, has confirmed that two attendees at their major conference have now tested positive for coronavirus. As reporter Ryan Grim noted, there were 18,000 people in attendance, including two-thirds of Congress, and many of attendees also visited offices on the Hill: Washington state governor Jay Inslee, who is currently overseeing the most serious coronavirus outbreak in the US, has responded to the president\u2019s personal insults and attacks, which Trump made during a rambling tangent at a CDC press conference earlier: The president also said he disagreed with his vice president\u2019s complimentary remarks toward the Democratic governor. Inslee just tweeted: Outside of the CDC, an update on the Biden v Sanders race today: -Sanders has directly criticized Biden over recent attacks against Nina Turner, the Sanders campaign co-chair: Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and Biden supporter, has faced intense backlash and was forced to apologize after she told Turner, a black woman: \u201cDon\u2019t use Martin Luther King against Joe Biden. You don\u2019t have that stand.\u201d Biden has not tweeted about the dispute, but he did condemn an antisemitic attack against Sanders after a man unfurled a Nazi flag at one of his rallies: To recap what just happened at this Trump CDC press conference on coronavirus: The president wore his re-election campaign hat and interrupted the event to ask a Fox News reporter if his town hall on the network had good ratings. He attacked CNN. He called the governor of Washington state, the epicenter of a major outbreak, a \u201csnake\u201d and \u201cnot a good governor\u201d, and said he disagreed with his own vice president saying nice things about the governor while visiting the state. Trump said he has not considered canceling his rallies and is not worried about risks. He made false and exaggerated claims about the availability of coronavirus tests, ignoring the reality that his vice president has acknowledged, which is that there is a shortage among US healthcare providers right now. He said he would prefer if people on the Grand Princess cruise remained on the ship so that US numbers would not go up. He gloated about his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the epidemic. The president took a break from sharing false and misleading information at his CDC coronavirus press conference to attack the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, who previously was running for president: He\u2019s also using the event as an opportunity to praise himself: Trump is continuing to speak at the CDC about coronavirus, and just said, \u201cAnyone who wants a test can get a test.\u201d There is, in fact, a test kit shortage across the country, as US health care providers have repeatedly reported. Trump\u2019s own vice president has said there are not enough tests to meed the demand. The president is also speaking with characteristic hyperbole, calling the coronavirus tests \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d: The president has repeatedly pushed false statements attempting to blame the Obama administration for current coronavirus testing problems: Here\u2019s recent reporting from the Guardian on what this shortage looks like on the ground from the perspective of US nurses: Trump is again attempting to downplay the threat of the coronavirus outbreak while also going on a tangent about TV ratings and Fox News at the CDC: https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1236051629654388736 Asked about coronavirus, he started talking about flu deaths: \u201cLast year, we had approximately 36,000 deaths due to what\u2019s called the flu. When I first heard this four, five, six weeks ago ... I was shocked to hear it.\u201d Before finishing his thought, he praised Fox News and asked a reporter about ratings: \u201cHow was the show last night, did it get good ratings by the way?\u201d He then said he would prefer that the passengers of the Grand Princess stay on the ship, so that the number of coronavirus cases in the US don\u2019t increase: The quote: I\u2019d rather have the people stay ... I like the numbers being where they are. I don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault. It wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either ... I\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally. Hello - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. The president is currently touring the CDC, talking with officials while wearing his \u201cKeep America Great\u201d re-election campaign hat: CDC\u2019s direct Robert Redfield began his public comments with praise for Trump\u2019s leadership. Trump is also using this time that was supposed to be a public health update as an opportunity to again insult CNN: The president had arrived at the CDC in the last 20 minutes and is beginning his visit there to be briefed on US efforts to test for and combat the coronavirus outbreak. He hasn\u2019t said anything publicly yet. I\u2019m handing over to my west coast colleague Sam Levin now, to take you through the next few hours in US politics. Here are some of the latest key events: Air Force One disgorges the president in Georgia to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard won\u2019t make the next Democratic debate despite hanging on in the 2020 race for the nomination. It\u2019s down to two, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden picked up the endorsements of leading Democratic party figures Lori Lightfoot, Dick Durbin and Deval Patrick this afternoon. The Trump re-election campaign has filed an audacious (and likely extremely long shot) libel lawsuit against CNN over an opinion piece relating to Russian interference to support Trump in the election(s). Bernie Sanders slammed the waving of a swastika flag by a protester at his rally in Phoenix last night as \u201cbeyond disgusting\u201d The president arrived at the main campus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, in the motorcade just moments ago. The reporters\u2019 pool traveling with Donald Trump\u2019s party reported that, on the way there was a mix of well-wishers and protestors along route. One sign said: \u201cWelcome chief idiot.\u201d Another read: \u201cHave faith in science.\u201d Another said: \u201cWe need a vaccine against Trump.\u201d Of course, as Trump fails to grasp, even if there was such a thing as a vaccine against him or his ideology it wouldn\u2019t be ready before the election....(cheat sheet: amid public health concerns, Trump has mentioned incorrectly that a vaccine for the Covid-19 coronavirus was close to ready and has appeared reluctant to grasp that such a thing is 12 - 18 months away. And that the seasonal influenza vaccine won\u2019t work on coronavirus). Hey Democrats, are you Joe a-Biden or feeling the Bern? It\u2019s make your mind up time. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino indicates that the next primary season debate in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 15, will be a two person affair. Yep, Tulsi Gabbard IS still in the race, but she\u2019s not IN the race. So let\u2019s see how two shouty, tetchy white guys in their late seventies will do, before one of them goes toe-to-toe with their similarly-bracketed but Republican nemesis in the man cave/White House. Another boost for Biden Deval Patrick, former governor of Massachusetts, who ran a very brief campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination to be president, has just endorsed Joe Biden. He will appear with the former vice president at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday, the Boston Globe reports. Biden\u2019s main remaining rival, Bernie Sanders, just pulled out of a rally in Mississippi that was scheduled for today, seemingly being forced to give up on the southern vote to race to Michigan in a last-ditch attempt to grab a mid-western state, as Sanders\u2019 campaign is suddenly \u2018Berning out\u2019. Massachusetts\u2019s first Black governor, Patrick adds to the growing list of one-time candidates to endorse Biden, and offers him a prominent surrogate in Mississippi, where nearly 40 percent of residents are African-American, the Globe writes. Shortly after Cory Booker dropped out of the 2020 race, in January, and Patrick did not cross the party\u2019s threshold to be included in the Democratic primary debates, he said at the time, the Guardian reported: \u201cAmerica will not see herself in full\u201d when the seventh Democratic debate takes place in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday night, Deval Patrick said, citing an absence of candidates of colour. Patrick entered late and remains well off the pace in both poll results and donations, criteria used by the Democratic National Committee to determine debate qualification. On Monday, he responded to Booker\u2019s departure by tweeting: \u201cWhether it\u2019s behind closed doors or screaming it from the rooftops \u2013 every candidate in this race needs to say it out loud: women and people of colour can win. To say otherwise expresses a lack of faith in the American people who deserve more from their leaders.\u201d Campaign legal action slammed as \u201clawsuit spree\u201d The lawsuit filed by the Trump re-election campaign against CNN earlier is the third such in two weeks against media outlets the president frequently criticizes himself - the cable news network, the New York Times and the Washington Post. Here\u2019s what some influential folks and outlets are saying about this on Twitter: Literary and free expression advocates PEN America. This guy: Oof, that\u2019s a gut-punch to the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to sue media outlets it doesn\u2019t like over some articles......but not others.... When Donald Trump attacked the NYT in October, 2018, over its investigation into his financial affairs headlined \u201cTrump Engaged in Suspect Tax Scheme as He Reaped Riches From His Father\u201d, the NYT was swift to note at the time that: Mr. Trump did not offer an outright denial of the facts in the report, such as that the money he made during his decades in real estate came from tax schemes of dubious legality, the existence of records of deception in documenting the family\u2019s financial assets, and that the beginning of the president\u2019s so-called self-made fortune dates back to his toddler years when, by the time he was 3 years old, Mr. Trump earned $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father. CNN-er hits back CNN\u2019s media expert Brian Stelter says libel lawsuits like the one Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign just filed against CNN, and prior suits vs the New York Times and the Washington Post won\u2019t succeed and are just a political strategy. Others are weighing in: Stelter points out that there is no official comment from his employer, CNN, at this point, which the Fox News report also noted. Here\u2019s a useful take from Axios, pointing out that: It\u2019s the latest of a series of libel suits by the campaign aimed at media outlets\u2019 opinion articles on issues linked to Russia. Over the last few weeks, the campaign has also sued the New York Times and the Washington Post, alleging similar motives. While President Trump has often threatened to sue news organizations for libel, he has rarely followed through. The efforts face a relatively high bar for proof compared to most lawsuits. In order for a public official to successfully sue for libel, they must be able to prove that the defendant acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d The article named in the suit, written by CNN contributor Larry Noble and published in June, states that \u201cthe Trump campaign assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia\u2019s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.\u201d That assertion is backed up earlier in the piece by citing a Trump interview last year with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, where Trump said he\u2019d \u201cwant to hear\u201d information offered on political opponents by a foreign government. His statement in that interview was also used to support an argument in one of the Post pieces that resulted in a lawsuit. The CNN piece also cites an \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d interview with White House adviser Jared Kushner, who said that he doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d call the FBI if he were to receive another email like the one before the campaign\u2019s Trump Tower meeting, which had the subject line: \u201cRe: Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.\u201d Illinois Democratic heavyweights Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago, and Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the US Senate (after minority leader Chuck Schumer), have just endorsed frontrunner Joe Biden for the party nomination to take on Donald Trump in November. Illinois voters go to the polls in the state\u2019s Democratic primary on March 17. Bernie Sanders is desperate to win something in the midwest but is struggling, heading to Detroit as we write in a frantic attempt to snatch Michigan out of the path of Biden\u2019s new South Carolina/Super Tuesday juggernaut. Lightfoot has reportedly been a Sanders critic. Michigan votes this Tuesday. Donald Trump re-election campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN on Friday for publishing \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d statements about seeking Russia\u2019s help in the 2020 election, Fox News reports. \u201cThe complaint alleges CNN was aware of the falsity at the time it published them but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign while misleading its own readers in the process... the campaign filed this lawsuit against CNN and the preceding suits against The New York Times and The Washington Post to hold the publishers accountable for their reckless false reporting and also to establish the truth,\u201d Senior Legal Adviser to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. Jenna Ellis told Fox News. Fox News obtained the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia where CNN is located. It states in part that CNN claimed Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cassessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia\u2019s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.\u201d The complaint said that CNN was well aware the statements were false \u201cbecause there was an extensive record of statements from the Campaign and the administration expressly disavowing any intention to seek Russian assistance\u201d but promoted the claim anyway. The complaint said that Trump\u2019s legal team sent CNN a request to retract and apologize last month but CNN executives refused. The Trump campaign now seeks \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d through litigation. Bernie Sanders spoke a little earlier about an awful incident at his rally in Phoenix, Arizona, last night, where a man unfurled a Nazi swastika flag and shouted anti-Jewish slurs at the 2020 candidate. The interloper was quickly kicked out of the event and Sanders denounced his actions, while noting that he had not noticed the flag or the incident himself and did not learn the details until later. \u201cI heard people booing but I didn\u2019t realise [what happened] until I left the stage,\u201d he said this morning. \u201cI speak not only as a Jewish American but on behalf of the US troops who died fighting Nazism. It\u2019s horrific, it\u2019s beyond disgusting to see, in the United States of America, that people would show the emblem of Hitler and I was shocked to hear that later,\u201d he said. He pointed out that there is sometimes disruption at his campaign events \u201cwith Trump people\u201d, but added: \u201cThis was something different\u201d to \u201chave someone bringing forth the most detestable symbol in modern history.\u201d He congratulated the Phoenix police for dealing with the incident and said he had not felt unsafe. US politics news so far today has been dominated by the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak and the state of the 2020 race for Democrats. There\u2019s plenty more action and drama to come - not least of which, Bernie Sanders is on his way to campaign in Michigan as he tries to save his nomination chances, and Donald Trump is on his way to visit the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, after visiting tornado damage in Tennessee, so do stay tuned. Here are some of the key events so far today: Bernie Sanders has reiterated that, despite divisions, he believes his rival for the Democratic 2020 nomination, Joe Biden, can beat White House incumbent and Republican Donald Trump. Sanders is heading to Detroit after canceling a planned rally in Jackson, Mississippi, today, figuring he has more chance of overcoming Biden in Michigan than the south. The US Congress will hold a hearing next week into Donald Trump\u2019s handling of America\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak (botched, according to one member of the committee that will question health officials next Tuesday). Donald Trump will visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this afternoon, after his plans to visit were initially canceled this morning, then reinstated. The CDC is the primary federal public health agency. The president signed an $8.3bn emergency spending bill passed by Congress yesterday to help fund the US response to coronavirus. The signing occurred in the White House. Bernie Sanders, speaking to the press in Phoenix, Arizona, moments ago before heading to Detroit for a make-or-break weekend of campaigning ahead of the Michigan primary on Tuesday, reiterated a message he said he has asserted since \u201cDay One\u201d of his 2020 campaign - that he believes Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump in November, if his rival becomes the Democratic nominee. Asked straight out, can Joe Biden beat Donald Trump, Sanders said, simply: \u201cYes, he can.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is my friend,\u201d Sanders said. He gave a laundry list of ways in which their track records and their campaign appeals differ, and we\u2019ll get on that in the next couple of posts - as well as that flag incident, where a swastika was waved at his rally in Phoenix last night. First the vital points that Sanders emphasizes that ousting Trump from the White House is the overarching goal for any Democrat right now. He points out that attacking Joe Biden is part of democracy. Then adds: \u201cI\u2019ve said from Day One I will support the Democratic nominee. The American people and democracy are entitled to a serious debate on our campaigns to decide who is the best to beat Donald Trump but at the end of the day, 98 to 99% of Democrats...are going to come together. \u201cThese differences are minimal compared with Trump.\u201d He adds that the challenge is to get disillusioned voters to the polls. \u201cWe have is to energize those Americans who say [of politicians] \u2018they all stink\u2019.\u201d Bernie Sanders is heading today to campaign in Michigan, canceling a rally he had planned to hold in Jackson, Mississippi. The ultra-progressive is suddenly once again in the fight of his career after moderate Joe Biden roared past him to snatch frontrunner status on Super Tuesday, turbo-charged by the support of 2020 drop-outs Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke, and the pivotal endorsement of South Carolina grandee James Clyburn, to make his great comeback. It seems Sanders has no choice this weekend but to focus on the midwest, where Missouri and Michigan vote in their primaries next Tuesday, March 10, and abandon Mississippi, which also votes that day. After Joe Biden swept the southern states on Super Tuesday this week, starting with surprisingly quick projections of victory in Virginia and South Carolina just moments after the polls closed, Sanders desperately needs a win in the midwest. His efforts are not being helped by the fact that Michigan\u2019s popular Democratic party governor, Gretchen Whitmer, endorsed Biden yesterday. \u201cAll roads to the White House lead through my state, and I want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a strong ability to help impact where we are headed as a nation,\u201d she told MSNBC. Sanders campaigned for Whitmer\u2019s primary challenger in 2018.... Michigan awards three times more pledged delegates (who invariably anoint the nominee) than Mississippi. Dilemma over cruise ship off California After Donald Trump played down the seriousness for the US of the coronavirus outbreak, in a press Q &amp; A at the White House this morning, he immediately expressed concern about the cruise ship anchored near San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. The ship is under strict quarantine conditions. \u201cIn terms of [US] cases, it\u2019s very, very few...but then we have a ship with many, many Americans on it. We have to make a decision and we are talking to the governor of California about that,\u201d the president said. The Guardian\u2019s Viv Ho reports: Passengers on a Grand Princess cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California remained off the coast on Thursday as the first two cases were confirmed in San Francisco. A coast guard helicopter was delivering test kits to the cruise ship waiting to dock in the port of San Francisco before flying them back to a laboratory. While the ship has 2,422 passengers and 1,111 crew onboard, according to the cruise line, fewer than 100 have thus far been identified for testing. \u201cThe ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, in a news conference Wednesday. The death of a 71-year-old man on Wednesday was the first US fatality reported outside of Washington state. The US death toll is now at 14. Obviously in itself this is a very low figure in a population of more than 325 million. But justified concerns grow over adequate testing and the fact that there is no specialized treatment, cure or preventive vaccine for Covid-19, and the lethality rate is relatively high, especially for vulnerable populations. To say nothing of the Trump administration\u2019s patchy and confusing response so far. Our dedicated global coronavirus live blog can be followed here, by the way. Our business blog, which is keeping an eye on how coronavirus worries are affecting financial markets (Wall Street is tumbling), as well as other economic news, can be followed here. Testing for coronavirus in US \u201cso botched\u201d Illinois congressman and House oversight committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi just hopped onto CNN to talk about the upcoming hearing next week. The committee will meet on Tuesday afternoon and hear sworn testimony from health officials. Contrary to Donald Trump\u2019s blas\u00e9 assertions this morning that the coronavirus outbreak has been \u201cshut down\u201d in the US and is going to \u201cgo away\u201d, Krishnamoorthi has concerns. He said that the Trump administration seems to be \u201ctrying to prevent the public from knowing the scale of the outbreak.\u201d He added: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to tell you where the confirmed cases are, they don\u2019t want to tell you how many people have been tested or how many people\u201d have the novel, pneumonia-like illness that has a relatively high lethality rate for those contracting the virus (between two and 3.4% lethality compared with seasonal influenza which typically kills 0.1% of those who catch it). Krishnamoorthi said that while China, where the outbreak started, is testing 10,000 people a day, the US has \u201cconducted 500 tests total across the country.\u201d \u201cThe whole testing issue has been so botched,\u201d he said. Vice president Mike Pence admitted last night - in a blunt statement that was actually refreshingly devoid of spin - that the US does not have enough coronovirus testing kits to meet demand right now. The oversight committee will seek testimony and answers under oath from public health officials next Tuesday, which the congressman said should elicit answers to important questions and will \u201csend a signal\u201d to the administration of what needs to be done. \u201cWe are worried,\u201d he said. Krishnamoorthi won Tammy Duckworth\u2019s Illinois House seat after she was elected to the US Senate in 2016. The hearing on Tuesday begins at 2pm ET on Capitol Hill. The US death toll from coronavirus has now risen to 14. The United States is considering ways to discourage US travelers from taking cruises as part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to four officials familiar with the situation, Reuters reports. The officials, who asked to remain anonymous, said no decision has been made. The discussions are taking place ahead of a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of leading the US response to the coronavirus, and the cruise industry this weekend. The administration could advise some or all US travelers to avoid taking cruises in the face of a growing number of coronavirus cases on cruise ships, officials said. More on the quarantined cruise ship anchored off California in a moment... The cruise industry had an economic impact of more than $52.7bn to the United States in 2018, according to a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association. This was an increase of more than 10% since 2016. The House oversight committee plans to hold a hearing in Washington next week to question officials from the Department of Health and Human Service and the federal public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The president\u2019s visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, is confirmed as back on, the White House says. Trump\u2019s visit was abruptly canceled this morning, then he mentioned that it might be back on. Now there\u2019s been a briefing for journalists accompanying the president on Air Force One (he\u2019s on his way to Tennessee to tour areas damaged by Tuesday\u2019s tornado and will then go to Georgia to the CDC). Pool report: Stephanie Grisham came back during flight to say the CDC visit is back on. There will \u201cprobably be a tour\u201d she said when asked what would be on the itinerary. Explaining the on-off nature of the trip she: \u201cWhat the president said is true.\u201d [Based on his statements at the White House prior to his departure this morning.] A CDC member of staff was suspected to have contracted coronavirus and they did not think they would get the test results in time before president\u2019s trip so \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d, she said, it was postponed for the safety of everyone involved and to allow the CDC to prevent any further spread. \u201cThankfully she\u2019s negative, the person,\u201d tested negative. Itinerary is now to visit Nashville and then go to Atlanta. The president is heading to his private resort club Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida, later today and is holding a fundraiser this evening. But Donald Trump revealed this morning that he is also meeting with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro at the club this weekend. A visit had been talked about, but details were not public. Reuters reports: Trump announced the meeting while speaking to reporters at the White House [on Friday morning], saying the two leaders would have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Trump did not offer any other details. Sources had earlier said the meeting was in the works, and one person familiar with the matter earlier told Reuters that Bolsonaro said he was \u201ccalled\u201d by Trump. \u201cHe wanted to have dinner,\u201d Trump told reporters. The meeting is expected to be closed to the press without any public statements, two others sources said. A preliminary schedule for Bolsonaro\u2019s US visit had shown the Brazilian conservative president would be in Florida from Saturday to Tuesday, including a meeting with a senior US military official, an investor seminar and visit to a plant run by Brazilian plane-maker Embraer. Since becoming president of Brazil, the conservative Bolsonaro has caused shockwaves among supporters of democracy, the environment, a free press, LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights, indigenous rights and..one could go on and on, ending in a primeval scream from the Amazonian rainforest as the logging trucks rumble by. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith also just asked Donald Trump at the White House what he thought of Elizabeth Warren dropping out of the race for the Democratic nomination yesterday, after a very disappointing performance in the Super Tuesday primaries across 14 states (she did not win any and came third in her home state of Massachusetts). Boom! Like taking a doctor\u2019s hammer on the knee, those misogynistic Trumpian reflexes shot up. \u201cI think lack of talent was her problem,\u201d he said, of one of the most talented figures in the Democratic party and the US Senate. Then he paid her a back-handed compliment, for slaying his New York frenemy-turned-arch enemy Mike Bloomberg. \u201cShe was a tremendous debater, she destroyed Mike Bloomberg very quickly,\u201d he said, of Bloomberg\u2019s first debate with his Democratic rivals, earlier this year, when Warren skewered him on his track record of discrimination lawsuits from women employees and sexist jokes, leaving the former New York mayor and billionaire gasping. But of course the irony is that there\u2019s nothing Trump loathes more, is viscerally repelled by, than a strong debating female..... He went on: \u201cBut people don\u2019t like her. She is a mean person. They like a person like me that\u2019s not mean.\u201d Warren wants to up taxes on billionaires. Trump policies put kids in cages at the US-Mexico border and rip families apart with his anti-Muslim travel ban while his rhetoric appears to be inspiring a surge of racist bullying in schools. Donald Trump just lit into Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden almost in a single breath, in one of his free-wheeling Q &amp; As with gathered media at the White House earlier this morning. The Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief David Smith is on pool duty today in the capital today. He was at the press session in the Diplomatic Room and got in a series of questions probing for the president\u2019s latest thoughts on the Democratic race for the 2020 party nomination. We\u2019ll come on to what he said about Warren in the next post. Meanwhile, Super Tuesday\u2019s tumultuous events catapulted Joe Biden back from the brink of 2020 failure to a strong position as national frontrunner, while pushing Warren and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg out of the contest in short order. Sanders now finds himself desperately chasing Biden and looking increasingly doomed, when a week ago it was precisely the other way around. Smith asked Trump what he thought of Biden\u2019s comeback and received this rather surprising response. \u201cJoe Biden? He\u2019s leftwing. In many ways he is worse than Bernie,\u201d he said, referring to Sanders\u2019s self-declared longtime label of Democratic socialist v Biden\u2019s stance as a leading moderate in the Democratic party. \u201cHe wants to put Beto in charge of guns,\u201d he said. Former Texas congressman and ex-candidate for 2020 Beto O\u2019Rourke endorsed Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday. And his most famous line from the Democratic debates while he was still in the campaign, and not long after a horrendous, seemingly anti-immigrant-driven mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, in west Texas, last year, was a strong call for federal gun control in America, especially a ban on military-style assault weapons. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15s,\u201d he shouted. Trump then seemingly took a dig at Biden\u2019s mental acuity (the 73-year-old Trump taunting the 77-year-old Biden), saying: \u201cIf he gets in they will be running the government, he has people who are further left than Bernie, he\u2019s going to raise taxes more than Bernie, he will destroy everything that\u2019s been built.\u201d Trump just reiterated his lack of worry about the spread of the novel illness in the US. Perhaps problematic, though is that, to many, he\u2019s coming across as casually dismissive and posturing, not measured, and reassuringly presidential. \u201cYou have to be calm,\u201d he said, at the White House this morning before departing to tour the tornado damage in Tennessee and just after signing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to deal with the virus. \u201cIt will go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very low numbers [of confirmed cases] compared to many countries throughout the world, our numbers are lower than almost anyone...deaths, is it 11?\u201d It is. \u201cIn terms of cases, it\u2019s very very few because we have been very strong at the borders.\u201d He also said he thinks the financial markets will \u201creally bounce back\u201d from the see-sawing of recent days over concerns that the virus is spreading and on governments\u2019 abilities to contain it. \u201cThis came unexpectedly, it came out of China, we closed it down, we stopped it, it was a very early shut down,\u201d he added. There has been no official evidence provided to date that the novel coronavirus illness COVID-19 has been \u201cshut down\u201d in the US. President tells America not to panic over coronavirus The president signed the Congressional emergency funding bill in side the White House and put some characteristic spin on the fact that he\u2019d originally assessed that only about a quarter of the funds that have just been approved would be needed to combat the spread of the disease in the US. Signing the bill in the Diplomatic Room at the White House, he said, according to the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, who is part of the media pool covering the president in Washington today: \u201cWe\u2019ve signed the $8.3 billion. I asked for two and a half and I got 8.3 and I\u2019ll take it.\u201d He also said his CDC trip today had been cancelled because of a suspected coronavirus case at the CDC itself - but that this turned out to be negative, so he may visit after all. \u201cSo I may be going. We\u2019re going to see if they can turn it around.\u201d Trump took questions for 12 minutes from the press and reiterated his message that the public should not panic over the coronavirus - and that it would have been worse but for his early actions. We\u2019ll have fuller quotes for you shortly. But given the mixed messages the president has been putting out about the risks of the virus, including contradicting health officials about the lethality of the illness and confusing the public by talking about people with the virus going to work, when his own health experts recommend not doing that, what is normally considered audacious now sounds closer to dangerous. Upon leaving the White House en route for Tennessee moments ago, the president confirmed he had signed the emergency spending bill to fund the US response to the coronavirus outbreak. He also signaled that his visit to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta this afternoon, a trip that was abruptly canceled this morning, may be back on. The CDC is the frontline federal agency dealing with public health for the nation. Donald Trump has signed the $8.3B special spending bill to combat coronavirus outbreak in US. The bill was passed in Congress yesterday almost with close to bipartisan unanimity. It is a much higher amount than the president originally suggested would be enough to deal with the novel illness. A top communications official is set to leave the White House later this month, it appears, as the president continues to muddle through not just his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak but its messaging, too. Adam Kennedy, a deputy communications director, is on his way out, according to Politico, which reports that he was: Also a deputy assistant to the president, has overseen a team of 11 communications staffers and also worked on building out messaging materials for various White House policy rollouts, including tax reform. A top research official at the Republican National Committee during 2016, he has worked in the White House since the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Kennedy led the White House\u2019s rapid response efforts on impeachment and other crises, including Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation battle, is leaving the government later this month, according to two White House officials. And here\u2019s the sting in the tail - right-wing BREITBART: Kennedy will be replaced by Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer who is currently director of rapid response and surrogate operations for the White House, according to one of the White House officials. Hahn will report to White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. Donald Trump is heading to Nashville this morning to visit areas hit by the deadly nighttime tornado that tore through Tennessee before dawn on Tuesday, killing 25, injuring at least 150 and destroying or damaging almost 600 homes with winds that reached 175mph. The president will be departing the White House soon, so let\u2019s watch out for any comments on the lawn, aka \u201cchopper talk\u201d before he boards the Marine One helicopter to take him to Air Force One and thence the south. He was originally scheduled to go to Atlanta this afternoon, to visit the CDC, which is at the core of US medical efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak. But that trip was abruptly canceled by the White House this morning. The president has been making up statistics on a personal hunch about how deadly the disease is and last night vice president Mike Pence, whom Trump has put in charge of his administration\u2019s task force to tackle the novel virus that\u2019s spreading globally, said the US does not yet have enough equipment to meet testing demands. Pence was in Washington State yesterday, where the worst local outbreak yet in the US is occurring. We\u2019ll bring you selected US coronavirus news here, but for all the details of global developments, including US news on the illness, do follow our dedicated live blog, here. And to keep track of how coronavirus concerns are affecting the financial markets, and the latest US jobs figures, there is quick and clear news in our dedicated business live blog, here. Good morning, live blog readers! It\u2019s Friday and there\u2019s still a lot of action before the political week in Washington is out and another weekend of 2020 campaigning begins for those remaining in the Democratic race for the nomination. Joanna Walters here in New York to take you through today\u2019s developments. Here\u2019s what\u2019s afoot: Breaking news: the White House has unexpectedly canceled a trip by Donald Trump to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today, the federal agency in charge of national public health in the United States, under the umbrella of the health department. The president was due to visit amid the coronavirus outbreak. There\u2019s no official explanation for the cancellation yet. Meanwhile, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination has narrowed to just three contenders: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and long-shot candidate Tulsi Gabbard. With Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement yesterday that she would suspend her presidential campaign, the nominating contest is coming down to a face-off between Biden and Sanders. Biden has momentum on his side after his strong performance on Super Tuesday, when he notched 10 state victories to Sanders\u2019 four. But Sanders is hoping he can pull ahead by winning over a high number of Warren\u2019s former supporters. His first test will come on Tuesday, when six states hold primaries. Those contests will give Sanders the chance to recapture the delegate lead, but if Biden can secure more victories on Tuesday, this primary may be over sooner than expected.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>If I buy travel insurance now for a holiday I have just booked, will it cover me going forward?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. The Association of British Insurers confirmed this week that someone booking a holiday to Spain in, say, June, and buying travel insurance would be covered for cancellation, but only if the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) later advised against travel to the country. The insurance has to have been bought before a country was declared off limits.</p> <p>That said, Money would not be surprised if insurers \u2013 faced with a deluge of claims in the future \u2013 started to argue that the virus was a known problem when the policy was bought. Force majeure may be used to avoid paying out, although when we examined several major travel policy terms and conditions this week, we were not able to identify such get-out clauses. <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>Will travel insurance cover me if I cancel my holiday?</strong></h2> <p>In most cases, no. Insurers\u2019 cancellation cover will only kick in if the FCO advises against all but essential travel. This happened for China, parts of South Korea and the area of northern Italy in lockdown. However, if you are travelling to another destination that is not covered by the advice \u2013 and you don\u2019t feel you want to travel because of the risk \u2013 your travel insurance will not cover your losses<strong>. MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>What travel insurance policy should I buy?</strong></h2> <p>One of the problems faced by travellers has been the fact that airlines have been cancelling flights. While they will refund the cost of the ticket, holidaymakers have been left holding unrefundable hotel and car hire bookings. The better travel policies offer \u201ctravel disruption cover\u201d, which will often pick up the pieces in such circumstances.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-two-months-after-government-announces-rescue\" title=\"\">Flybe\u2019s collapse</a> this week and the warnings that other airlines may be in the same boat, buyers need to opt for a policy that offers scheduled airline failure (SAF). About half of travel policies sold in the UK offer SAF as standard, with a further 19% offering it as an add-on according to Defaqto. In the current climate it would be a mistake not to buy a policy that included it.</p> <p>MoneySavingExpert did an in-depth investigation into <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2020/02/coronavirus-travel-help-and-your-rights/\" title=\"\">which policies are currently the best buys</a>. It highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.theaa.com/travel-insurance/\" title=\"\">AA (Silver)</a> cover policy, which will cover you if your flight or hotel is cancelled. This costs about \u00a329 for a 35-year-old\u2019s annual European policy, \u00a3141 for a family worldwide. It also favours Nationwide\u2019s travel cover for those with its FlexPlus account. <strong>MB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"357911f3d8121cb4fdb241b24087f55749fe60d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/357911f3d8121cb4fdb241b24087f55749fe60d8/0_31_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Ben Youngs looks to pass the ball during the Six Nations match between England and Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rugby fans who bought tour packages for the England v Italy Six Nations match in Rome on 14 March should get refunds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>I\u2019m over 70, and my doctor has advised me not to travel.

      "bodyText": "If I buy travel insurance now for a holiday I have just booked, will it cover me going forward? Yes. The Association of British Insurers confirmed this week that someone booking a holiday to Spain in, say, June, and buying travel insurance would be covered for cancellation, but only if the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) later advised against travel to the country. The insurance has to have been bought before a country was declared off limits. That said, Money would not be surprised if insurers \u2013 faced with a deluge of claims in the future \u2013 started to argue that the virus was a known problem when the policy was bought. Force majeure may be used to avoid paying out, although when we examined several major travel policy terms and conditions this week, we were not able to identify such get-out clauses. MB Will travel insurance cover me if I cancel my holiday? In most cases, no. Insurers\u2019 cancellation cover will only kick in if the FCO advises against all but essential travel. This happened for China, parts of South Korea and the area of northern Italy in lockdown. However, if you are travelling to another destination that is not covered by the advice \u2013 and you don\u2019t feel you want to travel because of the risk \u2013 your travel insurance will not cover your losses. MB What travel insurance policy should I buy? One of the problems faced by travellers has been the fact that airlines have been cancelling flights. While they will refund the cost of the ticket, holidaymakers have been left holding unrefundable hotel and car hire bookings. The better travel policies offer \u201ctravel disruption cover\u201d, which will often pick up the pieces in such circumstances. After Flybe\u2019s collapse this week and the warnings that other airlines may be in the same boat, buyers need to opt for a policy that offers scheduled airline failure (SAF). About half of travel policies sold in the UK offer SAF as standard, with a further 19% offering it as an add-on according to Defaqto. In the current climate it would be a mistake not to buy a policy that included it. MoneySavingExpert did an in-depth investigation into which policies are currently the best buys. It highlighted the AA (Silver) cover policy, which will cover you if your flight or hotel is cancelled. This costs about \u00a329 for a 35-year-old\u2019s annual European policy, \u00a3141 for a family worldwide. It also favours Nationwide\u2019s travel cover for those with its FlexPlus account. MB I\u2019m over 70, and my doctor has advised me not to travel. What\u2019s my position? The possible exception to the above comes if your GP has advised you not to travel to a virus-affected area, in which case your travel insurance could kick in. Axa said: \u201cIf your GP tells you not to travel to an [affected] area, you should contact us before your departure date, and you won\u2019t be penalised.\u201d The normal conditions of declaring pre-existing conditions will apply. So, if you were told not to travel by your doctor because of an underlying lung problem that you had not declared when you bought the policy, you may find your claim turned down, or the payout reduced. Doctors may, in the current climate, take a very dim view of being asked to provide a letter to allow you to make such a claim. MB I was due to travel to attend an event that has been cancelled \u2013 can I claim back my losses? It depends. Those who bought tour packages to go to the Italy v England Six Nations rugby match in Rome on 14 March \u2013 which has been postponed \u2013 will be offered a full refund or tickets for the new date. However, if you had put together your own package, buying a match ticket, and booking hotels and flights yourself, most travel policies are unlikely to pay up. There are a few exceptions. Some insurers will pay up if you are forced to abandon the trip. For example, Barclays\u2019 travel insurance states that it will pay up to \u00a33,000 if \u201cthe area in which you are staying is affected by pandemic or epidemic influenza\u201d. Most reasonable people would think that Italy and a host of other areas have been affected, but the World Health Organization is yet to declare a pandemic. MB I have a ski holiday booked in the Dolomites later this month. Can I get my money back? The tour companies are, for now, sticking firmly to their terms and conditions. Only if you cancel at Crystal Ski (part of Tui) more than 70 days before departure do you get your money back \u2013 and then it\u2019s minus the deposit. After that, there\u2019s a sliding scale of fees: so if you cancel between 28 and 15 days prior to departure, you get just 10% of your money back; and if you cancel 14 days before it\u2019s nothing back. It\u2019s a similar picture at Inghams: you\u2019ll get nothing back if you cancel within 21 days.

If you must book now, just pay the bare minimum for the flight, and avoid the extras for \u201cpriority\u201d or seat selection. You can add them later. You may also want to avoid the financially weaker airlines \u2013 the longer the crisis carries on, the more will go bust. Atol protection only applies if you buy the accommodation and flights from a travel agent at the same time. The long-haul picture is brighter. Virgin Atlantic and BA have said they will waive flight change fees for new bookings this month, so you can buy and then postpone if needed. PC Will the Ehic cover me in Europe if I need prolonged hospital care? The Ehic \u2013 European health insurance card \u2013 is an EU-wide scheme that remains in force until the end of December this year, and gives you state-provided healthcare in the EU for free or at reduced cost until you return home.

RJ \u2018Our insurer refused to pay despite travel restrictions\u2019 A couple who were forced to abandon a rowing trip to American Samoa after the governor of the tiny Pacific island imposed a 14-day quarantine over coronavirus fears have been told by Barclays, their travel insurer, that they can\u2019t claim for their lost flights. John and Caroline Turnbull, from Woking, were due to take the trip of a lifetime in April to meet fellow rowing enthusiasts for a two-week tour of the little-known, remote American territory in the South Pacific Ocean. Having booked expensive flights from London to Hawaii, and pricey business class tickets for the five-and-a-half-hour flight to Pago Pago on American Samoa, the couple, both in their 70s, say they have been forced to abandon the Samoa part of the trip to the island, after the governor banned all foreign nationals from landing on the island unless they have spent 14 days in Hawaii.

The couple had worldwide travel insurance provided by Barclays as an add-on to a bank account and duly claimed the \u00a32,500 they had spent on the Hawaii to Samoa flights they could not use. However, Barclays turned down the cancellation claim on the basis that the UK government has not advised against travel to the island. After the Guardian\u2019s intervention, Barclays took a second look at the case, and has now paid up. \u201cThe initial decline decision was the correct given there is no cover in our policy for \u2018closure of borders\u2019.

Updating journalists on the progress of the fight against the virus, Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization\u2019s head of emergencies, referred to the issue.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been at this a long time and no one has ever responded to an epidemic perfectly. No one has ever responded in perfect time, with a perfect response,\u201d he said, even as the WHO has insisted that the sharp continuing decline in Chinese cases demonstrates the disease can be controlled with a strong and unified response.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the real world we live in. Every emergency response is dotted with missed opportunities and unfortunate delays, and sometimes decisions that have to be made on limited data, [where] you look back and you say \u2018If we knew then what we know now, then we might have done something different.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The intrinsic nature of the new coronavirus has also been a complicating factor. Paradoxically, despite being far less deadly in terms of mortality rate than Sars, the closely related coronavirus, the mildness of the symptoms experienced by many have also meant it is easier to miss.</p> \n<p>One case in point was an early European cluster identified in Munich, which some believe may have contributed to some of the first infections in Italy.</p> \n<p>According to researchers who have looked at the genetic information in about a fourth of new infections \u2013 in Mexico, Finland, Scotland and Italy as well as the first case in Brazil \u2013 these appeared similar to that initial Munich cluster suggesting, according to Trevor Bedford, a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, how routes of transmission were being missed.</p> \n<p>\u201cAn extremely important take home message here is that just because a cluster has been identified and \u2018contained\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean this case did not seed a transmission chain that went undetected until it grew to be [a] sizable outbreak,\u201d Bedford <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1235106301669068800\">posted</a> to Twitter.</p> \n<p>It is a view echoed by Francesca Russo, a senior doctor in the Veneto region. She has been involved in the search for Italy\u2019s \u2018patient zero\u2019, earning her the nickname \u201cPatient Zero Hunter.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems the virus has been circulating under the radar, for some time, alongside the normal flu virus. The most accepted hypothesis, at the moment, is that the virus arrived in Europe from the first infections in Germany and France and then arrived in Italy from everywhere,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-6-march\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the final analysis, however, what concerns those at the head of the international response is not the small mistakes but the big omissions in policy \u2013 not least the fact that many countries have yet to fully mobilise their responses.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are a number of countries that have left this up to the minister of health and the health ministry; we\u2019re saying this is wrong, it needs a whole government approach,\u201d said the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n<p>A coordinated human intervention won\u2019t stop every transmission, but it can reduce the peak of the whole epidemic, WHO experts say. And that is what could ultimately mitigate the virus\u2019s impact.</p>",

Allegations have also emerged of delays in testing the first case of community transmission in California, because of the lack of links to a high-risk location outside of the US. \u201cDiseases surprise us,\u201d Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a recent conference call, underlining the overarching difficulties in trying to respond to and contain new diseases as they emerge. \u201cWe need to be reacting to the current situation even if it differs from what we planned for.\u201d As Italian officials have sought to understand the genesis of the worst outbreak in Europe, and beyond its borders, theories are beginning to emerge over what went wrong in the Italian response. One line of inquiry is the authorities\u2019 decision to allow flights from the north, where Italy\u2019s outbreak began, to other parts of the country. \u201cWe probably should have started tracking and registering people who came to the south from the red zones of northern Italy in order to avoid spreading to the southern cities of the country,\u201d said Tullio Prestileo, a doctor in infectious diseases at Palermo\u2019s Benfratelli hospital. In some cases countries have simply not been able to identify the roots of the outbreak to draw any meaningful conclusions, even as rumours have swirled. In France\u2019s Oise department, which has the country\u2019s biggest cluster, authorities are searching for their \u201cpatient zero\u201d, the person from whom the contaminations originated. While some reports in the French media have pointed to a military airbase with 15 infections as the source of the cluster, implicating a repatriation flight from China, that has been emphatically denied by French authorities who point out that no one on the flight has tested positive; not passengers, not crew, while the French military say flight crew did not enter Chinese territory. For those who have spent many years dealing with outbreaks, some of the issues are familiar. Updating journalists on the progress of the fight against the virus, Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization\u2019s head of emergencies, referred to the issue. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this a long time and no one has ever responded to an epidemic perfectly. No one has ever responded in perfect time, with a perfect response,\u201d he said, even as the WHO has insisted that the sharp continuing decline in Chinese cases demonstrates the disease can be controlled with a strong and unified response. \u201cThis is the real world we live in. Every emergency response is dotted with missed opportunities and unfortunate delays, and sometimes decisions that have to be made on limited data, [where] you look back and you say \u2018If we knew then what we know now, then we might have done something different.\u2019\u201d The intrinsic nature of the new coronavirus has also been a complicating factor. Paradoxically, despite being far less deadly in terms of mortality rate than Sars, the closely related coronavirus, the mildness of the symptoms experienced by many have also meant it is easier to miss. One case in point was an early European cluster identified in Munich, which some believe may have contributed to some of the first infections in Italy. According to researchers who have looked at the genetic information in about a fourth of new infections \u2013 in Mexico, Finland, Scotland and Italy as well as the first case in Brazil \u2013 these appeared similar to that initial Munich cluster suggesting, according to Trevor Bedford, a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, how routes of transmission were being missed. \u201cAn extremely important take home message here is that just because a cluster has been identified and \u2018contained\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean this case did not seed a transmission chain that went undetected until it grew to be [a] sizable outbreak,\u201d Bedford posted to Twitter. It is a view echoed by Francesca Russo, a senior doctor in the Veneto region. She has been involved in the search for Italy\u2019s \u2018patient zero\u2019, earning her the nickname \u201cPatient Zero Hunter.\u201d \u201cIt seems the virus has been circulating under the radar, for some time, alongside the normal flu virus. The most accepted hypothesis, at the moment, is that the virus arrived in Europe from the first infections in Germany and France and then arrived in Italy from everywhere,\u201d she said. In the final analysis, however, what concerns those at the head of the international response is not the small mistakes but the big omissions in policy \u2013 not least the fact that many countries have yet to fully mobilise their responses. \u201cThere are a number of countries that have left this up to the minister of health and the health ministry; we\u2019re saying this is wrong, it needs a whole government approach,\u201d said the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A coordinated human intervention won\u2019t stop every transmission, but it can reduce the peak of the whole epidemic, WHO experts say. And that is what could ultimately mitigate the virus\u2019s impact.",

Malcolm Bell, the chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said since the number of coronavirus cases in Italy exploded in recent weeks, there had been a 10% increase in traffic to the Cornish tourism board\u2019s website. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell if this will translate into an increase in bookings at this stage, but that is a significant increase in traffic and very unusual for this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good indication that we could see a rise in staycations being booked from the end of March onwards.\u201d YouTube doctors offering advice on how to cope have also had a surge in interest. The coronavirus is the first novel outbreak of the hyper-digital age. With the proliferation of misinformation, false reports and conspiracy theories online creating an \u201cinfodemic\u201d, a number of doctors and scientists have taken to social media to offer expert advice to alleviate panic. Some videos have been watched millions of times, including one posted by NYC celebrity doctor and YouTuber Dr Mikhail Varshavski \u2013 Dr Mike. A 10-minute video he uploaded in January entitled The Truth About the Coronavirus has had more than 5.2m views and more than 33,000 comments. Meanwhile in Carlisle, Cumbria, a semi-retired medical teacher, John Campbell, has seen subscribers to his YouTube channel surge by more than 129,000 after posting near-daily videos providing evidence-based updates on Covid-19. His channel has gone from averaging 500,000 views a month to 9.6m views in the last 28 days, with the vast majority of views coming from the US (3.6m) and the UK (916,000). \u201cI wanted to inform and educate people to allow them to make informed decisions, like a textbook,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people spreading absolutely bonkers \u2013 and sometimes dangerous \u2013 information, then there\u2019s a minority like me trying to demystify the scientific evidence. \u201cI try to take things from the medical literature and make it easier for people to understand. It\u2019s no good to be reactive all the time; we need to be proactive if we\u2019re going to stop it from spreading. As long as I feel it\u2019s doing something useful I\u2019m going to carry on making the videos.\u201d Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, said given that coronavirus as a topic was ubiquitous, it was unsurprising to find people or organisations leveraging it. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of misinformation and scare stories, and then people trying to sell products that are benefiting from the crisis around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cQualified medical practitioners providing relevant, timely, accurate information \u2013 and not profiteering in any way \u2013 to raise awareness with people not engaged in other forms of media and to help them understand, generally, can only be a good thing.\u201d In tandem, there has been a surge in people seeking out products associated with fending off the virus. Boots ran out of face masks in stores and online last week due to high demand. And data from Kantar Worldpanel showed sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets soared by 255% last month \u2013 more than triple \u2013 as worried customers cleared the shelves. Sales of liquid soap also increased by 7% and household cleaning products rose 10%.",

      "body": "<p>What\u2019s the difference between playing a president on screen and being one in real life? Not much, according to Ukraine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\" title=\"\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, the man who\u2019s done both.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very similar,\u201d he says, his compact frame engulfed by a green leather armchair in his opulent presidential office. Then he changes his mind: in fact, the real job lasts a whole five years, and comes with far greater challenges than can fit into one season of a television show. \u201cIt\u2019s true there are more problems. They are catastrophic. They appear, I\u2019m sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don\u2019t know where they will pop up, or when.\u201d The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash.</p> <p>The latest problem is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. Angry villagers, scared their hospital is hosting returnees from China, have attacked the buses transporting them. The day before we meet, Zelenskiy dispatched his health minister to join the evacuees in quarantine, as proof they pose no danger. \u201cIt was her choice, but I suggested it,\u201d he says, chuckling in a way that implies he gave her little alternative.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things that I can\u2019t now. State secrets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is exactly the kind of impetuous decision his television alter ego might have taken. In the Ukrainian series <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6235122/\" title=\"\">Servant Of The People</a>, Zelenskiy plays an everyman with no political experience who is elevated to the country\u2019s presidency. Last April, a couple of weeks after the season three finale aired, he took 73% of the vote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/zelenskiy-wins-second-round-of-ukraines-presidential-election-exit-poll\" title=\"\">the country\u2019s actual presidential election</a>. In May, he started the job for real. In an era of outsider electoral successes, Zelenskiy\u2019s has been perhaps the most unlikely of them all.</p> <p>Running a country of 42 million people that in the past few years has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-russia-explainer\" title=\"\">a revolution, a land-grab by Vladimir Putin</a> and an ongoing war in its eastern regions was not going to be an easy task, especially for a political novice. But Zelenskiy\u2019s first real-life presidential season has thrown up one plotline that even his show\u2019s scriptwriters might have discarded as implausible, involving another unlikely president, from across the Atlantic.</p> <p>After decades in which US politicians have chided Ukraine for its venal politics, it\u2019s ironic that an American president should try to corrupt his Ukrainian counterpart. Donald Trump wanted one thing from Zelenskiy: an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Joe \u2013 his potential 2020 presidential opponent. Until he complied, Trump made it clear through aides that he would withhold $391m (\u00a3303m) in military aid, along with Zelenskiy\u2019s chance of a coveted White House visit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/30/trump-ukraine-alleged-bribery-impeachment-inquiry\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelenskiy</a> were at the crux of his impeachment trial in January, with the most damning evidence released by Trump himself: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trumps-phone-call-with-ukraines-president-read-the-full-transcript\" title=\"\">a memorandum of a 25 July call</a> between the leaders. In it, Zelenskiy flatters Trump, while delicately trying not to enter into a criminal conspiracy with him: \u201cYou are a great teacher for us,\u201d he says, in one of several passages it is hard to read without cringing. Trump, meanwhile, underlines how much the US will do for Ukraine, if only Zelenskiy will order a probe into Hunter Biden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302/0_58_4604_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump (on right) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in New York on September 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the UN summit last September, hours after Trump released the transcript of the call that led to his impeachment.

Not only 100%, but actually 1,000%,\u201d he says when Trump claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d for Ukraine (in fact, the EU is its largest financial donor). But the scandal resonated more loudly in the US; with Russia-backed troops still in the east of the country, most Ukrainians are sympathetic to maintaining US support at almost any cost.</p> <p>Zelenskiy appeared rattled when Trump released the memo just hours before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">the two </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">held an awkward press conference</a> at the UN last September. Today, he looks more comfortable discussing the exchange, though he says he is tired of the impeachment saga dominating every conversation about Ukraine. \u201cI think Ukraine has passed through this story proudly, with its head raised high,\u201d he says. But he has still not received the promised White House invitation, and it\u2019s clear this is an irritation. \u201cI was told it\u2019s being prepared. It\u2019s hard for me to hear that. I am a person who works to deadlines. Our diplomats are discussing it with American diplomats. I would like us to have a fruitful meeting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just beginning. \u2018People are tired and want a breath of fresh air'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the humiliations have kept coming. In late January, two days before secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due to travel to Kyiv in a show of US support, he somewhat undermined the message by snapping at a reporter: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/mike-pompeo-ukraine-npr-rant\" title=\"\">\u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d</a> and asking her to point to it on a map, as if it were an obscure principality rather than the biggest country in Europe. When they met, Zelenskiy says, Pompeo insisted he had been misquoted. He says he is \u201cgrateful to the US, because actually both political parties support us\u201d. But what about the president?</p> <p>Zelenskiy pauses and laughs. He draws another breath before giving a long, convoluted and largely meaningless answer about the overwhelming US support he feels, from the president down. There\u2019s not much else he can say. Trump is known to be vindictive, and could win another four years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">November</a>. On the other hand, if Zelenskiy comes out in full-blooded support, he will look a fool if a Democrat wins the White House. The best option, it seems, is to say nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWith some issues, I don\u2019t really understand how to help journalists. When it comes to matters of state, I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things I can\u2019t now. But these are state secrets.\u201d</p> <p>After 10 months in office, Zelenskiy is desperate to move the conversation on from the impeachment saga. He has agreed to a rare interview in the hope that he can \u201cchange the context\u201d \u2013 to his focus on making a deal with Putin to end the war, and on further integration with Europe. He speaks passionately and with much gesturing, deploying the easy charm that helped him win the presidency. His future success will depend on whether he can use it to good effect on the European leaders who are his best hope of escaping his unenviable position, stuck between Trump and Putin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1af41c13fc1c29390a20085d6c6e35eb3e6bf2af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af41c13fc1c29390a20085d6c6e35eb3e6bf2af/163_2314_3471_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Volodymyr Zelenskiy (president of Ukraine) in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"906\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Previous inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings. I feel horribly uncomfortable.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Bondar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the aftermath of his election victory, Zelenskiy promised voters he would \u201cstay a human being\u201d and not become a typical politician. He claims to have succeeded so far, but our surroundings tell a different story. His cavernous office is done out with gilded stucco ceilings, chandeliers and ruched curtains that cascade down long windows. So far, so very presidential. But the handshakes are hardly over before Zelenskiy tells us how ill at ease he is. \u201cI can\u2019t even sit there, it\u2019s awful,\u201d he says, pointing to the wooden desk laden with malachite ornaments and a bank of secure telephones. \u201cPrevious inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings, I guess,\u201d he says; they make him feel \u201chorribly uncomfortable\u201d.</p> <p>The most recent renovations were done by president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-yanukovych\" title=\"\">Viktor Yanukovych</a>, whose obscene corruption and cosying up to Russia prompted the 2014 Maidan revolution. We meet six years to the day since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-tymoshenko-president-protests\" title=\"\">Yanukovych fled the building</a> during bloody clashes between riot police and protesters in central Kyiv, setting in train the Russian annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>Initially, Zelenskiy promised he would move the presidential office, but he has now decided the cost to the taxpayer would be prohibitive: \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do a renovation, because it\u2019s a historic building, so it would be illegal.\u201d But it is noticeable he has not made even small changes, such as replacing the furniture or removing the kitsch bronze figurines. Maybe he needs something to complain about. Or maybe the trappings of power are proving seductive.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, you do start getting used to it.\u201d He laughs.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy was born in 1978, into a Jewish Ukrainian family in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south-east of Soviet Ukraine, dotted with mines and blast furnaces. It was a tough place to grow up, notorious for gangs of youths fighting to control different neighbourhoods in the years after the Soviet collapse.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s way out came through comedy. A natural performer, he organised a tight-knit group of friends from high school and law school into a comedy troupe named Kvartal 95, after the neighbourhood in which they grew up. By the mid-2000s, the troupe had moved to Kyiv and were appearing regularly on Ukrainian television. Recently, Zelenskiy has brought in some of them as key advisers. \u201cI have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time\u2026 They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\u201d he says, insisting the appointments are about personal trust, not financial cronyism.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s humour tended toward the slapstick: his audiences preferred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/21/biography.features\" title=\"\">Benny Hill</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python\" title=\"\">Monty Python</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47769118\" title=\"\">he has said</a>. In one skit, he and a fellow actor appear to play Chopsticks on the piano using only their penises. But there were also more pointed, political sketches, mocking Ukraine\u2019s corrupt officials and oligarchs. He came to know some of his targets personally, as he took on more work as a television and film producer, bringing him wealth and connections among the elites. Sometimes this got him into trouble, if a sketch cut too deeply. Occasionally, the group poked fun at the authoritarianism of Ukraine\u2019s big neighbour. In a skit to coincide with a Russian presidential election, Zelenskiy and his friends played the returning officers at a local polling station, suicidal because they have accidentally failed to secure a Putin victory in their district.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77fc2e3aed99c9db5c70a70f77a54e548f6a8f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77fc2e3aed99c9db5c70a70f77a54e548f6a8f07/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stills from Ukranian tv show: Servant of the People featuring Volodymyr Zelenskiy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Servant Of The People: think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kvartal 95 PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Servant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015. Zelenskiy stars as high-school teacher Vasyl Holoborodko, whose classroom tirade against corruption is filmed by a pupil and posted online, propelling him to the presidency after the post goes viral.

The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year television show, he announced that he would.</p> <p>He ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. \u201cBut where did you stop?\u201d he is asked. \u201cSomewhere around Terminator 2,\u201d comes the response.</p> <p>Zelenskiy was up against the incumbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/petro-poroshenko\" title=\"\">Petro Poroshenko</a>, a billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy\u2019s insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely avoided debate, running a populist campaign \u2013 the people against the old elites \u2013 but without the usual populist tactic of sowing anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification, fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e4646699dfd10d9f2eb99618032b1cfa9ee6c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4646699dfd10d9f2eb99618032b1cfa9ee6c8a/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FromL) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin give a press conference after a summit on Ukraine at the Elysee Palace, in Paris, on December 9, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin in Paris in December.

It wasn\u2019t intended as a serious offer, but with nothing to lose, Poroshenko said yes, gamely showing up for blood and urine tests the day before. The debate was loud, confusing and largely senseless \u2013 which was how Zelenskiy wanted it. In the stadium, both candidates came across badly, bellowing into microphones; but on television, where it really mattered, Zelenskiy was the clear winner.</p> <p>The election was an easy win, too. He came first in almost every region \u2013 something new for a country that has long been divided on regional and linguistic lines. In the minutes after his crushing victory was announced, Zelenskiy strode on to the stage at his campaign headquarters accompanied by the lilting theme tune of Servant Of The People. Nobody quite knew what a Zelenskiy presidency would look like, including the people who had voted for him. But after a two-decade cycle of revolution and disappointment, he had won, not despite his lack of experience but because of it. He called parliamentary elections soon after, announcing that his newly formed party (named the Servant Of The People Party, naturally) would nominate a varied field of candidates, most without political experience. It won more than half the parliamentary seats, giving Zelenskiy huge power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1b5aafae412673b9802c45270b6ef5e1690f07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1b5aafae412673b9802c45270b6ef5e1690f07f/0_1162_4000_4348/920.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Volodymyr Zelenskiy (president of Ukraine) in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 2020\" width=\"920\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The president can\u2019t change the country on his own.

Zelenskiy smiles. \u201cI understood that, without experienced people it\u2019s impossible to run a country. But these people are at middle level. They are the bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring the papers to.\u201d </p> <p>To manage these bureaucrats, Zelenskiy has enlisted some old friends. <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/who-is-zelenskys-chief-negotiator-andriy-yermak.html?cn-reloaded=1\" title=\"\">Andriy Yermak</a>, the man he entrusted with US negotiations last summer and recently made his chief of staff, is a former copyright lawyer. Serhiy Shefir, another presidential aide, is a co-founder of Zelenskiy\u2019s production studio. A childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, has been made head of the secret services. While Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle do not seem to be seeking personal enrichment, there are legitimate concerns about whether his friends are the best qualified people to run the country.</p> <p>Alongside these old friends, Zelenskiy put together a cabinet composed largely of well-regarded reformers, and the general feeling in the international community was that his team was doing surprisingly well, against the odds. However, earlier this week, a few days after our interview, he fired most of the government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/ukrainian-president-removes-pm-government-reshuffle-volodymyr-zelenskiy\">including the 35-year-old prime minister (and also the still-quarantined health minister)</a>. The chief prosecutor, seen as a reformer, was also dismissed by parliament. The move, which Zelenskiy gave no hint was coming during the interview, has been interpreted as a blow for genuine reform efforts.</p> <p>Zelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. \u201cThe president can\u2019t change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an example.\u201d</p> <p>While Zelenskiy appears to be enjoying himself, he admits the political spotlight has been unwelcome for his family. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like my work.\u201d Going out for a meal has to be cleared with security; taking a nice holiday looks insensitive when his country is at war.</p> <p>His wife, Olena, is a former writer for Kvartal 95 who, like Zelenskiy, grew up in Kryvyi Rih. He says that while he is used to being in the public eye, she prefers to stay out of the limelight. His 16-year-old daughter is the most irritated by his new job, bristling against the security detail that now follows her everywhere. They try to hide, but she always spots them, her father says. \u201cShe\u2019s at that age when a person is usually most free,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant for her on a human level.\u201d On the other hand, his seven-year-old son is loving it, proudly announcing to anyone who will listen that his father is the president. \u201cI came home the other day and I said, \u2018Why is nobody saying hello to me?\u2019 And I can hear my own voice on the television. It was my speech. And my son says, \u2018Don\u2019t disturb us, we\u2019re watching the president!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Before Trump hijacked the script, the main villain to Zelenskiy\u2019s hero was meant to be Putin, who annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent money, men and weapons to fuel a war that has killed 14,000 people so far, many of them civilians. Large-scale fighting was halted in 2015, but regular shelling and fatalities on the frontline have been a way of life ever since. Peace could be achieved, Zelenskiy told voters, only if Kyiv began direct negotiations with the Kremlin. This was a radical departure from Poroshenko\u2019s approach and proved popular with a nation suffering from war fatigue \u2013 though a loud minority accused Zelenskiy of capitulating to Russia by even proposing talks. But he says he values saving lives over counting territorial gains. \u201cWho is this all being done for? For people. What\u2019s the point of returning our territory if a million people die?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, Trump really was an example</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Putin and Zelenskiy met face to face for the first time in December, at a summit in Paris, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a> and Angela Merkel. They mainly stuck to the technical details of a long-ignored peace treaty, but \u201cthere were a few emotional parts\u201d, Zelenskiy recalls: when Putin complained about radical Ukrainian nationalists, he fired back that Russia has radicals, too. Was he able to get through to Putin? \u201cI think he listened to me. I had that feeling. I hope it\u2019s not a false feeling.\u201d The talks produced modest results: prisoner exchanges, an agreement to disengage military forces, and a ceasefire that has not held, with one soldier killed and several injured in a deadly flare-up in recent weeks.</p> <p>It seems unlikely that Putin will agree to any peace deal remotely acceptable to Ukrainian public opinion, but Zelenskiy says he wants to move fast. \u201cTime is ticking,\u201d he says, pointing at his watch and announcing a timeframe of a year in which to solve the conflict, so he can focus on other domestic issues. \u201cThe government can spend one year on the entire agreement. Then it should be implemented. Any longer is prohibited. If it lasts longer, we need to change the format and choose another strategy,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a dramatic new deadline, but his urgency is undercut by a lack of detail. (At times like this, Zelenskiy sounds rather Trumpian.) He declines to say what the fallback strategy might be, and when his press secretary jumps in to clarify that the one-year deadline dates from the December summit, rather than the start of his presidency in May, he replies with a laugh: \u201cI don\u2019t know any more.\u201d Thinking on the fly, as he often appears to, he buys himself the extra months: yes, it starts from the summit.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s aides present this kind of improvisation as part of his charm. In meetings with foreign dignitaries, they say, he will read the room and, if he feels he can succeed with a more emotional pitch, discard official briefing notes. And perhaps this might work with Merkel, for one, who reportedly watched clips from Servant Of The People before meeting Zelenskiy.</p> <p>Convincing Merkel and others of Ukraine\u2019s desire for closer integration into Europe is vital, he says. \u201cWe need to give people confidence that the European Union is waiting for Ukraine,\u201d he says. If it takes 20 years, his electorate will lose hope. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really believe in words. Or rather, people believe in words only for a stretch of time. Then they start to look for action.\u201d Merkel gets it, he thinks; he also claims to have developed a warm personal relationship with Macron, though he is wary of the French president\u2019s recent references to the need for warmer relations with Moscow.</p> <p>Watching Brexit unfold from Kyiv has been a strange experience, he says \u2013 seeing a country rush to exit the EU when Ukraine is so keen to join. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a group of people around a table spending a nice evening together. If someone doesn\u2019t want to sit at the table, he\u2019ll definitely ruin the party,\u201d he says, warming to his metaphor. \u201cAnd then there are people standing outside the door, ringing the doorbell, knocking, and they\u2019re told through the peephole: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re welcome to join but come back next time!\u2019 And they\u2019re still outside knocking when the party is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1cc730dc2ae9d0698804ee6d8d584405b088368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1cc730dc2ae9d0698804ee6d8d584405b088368/388_203_2602_2214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky casts his ballot next to his wife Olena (L) at a polling station in Kiev, Ukraine, on July 21, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife Olena, voting in last July\u2019s parliamentary elections.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua News Agency/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He revels in these colourful comparisons, which sometimes take him in the wrong direction. He likens his presidency to being on a boat: \u201cThere are holes everywhere, and with your arms and legs, you are trying to close them up. This is how we\u2019re living. We are closing the holes.\u201d When told it sounds like a sinking ship, Zelenskiy looks alarmed, and adds: \u201cBut we\u2019re not sinking!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When he came to power, western diplomats worried Zelenskiy might be a proxy for Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial billionaire whose television channel aired his show. Kolomoisky is one of a group of oligarchs who made vast fortunes in the transition from communism, while most Ukrainians remained poor. In recent years, they have rebranded themselves as generous philanthropists, while retaining an outsized influence on the political scene, and are far more deserving of the \u201coligarch\u201d title than their counterparts in Russia, long since neutered by Putin.</p> <p>\u201cI want them to have walk-on parts, not leading roles,\u201d Zelenskiy says. Kolomoisky receives no special treatment, he insists, despite their long acquaintance. He dismisses as \u201cinappropriate\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0af836dc-4108-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d\" title=\"\">the recent purchase</a> of a 14-bedroom mansion on the French Riviera for \u20ac200m (\u00a3170m) by Rinat Akhmetov, a businessman whose apartment at One Hyde Park was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/19/rinat-akhmetov-one-hyde-park\" title=\"\">the most expensive property ever purchased</a> in the UK when he bought it in 2011, at \u00a3136m.</p> <p>Many in Kyiv see Zelenskiy\u2019s government reshuffle this week as a sign that the old oligarchic players are reasserting their influence, despite his public claims that it was about speeding up reform. It\u2019s certainly true that Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs continue to wield tremendous power, and Zelenskiy won\u2019t be rid of their machinations simply by asking nicely. His TV president might have ordered them hanged or shot for such lavish expenditure abroad during a time of war, but the real Zelenskiy will have to work with them, asking them to invest at home and fund state projects when asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve chosen democracy, of course we can\u2019t hang people,\u201d he says, but a twinkle appears in his eyes. \u201cAlthough! Sometimes you really want to. And do you know why? Because it would be quicker. Much quicker,\u201d he says, delivering the line with a comic\u2019s timing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are joking,\u201d says his press secretary, looking somewhat concerned, from the other side of the table.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re joking,\u201d Zelenskiy says.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In their ill-fated phone call, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for providing him with a model of electoral success. \u201cWe used quite a few of your skills\u2026 we wanted to drain the swamp here in my country,\u201d he says. Is that true, or was he simply following advice that the US president responds well to flattery? He sighs and answers carefully. What Trump showed him, he says, was how an outsider can win without having to adapt to the supposed rules of the game. \u201cI do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, he really was an example \u2013 of how you can win without using the standard format.\u201d</p> <p>Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just starting and his own campaign model could succeed elsewhere. \u201cI am certain it could, especially where people are tired, where they are running like squirrels<strong> </strong>on a wheel, and there are these long-standing politicians with big financial resources. In these places, where people are searching for a breath of fresh air, it should work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-press-conference-donald-trump\">Ask me anything: Ukraine's president holds 14-hour press conference</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It sounds like a clear allusion to Ukraine\u2019s neighbour to the east, and its indefatigable leader. Indeed, on the night of his election, Zelenskiy said he wanted his victory to be an example to the entire post-Soviet region, dominated by autocrats. His success has not gone unnoticed inside Russia, and many have made favourable comparisons with the man in the Kremlin: Zelenskiy walking to his inauguration, high-fiving members of the crowd, versus a lonely Putin in his limousine, gliding through the emptied streets of Moscow to his own ceremony. Zelenskiy\u2019s chummy, upbeat new year message to the nation, versus Putin\u2019s staid television address. A Russian channel recently started to broadcast Servant Of The People, but quickly reversed the decision, presumably fearing its message was too subversive.</p> <p>Zelenskiy did not, in the end, bring down Trump, and he may well not succeed in his plans to remodel Ukraine. Could Zelenskiy\u2019s legacy turn out to be piercing Putin\u2019s aura of infallibility? \u201cOf course a new president will appear there. Of course it will happen. What kind of president it will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can see that all totalitarian regimes end the same way.\u201d</p> <p>But Putin would never simply give up power to a Zelenskiy figure in Russia. Is he predicting a bloody revolution? \u201cI don\u2019t want people to die anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we should understand that if you keep tightening the spring, at some point it will snap.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the difference between playing a president on screen and being one in real life? Not much, according to Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the man who\u2019s done both. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar,\u201d he says, his compact frame engulfed by a green leather armchair in his opulent presidential office. Then he changes his mind: in fact, the real job lasts a whole five years, and comes with far greater challenges than can fit into one season of a television show. \u201cIt\u2019s true there are more problems. They are catastrophic. They appear, I\u2019m sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don\u2019t know where they will pop up, or when.\u201d The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash. The latest problem is coronavirus. Angry villagers, scared their hospital is hosting returnees from China, have attacked the buses transporting them. The day before we meet, Zelenskiy dispatched his health minister to join the evacuees in quarantine, as proof they pose no danger. \u201cIt was her choice, but I suggested it,\u201d he says, chuckling in a way that implies he gave her little alternative. It is exactly the kind of impetuous decision his television alter ego might have taken. In the Ukrainian series Servant Of The People, Zelenskiy plays an everyman with no political experience who is elevated to the country\u2019s presidency. Last April, a couple of weeks after the season three finale aired, he took 73% of the vote in the country\u2019s actual presidential election. In May, he started the job for real. In an era of outsider electoral successes, Zelenskiy\u2019s has been perhaps the most unlikely of them all. Running a country of 42 million people that in the past few years has seen a revolution, a land-grab by Vladimir Putin and an ongoing war in its eastern regions was not going to be an easy task, especially for a political novice. But Zelenskiy\u2019s first real-life presidential season has thrown up one plotline that even his show\u2019s scriptwriters might have discarded as implausible, involving another unlikely president, from across the Atlantic. After decades in which US politicians have chided Ukraine for its venal politics, it\u2019s ironic that an American president should try to corrupt his Ukrainian counterpart. Donald Trump wanted one thing from Zelenskiy: an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Joe \u2013 his potential 2020 presidential opponent. Until he complied, Trump made it clear through aides that he would withhold $391m (\u00a3303m) in military aid, along with Zelenskiy\u2019s chance of a coveted White House visit. Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelenskiy were at the crux of his impeachment trial in January, with the most damning evidence released by Trump himself: a memorandum of a 25 July call between the leaders. In it, Zelenskiy flatters Trump, while delicately trying not to enter into a criminal conspiracy with him: \u201cYou are a great teacher for us,\u201d he says, in one of several passages it is hard to read without cringing. Trump, meanwhile, underlines how much the US will do for Ukraine, if only Zelenskiy will order a probe into Hunter Biden. His political opponents seized on his fawning tone and he was even dubbed \u201cMonica Zelenskiy\u201d. \u201cYou are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1,000%,\u201d he says when Trump claims Angela Merkel \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d for Ukraine (in fact, the EU is its largest financial donor). But the scandal resonated more loudly in the US; with Russia-backed troops still in the east of the country, most Ukrainians are sympathetic to maintaining US support at almost any cost. Zelenskiy appeared rattled when Trump released the memo just hours before the two held an awkward press conference at the UN last September. Today, he looks more comfortable discussing the exchange, though he says he is tired of the impeachment saga dominating every conversation about Ukraine. \u201cI think Ukraine has passed through this story proudly, with its head raised high,\u201d he says. But he has still not received the promised White House invitation, and it\u2019s clear this is an irritation. \u201cI was told it\u2019s being prepared. It\u2019s hard for me to hear that. I am a person who works to deadlines. Our diplomats are discussing it with American diplomats. I would like us to have a fruitful meeting.\u201d But the humiliations have kept coming. In late January, two days before secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due to travel to Kyiv in a show of US support, he somewhat undermined the message by snapping at a reporter: \u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d and asking her to point to it on a map, as if it were an obscure principality rather than the biggest country in Europe. When they met, Zelenskiy says, Pompeo insisted he had been misquoted. He says he is \u201cgrateful to the US, because actually both political parties support us\u201d. But what about the president? Zelenskiy pauses and laughs. He draws another breath before giving a long, convoluted and largely meaningless answer about the overwhelming US support he feels, from the president down. There\u2019s not much else he can say. Trump is known to be vindictive, and could win another four years in November. On the other hand, if Zelenskiy comes out in full-blooded support, he will look a fool if a Democrat wins the White House. The best option, it seems, is to say nothing. \u201cWith some issues, I don\u2019t really understand how to help journalists. When it comes to matters of state, I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things I can\u2019t now. But these are state secrets.\u201d After 10 months in office, Zelenskiy is desperate to move the conversation on from the impeachment saga. He has agreed to a rare interview in the hope that he can \u201cchange the context\u201d \u2013 to his focus on making a deal with Putin to end the war, and on further integration with Europe. He speaks passionately and with much gesturing, deploying the easy charm that helped him win the presidency. His future success will depend on whether he can use it to good effect on the European leaders who are his best hope of escaping his unenviable position, stuck between Trump and Putin. In the aftermath of his election victory, Zelenskiy promised voters he would \u201cstay a human being\u201d and not become a typical politician. He claims to have succeeded so far, but our surroundings tell a different story. His cavernous office is done out with gilded stucco ceilings, chandeliers and ruched curtains that cascade down long windows. So far, so very presidential. But the handshakes are hardly over before Zelenskiy tells us how ill at ease he is. \u201cI can\u2019t even sit there, it\u2019s awful,\u201d he says, pointing to the wooden desk laden with malachite ornaments and a bank of secure telephones. \u201cPrevious inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings, I guess,\u201d he says; they make him feel \u201chorribly uncomfortable\u201d. The most recent renovations were done by president Viktor Yanukovych, whose obscene corruption and cosying up to Russia prompted the 2014 Maidan revolution. We meet six years to the day since Yanukovych fled the building during bloody clashes between riot police and protesters in central Kyiv, setting in train the Russian annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine. Initially, Zelenskiy promised he would move the presidential office, but he has now decided the cost to the taxpayer would be prohibitive: \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do a renovation, because it\u2019s a historic building, so it would be illegal.\u201d But it is noticeable he has not made even small changes, such as replacing the furniture or removing the kitsch bronze figurines. Maybe he needs something to complain about. Or maybe the trappings of power are proving seductive. \u201cIt\u2019s true, you do start getting used to it.\u201d He laughs. * * * Volodymyr Zelenskiy was born in 1978, into a Jewish Ukrainian family in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south-east of Soviet Ukraine, dotted with mines and blast furnaces. It was a tough place to grow up, notorious for gangs of youths fighting to control different neighbourhoods in the years after the Soviet collapse. Zelenskiy\u2019s way out came through comedy. A natural performer, he organised a tight-knit group of friends from high school and law school into a comedy troupe named Kvartal 95, after the neighbourhood in which they grew up. By the mid-2000s, the troupe had moved to Kyiv and were appearing regularly on Ukrainian television. Recently, Zelenskiy has brought in some of them as key advisers. \u201cI have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time\u2026 They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\u201d he says, insisting the appointments are about personal trust, not financial cronyism. Zelenskiy\u2019s humour tended toward the slapstick: his audiences preferred Benny Hill to Monty Python, he has said. In one skit, he and a fellow actor appear to play Chopsticks on the piano using only their penises. But there were also more pointed, political sketches, mocking Ukraine\u2019s corrupt officials and oligarchs. He came to know some of his targets personally, as he took on more work as a television and film producer, bringing him wealth and connections among the elites. Sometimes this got him into trouble, if a sketch cut too deeply. Occasionally, the group poked fun at the authoritarianism of Ukraine\u2019s big neighbour. In a skit to coincide with a Russian presidential election, Zelenskiy and his friends played the returning officers at a local polling station, suicidal because they have accidentally failed to secure a Putin victory in their district. Servant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015. Zelenskiy stars as high-school teacher Vasyl Holoborodko, whose classroom tirade against corruption is filmed by a pupil and posted online, propelling him to the presidency after the post goes viral. Think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards, transposed on to the grimly cynical world of post-Soviet politics. The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year television show, he announced that he would. He ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. \u201cBut where did you stop?\u201d he is asked. \u201cSomewhere around Terminator 2,\u201d comes the response. Zelenskiy was up against the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy\u2019s insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely avoided debate, running a populist campaign \u2013 the people against the old elites \u2013 but without the usual populist tactic of sowing anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification, fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics. When he did agree to a debate, he made it conditional on Poroshenko accepting a set of absurd terms: it would take place on the pitch at Kyiv\u2019s 70,000-seater Olympic stadium, and Poroshenko would have to take a drug and alcohol test beforehand, to prove he wasn\u2019t high. It wasn\u2019t intended as a serious offer, but with nothing to lose, Poroshenko said yes, gamely showing up for blood and urine tests the day before. The debate was loud, confusing and largely senseless \u2013 which was how Zelenskiy wanted it. In the stadium, both candidates came across badly, bellowing into microphones; but on television, where it really mattered, Zelenskiy was the clear winner. The election was an easy win, too. He came first in almost every region \u2013 something new for a country that has long been divided on regional and linguistic lines. In the minutes after his crushing victory was announced, Zelenskiy strode on to the stage at his campaign headquarters accompanied by the lilting theme tune of Servant Of The People. Nobody quite knew what a Zelenskiy presidency would look like, including the people who had voted for him. But after a two-decade cycle of revolution and disappointment, he had won, not despite his lack of experience but because of it. He called parliamentary elections soon after, announcing that his newly formed party (named the Servant Of The People Party, naturally) would nominate a varied field of candidates, most without political experience. It won more than half the parliamentary seats, giving Zelenskiy huge power. Now that he\u2019s in charge, does he regret mocking politicians so mercilessly on his TV show? Zelenskiy smiles. \u201cI understood that, without experienced people it\u2019s impossible to run a country. But these people are at middle level. They are the bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring the papers to.\u201d To manage these bureaucrats, Zelenskiy has enlisted some old friends. Andriy Yermak, the man he entrusted with US negotiations last summer and recently made his chief of staff, is a former copyright lawyer. Serhiy Shefir, another presidential aide, is a co-founder of Zelenskiy\u2019s production studio. A childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, has been made head of the secret services. While Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle do not seem to be seeking personal enrichment, there are legitimate concerns about whether his friends are the best qualified people to run the country. Alongside these old friends, Zelenskiy put together a cabinet composed largely of well-regarded reformers, and the general feeling in the international community was that his team was doing surprisingly well, against the odds. However, earlier this week, a few days after our interview, he fired most of the government, including the 35-year-old prime minister (and also the still-quarantined health minister). The chief prosecutor, seen as a reformer, was also dismissed by parliament. The move, which Zelenskiy gave no hint was coming during the interview, has been interpreted as a blow for genuine reform efforts. Zelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. \u201cThe president can\u2019t change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an example.\u201d While Zelenskiy appears to be enjoying himself, he admits the political spotlight has been unwelcome for his family. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like my work.\u201d Going out for a meal has to be cleared with security; taking a nice holiday looks insensitive when his country is at war. His wife, Olena, is a former writer for Kvartal 95 who, like Zelenskiy, grew up in Kryvyi Rih. He says that while he is used to being in the public eye, she prefers to stay out of the limelight. His 16-year-old daughter is the most irritated by his new job, bristling against the security detail that now follows her everywhere. They try to hide, but she always spots them, her father says. \u201cShe\u2019s at that age when a person is usually most free,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant for her on a human level.\u201d On the other hand, his seven-year-old son is loving it, proudly announcing to anyone who will listen that his father is the president. \u201cI came home the other day and I said, \u2018Why is nobody saying hello to me?\u2019 And I can hear my own voice on the television. It was my speech. And my son says, \u2018Don\u2019t disturb us, we\u2019re watching the president!\u2019\u201d * * * Before Trump hijacked the script, the main villain to Zelenskiy\u2019s hero was meant to be Putin, who annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent money, men and weapons to fuel a war that has killed 14,000 people so far, many of them civilians. Large-scale fighting was halted in 2015, but regular shelling and fatalities on the frontline have been a way of life ever since. Peace could be achieved, Zelenskiy told voters, only if Kyiv began direct negotiations with the Kremlin. This was a radical departure from Poroshenko\u2019s approach and proved popular with a nation suffering from war fatigue \u2013 though a loud minority accused Zelenskiy of capitulating to Russia by even proposing talks. But he says he values saving lives over counting territorial gains. \u201cWho is this all being done for? For people. What\u2019s the point of returning our territory if a million people die?\u201d Putin and Zelenskiy met face to face for the first time in December, at a summit in Paris, alongside Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. They mainly stuck to the technical details of a long-ignored peace treaty, but \u201cthere were a few emotional parts\u201d, Zelenskiy recalls: when Putin complained about radical Ukrainian nationalists, he fired back that Russia has radicals, too. Was he able to get through to Putin? \u201cI think he listened to me. I had that feeling. I hope it\u2019s not a false feeling.\u201d The talks produced modest results: prisoner exchanges, an agreement to disengage military forces, and a ceasefire that has not held, with one soldier killed and several injured in a deadly flare-up in recent weeks. It seems unlikely that Putin will agree to any peace deal remotely acceptable to Ukrainian public opinion, but Zelenskiy says he wants to move fast. \u201cTime is ticking,\u201d he says, pointing at his watch and announcing a timeframe of a year in which to solve the conflict, so he can focus on other domestic issues. \u201cThe government can spend one year on the entire agreement. Then it should be implemented. Any longer is prohibited. If it lasts longer, we need to change the format and choose another strategy,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a dramatic new deadline, but his urgency is undercut by a lack of detail. (At times like this, Zelenskiy sounds rather Trumpian.) He declines to say what the fallback strategy might be, and when his press secretary jumps in to clarify that the one-year deadline dates from the December summit, rather than the start of his presidency in May, he replies with a laugh: \u201cI don\u2019t know any more.\u201d Thinking on the fly, as he often appears to, he buys himself the extra months: yes, it starts from the summit. Zelenskiy\u2019s aides present this kind of improvisation as part of his charm. In meetings with foreign dignitaries, they say, he will read the room and, if he feels he can succeed with a more emotional pitch, discard official briefing notes. And perhaps this might work with Merkel, for one, who reportedly watched clips from Servant Of The People before meeting Zelenskiy. Convincing Merkel and others of Ukraine\u2019s desire for closer integration into Europe is vital, he says. \u201cWe need to give people confidence that the European Union is waiting for Ukraine,\u201d he says. If it takes 20 years, his electorate will lose hope. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really believe in words. Or rather, people believe in words only for a stretch of time. Then they start to look for action.\u201d Merkel gets it, he thinks; he also claims to have developed a warm personal relationship with Macron, though he is wary of the French president\u2019s recent references to the need for warmer relations with Moscow. Watching Brexit unfold from Kyiv has been a strange experience, he says \u2013 seeing a country rush to exit the EU when Ukraine is so keen to join. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a group of people around a table spending a nice evening together. If someone doesn\u2019t want to sit at the table, he\u2019ll definitely ruin the party,\u201d he says, warming to his metaphor. \u201cAnd then there are people standing outside the door, ringing the doorbell, knocking, and they\u2019re told through the peephole: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re welcome to join but come back next time!\u2019 And they\u2019re still outside knocking when the party is over.\u201d He revels in these colourful comparisons, which sometimes take him in the wrong direction. He likens his presidency to being on a boat: \u201cThere are holes everywhere, and with your arms and legs, you are trying to close them up. This is how we\u2019re living. We are closing the holes.\u201d When told it sounds like a sinking ship, Zelenskiy looks alarmed, and adds: \u201cBut we\u2019re not sinking!\u201d * * * When he came to power, western diplomats worried Zelenskiy might be a proxy for Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial billionaire whose television channel aired his show. Kolomoisky is one of a group of oligarchs who made vast fortunes in the transition from communism, while most Ukrainians remained poor. In recent years, they have rebranded themselves as generous philanthropists, while retaining an outsized influence on the political scene, and are far more deserving of the \u201coligarch\u201d title than their counterparts in Russia, long since neutered by Putin. \u201cI want them to have walk-on parts, not leading roles,\u201d Zelenskiy says. Kolomoisky receives no special treatment, he insists, despite their long acquaintance. He dismisses as \u201cinappropriate\u201d the recent purchase of a 14-bedroom mansion on the French Riviera for \u20ac200m (\u00a3170m) by Rinat Akhmetov, a businessman whose apartment at One Hyde Park was the most expensive property ever purchased in the UK when he bought it in 2011, at \u00a3136m. Many in Kyiv see Zelenskiy\u2019s government reshuffle this week as a sign that the old oligarchic players are reasserting their influence, despite his public claims that it was about speeding up reform. It\u2019s certainly true that Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs continue to wield tremendous power, and Zelenskiy won\u2019t be rid of their machinations simply by asking nicely. His TV president might have ordered them hanged or shot for such lavish expenditure abroad during a time of war, but the real Zelenskiy will have to work with them, asking them to invest at home and fund state projects when asked. \u201cIf we\u2019ve chosen democracy, of course we can\u2019t hang people,\u201d he says, but a twinkle appears in his eyes. \u201cAlthough! Sometimes you really want to. And do you know why? Because it would be quicker. Much quicker,\u201d he says, delivering the line with a comic\u2019s timing. \u201cWe are joking,\u201d says his press secretary, looking somewhat concerned, from the other side of the table. \u201cOf course we\u2019re joking,\u201d Zelenskiy says. * * * In their ill-fated phone call, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for providing him with a model of electoral success. \u201cWe used quite a few of your skills\u2026 we wanted to drain the swamp here in my country,\u201d he says. Is that true, or was he simply following advice that the US president responds well to flattery? He sighs and answers carefully. What Trump showed him, he says, was how an outsider can win without having to adapt to the supposed rules of the game. \u201cI do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, he really was an example \u2013 of how you can win without using the standard format.\u201d Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just starting and his own campaign model could succeed elsewhere. \u201cI am certain it could, especially where people are tired, where they are running like squirrels on a wheel, and there are these long-standing politicians with big financial resources. In these places, where people are searching for a breath of fresh air, it should work.\u201d It sounds like a clear allusion to Ukraine\u2019s neighbour to the east, and its indefatigable leader. Indeed, on the night of his election, Zelenskiy said he wanted his victory to be an example to the entire post-Soviet region, dominated by autocrats. His success has not gone unnoticed inside Russia, and many have made favourable comparisons with the man in the Kremlin: Zelenskiy walking to his inauguration, high-fiving members of the crowd, versus a lonely Putin in his limousine, gliding through the emptied streets of Moscow to his own ceremony. Zelenskiy\u2019s chummy, upbeat new year message to the nation, versus Putin\u2019s staid television address. A Russian channel recently started to broadcast Servant Of The People, but quickly reversed the decision, presumably fearing its message was too subversive. Zelenskiy did not, in the end, bring down Trump, and he may well not succeed in his plans to remodel Ukraine. Could Zelenskiy\u2019s legacy turn out to be piercing Putin\u2019s aura of infallibility? \u201cOf course a new president will appear there. Of course it will happen. What kind of president it will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can see that all totalitarian regimes end the same way.\u201d But Putin would never simply give up power to a Zelenskiy figure in Russia. Is he predicting a bloody revolution? \u201cI don\u2019t want people to die anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we should understand that if you keep tightening the spring, at some point it will snap.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<h2><strong>I feel fine but I\u2019ve been told to self-isolate \u2013 will I still be paid?</strong></h2> <p>There is no requirement on the employer to pay, says Sarah Evans, an employment expert and partner at JMW Solicitors, but in reality most decent employers are paying staff \u2013 particularly in the light of comments by the prime minister on Wednesday, who said workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-epidemic-in-uk-is-likely-says-chief-medical-officer\" title=\"\">should be paid sick leave</a> from the day they are off.</p> <p>Evans says in most cases people will come to an arrangement with their employer to work from home, and as such, will be paid as normal. \u201cIncreasingly, lots of employees can and will work at home.</p> <p>However, the problem comes if you work in a shop or a warehouse that requires your presence.</p> <p>The legal position is that your employer can send you home and is under no obligation to pay you. For a small company, having an unproductive member of staff sitting at home doing nothing on full pay will be a huge burden.\u201d</p> <p>This week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said guidance has been sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate should be entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP). He said medical advice on self-isolation should be considered \u201csickness for employment purposes\u201d. <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>How much will I get under statutory sick pay?</strong></h2> <p>All employed staff who earn at least \u00a3118 a week qualify for statutory sick pay, or whatever your employment contract may provide over and above that. Most employers will allow a certain number of days a year on full pay. After that, employees are entitled to statutory sick pay of \u00a394.25 per week, which will be paid for up to 28 weeks. Until now it has been paid from the fourth day of sickness. A doctor\u2019s note may not be necessary, with employees able to self-certify with symptoms of flu without seeing a doctor, says Evans. Emergency legislation is being rushed through to allow sick pay to start from the first day off instead of the fourth, so claimants should receive it for the entire period they are off work.</p> <p>Trade unions have warned that up to 2 million workers do not earn enough to qualify for SSP, and could lose out if the virus becomes mainstream in the workplace. The government has said up to 20% of the workforce could be off sick during the peak of an epidemic. <strong>MB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e99ab4d4ae09f04f2cff54535c05d42d2815d60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e99ab4d4ae09f04f2cff54535c05d42d2815d60/0_130_6484_3891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"toddlers girls playing at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If the children are sent home from school or nursery, what are my rights?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oksana Kuzmina/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>My children have been sent home from school to self-isolate.

      "bodyText": "I feel fine but I\u2019ve been told to self-isolate \u2013 will I still be paid? There is no requirement on the employer to pay, says Sarah Evans, an employment expert and partner at JMW Solicitors, but in reality most decent employers are paying staff \u2013 particularly in the light of comments by the prime minister on Wednesday, who said workers should be paid sick leave from the day they are off. Evans says in most cases people will come to an arrangement with their employer to work from home, and as such, will be paid as normal. \u201cIncreasingly, lots of employees can and will work at home. However, the problem comes if you work in a shop or a warehouse that requires your presence. The legal position is that your employer can send you home and is under no obligation to pay you. For a small company, having an unproductive member of staff sitting at home doing nothing on full pay will be a huge burden.\u201d This week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said guidance has been sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate should be entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP). He said medical advice on self-isolation should be considered \u201csickness for employment purposes\u201d. MB How much will I get under statutory sick pay? All employed staff who earn at least \u00a3118 a week qualify for statutory sick pay, or whatever your employment contract may provide over and above that. Most employers will allow a certain number of days a year on full pay. After that, employees are entitled to statutory sick pay of \u00a394.25 per week, which will be paid for up to 28 weeks. Until now it has been paid from the fourth day of sickness. A doctor\u2019s note may not be necessary, with employees able to self-certify with symptoms of flu without seeing a doctor, says Evans. Emergency legislation is being rushed through to allow sick pay to start from the first day off instead of the fourth, so claimants should receive it for the entire period they are off work. Trade unions have warned that up to 2 million workers do not earn enough to qualify for SSP, and could lose out if the virus becomes mainstream in the workplace. The government has said up to 20% of the workforce could be off sick during the peak of an epidemic. MB My children have been sent home from school to self-isolate. Can I ask for time off, and will I be paid? Evans says employees could ask for emergency time off in such a situation. The employer would have to grant this, she says, but would be under no obligation to pay the employee. In reality, most people would just work from home. Most employers would probably allow the person to take the time off as holiday, which in most cases is still paid, says Martha McKinley, an employment specialist at the law firm Stephensons, but they are under no obligation to do so. MB I\u2019m self-employed \u2013 what do I get? Nothing, and you are not entitled to SSP either, says McKinley. \u201cOne of the biggest downsides of being self-employed is that in most cases you will not be paid if you do not turn up for work. If the virus spirals out of control, those in the gig economy will be adversely affected and face significant loss of wages.\u201d The unions have called on the government to take action to help the 5 million people in this boat but it has so far resisted.

Amazon said earlier this week it had removed \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of items, adding: \u201cThere is no place for price gouging on Amazon.\u201d It said its staff constantly check listings. But a brief search on Amazon and eBay showed lots of examples of extraordinary asking prices. For example, on eBay a seller was this week offering two small 50ml Carex Aloe Vera hand sanitisers, adding that they \u201ckill bacteria virus\u201d. Usually they cost \u00a31 each in Boots.

However, many gyms allow you to freeze your membership temporarily \u2013 often for a small or not-so-small fee \u2013 so you can opt out of going for a while. PureGym allows its \u201cCore\u201d members to apply a freeze for up to three months at a cost of \u00a35.99 a month, while \u201cPlus\u201d members can freeze at no extra cost for up to three months.

Inter\u2019s president, Steven Zhang, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenzhang91_/status/1234709011397795847\">called Dal Pino a \u201cclown\u201d.</a></p> <p>Zhang was incredulous that considerations of competitive advantage and league prestige were being prioritised over public health. Dal Pino had spoken of his duty to represent Serie A\u2019s greater interests for a game that would be broadcast to more than 200 countries. Only after a fresh government intervention, extending the ban on mass gatherings to cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/italys-serie-a-considering-matches-behind-closed-doors-due-to-coronavirus\">the whole country until 3 April</a>, were all parties able to agree on the best way to proceed.</p> <p>Now there was no choice but to get on with it. The top-flight calendar was already at breaking point after four games were postponed on the weekend of 21-22 February as well.

Juventus were originally supposed to host Internazionale on 1 March, before Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak tipped the country\u2019s top division into a timetabling meltdown. On 27 February, the league\u2019s governing body officially confirmed that the game was going ahead as scheduled but behind closed doors \u2013 in line with a government ban on mass public gatherings in several northern regions of Italy. Two days later, the decision was reversed. Juventus v Inter was postponed, as were five other Serie A games: all at less than 36 hours\u2019 notice. Inter fans protested outside the league\u2019s offices, accusing organisers of caving to pressure from Juventus.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Should I sell all my shares?</strong></h2> <p>The conventional wisdom in the pensions and investment industry is that you should sit tight. Jason Hollands of advisers Tilney says: \u201cNow is the time for investors to exercise nerves of steel and to avoid the temptation to kneejerk sell long-term investments in reaction to short-term turmoil; in so doing they will just crystallise losses. The market is now pricing in a worst case scenario and with such negative sentiment hitting stock prices, those in a position to do so should consider feeding new cash into the market, picking up shares that have been indiscriminately marked down. As Warren Buffet once observed: \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful.\u201d</p> <p>Note that most pension funds are invested in a mix of shares, government and corporate bonds, and property. While share values are down, the government bonds have generally gone up, so a 10% fall in the FTSE equates to a fall of only 6% in your pension.</p> <p>But there are some doom merchants who are telling investors to shift much of their investments into cash for now. Brian Dennehy of Dennehy Weller says: \u201cWhat are the three most dangerous words in the investment industry? Buy and hold. For some time, we have expected a correction of 25-30% in stock markets \u2013 not pleasant, but not the end of the world.

Jason Hollands of advisers Tilney says: \u201cNow is the time for investors to exercise nerves of steel and to avoid the temptation to kneejerk sell long-term investments in reaction to short-term turmoil; in so doing they will just crystallise losses. The market is now pricing in a worst case scenario and with such negative sentiment hitting stock prices, those in a position to do so should consider feeding new cash into the market, picking up shares that have been indiscriminately marked down. As Warren Buffet once observed: \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful.\u201d Note that most pension funds are invested in a mix of shares, government and corporate bonds, and property. While share values are down, the government bonds have generally gone up, so a 10% fall in the FTSE equates to a fall of only 6% in your pension. But there are some doom merchants who are telling investors to shift much of their investments into cash for now. Brian Dennehy of Dennehy Weller says: \u201cWhat are the three most dangerous words in the investment industry? Buy and hold. For some time, we have expected a correction of 25-30% in stock markets \u2013 not pleasant, but not the end of the world. We have now upgraded that analysis to a risk of falls in the 55% to 80% range. \u201cUnfortunately, there is generational complacency about risk investments, which has been created by a 40-year bull market.\u201d It should be noted that Dennehy\u2019s view is certainly not mainstream. The message from Fidelity, one of the world\u2019s biggest investment managers, is \u201cstay calm, carry on\u201d, adding that \u201cmarket corrections can create attractive opportunities\u201d. Is there anything I can actually do with my company pension? Most big company pension schemes allow you to log in to your account online, and while your money is usually sensibly invested in a \u201cdefault\u201d fund made up of a mix of shares and bonds, you usually have the option to switch it elsewhere. So you can increase or decrease the amount in shares, or even move all your fund into cash. But remarkably few people bother to monitor what is their biggest financial investment. After the recent market falls, it may be unwise to shift your investments now, but resolve to ask your pensions or HR department how to access your pension investments in future. Are there some shares that have gone up in value? Rather gruesomely, shares in the only stock market quoted funeral directors, Dignity plc, have been rising while all around them others have crashed. Its shares were trading at 544p just before the market began falling, and ended the week of the \u201ccrash\u201d at 595p, up 9%. Shares in Ocado, the food delivery company, are also currently higher than they were at the start of the sell-off, while PZ Cussons, which makes the handwash brand Carex, has also been resilient.

      "body": "<p>Two of Britain\u2019s greatest athletes are sharing anecdotes about their triumphs and tribulations, laughing like old friends despite having only recently met, when Mary Peters tells a story that makes Katarina Johnson\u2011Thompson gasp.</p> <p>In the months before the 1972 Munich Olympics Peters was desperate to win a pentathlon gold medal to cap off her career. But there was no track near where she lived in Belfast. So at the height of the Troubles she would get two buses across the city to use a run\u2011down facility, carrying her starter\u2019s blocks and a heavy shot to practise her putting, while also holding down a job. Sometimes she would hear bombs go off while she trained.</p> <p>\u201cIt was always raining too,\u201d says a chuckling Peters, who turned 80 and had open heart surgery last year but has the restless energy of someone half her age. \u201cAnd the track was full of potholes. Luckily I got a Churchill scholarship, which allowed me to go to the States for six weeks and train. I didn\u2019t have that much talent \u2013 which sounds ridiculous \u2013 but I worked really hard at it and it all came together.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/16/jemma-reekie-shows-olympic-class-with-special-kick-to-win-glasgow-1500m\">Jemma Reekie's 'special kick' could take her to Olympic glory, predicts coach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Memories of that pentathlon gold in Munich, where she set a world record \u2013 snatching glory in the 200m \u2013 come flooding back. \u201cI never thought: \u2018What will happen to me if I stand on that rostrum?\u2019 but when it happened it was amazing. It\u2019s over 47 years ago now since I had my success but I am still celebrating \u2013 still partying!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want that,\u201d replies Johnson\u2011Thompson, who will compete in the heptathlon in Tokyo later this year. \u201cI want to go on a 47-year celebration.\u201d</p> <p>Peters nods, recognising the spirit of a fellow traveller. \u201cJessica Ennis-Hill set a really high standard and was the face of the 2012 Olympics,\u201d she says, looking Johnson\u2011Thompson in the eye. \u201cAnd you are our next champion.\u201d</p> <p>It feels appropriate that Johnson\u2011Thompson and Peters are getting to know each other only days before International Women\u2019s Day, given one of its focuses is on celebrating sporting trailblazers and visionaries. Peters was certainly that \u2013 and a whole lot more. In the 1960s, when lifting weights was seen as distinctly unladylike, Peters was able to quarter-squat with 825lb (375kg) on her back \u2013 roughly the combined weight of four giant pandas \u2013 and one-arm jerk press an incredible 160lb (73kg).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c2e015a4f8684941b76107f039440c063f4ab61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c2e015a4f8684941b76107f039440c063f4ab61/2_0_3022_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Peters, KJT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Peters storms home in the 200m in Munich, and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in action in the same event in Doha last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images and Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For good measure she could also do a vertical jump of 32 inches, which she says was then a world record, and also broke 25 British records during a career that spanned three Olympic Games.</p> <p>Not only was Peters a walking advert for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/11/this-girl-can-female-sporting-activity-taboo-busting\" title=\"\">This Girl Can</a> 50 years before the award-winning campaign was dreamed up but she did it all while holding down a full-time job \u2013 first as a teacher and then as a secretary.</p> <p>Of course there were challenges \u2013 plenty of them. While at training college, for instance, Peters had no track to train on, so she used to sprint down corridors after hours.

      "bodyText": "Two of Britain\u2019s greatest athletes are sharing anecdotes about their triumphs and tribulations, laughing like old friends despite having only recently met, when Mary Peters tells a story that makes Katarina Johnson\u2011Thompson gasp. In the months before the 1972 Munich Olympics Peters was desperate to win a pentathlon gold medal to cap off her career. But there was no track near where she lived in Belfast. So at the height of the Troubles she would get two buses across the city to use a run\u2011down facility, carrying her starter\u2019s blocks and a heavy shot to practise her putting, while also holding down a job. Sometimes she would hear bombs go off while she trained. \u201cIt was always raining too,\u201d says a chuckling Peters, who turned 80 and had open heart surgery last year but has the restless energy of someone half her age. \u201cAnd the track was full of potholes. Luckily I got a Churchill scholarship, which allowed me to go to the States for six weeks and train. I didn\u2019t have that much talent \u2013 which sounds ridiculous \u2013 but I worked really hard at it and it all came together.\u201d Memories of that pentathlon gold in Munich, where she set a world record \u2013 snatching glory in the 200m \u2013 come flooding back. \u201cI never thought: \u2018What will happen to me if I stand on that rostrum?\u2019 but when it happened it was amazing. It\u2019s over 47 years ago now since I had my success but I am still celebrating \u2013 still partying!\u201d \u201cI want that,\u201d replies Johnson\u2011Thompson, who will compete in the heptathlon in Tokyo later this year. \u201cI want to go on a 47-year celebration.\u201d Peters nods, recognising the spirit of a fellow traveller. \u201cJessica Ennis-Hill set a really high standard and was the face of the 2012 Olympics,\u201d she says, looking Johnson\u2011Thompson in the eye. \u201cAnd you are our next champion.\u201d It feels appropriate that Johnson\u2011Thompson and Peters are getting to know each other only days before International Women\u2019s Day, given one of its focuses is on celebrating sporting trailblazers and visionaries. Peters was certainly that \u2013 and a whole lot more. In the 1960s, when lifting weights was seen as distinctly unladylike, Peters was able to quarter-squat with 825lb (375kg) on her back \u2013 roughly the combined weight of four giant pandas \u2013 and one-arm jerk press an incredible 160lb (73kg). For good measure she could also do a vertical jump of 32 inches, which she says was then a world record, and also broke 25 British records during a career that spanned three Olympic Games. Not only was Peters a walking advert for This Girl Can 50 years before the award-winning campaign was dreamed up but she did it all while holding down a full-time job \u2013 first as a teacher and then as a secretary. Of course there were challenges \u2013 plenty of them. While at training college, for instance, Peters had no track to train on, so she used to sprint down corridors after hours. On one occasion the doors ahead of her were suddenly closed and she smashed into them, shattering all the glass. \u201cI worked as a school teacher but I gave it up because they didn\u2019t like giving me time off to do my sport,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I went to work as my coach\u2019s secretary. I\u2019d work 40 hours a week and train at the end of the day. It wasn\u2019t easy. I would go to the gym at 6am or stay after work at 9pm at night and do some weights.\u201d At this point Johnson-Thompson, who is listening with a mixture of awe and utter horror, chips in. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could cope under those conditions, I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d she says. \u201cI just find it crazy that you describe yourself as just a hard worker and not talented when you\u2019re doing those events and jumping those heights in the conditions you had and training facilities you had. You\u2019re obviously putting yourself down.\u201d \u201cI had to work really hard at everything I did,\u201d Peters says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t find it a chore.\u201d Back then it was not just people\u2019s attitudes to women in sport that was less sophisticated. The diet was, too. \u201cI ate everything and more,\u201d Peters admits. \u201cI never had any pasta, never drank water, never carried a bottle of water.

Did Peters go that far? \u201cNearly,\u201d she replies, laughing. As the conversation continues, the pair find out they also share a deeper bond than an aptitude for multi-events \u2013 both hail from Halewood in Liverpool. Peters grew up there before moving to Northern Ireland when she was 11, while Johnson\u2011Thompson\u2019s mum and nan still live there. \u201cI remember those days vividly,\u201d says Peters. \u201cI used to get a penny for the bus fare home but I\u2019d run and try to beat it so I could save the penny.\u201d Neither woman can explain why Liverpool has produced two world-class multi-eventers but Johnson\u2011Thompson believes it is clear that success breeds success. \u201cI think it\u2019s because you see someone do it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that falls down to Denise Lewis and then Jess Ennis\u2011Hill.

      "bodyText": "NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak, following complaints from ill-equipped doctors. In a letter sent to all 7,000 English GP surgeries on Thursday, NHS England made clear it will give every surgery a full supply of PPE gear, which will help keep staff who come into contact with suspected coronavirus cases safe and help to minimise the spread of the virus. The move follows complaints by GPs and the British Medical Association that practices are ill-equipped to deal with the outbreak. More than 20 GP practices have been forced to close temporarily over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. GPs were advised last month to wear surgical masks and other protective equipment if they came into contact with patients who might have Covid-19, but one doctor pointed out on Twitter that her practice only had two surgical masks left. In a tweet that went viral, South Cumbria GP Dr Alison Johnston asked the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, what he was doing to protect healthcare staff, adding that they had also received no training in the use of PPE. NHS England has now confirmed that all practices will be issued with an initial stock of PPE including 400 general-use aprons, 300 pairs of examination gloves and 300 fluid-repellent face masks. The kits will be sent out next week. Larger surgeries will receive repeat deliveries to ensure they have sufficient amounts, the letter said. The confirmation followed a call from the BMA for practices to be issued with the specialist equipment. Dr Helena McKeown, the chair of the BMA representative body, welcomed the news and said GPs were \u201cthe first-line defence in the NHS\u201d. She said: \u201cWe have been working closely with NHS England to ensure surgeries have the appropriate equipment, and we\u2019re pleased to see that extra supplies are now going to be delivered to practices across the country.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to have discussions with NHS England about the protection of other doctors and medical students, such as those in hospitals and intensive care units where some Covid-19 patients might need further treatment.\u201d The letter from Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England\u2019s medical director for primary care, said: \u201cI recognise that Covid-19 is placing a new and increasing challenge on already busy practices, and this will be an area of concern for you, your teams and your patients.\u201d She added that NHS England is continually refining plans for the outbreak and is listening to feedback received on emerging coronavirus issues. Dr Steve Mowle, the honorary treasurer of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cThe advice from NHS England for GPs is welcome, particularly the confirmation that GP practices in England will start to receive appropriate and necessary protective equipment early next week. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that anybody working in general practice is doing so safely and is as protected from Covid-19 as possible as we work through this challenging time for the NHS and society in general.\u201d Mowle added that it appears as though the majority of patients are heeding official advice not to go to GP practices if they think they might have Covid-19. However, he said: \u201cAs the situation escalates, we\u2019re going to need to have serious conversations about which tasks to prioritise over others and whether there are any we can stop doing temporarily to create capacity to deal with Covid-19.\u201d On Friday, GP surgeries were told by NHS England to start conducting as many remote consultations as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact. Only 1% of the 340m appointments a year with GPs and other practice staff are currently carried out by video call. The change could last for several months, as experts believe the virus may not peak until April or May, and could last until June or July.",

We started really well, and threatened on the counter attack. We defended really well, the two goals came from us having possession and that transition Liverpool are so good at. They punished us twice today, but I can\u2019t fault the lads. We\u2019ve made a mistake, but they still had to punish us. That\u2019s the quality they possess. They were ruthless. I don\u2019t think we did a lot wrong in the match. I felt we could score at any time in the game. Losing Steve Cook was a big moment. I don\u2019t want to be positive after games we don\u2019t win, but the last six games for us have been a big improvement. We\u2019ve won two, but our performances have been better, and that encourages us for the last nine games.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e63b1f18f085f0b8d943f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-07T14:45:10.040Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jurgen Klopp speaks! </strong>\u201cIt was a very good performance after a very difficult start. From my point of view, the first goal was a 100 percent foul. Nothing else. But it shows the problem with VAR as well, because the referee didn\u2019t see it. Mike Dean was next to me, saying have a look, have a look, and VAR said it was not clear and obvious, I don\u2019t know how that is possible. We wanted to fight back before the game, but then we really had to fight back, and put them under pressure. We did a lot of good stuff, played a lot of good football. We had to concentrate 100 percent, and we deserved the three points in the end. [The home record] is nice, it is special, but not normal, and the game today is a good example. We had to fight hard, we are not geniuses, but we can really fight!\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e63b0668f085f0b8d943f93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-07T14:35:54.899Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Liverpool have broken their own long-standing record today. </strong>By winning their 22nd league match at Anfield in a row, they beat the mark set by the legendary Bill Shankly\u2019s team in 1972.

It\u2019s a boring thing to say, but it\u2019s true. Especially when you\u2019ve had a couple of performances when we weren\u2019t at our level. Again today, we weren\u2019t at our best, but many teams would have crumbled after a couple of poor results. But we kept going and stayed calm, and with the boys up front, we always have a chance. You can\u2019t question the boys\u2019 heart and desire.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mohamed Salah adds: </strong>\u201cToday we showed our personality, we had to react, we did well.

Mind you, this time last week, it felt like the Reds were leading a procession, four wins from their first English championship since 1990. But one no-show against Watford later, plus a KO in the cup, and the mood-o-meter has switched from Party to Pensive. If they fail to beat Bournemouth this lunchtime, it won\u2019t exactly be crisis time ... not yet ... but a few nerve-ends will start to jangle, twitch and yip, you can be darn sure of that.</p> <p><strong>As Liverpool have just found out, a lot can change in a couple of matches. </strong>But then spin it another way: if they see off relegation-haunted Bournemouth today, as they surely should, then pull off a recovery in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, the entire picture will suddenly look a hell of a lot brighter. It doesn\u2019t take much for the dial to shift either way. And what better opponent to shake off the post-break blues against than Bournemouth? Liverpool have won their last five games against Eddie Howe\u2019s side to the aggregate tune of <em>17-0</em>. They quite literally couldn\u2019t Cherry-pick a better fixture in which to bounce back.</p> <p><strong>And yet Bournemouth won\u2019t be without hope. </strong>They haven\u2019t won in three, but came mighty close to beating Chelsea last weekend. They\u2019ve also claimed a couple of big scalps this season: Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester United at home. And they earned a 2-2 draw at Anfield back in April 2017, the same season they turned Klopp\u2019s side over at Dean Court, coming from behind for a famous smash-and-grab 4-3 victory. It\u2019s not totally been a one-sided relationship. Plus the fact Anfield may get a little nervous if things don\u2019t go to plan for the home heroes in the early exchanges.</p> <p><strong>This could be the match that steadies the champions-elect after a brief, uncharacteristic wobble.</strong> Or it could go some way to saving Bournemouth\u2019s Premier League skin, while planting more seeds of doubt in Liverpool\u2019s collective mind, with big away games at Everton and Manchester City coming up. Plenty riding on this, then, and it\u2019s going to be fun finding out how it all comes down. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-06T16:48:40.600Z\">at 4.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter was at Anfield to witness Liverpool fight their way back into form. Here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM! Eddie Howe\u2019s verdict. \u201cWe gave it a go. We started really well, and threatened on the counter attack. We defended really well, the two goals came from us having possession and that transition Liverpool are so good at. They punished us twice today, but I can\u2019t fault the lads. We\u2019ve made a mistake, but they still had to punish us. That\u2019s the quality they possess. They were ruthless. I don\u2019t think we did a lot wrong in the match. I felt we could score at any time in the game. Losing Steve Cook was a big moment. I don\u2019t want to be positive after games we don\u2019t win, but the last six games for us have been a big improvement. We\u2019ve won two, but our performances have been better, and that encourages us for the last nine games.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cIt was a very good performance after a very difficult start. From my point of view, the first goal was a 100 percent foul. Nothing else. But it shows the problem with VAR as well, because the referee didn\u2019t see it. Mike Dean was next to me, saying have a look, have a look, and VAR said it was not clear and obvious, I don\u2019t know how that is possible. We wanted to fight back before the game, but then we really had to fight back, and put them under pressure. We did a lot of good stuff, played a lot of good football. We had to concentrate 100 percent, and we deserved the three points in the end. [The home record] is nice, it is special, but not normal, and the game today is a good example. We had to fight hard, we are not geniuses, but we can really fight!\u201d Liverpool have broken their own long-standing record today. By winning their 22nd league match at Anfield in a row, they beat the mark set by the legendary Bill Shankly\u2019s team in 1972. Third on the list: Manchester City (2011-12) and Newcastle United (1906-07). \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place to play football,\u201d adds Milner. \u201cThere have been unbelievable teams here over the years, so to be up there with those is special. But we want to keep producing performances, hopefully winning trophies and create history for this club.\u201d James Milner, who made sure of Liverpool\u2019s victory with an outstanding goal-line clearance, speaks to BT Sport. \u201cAny Premier League game is hard to win. It\u2019s a boring thing to say, but it\u2019s true. Especially when you\u2019ve had a couple of performances when we weren\u2019t at our level. Again today, we weren\u2019t at our best, but many teams would have crumbled after a couple of poor results. But we kept going and stayed calm, and with the boys up front, we always have a chance. You can\u2019t question the boys\u2019 heart and desire.\u201d Mohamed Salah adds: \u201cToday we showed our personality, we had to react, we did well. We need to keep going for the next three games, and the rest of the season.\u201d Liverpool are now 25 points clear at the top, though second-placed Manchester City have two games in hand. They just need nine points from their last nine games for their first title in 30 years. Jurgen Klopp punches the air in front of the Kop, a study more of relief than celebration. Liverpool were far from their best today ... though they still scored twice, hit the post, and will feel aggrieved at the nature of Bournemouth\u2019s opener. Not a bad way to under-perform. One down, three to go. Bournemouth remain in the relegation zone. 90 min +4: Mane and Milner take an age over a free kick out on the left. Clock management in full effect. The Kop finally feels brave enough to break into song: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league.\u201d 90 min +3: Origi tears off down the left. He\u2019s got Salah in the middle, but can\u2019t force the ball past Stacey, who was tracking back well. Liverpool look like getting over the line, but they\u2019ve made a meal of this. 90 min +2: Wilson is booked for a late clatter on Milner. Then a second change for Liverpool, as Origi replaces Firmino, who is still yet to score at Anfield this season. He\u2019ll not get a better chance than the one he spurned a minute ago. 90 min +1: And up the other end, Bournemouth breathe again! Lallana and Salah combine down the right, teeing up Firmino in the centre. He has to make Ramsdale work at the very least, but leans back and hoicks deep into the Kop. What a finish to this game! 90 min: Milner upends Stacey out on the right, and this is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Milner heads clear, but Cook dinks a pass down the inside left, and Ake is clear! He rolls infield for Wilson, who should poke home, but stands on the ball. Then the flag goes up for offside. What an escape for Liverpool! 89 min: Lewis Cook sprays a pass down the right. Solanke hopes to latch onto it, but Adrian is out quickly to blast into the stand. 88 min: Billing\u2019s back! But he doesn\u2019t look comfortable at all as he trots around the middle of the park in a very ginger fashion. 87 min: Van Dijk lashes a long pass down the left. Mane nearly gets past Stacey, but legs tangle and he goes over. No free kick, and no penalty either, Mane making sure he falls inside the box. Ramsdale gathers, and we play on. 86 min: Billing loiters on the touchline in the hope his injury repairs itself in short order. 85 min: Billing gets up and limps off. It doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s able to continue, so Bournemouth will play the rest of the game with ten men. 84 min: Solanke whacks his own man Billing, pressing his knee into the defender\u2019s lower back. Billing looks in some pain. He writhes around, punching the turf in agony. As he receives treatment, Oxlade-Chamberlain makes way for Lallana. 82 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a whack from 25 yards. It\u2019s always heading well wide left. 80 min: Lerma is replaced by walking Tic-Tac advertisement Dan Gosling. The former Everton midfielder gets the sort of reception you\u2019d imagine. 78 min: Correction: Ake forces out for another wasted corner. 77 min: Suddenly Gomez slips a pass down the right. Salah cuts into the area and tries to thread another into the bottom right. Ramsdale tips round the post for a corner. Liverpool make a mess of the set piece, but Salah strips a dallying Fraser on the right and feeds Milner, who fires across the face of goal. With Mane and Firmino lurking, Ake forces out for another corner. 76 min: Liverpool stroke it around the middle, but don\u2019t go anywhere in particular. 74 min: Mane latches onto a loose ball, 25 yards out on the left. He hits it first time, curling the ball towards the top right. It\u2019s beaten Ramsdale all ends up ... but the ball crashes off the post and away. That would have been an absolute pearler. What an effort! 72 min: Firmino has been quiet, but suddenly he sparks into life, dinking the ball down the inside right for Salah. The ball breaks back to him, and he flashes a fierce cross-cum-shot through the six-yard box. Mane, at the far post, can\u2019t react in time to prod home. To be fair, the ball was travelling some, and it would have been a hell of a finish if he\u2019d managed to connect. 70 min: Bournemouth are causing Liverpool some problems, though. Fraser tries to get on the end of a left-wing cross, but can\u2019t keep the ball in play. A taller player might have asked a question there. The crowd groan in anxious fashion. 69 min: Salah tries to bring down a high ball with his shoulder, and uses his arm instead. A free kick out on the right. It\u2019s floated in. There are five Bournemouth players offside, but the flag doesn\u2019t go up. Ake and Solanke bustle around and force a corner. Liverpool are furious ... but finally the flag goes up. What a nonsense. 68 min: Stanislas is replaced by former Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke, who receives a warm round of applause as he reacquaints himself with his old stomping ground. 66 min: This one\u2019s better. Alexander-Arnold takes from the right. He fires long, and at the far post Van Dijk rises to bomb a header towards the bottom left. Ramsdale claims it well, though. 65 min: There used to be a Liverpool fanzine called Another Wasted Corner. Well, that. 63 min: A free kick for Liverpool out on the left. Milner floats it in. Van Dijk goes up, but Ramsdale is able to punch clear. \u201cI\u2019m sure I speak for my fellow LFC supporters when I say I\u2019m not enjoying our early 2010s tribute act this afternoon. Squeaky bum time indeed,\u201d writes Sir Alex Ferguson tribute act Tony Barr. 62 min: Liverpool are not playing well. Stanislas crosses from the left. Ake is preparing to crash a header goalwards, but Adrian does just enough to punch clear. Diego Simeone will be watching this game with his feet up and a cigar on. 61 min: A long pass down the middle. Fraser beats the Liverpool back line, and reaches the ball ahead of the out-rushing Adrian. He loops over the keeper. The ball\u2019s heading into the net ... but Milner brilliantly races back and acrobatically hooks off the line and away! What a clearance! Bournemouth so close to hauling themselves level. 59 min: Salah sashays in from the right and dinks the ball into the Bournemouth box to ... nobody. Ramsdale claims with a yawn. The crowd burst into song, in an attempt to light a fire under their team. 58 min: Van Dijk, usually so poised in distribution, wallops a long ball straight out for a goal kick, miles from any red shirt. The tension at Anfield is palpable. Next goal wins? 56 min: Some nervy head tennis in the midfield. Both teams aware this is still very much up for grabs. 54 min: Liverpool are beginning to stutter. Anfield is very still as a result. You can understand the tension. So close, after 30 years. Wins, so easy to come by for so long, suddenly don\u2019t look quite so simple. 52 min: Stanislas sends a weak shot wide left of goal. A poor end to a promising move that saw Fraser momentarily get clear down the inside right, only to hesitate and see an effort easily blocked. Further proof, though, that Bournemouth don\u2019t intend to lie down and accept the inevitable. 50 min: Stanislas knocks long down the right. Wilson nearly nudges Van Dijk, of all people, off the ball. Van Dijk\u2019s not having it, and barges back to win and clear, but the Bournemouth striker is clearly in the mood to take the game to Liverpool\u2019s centre backs. 49 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a dig from 25 yards. The ball cannons off Ake and away from danger. The hosts are on the front foot in the early stages of the second half. 47 min: The corner drops to Wijnaldum, who executes a perfect fresh-air swipe. The ball\u2019s knocked back into the box. Mane tries to flick the ball around Simpson, but it clips the defender\u2019s hand. Liverpool claim for a penalty, but they\u2019re not getting it. The correct decision: Simpson\u2019s arm was down by his side, and the two players were standing right next to each other. 46 min: Gomez slips a pass down the right for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who wins a corner off Ake. Alexander-Arnold to take. Liverpool get the second half underway. They\u2019re kicking towards the Kop. Half-time entertainment: Meanwhile, across the city ... Another good 45 minutes for Jordan Henderson. 45 min +3: Gomez tries to release Salah down the right. Blooter! Overhit! Out of play. Goal kick. 45 min +2: Fraser works hard down the left to win a corner off Alexander-Arnold. Stanislas takes. Milner slaps it clear. Both teams are pushing for a goal that would significantly change the picture at half-time. 45 min +1: The first of four added minutes. Stacey nearly gifts Mane possession in the Bournemouth box, but just about gets away with it. 45 min: Smith barges Salah off the ball down the left, and slips a pass upfield for Wilson. Adrian races out of his area to punt clear, just in time. On the touchline, Klopp is ranting and raving. You\u2019d pay cash money to be a fly on the wall in the Liverpool dressing room during the break. 43 min: Fraser dinks a ball down the left to release Stanislas. Milner does well to track his run, ensuring he can\u2019t slip Wilson in down the middle. Stanislas lays off to Fraser, who dinks into the box for Billing, but Gomez is on hand to clear. Bournemouth are still carrying a threat. Liverpool don\u2019t look secure at the back at all. Lots of space. 41 min: Mane is penalised for being kicked by Lerma. The referee is currently doing a splendid job of riling up both sets of players. 39 min: Stanislas makes good down the inside left and pearls a shot towards the bottom left. Adrian parries, although not in a particularly confident style. The ball spins out for a corner, which Adrian clears with a much more definitive punch. Liverpool attempt to break upfield, but make a Horlicks of the three-on-two. 38 min: More ill feeling, as Gomez nudges Smith off the field and into the advertising hoardings. Smith whacks his noggin. He\u2019s up soon enough, rubbing his head and moaning at the referee. Speaking of Gomez ... \u201cIf Gomez goes down from the initial push the ref would probably blow for a foul before it got any further,\u201d argues Dan C. \u201cMaybe not a \u2018clear and obvious error\u2019 for VAR to overturn, but it doesn\u2019t encourage honesty either. Which would we rather see?\u201d 37 min: Salah, dropping deep on the right, rakes a diagonal looper towards Milner, coming in from the left. Milner connects, but volleys softly into the arms of Ramsdale. Bournemouth are holding on a bit. 35 min: Mane loses the flight of a long ball and sticks up an arm as it sails towards the stand. He\u2019s still in play, though. Lerma and Fraser want him booked, and tell the referee so. The referee isn\u2019t minded to flourish a yellow. The crowd aren\u2019t too happy with Bournemouth\u2019s demands. There\u2019s a bit of an edge to this now, for one reason and another. 34 min: Klopp celebrated that goal with a wild scream, and a pointed holler in the ear of the linesman, who happened to be passing. He\u2019s clearly still livid about that opening goal. Van Dijk intercepts as Bournemouth consider a quick break. He rolls a straight ball down the middle for Mane, who is in acres. Mane advances towards the box, draws Ramsdale, and slips the ball past the keeper and into the bottom right. Easy as that. 31 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a dig from 25 yards. It pinballs around the Bournemouth box before the visitors clear. Liverpool are beginning to dominate. 29 min: Another corner for Liverpool ... but this one is whizzed straight out of play by Alexander-Arnold. Bournemouth are getting pushed back again, their early verve suddenly lost. 28 min: This is much better from Simpson! Van Dijk floats a left-to-right diagonal for Alexander-Arnold, who fires across the face of goal. Mane is waiting to tap in, but Simpson somehow hooks behind for a corner, from which nothing occurs. That makes up for his earlier error ... a bit. 27 min: Salah dug Mane out of a hole there. That move looked like falling apart, a superb chance about to be squandered, but Salah ensured it would count with a magnificent finish from the edge of the box. Mane will get an assist for that, but really. Anfield is making some noise now! Mane robs Simpson, who was ambling out from the back, yet to get up to speed. Liverpool are two on one! Mane thinks about shooting, but rolls the ball to Salah on his right. It\u2019s a dreadful pass, behind the man, but Salah checks, shifts inside, and threads a shot into the bottom right. 23 min: You could hear a pin drop at the minute. In the dugout, Klopp tries to whip up his charges. It\u2019s all extremely flat. Penny for Pep Guardiola\u2019s thoughts at the moment. 21 min: Liverpool win their first corner. Alexander-Arnold takes it from the right. Play is stopped as Wijnaldum takes an accidental whack from Ake\u2019s flailing arm. Anfield wants a penalty, but there was no intent. Mind you, elsewhere, Lerma shoved Fabinho to the floor, so perhaps everyone was claiming for that. Either way, Liverpool are getting nowt, and the hosts look extremely agitated. 19 min: Simpson comes on for the Bournemouth captain Steve Cook. \u201cI assume we can stop talking about VAR favouring Liverpool now, right?\u201d asks Oliver Loksa. BT Sport refereeing guru Peter Walton certainly thinks it should have been a foul, as the \u201cclear and obvious\u201d bar is lowered significantly for an \u201cupper body foul\u201d. And he usually just parrots the official line, so make of that what you will. 17 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain plays a cute ball down the inside-right channel. Steve Cook stretches but can\u2019t intercept. Firmino has space to shoot, but his effort is parried by Ramsdale. Bournemouth clear ... but it looks like Cook has done his hamstring. 16 min: Lewis Cook plays a ball down the inside-left channel for Wilson, who beats the offside trap and zips upfield. Liverpool are again short at the back, and lucky that Wilson\u2019s pass forward for Stanislas is too strong. Adrian claims. 14 min: Milner is forced to concede a corner out on the right. Fraser takes. Ake pearls a glorious header goalwards. Liverpool are fortunate that it\u2019s straight at Adrian, who can tip over the bar. The second corner comes to nothing, but you can be sure most of the punters inside Anfield are currently thinking about Devon Loch. 13 min: Let\u2019s see if James Milner\u2019s pre-match team-talk had any effect. There\u2019s no immediate sign, as Fraser crosses from the right. The ball only just flies over the head of Stanislas in the middle. 11 min: Liverpool have only themselves to blame for that one. Wilson did shove Gomez in the back, and off the ball, but everyone in red then stopped. Bournemouth played to the whistle, and VAR official Michael Oliver saw nothing wrong with Wilson\u2019s challenge. Anfield falls silent, bar a few boos, and a cheer in the away end. On the touchline, Klopp throws his hands around, urging the crowd to get going. Billing takes up possession, feeding Lerma down the right. He rolls the ball across the face of goal for Wilson, who taps home. VAR checks, decides there\u2019s no shove on Gomez, and Liverpool are trailing again! 8 min: Wilson barges Gomez out of the way as the pair chase a long ball. It looks like a foul, but ... 6 min: Bournemouth are sitting deep. Liverpool hogging possession. It already looks like being one of those games. Can the title hopefuls break through? Can the relegation strugglers hold out? Alexander-Arnold crosses for Salah. Steve Cook heads behind for a corner, but the flag goes up, correctly, for offside. 4 min: It\u2019s a lovely late-winter, early-spring day at Anfield. Not much in the way of breeze. Liverpool stroke it around the back in a similarly mild style. Then suddenly there\u2019s a little space for Alexander-Arnold down the right, but his cross is easily hoicked clear by Ake. 2 min: Otherwise, it\u2019s a slow start, and Anfield has quickly fallen silent. Expect this to be a tense affair, unless Liverpool score early. 40 secs: A mazy dribble by Oxlade-Chamberlain down the right. The ball\u2019s slipped inside for Van Dijk, who lumps forward and nearly releases Salah down the right. Ramsdale is out quickly to claim. An early statement of intent from the hosts. Bournemouth get the ball rolling. They\u2019ll be kicking towards the Kop in this first half. The teams are out! Liverpool are four wins from the title, and the atmosphere at Anfield is accordingly hot. A huge roar as the players take to the field of play. Much amusement as the players meet, the hosts trooping along the line offering no handshakes, as per the coronavirus edict. Smiles all round at the oddity. Let\u2019s balance out the fun with some pre-match misery, courtesy of Ian Copestake: \u201cDespite defending Lovren far better than Lovren actually can himself, Juergen has not included him on the bench. Kudos to the Croatian for self-isolating. I am going to say this out loud, but I think this will not be a win for Liverpool. I\u2019m no psychologist but until they get the game with Madrid-lite done and won then and only then will the burden they seem to be playing under will be lifted.\u201d BT Sport have been lugging into Liverpool stand-in captain James Milner\u2019s pre-match pep talk. Here\u2019s what he told the rest of the team as they were warming up. \u201cThose reactions, straight away, as soon as we lose it, bodies round it, then we play all that area, eh? Doesn\u2019t matter who scores, we score, they score, we lift it again. Every kick-off is a trigger for us.\u201d Well that\u2019s fate tempted. Goalless draw ahoy! Jurgen\u2019s version. \u201cThe results in the last four games were not exactly how we wanted them to be. So we have the chance to change the situation. Bournemouth have to fight for the league, so we have to fight, make it as difficult as possible, and get a result. In football you always have to find a solution.\u201d Is Robertson rested or injured, BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly asks. A long pause, before a considered response. \u201cSomething in between?! He would have started today but he felt slightly bad, so he will be good, fine for Wednesday, but not today.\u201d Cherries boss Eddie Howe throws down the gauntlet. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate test and that\u2019s how we have to look at this game and approach it. It\u2019s a great opportunity to show how good we are. You learn from every opponent\u2019s gameplan and see if there\u2019s anything that can help your team, but we are us. We are our unique team with the strengths that we possess, and I think we can cause them problems. We have to believe we can get a positive result today. Being in the bottom three should focus our energies in a positive way. We know we have to do something. The onus is on us.\u201d BREAKING NEWS: Liverpool will be playing in red ... ... while Bournemouth will sport robustly couriered second-choice blue. Liverpool make three changes to the team that went down so spectacularly at Watford last week. Adrian in for Alisson; Joe Gomez for Dejan Lovren; James Milner for Andy Robertson. Bournemouth make one change from last weekend\u2019s draw with Chelsea. Junior Stanislas replaces the injured Josh King. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Mane, Firmino, Salah. Subs: Keita, Minamino, Lallana, Lonergan, Origi, Matip, Williams. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Stacey, Steve Cook, Ake, Smith, Billing, Lerma, Lewis Cook, Stanislas, Callum Wilson, Fraser. Subs: Boruc, Gosling, Surman, Solanke, Rico, Simpson, Surridge. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). Winning the league isn\u2019t meant to be easy. Liverpool supporters are all too aware of this, into the 30th year of the search for their holy grail. Mind you, this time last week, it felt like the Reds were leading a procession, four wins from their first English championship since 1990. But one no-show against Watford later, plus a KO in the cup, and the mood-o-meter has switched from Party to Pensive. If they fail to beat Bournemouth this lunchtime, it won\u2019t exactly be crisis time ... not yet ... but a few nerve-ends will start to jangle, twitch and yip, you can be darn sure of that. As Liverpool have just found out, a lot can change in a couple of matches. But then spin it another way: if they see off relegation-haunted Bournemouth today, as they surely should, then pull off a recovery in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, the entire picture will suddenly look a hell of a lot brighter. It doesn\u2019t take much for the dial to shift either way. And what better opponent to shake off the post-break blues against than Bournemouth? Liverpool have won their last five games against Eddie Howe\u2019s side to the aggregate tune of 17-0. They quite literally couldn\u2019t Cherry-pick a better fixture in which to bounce back. And yet Bournemouth won\u2019t be without hope. They haven\u2019t won in three, but came mighty close to beating Chelsea last weekend. They\u2019ve also claimed a couple of big scalps this season: Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester United at home. And they earned a 2-2 draw at Anfield back in April 2017, the same season they turned Klopp\u2019s side over at Dean Court, coming from behind for a famous smash-and-grab 4-3 victory. It\u2019s not totally been a one-sided relationship. Plus the fact Anfield may get a little nervous if things don\u2019t go to plan for the home heroes in the early exchanges. This could be the match that steadies the champions-elect after a brief, uncharacteristic wobble. Or it could go some way to saving Bournemouth\u2019s Premier League skin, while planting more seeds of doubt in Liverpool\u2019s collective mind, with big away games at Everton and Manchester City coming up. Plenty riding on this, then, and it\u2019s going to be fun finding out how it all comes down. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "The state of Florida has reported two deaths from coronavirus, the first US fatalities outside the west coast, as thousands remain quarantined on a cruise ship moored off the coast of California, near San Francisco. Health officials said the deaths in Florida involved two people in their 70s who had travelled overseas, one in Santa Rosa County and the other near Fort Myers. The US death toll is now 17, with 333 confirmed cases in the Covid-19 novel coronavirus outbreak. And on the Grand Princess cruise ship moored outside San Francisco, nearly half of the 46 people tested for coronavirus onboard have returned a positive result, vice president Mike Pence said. The fate of its more than 3,500 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries remains unclear. Pence said 21 positive results had been recorded \u2013 19 crew members and two passengers \u2013 and that \u201cthose that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it.\u201d He urged elderly Americans to consider carefully taking future cruises during the crisis. There is little detail as to where quarantined and sick passengers will be taken. Previously, military sites have been used to quarantine holidaymakers from the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. On the Grand Princess, some passengers have already complained about the handling of the situation, saying they learned of the coronavirus cases from media reports, and there are concerns for one passenger who has stage 4 cancer. There are 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew on the vessel, with more than 140 Britons and four Australians among them. Globally, the virus has now killed nearly 3,500 people and infected more than 100,000 across 92 nations and territories. Italy and Iran have become the latest hotspots with sharp rises in confirmed cases, recording 4,636 and 4,747 respectively. In China, 99 new cases were confirmed, and 29 deaths as of midnight Friday. In official data released on Saturday, China\u2019s exports fell 17.2%, the biggest drop since February 2019 during the trade war with the US, and imports dropped 4%. The US government plans to take the Grand Princess to a \u201cnon-commercial port\u201d where all the passengers and crew would be tested, however, President Donald Trump said on Friday he would prefer not to allow the passengers onto American soil. \u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d said Trump, who appeared to be explicitly acknowledging his political concerns about the outbreak: \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d Closer to the epicentre of the global outbreak, Hong Kong further sealed itself off from the outside world, with authorities advising Hongkongers against all non-essential travel abroad, and making all arrivals complete a health declaration form. Previously, the measure, which will come into force from Sunday, was required only for mainland Chinese passengers. The city has reported 106 cases and two deaths in the past six weeks, according to its health officials. In Australia, authorities are working to trace about 70 patients of a doctor who continued to see patients despite falling ill with coronavirus-like symptoms. He fell ill in the US during a flight from Denver to San Francisco on 27 February before flying back to Melbourne and working throughout the following week. He was later confirmed to have the virus and Toorak clinic, where he works, has since been closed. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said: \u201cI have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms has presented to work,\u201d Mikakos said. Equally astonished were police in Sydney, who appealed for calm after a brawl broke out between three women in a supermarket over toilet paper amid continued panic buying. \u201cWe just ask that people don\u2019t panic like this when they go out shopping,\u201d said acting inspector Andrew New from New South Wales police. \u201cThere is no need for it.

Kolstoe, 60, said she and her husband, Paul, 61, had looked forward to the cruise to Hawaii as a brief, badly needed respite from the grind of medical intervention she has endured for the past 18 months. Now facing the prospect of a two-week quarantine far from home in Grand Forks, she worried their getaway cruise will end up causing a fateful delay in her next round of chemotherapy, scheduled to begin early next week. \u201cIt\u2019s very unsettling,\u201d she said in a telephpone interview from the ship on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s still a worry that I\u2019m going to not get back.\u201d Besides the implications for cancer treatment is the fear of falling ill from exposure to a respiratory virus especially dangerous to older people with chronic health conditions and suppressed immunity. \u201cI\u2019m very at risk for this,\u201d said Kolstoe, whose rare form of neuroendocrine cancer has spread throughout her body. \u201cMe staying on here for a lot of reasons isn\u2019t good.\u201d Steven Smith and his wife, Michele, of Paradise, California, went on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

In the US, officials in Austin cancelled this year\u2019s SXSW festival, a major tech and music conference, amid coronavirus concerns. SXSW, which draws 400,000 visitors, was scheduled for 13 to 22 March. Austin\u2019s mayor, Steve Adler, said: \u201cI\u2019ve gone ahead and declared a local disaster in the city and associated with that, have issued an order that effectively cancels SXSW.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen to more than 200, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed. In total, 206 people had tested positive for Covid-19 as of 7am on Saturday, an increase of 42 from 164 cases confirmed on Friday. The department said more than 21,000 people had been tested for the virus. Five more people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in Scotland, with a total of 16 confirmed. Two new cases, confirmed on Saturday by the Scottish government, have been reported in Lanarkshire, with an increase of one case in Lothian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Grampian. The increase matches the jump seen in Scotland on Friday, the biggest in a single day since the first reported Scottish case on Sunday. In total, 1,664 of the 1,680 tests in Scotland have come back negative. Meanwhile, US authorities are preparing to deal with a cruise ship carrying British passengers off the Californian coast, after 21 people on board tested positive for coronavirus. Mike Pence, the US vice-president, said on Friday that the Grand Princess, with more than 3,500 people on board \u2013 including 140 Britons \u2013 had been directed to a non-commercial port for testing. The public has been told to prepare itself in case \u201csocial distancing\u201d policies are needed to help contain the spread of the virus. However the UK remains in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase of tracing coronavirus cases to prevent it spreading in the community, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer has said. Jennie Harries told the BBC on Saturday that a decision about the next phase of delaying the spread of the virus would depend on how fast the number of cases rose. The government\u2019s battle plan says of the \u201cdelay\u201d phase: \u201cAction that would be considered could include population-distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country\u2019s ability to continue to run as normally as possible.\u201d On Friday, it was confirmed that a man in his early 80s had become the second person to die in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. The man, who had underlying health conditions, died on Thursday while being treated at Milton Keynes University hospital. The previous evening, another patient, reported to be a woman in her 70s, became the first person in the UK to die after being diagnosed with Covid-19 while at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading. NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak. In a letter sent to all 7,000 English GP surgeries on Thursday, NHS England made clear it is giving every surgery a full supply of PPE gear, which will help keep staff who come into contact with suspected coronavirus cases safe and help to minimise the spread of the virus. The move follows complaints by GPs and the British Medical Association that practices are ill-equipped to deal with the outbreak. On Friday, GP surgeries were told by NHS England to start conducting as many remote consultations as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact. More than 20 GP practices have been forced to close temporarily over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Boris Johnson will chair a Cobra civil contingencies committee on Monday as officials prepare to accelerate work on the delay phase of the government\u2019s plan. Sports governing bodies and broadcasters have also been called to a government meeting on Monday to discuss how to handle the possible impact of the outbreak on the sporting calendar.",

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget on Wednesday was supposed to be a landmark event that set the stage for five years of extraordinary Conservative government spending to upgrade Britain\u2019s infrastructure and \u201clevel up\u201d economic activity between London the regions. The chancellor was expected to talk about both aims along with plans to cut taxes for low-income workers, a boost to skills training and how the government plans to meet carbon-reduction objectives before the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. However, before he talks about any of these things, Sunak will now have to address the most pressing issue confronting the government \u2013 how to limit the spread and impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Here is what to expect in what is being billed as one of the most hurriedly rewritten budgets of recent times. Coronavirus outbreak There will be extra cash for the health service to fund test centres at hospitals and to purchase testing kits. Cash for GP surgeries, which are expected to come under intense pressure as the virus spreads, will also be set aside. Attempts to attract back retired and semi-retired doctors and nurses to help cope with the anticipated epidemic have so far failed, according to some reports from health trusts. Sunak is expected to help stem the tide by easing the restrictions on pension tax relief. It is hoped this will reverse the exodus of doctors in recent years as they hit their tax-free limits. Many have quit after exceeding their limit and being asked to make large repayments.

Sunak, though, is expected to say that more than \u00a3100bn in extra spending to boost the economy and tackle the climate emergency will be delayed until after the budget. The Treasury may have hundreds more staff than it did just two years ago to put in place new policies. However, most of them have found themselves up to their eyes in Brexit planning and, in more recent weeks, deciding how to cope with the coronavirus. A plan to improve transport connectivity and work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, due to be published alongside the budget, will now be delayed for several weeks. Plans to kickstart the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda look like being delayed even further, most likely to the autumn budget. National insurance threshold/national minimum wage The chancellor will be keen to say he is improving the incomes of low-paid workers. A rise in the national insurance threshold and a faster increase in minimum wage will be billed as offering support. It is understood that planning for a rise in the national insurance threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 from the start of the 2020-21 tax year was well advanced when Sunak took over at the Treasury following Sajid Javid\u2019s shock resignation in the second week of February. This change will give an average family with two earners a tax cut of about \u00a3192 a year. Last September, Javid declared the Conservatives were now the \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d of Britain, as he announced plans to extend the main minimum wage rate to all workers aged 21 and over and raise it to two-thirds of median earnings by April 2024. Sunak is expected to make a similar pledge, though maybe to push back the target date from 2024. Entrepreneurs\u2019 relief/fuel duty/tax reform There is a head of steam behind demands to abolish entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, saving an estimated \u00a32.6bn, or at least reform it. With only an estimated 5,200 people benefiting last year and speculation that they all number among the super-rich, the tax break could be chopped or limited to smaller businesses. Plans to reform pension tax relief are expected to be considered by a wide-ranging review of the government\u2019s support for retirement saving.

Boris Johnson hinted that fuel tax could rise, or fall, before the general election. Sunak, under pressure to maintain tax receipts as the decline in petrol and diesel vehicles is increasing, is expected to signal a rise, but implement it in a year or two. Climate emergency Sunak, who is keen to implement the manifesto promises the Conservative party made last year, will say he plans to invest in nature, with a \u00a3640m \u201cnature for climate\u201d fund to plant 75,000 acres of trees a year by the end of the parliament, as well as restoring peatland. He should also outline how the government will spend \u00a36.3bn committed for energy efficiency, plus \u00a31bn for vehicle charging points and \u00a3800m to limit emissions through initiatives to capture carbon and store it.

      "bodyText": "Police have been deployed to lock down entire blocks of a neighbourhood in Haro, a small town in northern Spain, after dozens of cases of coronavirus were traced back to a funeral held in the nearby Basque country two weeks ago. Spain has so far confirmed 430 cases of the virus \u2013 60 of which originated among people who attended a funeral service in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, according to Spain\u2019s National Microbiology Centre. Thirty-nine of those 60 cases are in the neighbouring La Rioja region, according the local government, with most of them concentrated in the towns of Haro and Casalarreina. About another 25 cases are reported to have been confirmed in the Basque country. At a press conference on Saturday, the regional health minister and the central government\u2019s representative in La Rioja said the situation called for \u201cexceptional measures and robust action\u201d to halt the spread of the virus. Although only six people in the region are being treated in hospital, the authorities said police would be \u201creinforcing home isolation controls\u201d in Haro and limiting access to the town\u2019s health centre. In a statement, the regional health department said officers from the national police force and the Guardia Civil were being deployed to \u201cguarantee the correct observance of home isolation\u201d. It also called for the cancellation of events in enclosed spaces and urged people to stay at home and contact the authorities if they believed they had picked up the virus. \u201cFollowing the principle of precaution that the department is obliged to abide by, we need to take exceptional measures designed to stop the transmission of the illness between citizens who are not following the advice of the health authorities,\u201d said the regional health minister, Sara Alba. \u201cWe are talking to the national health ministry about the situation in Haro and together we\u2019ve agreed the measures we have taken up to now and are prepared for future scenarios,\u201d she said. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, described the outbreak in La Rioja as \u201ca worrying situation\u201d that required \u201cdrastic\u201d but necessary measures. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about quarantining whole blocks in a small neighbourhood,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cThe situation is ongoing and we don\u2019t know where they are with the measures at the moment.\u201d On Saturday, it was announced that a prison worker at a facility in Aranjuez, 30 miles (50km) south of Madrid, also tested positive for the virus. The death toll from the virus in Spain currently stands at 10, while 30 people have been given the all-clear after recovering from the disease. The virus has prompted Barcelona city council to postpone the Catalan capital\u2019s marathon, which was due to take place on 15 March. The event will now be staged on 25 October.",

Premier League: In vain, I pretend nobody noticed I absentmindedly got my Sheffields mixed up in the result before last, while Newcastle leap-frog Southampton in the table thanks to a goal from Allan Saint-Maximin. Premier League: West Ham squandered enough chances to win several games and were undone by a late sucker-punch from Alexandre Lacazette. Premier League: Billy Sharp\u2019s third goal in four games was enough to consign Norwich City to another defeat. Premier League: It\u2019s a decent result at Molineux for Brighton, who draw with Wolves for the second time this season.

Scottish Premiership latest Aberdeen 3-1 Hibernian Celtic 4-0 St Mirren Hamilton 0-0 Kilmarnock Hearts 1-1 Motherwell St Johnstone 1-0 Livingston Championship: They may be down to 10 men, but that hasn\u2019t stopped QPR taking a 2-1 lead against Preston at Deepdale.

After a ridiculously long VAR consultation, Alexandre Lacazette is judged to have been onside when he converted Mesut Ozil\u2019s delivery. Championship: It\u2019s almost certainly too little too late from Hull City, who have pulled a goal back against Stoke City, thanks to Leonardo Da Silva Lopes. Scottish Premiership: Leigh Griffiths completes his hat-trick as Celtic pile the pain on St Mirren in Glasgow. Championship: Brentford 4-0 Sheffield Wednesday - Josh Dasilva scores his second of the afternoon as Brentford riff, be-bop and scat all over Wednesday\u2019s pain at Griffin Park. Championship: QPR\u2019s Geoff Cameron picks up his second yellow card of the game and it\u2019s quickly followed by a red. It\u2019s Preston 1-1 QPR at Deepdale but the visitors are an American down. Championship: Cardiff City score two goals in as many minutes to leave Barnsley7 in all sorts of bother. Will Vaulks and Callum Paterson with the quick-fire double at Oakwell. Scottish Premiership: Having lost Steven Whittaker to a red card, Hibs have now surrendered their lead against Aberdeen and are behind. Christian Doidge had put Hibs ahead, but goals from Adam Jackson and Andrew Considine have left them with a mountain to climb. Championship: Grant Hall scores for QPR to make it all square in their match against Preston. It\u2019s 1-1 at Deepdale. We\u2019re into the final half hour of today\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs. And one suspects Gary Lineker and his Match of the Day team are starting to get antsy. We\u2019ve had just two goals in the day\u2019s fixtures that kicked off since Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2-1 at Anfield in the lunchtime kick-off. Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth (result) Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-0 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Championship: Reading have come from behind to take the lead against Birmingham City, with Yakou Meite scoring their second in quick succession with a flick of his head.

Championship: Patrick Bamford scores his first goal in eight games with a tap-in from a couple of yards out to put Leeds United 2-0 up against Huddersfield Town. At the Bet365 Stadium, Sam Clucas heads his second goal of the afternoon to give Stoke a 4-0 lead over beleaguered Hull City. Meanwhile in Spain: Ahead of their Champions League Round of 16 second leg match against Liverpool next week, Atletico Madrid are playing Sevilla in the Spanish capital. It\u2019s 2-2 at half-time at the Wanda Metropolitano. Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth (result) Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-0 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Bristol City 1-1 Fulham (result) Barnsley 0-0 Cardiff City Birmingham City 1-0 Reading Brentford 3-0 Sheffield Wednesday Charlton Athletic 0-1 Middlesbrough Leeds United 1-0 Huddersfield Town Preston 1-0 QPR Stoke City 3-0 Hull City Swansea City 0-0 West Brom Wigan Athletic 0-0 Luton Town Scottish Premiership half-times Aberdeen 0-1 Hibernian Celtic 2-0 St Mirren Hamilton 0-0 Kilmarnock Hearts 0-1 Motherwell St Johnstone 0-0 Livingston Scottish Premiership: Leigh Griffiths doubles his first half tally to make it Celtic 2-0 St Mirren. Meanwhile at Pittodrie, Hibs are one up against hosts Aberdeen thanks to Christian Doidge\u2019s strike in the 39th minute. Premier League: Matt Ritchie celebrates signing a contract extension yesterday by missing from the spot. It\u2019s a brilliant save from Alex McCarthy after Sofiane Boufal was correctly penalised for hand-ball. It remains (10-man) Southampton 0-0 Newcastle. Premier League: VAR intervention results in a penalty for Newcastle after a hand-ball. Championship: Brentford go 3-0 up against Sheffield Wednesday, with Bryan Mbeumo sprinting on to a weighted pass, cutting in from the right and firing into the corner. Premier League: Billy Sharp\u2019s rich vein of form continues as the Sheffield United striker slots home John Lundstram\u2019s cross. That\u2019s the evergreen Billy\u2019s third in four games. Premier League latest Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth (result) Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-0 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Premier League: Jordan Ayew scores from about 20 yards out after good hold-up play from Christian Benteke, who turns provider for his team-mate for the second game in a row. Premier League: The intervention of VAR results in Moussa Djenepo having a yellow card overturned and replaced with a red after a high challenge on Isaac Hayden. Scottish Premiership latest Leigh Griffiths has put Celtic ahead against St Mirren, getting on the end of a cross from Odsonne Eduord. Meanwhile in Edinburgh, Motherwell pile the misery on hapless Hearts, Chris Long capitalising on an error from defender Craig Halkett, who sold his goalkeeper short with a dreadful backpass. Aberdeen 0-0 Hibernian Celtic 1-0 St Mirren Hamilton 0-0 Kilmarnock Hearts 0-1 Motherwell St Johnstone 0-0 Livingston Championship latest Bristol City 1-1 Fulham (result) Barnsley 0-0 Cardiff City Birmingham City 1-0 Reading Brentford 2-0 Sheffield Wednesday Charlton Athletic 0-1 Middlesbrough Leeds United 1-0 Huddersfield Town Preston 1-0 QPR Stoke City 3-0 Hull City Swansea City 0-0 West Brom Wigan Athletic 0-0 Luton Town Championship: Stoke City are going goal crazy!

We\u2019re still waiting for our first goal in the Premier League\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs, but they\u2019re flying in in the Championship. Championship: Stoke City double their lead against Hull City, who are perilously close to the relegation zone who are without a win in their past 10 league games, having taken just two points from 30 available.

Championship: Stoke City take the lead against Hull City, with Nick Powell getting on the end of a cross to head past George Long at the back post. Championship: Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Cameron Dawson flaps at a high ball, which drops for Brentford\u2019s Josh Dasilva. The Bees lead 1-0 at Griffin Park.

Championship: Leeds United take an early lead against Huddersfield Town at Elland Road, Luke Ayling volleying home at the back post after three minutes. Premier League: Jarrod Bowen hits the post with a long range effort for West Ham in the early stages of their match against Arsenal at the Emirates. Not long now: Pre-match handshakes are not taking place in grounds around the country as players and match officials go through the last of the pre-match formalities ahead of our three o\u2019clock kick-offs. Intriguingly, there were no short of post-match handshakes and embraces in the game between Liverpool and Bournemouth. It\u2019s almost as if Premier League officials just wanted to be seen to be doing something about the coronavirus and didn\u2019t really think their new healthcare policy through. Premier League: \u201cThere was joy in the eruption that greeted the final whistle at Anfield but also unmistakable relief,\u201d writes Andy Hunter. Championship: Nakhi Wells and Tom Cairney got the goals as the points were shared at Ashton Gate. Premier League: It wasn\u2019t the most convincing of victories, but Liverpool won\u2019t care. They\u2019re unbeaten in 55 at Anfield and now lead the Premier League by 25 points. Arsenal v West Ham: Arsenal make three changes, while West Ham field an unchanged side from the one that beat Southampton last week. Wolves v Brighton: Adama Traore is injured, but makes the bench. Leander Dendoncker replaces him. Graham Potter keeps faith with the same team that lost against Crystal Palace last week. Southampton v Newcastle: Danny Ings comes back into the Southampton side, with Michael Obafemi dropping to the bench. Chris Smallbone and Stuart Armstrong are both out injured. For Newcastle, Alain Saint-Maximin returns to the starting line-up after missing out against Burnley last weekend, while Joelinton is among the substitutes. Sheffield United v Norwich City: Sander Berge is out of Sheffield United\u2019s starting line-up and is replaced by John Lundstram. Norwich City are unchanged from the side that beat Leicester City last weekend. Crystal Palace v Watford: Crystal Palace are unchanged from their win over Newcastle. Watford make one enforced switch, with Roberto Pereyra coming in for Gerard Deulofeu, whose season is over. Championship: With the game approaching its knockings, it\u2019s 1-1 between Bristol City and Fulham at Ashton Gate. Nahki Wells put the home side ahead in the 70th minute, but Tom Cairney has just equalised for Fulham. There\u2019s five minutes left in that one.

If the evidence of Liverpool\u2019s match against Bournemouth is anything to go by, handshakes have been outlawed, but spitting on the pitch, goal celebrations, players covering their hands with their mouths while talking to each other and managers screaming with spittle-flecked rage at fourth officials is still OK. Premier League: It remains Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth at Anfield, but Liverpool are not having it all their own way. Ryan Fraser thought he\u2019d equalised for Bournemouth after lobbing Adrian and was waiting for the ball to drop into the gaping goal, only for James Milner to sprint back and make a spectacular goal-line clearance. Scott Murray has the latest ... Barney Ronay wrote column about Eric Dier\u2019s post-match saunter into the West Stand at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night, in which he expressed concern about levels of incoherent anger on the internet. It should go without saying that it has been greeted by levels of incoherent anger on the internet, although many readers seem largely in agreement. Read on ... Meanwhile in Scotland As good as home and hosed in the Scottish title race due to Rangers\u2019 post winter break slump, Celtic entertain St Mirren as they continue their hunt for nine in a row. At the bottom of the table, Hearts entertain third-placed Motherwell and are in desperate need of a win. Two points above them and high on the hog after their midweek win over Rangers at Ibrox, Hamilton Hamilton entertain Kilmarnock. Rangers travel to Ross County for tomorrow\u2019s lunchtime kick-off. Championship fixtures The Championship weekend got off to rather a surreal start with Millwall\u2019s surprise hammering Nottingham Forest at the City Ground last night. Just ahead of Forest in third place, Fulham are playing Bristol City in the day\u2019s early fixture and it\u2019s currently scoreless at the break at Ashton Gate. Elsewhere, league leaders West Brom travel to Swansea City, while second placed Leeds United entertain Huddersfield Town in a Yorkshire derby. Further down the table, close friends and rival managers Less Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate will be in opposing technical areas when Charlton entertain fellow strugglers Middlesbrough in a kind of Leeds Last Time They Were In Europe derby. Premier League fixtures As we\u2019ve mentioned already, Liverpool are entertaining Bournemouth in the day\u2019s lunchtime kick-off and got off to a poor start, going behind to a Callum Wilson goal in the ninth minute that somehow survived a VAR check despite a blatant foul by the goalscorer on Joe Gomez in the build-up. It\u2019s going better for the hosts now, thanks to goals from Mo Salah and Sadio Mane. Liverpool now lead by the odd goal of three. Elsewhere, Brighton face a daunting trip to Wolves as they begin a run of fixtures that pits them against four of the top six, Arsenal and relegation rivals Norwich City in their next six games. Their fellow strugglers West Ham continue their fight against relegation with a trip to Arsenal, while Newcastle, who look far from safe, travel to the south coast for a visit to Southampton in one of the day\u2019s other eye-catching fixtures. The weekend\u2019s Premier League action kicked off at Anfield, where Liverpool are hoping to put a run of three defeats in four games (across three different competitions) behind them as they entertain relegation-threatened Bournemouth. They\u2019ve come from behind to lead their visitors 2-1 at half-time. Away from Merseyside, we\u2019ve got five three o\u2019clock kick-offs to stay across in the top flight and we\u2019ll also be keeping tabs on goings-on in the Championship and beyond. Stay tuned for team news, build-up, goal alerts and any other major talking points on what promises to be another intriguing afternoon of football action.",

      "bodyText": "You can continue to view our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak here. We\u2019re closing this blog now. Thanks for joining me. Here\u2019s a summary of the news so far today: It was now \u201chighly likely\u201d the infection will spread in the UK in a \u201csignificant way\u201d, a No 10 spokesman has said. The number of coronavirus cases in Germany has hit 684 on Saturday morning, an increase of 45 overnight. Authorities in the US are preparing to test passengers on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Grand Princess, after 21 people on board tested positive for the illness. Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy\u2019s Democratic party (PD), which governs the country in coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S), has tested positive for coronavirus. The pope will make Sunday blessings via a streaming service from inside the Vatican, instead of appearing in person in St Peter\u2019s Square, it was announced. British health officials say the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen from 164 to 206, an increase of 42 from Friday. NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak Cases in both Italy and Iran have increased by more than 1,000 in 24 hours. The family of the 83-year-old man who died after testing positive for coronavirus have paid tribute to him in a statement released on Saturday afternoon. Here\u2019s the full story from the UK: More than 1,200 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy since Friday, the Civil Protection Agency said. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy has risen to 5,883 from 4,636 on Friday, according to official figures, a rise of 1,247. The death toll in the country rose to 233 from 197 on Friday. The head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said in a news conference that of those originally infected, 589 had fully recovered while 567 were being treated in intensive care. In total there are now 5,061 current cases (this figure doesn\u2019t include those who have died or those who have recovered.) The outbreak in Italy, which began over two weeks ago, is focused on a handful of hotspots in the north, but cases have now been confirmed in each of the country\u2019s 20 regions, with deaths recorded in eight of them. A second member of France\u2019s National Assembly has been taken to hospital after contracting coronavirus and five other lawmakers are being tested for the illness, the lower house\u2019s presidency said in a statement on Saturday. The Assembly did not name the two legislators who have caught the disease, but local media in the eastern region of Alsace have reported that the first of the two lawmakers is Jean-Luc Reitzer, who represents one of the departments most affected by the outbreak and is currently in intensive care, Reuters reports. The second lawmaker is a woman, according to the statement by the parliament. The Assembly said on Friday that a snack bar worker had also contracted the virus. Sessions in the lower house will be interrupted for two weeks from 9 March and 22 March due to municipal elections that are taking place across France, reducing activity and the number of people present in the building, the assembly said. France\u2019s health ministry said earlier that two more people had died from the coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to 11 people. France now has 716 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 103 compared with a day earlier. Italy\u2019s premier football league, Serie A, could be forced to suspend mid-season if a player tests positive for coronavirus, the Italian football federation (FIGC) said on Saturday. \u201cWe must be realistic,\u2019\u2019 Gabriele Gravina, president of the FIGC, said in an interview with Italian broadcaster Rai, \u201cWe need to take measures to protect athletes, and we cannot exclude the possibility to suspend the competition if a player tested positive.\u2019\u2019 On Wednesday, Italy ordered that all sporting events should be played behind closed doors until 3 April due to the outbreak. The \u201dderby of Italy\u201d between Inter Milan and Juventus football clubs is set to be played on Sunday, while the Rome marathon, due to take place on 29 March, has been cancelled due to the outbreak. \u201cThis is the message that we would never have wished to write but sadly, as a consequence of the ongoing health emergency and according to what is laid down in the cabinet decree of March 4, 2020, the Marathon on March 29 has been cancelled,\u201d said organisers. Italy is the European country most affected by the coronavirus with 3,916 infected and 197 dead. Iran\u2019s death toll climbed to 145 on Saturday after another 21 people were confirmed to have died, as infections in the country increased to nearly 6,000. Announcing the latest deaths from the virus, a health ministry official said in a televised briefing that the tally of confirmed infections had increased by more than 1,000 during the last 24 hours, totalling 5,823 by Saturday, Reuters reported. On Friday, the country\u2019s confirmed cases were reported to be 4,747. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called in a tweet for world opposition to US sanctions, which he said were draining Iran\u2019s resources, needed in the fight against the outbreak. A second confirmed case of Covid-19 has been recorded in Cornwall. Steve Brown, Cornwall council\u2019s deputy director of public health, told PA Media: \u201cThe case is a resident directly linked to the initial diagnosis in Cornwall, who had also travelled to northern Italy. \u201cI\u2019d like to reassure people again that the risk to the general public remains low and Cornwall council is working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Cornwall are protected. \u201cIf you have not been contacted by Public Health England as a close contact of the confirmed cases you do not need to take any action at this time.\u201d Public Health England is also contacting people who had close contact with a resident of Leicestershire, one of the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19. Fu-Meng Khaw, the centre director at Public Health England East Midlands, said: \u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case. \u201cThis tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.\u201d The Premier League handshake ban has kicked in today, with various players seen bumping fists or elbows instead, or even completely avoiding a physical greeting. Sam Jones in Madrid Police are preparing to lock down entire blocks of a neighbourhood in a small town in northern Spain after dozens of cases of the coronavirus were traced back to a funeral two weeks ago. Spain has so far confirmed 430 cases of the virus \u2013 60 of which originated among people who attended a funeral service in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, according to Spain\u2019s National Microbiology Centre. Thirty-nine of those 60 cases are in the neighbouring La Rioja region, according the local government, with most of them concentrated in the towns of Haro and Casalarreina. About another 25 cases are reported to have been confirmed in the Basque country. Although only six people in the region are being treated in hospital, the authorities said police would be \u201creinforcing home isolation controls\u201d in Haro and limiting access to the town\u2019s health centre. Greek Cypriot police fired pepper spray on Saturday after skirmishes broke out with protesters angry about a closed checkpoint on the ethnically-split island, according to witnesses. Authorities said the closure was a precaution against coronavirus, Reuters reports. Cyprus announced the temporary closure of four checkpoints on the divided island on 28 Feb, the first closure since border crossings were opened in 2003 after decades of estrangement. Witnesses said a group of people on the Turkish Cypriot side turned out in support of peace activists on the other side of the barricade calling for the checkpoint in the capital Nicosia to open. When open, it is used by hundreds of people every day. \u201cPeople were holding olive branches, and at some stage it appears someone started pushing,\u201d a witness at the gathering on the Turkish Cypriot side told Reuters. \u201cGreek Cypriot police pushed back and at that moment it appeared they used pepper spray.\u201d In a statement, Cyprus police said they made limited use of teargas to prevent demonstrators breaking a police cordon. Stones were also thrown at police, the statement said. The Italian Democratic party leader, Nicola Zingaretti, in a video about his own Covid-19 diagnosis My colleague Nicola Slawson has written a story about a letter that was sent to over 7,000 GP surgeries in England, informing them that NHS England will provide personal protective equipment to help staff deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Virologist Chris Smith, presenter of the BBC radio talk show The Naked Scientists, told the BBC in a Q&amp;A with members of the public that, at the moment, the level of circulation of coronavirus in the community in the UK was \u201cextremely low\u201d, and thus the risk of catching it currently \u201cremains extremely low\u201d. Smith said there was a very low chance of getting infected with coronavirus via items such as parcels. Asked whether the new coronavirus could mutate quickly into new, even more aggressive forms, meaning that patients would likely not enjoy immunity even after they had it, Smith said that, judging from currently available observations about the outbreak, Covid-19 was thankfully changing shape \u201conly very slowly\u201d. Toys for small children could be cleaned very effectively in the dishwasher, Smith advised. British health officials say the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen from 164 to 206, an increase of 42 from Friday. So far in Britain, two patients who had been confirmed as being infected with the virus have died, the health ministry and the Public Health England agency said. The Department of Health said more than 21,000 people had been tested for the virus. \u201cAs of 7am on 7 March 2020, 21,460 people have been tested in the UK, of which 21,254 were confirmed negative and 206 were confirmed as positive.\u201d Around 70 people were left trapped after a hotel used to quarantine people who have had recent contact with coronavirus patients collapsed in Quanzhou, eastern China, officials said. The Xinjia Hotel collapsed around 7.30pm local time (11.30am GMT) and around 23 people had been rescued by 9pm, according to a city government statement reported by AFP, with rescue efforts ongoing. The 80-room hotel was recently converted to a quarantine facility for people who had recent contact with coronavirus patients, the People\u2019s Daily state newspaper reported. Five more people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in Scotland, with a total of 16 now confirmed. Two new cases, confirmed on Saturday by the Scottish government, have been reported in Lanarkshire, with an increase of one case each in the Lothian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Grampian areas. The increase matches the jump seen in Scotland on Friday, the biggest in a single day since the first Scottish case was reported the previous Sunday. In total, 1,664 of the 1,680 tests in Scotland have come back negative. The England cricket team\u2019s head coach, Chris Silverwood, has said he is following the lead of Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp by referring questions over medical advice to experts. Seemingly, doctors have instructed the cricketers to keep their distance from members of the media in Sri Lanka as part of precautions against the coronavirus. There has been only one recorded case on the island to date, but the squad are taking a proactive approach, with all players and backroom staff provided with an \u201dimmunity pack\u201d for the Test tour, including hand sanitiser, sterilising wipes and nasal sprays, PA Media has reported. Handshakes have also been replaced by fist bumps. Post-match interviews on tour often take the form of pitch-side huddles but when Silverwood emerged to speak to two journalists after the opening day of the warm-up match in Katunayake, he did so while standing behind a blue table. The measure is designed to establish a buffer zone of around two metres. \u201cI\u2019m taking J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s lead here \u2013 I\u2019m not a doctor, so we do what we\u2019re told and follow the advice,\u201d he said, referring to the Klopp\u2019s comments earlier this week that journalists should ask experts about medical issues, not sportspeople. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat and we do our best to be as vigilant as possible,\u201d said Silverwood. David and Sally Abel, the British couple diagnosed with coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, remain unable to return to the UK after their latest test came back positive. They were taken to a Japanese hospital from the cruise liner following a positive diagnosis of both the virus and pneumonia, after spending almost two weeks in quarantine in their cabin. In order to leave the hospital, both need three negative test results. Both had been tested twice previously \u2013 and the result had been negative \u2013 but during the most recent and final test, David Abel\u2019s response came back positive. David Abel, who has been filming a YouTube video diary of his experiences, said: Sally is now negative but is staying in Japan. Sally is now totally all clear, good to return to the UK. But she won\u2019t because I have had a positive. This is what happens. I have now got to go back to square one. I have another test on Monday. That is more than likely going to be negative. They have agreed to allow her to remain here so we can be company for one another. She won\u2019t get reinfected because we have got the same strain. Her immune system is now really well established. So it\u2019s the waiting game. The doctor, I think he was surprised. I think everyone else was expecting a negative. Confirmed cases in the Netherlands have risen by 60 to 188, health officials have said, after the country reported its first fatal case on Friday. The National Institute for Public Health said that most of the cases could be traced back to people who had recently travelled, mostly from northern Italy. In 29 cases, the path of infection was still being investigated. Elsewhere, in New South Wales, Australia, two more people have tested positive \u2013 bringing the day\u2019s number to eight and the state\u2019s total to 36 cases. The two new cases are a man in his 60s who recently returned from Italy and a second man in his 40s who is a known close contact of a previously confirmed case. In need of some light relief? Here\u2019s a montage of inventive new greetings designed to avoid the risk of passing coronavirus. And here\u2019s something a little longer, on the man caring for cats left alone in Wuhan. A former passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship who was infected with coronavirus has died, bringing the death toll from the ship to seven, Japanese public broadcaster NHK has said. The passenger, a man from outside Japan, died on Friday, according to Reuters. The US president, Donald Trump, remarks that he would prefer if passengers on the coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship were not allowed to come on to US soil. France has reported another jump in coronavirus cases from 653 to 716, an increase of 63, according to the French health ministry. The spokesperson said that 11 people had now died in France because of the virus. The pope will make Sunday blessings via a streaming service from inside the Vatican, instead of appearing in person in St Peter\u2019s Square, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The pope\u2019s general audiences are also to be streamed and no participants at papal morning masses are to be allowed until March 15, Reuters reports. The measures are being put in place to protect worshippers and the pope from infection. The pope has been suffering from a cold. As Greece steps up measures to contain an outbreak of coronavirus in the west of the country, there is growing concern over the stance of Greek Orthodox clerics, who have refused to postpone church services and suspend Christian rites. Although the Holy Synod, the church\u2019s ruling body, has endorsed many of the preventative measures, it has steadfastly rejected calls for practices such as holy communion to be halted. To the alarm of scientists, high-ranking bishops have invoked religious belief as a bulwark again Covid-19. In extraordinary exchanges on TV, clerics have argued that sacraments such as the holy eucharist should remain off-limits because they are God-given. \u201cWhoever believes that holy communion and the church are life has nothing to fear,\u201d the Bishop of Patras, Chrysostomos, told Open News. \u201cThere has been no case, anywhere, of a virus or any other illness being transmitted through holy communion.\u201d Prominent virologists in the country have also come out in support of the powerful religious institution. One well-known professor of infectious diseases said that while people aged 65 and over with underlying health issues would be better off avoiding church, she belonged to those who would still attend services, which in Greece are often held in crowded chapels. \u201cWhen you go to take holy communion, you don\u2019t take it out of habit but because it tis he body and blood of Christ,\u201d Eleni Giamarellou, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Athens, told local media. \u201cThose who want to take the sacraments should not fear that germs could be transmitted through holy communion.\u201d The stance has raised fears of further transmissions in a country where cases of coronavirus rose from eight on Monday to 46 today. In a statement, the Federation of Hospital Doctors\u2019 Unions slammed what it described as obscurantist views, suggesting that some professionals were putting religious beliefs before the strictures of profession. \u201cWe will be on the front line of defending scientific truth against metaphysical [theories] and every other kind of obscurantism,\u201d it said. Another leading epidemiologist has weighed in on the drop in cases in Hubei province, and what this might mean for the rest of the world. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said it was a source of hope that China was currently seeing a substantial reduction in cases. \u201cHowever, there are still unanswered questions, for example about the total number of infections and even how protected previously recovered people are from new infections, before we can give confident descriptions on how to contain the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see detailed, population-based (as opposed to clinic-based) serological investigations to be conducted. This would allow an individual\u2019s history of the disease, including inapparent (or asymptomatic) cases, to be evaluated. And this needs to be done in large areas where cases have been reported, in order to find out how many cases were missed by the surveillance programs.\u201d Hibberd added that such data could enable a more accurate analysis of the disease\u2019s severity following infection, \u201cin a similar way to how we are able to calculate this for Influenza\u201d. He warned governments around the globe to get the balance in their response to the outbreak, by adequately contributing to the world\u2019s attempts to delay the spread of coronavirus, while simultaneously \u201ckeeping their economies running as well as possible\u201d, instead of \u201cputting too much of their health care resources into Covid-19\u201d. A 26-year old woman returning from London has tested positive for coronavirus in Vietnam, after the country went 22 days with no new infections. The Vietnamese woman, the country\u2019s 17th case in total, has been quarantined and is undergoing treatment, the Vietnamese news outlet VN Express reported. Authorities said the patient had left Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai airport on 15 February to visit family members living in London. Three days later, she travelled from London to Milan City, in the province of Lombardy, Italy, and returned to London on 20 February. On 25 February, the woman travelled from London to Paris to visit her sister. She contracted a cough on 29 February, but did not see a doctor. On 1 March, she reportedly felt body pain and fatigue, but it was unclear if she had a fever. The same day, she boarded a flight from London and landed in Hanoi on 2 March. As Vietnamese authorities held an emergency meeting about the case, and 17 doctors who had been in contact with the woman were being isolated, Public Health England said it could not comment on individual situations. Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy\u2019s Democratic party (PD), which governs the country in coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S), has tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cDoctors told me I have tested positive,\u2019\u2019 Zingaretti announced on Facebook. \u201cBut I\u2019m fine and I will stay home for the next few days. From here, I will continue to follow the work that needs to be done.\u201d Authorities in the US are preparing to test passengers on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Grand Princess, after 21 people on board tested positive for the illness. Some 140 Britons are among those on board. US vice-president, Mike Pence, said on Friday that the Grand Princess, currently carrying more than 3,500 people, had been directed to a non-commercial port for testing, PA Media reports. So far 45 people on board the ship off the Californian coast have been tested, with 19 of those diagnosed with the virus being crew members. Lisa Egan, whose 90-year-old father is on board, called for the ship to be evacuated. \u201cKeeping people on board is going to be a death sentence for many,\u201d she told the Telegraph newspaper. Donald Trump appeared to suggest he wanted to see the ship remain off the coast to keep country\u2019s infection numbers down. An infectious disease specialist has warned against mass panic and stockpiling as Covid-19 infections continue to spread across the world. Abdu Sharkawy of the University of Toronto\u2019s Division of Infectious Disease wrote on Facebook that he was not scared of the virus, but feared the implications of people\u2019s egoism, which could result in a mass panic. What I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they \u2018probably don\u2019t have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know...\u2019 and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess. He added that he was scared about far reaching travel restrictions impacting communities harshly, and about \u201cepidemic fears\u201d limiting trade in multiple sectors. But mostly he was scared of the message children were told in this crisis. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and \u2018fight for yourself above all else\u2019 attitude could prove disastrous. Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo Italy is considering setting up new quarantine red zones in northern regions amid increasing numbers of coronavirus cases, as the country grapples to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of Covid-19 which had claimed 197 lives by Saturday. Authorities are also considering locking down the entire region of Lombardy. Rome has announced it is making \u20ac600m available to hire 20,000 new health professionals to cope with the emergency. The government is evaluating the possibility of prolonging the closure of schools until 3 April. Some 3,916 people are now infected, 620 more than Thursday, the emergency commissioner and civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said on Friday. A cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt with more than 150 tourists and local crew was in quarantine on Saturday in the southern city of Luxor, after 12 people tested positive for coronavirus. A Taiwanese-American tourist who had previously been on the same ship tested positive when she returned to Taiwan. The World Health Organization informed Egyptian authorities, who tested everyone currently on the ship, AP reported. Health authorities in Egypt released a statement on Friday saying they had found a dozen Egyptian crew members on the ship had had contracted the fast-spreading virus, but did not show symptoms. The statement said they will be be put in isolation in a hospital on Egypt\u2019s north coast. The passengers, who include Americans, French and other nationalities, and crew will remain quarantined on the ship awaiting further test results. The coronavirus death toll in Iran has increased to 145, a rise of 21 over the past 24 hours, a health ministry official said. The number of people testing positive for the virus increased by more than 1,000 over the past 24 hours, reaching 5,823 on Saturday, Reuters reports. Malta\u2019s first case of coronavirus has been detected in a 12-year-old Italian girl who lives on the island, the health minister, Chris Fearne, said on Saturday. The girl tested positive for the illness early on Saturday and is receiving treatment in the infectious diseases unit of the state hospital, the minister said, adding she \u201cis doing well\u201d, Reuters reports. She returned on Tuesday from the northern Italian region of Trentino, passing through the capital Rome, with her parents and sister and reported symptoms on Friday. It was only on Thursday that the girl displayed symptoms associated with coronavirus. The whole family went into self-quarantine immediately, according to MaltaToday. Health authorities were alerted and immediately tested the girl, who resulted positive. Justin McCurry in Tokyo The number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded 7,000 on Saturday, an increase of 448 from the previous day. More than half of the total are linked to a branch of a secretive religious sect in the south-eastern city of Daegu. The death toll in the country rose by two to 46, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The KCDC said it had confirmed 7,041 cases in South Korea, including a new cluster at an apartment complex in Daegu where some members of the sect live. Despite the significant increase in infections over the past 24 hours, Saturday\u2019s total was the third straight day of declines in the number of new cases in South Korea, the KCDC said. A report in Japan, meanwhile, warned that cancelling this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics would slash the country\u2019s GDP by 1.4%. SMBC Nikko Securities, in Tokyo, projected that the Games would create demand worth 670bn yen (US$6.4bn), but added that cancellation due to the coronavirus outbreak would sap GDP by about 7.8tn yen. The firm said it believed the Games, which are due to open on 24 July, would have to be called off it the virus continued to spread through to July. While the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers insisted this week that they expected the Olympics to go ahead as scheduled, the coronavirus outbreak continues to disrupt preparations, with Greece\u2019s Olympic committee saying it will restrict the number of guests at next week\u2019s flame-lighting ceremony in Olympia. The Japan leg of the torch relay is scheduled to begin on 26 March in Fukushima, the scene of a nuclear meltdown nine years ago. The number of coronavirus cases in Germany has hit 684 on Saturday morning, an increase of 45 overnight since Friday evening, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the country\u2019s public health agency. Germany has now confirmed cases in 15 of its 16 states, while the biggest concentration is in the west and south of the country, with 346 in the state of North Rhine Westphalia and over 100 each in the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Germany\u2019s first cases were registered. A popular leisure centre in Glasgow has closed after a player at the rugby stadium, which is part of the complex, tested positive for coronavirus. It is understood the decision to close the Scotstoun Sports Campus was taken after a Scottish player due to compete in a women\u2019s Six Nations match at Scotstoun stadium against France on Saturday contracted Covid-19, PA Media reports. The match was subsequently cancelled and a spokeswoman for Glasgow Life \u2013 the agency which governs the city\u2019s leisure spaces \u2013 said \u201cappropriate measures\u201d were being taken. The player, who has not been named, is described as \u201cdoing well\u201d by James Robson, the chief medical officer of Scottish Rugby, and has been checked into a healthcare facility. Seven members of staff and players have self-isolated after taking medical advice. Scotland has so far had 11 confirmed cases of the illness, according to the Scottish government, with preparations continuing for a larger outbreak. Paul Hunter, a professor at the Norwich School of Medicine, at the University of East Anglia, said the drop in infections in Hubei was a good sign, echoing comments of senior WHO advisor Bruce Aylward. \u201cThe continuing drop in cases reported each day from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan is one of the few good news stories from the past week,\u201d he said. \u201cExcluding the days when clinical diagnosed cases and not only laboratory diagnosed cases were given as the daily totals, the epidemic in Hubei peaked on 5 February with 3,156 new cases. Since then there has been an almost steady decline in cases reported each day. Today\u2019s provisional figures show only 74 new cases from Hubei,\u201d Hunter added. China had demonstrated that the rigorous control measures put in place had been effective in delaying the spread of the infection globally, he said. \u201cUltimately, however, the infection did spread from China and is now spreading globally with several countries experiencing rapid increases in numbers. It looks like the UK is also at the start of a rapid growth in locally-acquired infections. However, the extra weeks that we have had to prepare, thanks to the control measures in Wuhan and Hubei generally, will make quite a difference to our ability to mitigate some of the more harmful effects of the epidemic,\u201d he said. All migrant workers in China are expected to return to work in early April, according to Chinese government officials, Se Young Lee, at Reuters, reports. 78 million rural workers who had travelled home for lunar new year have already returned to work, he says. As the number of confirmed cases in Spain rose to 401 on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, the outbreak has prompted Barcelona city council to postpone the Catalan capital\u2019s marathon, which was due to take place on 15 March. The event will now be staged on 25 October. Meanwhile, a prison worker at a facility in Aranjuez, 50km south of Madrid, has tested positive for the virus, and health authorities are investigating a cluster of cases that appear to be related to a funeral held in Vitoria, in the Basque country, two weeks ago. As many as 60 people who attended the funeral are reported to have picked up the virus. So far, eight people have died in total in Spain because of coronavirus. Children are just as likely to contract coronavirus as adults, according to a new Chinese study, countering the theory that kids are less susceptible to Covid-19. Research on community transmission of the virus showed a \u201csharply increasing proportion of infected children\u201d as the outbreak has progressed. Scientists analysed 365 patients in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen \u2013 including 74 clusters comprising 183 cases. Children aged under 15 made up just 2% of the cases before 24 January. But from 25 January to 5 February, the proportion of children went up to 13%. According to the researchers, the findings implied that children\u2019s risk of becoming infected could substantially rise with more exposure to the virus. Transmission of the virus within families was also a major factor, they said. A Briton stuck on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California has told of her plight as 140 other British passengers brace for potential weeks of isolation. So far 21 people on the ship, with 3,500 people on board, have tested positive for coronavirus \u2013 just under half of all those who have been tested. The Grand Princess is being directed to a non-commercial port, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, said on Friday. Jackie Bissell, from Dartford, in Kent, told the Today programme that she had booked the cruise with a friend as part of her 70th birthday celebrations. She said that passengers had only been told on Thursday that there might be something wrong, as the ship\u2019s management implemented rigid procedures in the hope of limiting the outbreak. \u201cWe had a note popped through the door saying that this virus might be on the ship \u2013 they removed the salt, the pepper,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could touch absolutely nothing, if you wanted sugar in your tea or coffee they would come along and do it for you rather than you touching any of these items,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can just go out in the hall if someone taps the door. They put the food outside, drop your menus inside and that\u2019s about it.\u201d Bissell said she was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d and life on board \u201chas not been too bad\u201d so far. \u201cIt was a bit mishmash yesterday but today they\u2019ve got things a lot more organised,\u201d she said. Passengers relied on information from the news, she added. \u201cWe are waiting for the ship\u2019s captain \u2013 but I think he\u2019s as much in the dark as we are and he\u2019s said he\u2019s only giving us information as and when he gets it.\u201d Boris Johnson is due to chair a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra civil contingencies committee on Monday morning. It was now \u201chighly likely\u201d the infection will spread in a \u201csignificant way\u201d, a No 10 spokesman has said, according to PA Media. \u201cOfficials will therefore accelerate work on the delay phase of the government\u2019s plan,\u201d the spokesman added. Meanwhile, sports governing bodies and broadcasters have been called to a government meeting to discuss how to deal with the outbreak\u2019s possible impact on the sporting calendar. The meeting will cover various scenarios, such as holding events behind closed doors, should the virus continue to spread and gatherings of large numbers of people are banned. An Iranian MP has died from coronavirus, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Saturday, in an another sign the disease is spreading within state institutions. Iran is one of the countries outside China most affected by the epidemic. As of Friday, the country had reported 4,747 infections. The MP who died on Friday is Fatemeh Rahbar, a conservative lawmaker from Tehran, according to Tasnim. It did not say if she was included in the country\u2019s official toll of 124 deaths from the virus, given on Friday. On 2 March, Tasnim reported the death of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a member of the Expediency Council, intended to resolve disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, a governmental body that vets electoral candidates, among other duties. Iran\u2019s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, and another member of parliament, Mahmoud Sadeghi, have also said they have contracted the virus. Government ministers are expected to advise elderly people in the UK next week to visit relatives now before \u201csocial distancing\u201d policies are introduced. British pensioners could be warned to stay at home and will likely be told to avoid crowded areas, the Daily Telegraph reported. Bruce Aylward, the senior advisor to the head of the World Health Organization, has said the world should be encouraged by the decline in coronavirus cases in China\u2019s Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated. Countries hadn\u2019t yet learned the lesson that an effective response depends largely on speedily finding, isolating and testing suspected cases, however, he told the Today show. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find the cases very very quickly, get them isolated, find their close contacts, because those people are where the virus is, and if you get those isolated, quarantined, you\u2019re going to take the heat out of this outbreak,\u201d he said. Despite weeks of China making \u201cheroic\u201d efforts to contain the virus, countries were \u201cstill surprised when it hits their borders here and they still don\u2019t know how to isolate or find cases\u201d, Aylward said. As a church in Devon has been closed for a deep clean after a parishioner there became infected with coronavirus, Gina Radford, a vicar from south Devon and deputy chief medical officer for England until last year, told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that churches across the country were trying to go about their normal business as much as possible, because of their \u201cvery important role\u201d in communities. Radford said during service, advice had been given about how to maintain appropriate hygiene as an individual, which also applied to priests administering communion. It was up to priests to decide whether they it would be necessary to \u201cwithdraw the common cup\u201d during communion, she said, so that everyone would not be drinking from the same chalice. Congregations had been reminded that they could decide to just take the wafer, \u201cthat is full communion\u201d, she added. \u201cWe do have to remember that churches are places of meeting and welcome and comfort, and at the moment [...] we are wanting to encourage people to have a balanced approach [to the outbreak] and to go about life as normal as they can for as long as they can.\u201d As millions of people wonder whether their travel plans and holidays will be affected by coronavirus over the coming weeks and months, my colleague Patrick Collinson has put together a useful advice guide about all things travel insurance, holiday deposits, flight bookings and more. My colleagues Peter Beaumont, Lorenzo Tondo and Kim Willsher have written an analysis on how human error helped spread the virus across the globe, and how avoiding small mistakes can mitigate the crisis. The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has agreed to declare a state of national public health emergency following the local transmission of coronavirus, according to Senator Bong Go, CNN Philippines reports. Here\u2019s what has happened in coronavirus news so far today: Twenty-one people tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Grand Princess cruise ship stranded off the California coast. Of these, 19 were crew members. The US confirmed its first East Coast deaths, as two people died in Florida. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. Europe\u2019s infections doubled in the last three days, to 7,300 on Friday. China\u2019s exports have fallen sharply. China\u2019s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world\u2019s supply chains. In Victoria, Australia a doctor has been confirmed as the eleventh case of the virus for the state. He treated 70 patients despite displaying flu-like symptoms shortly after travelling from America. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. South Korea\u2019s diplomatic spat with Japan escalated, as the country suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan. South by South West was cancelled. The annual technology and culture festival said its March events would not go ahead amid fears it could help to spread the virus in Austin, in Texas. Two South Korean apartment buildings heavily occupied by members of a sect linked to most of the country\u2019s coronavirus cases have been quarantined after dozens of residents tested positive for the disease, an official said on Saturday. The country, which has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases outside China, reported 174 new infections, taking its total to 6,767. Another two deaths were reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the toll to 44. The apartment complex in Daegu \u2013 the country\u2019s fourth-largest city and epicentre of its outbreak \u2013 was placed under lockdown after 46 residents were confirmed to have the virus, mayor Kwon Young-jin said. More than 140 people live in the two buildings, including 94 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often accused of being a cult and is linked to most of South Korea\u2019s infections. The NBA is preparing its players for the eventuality that they may have to play in empty stadiums to no fans, sports journalist Shams Charania and the New York Times report. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday that the number of confirmed case of coronavirus in the country had jumped to four. \u201cThree positive cases of coronavirus have been registered in western Herat province of Afghanistan,\u201d Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health told Reuters, adding that of the 36 cases tested in Kabul, 33 had come back negative. Herat borders neighbouring Iran, which is one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus outside of China, with more than 4,000 cases and dozens of deaths. Mayar expressed concern about the vulnerability of Afghanistan\u2019s border with Iran. Millions of Afghans live and work in the neighbouring country and many are facing increasing political and economic pressure to return. Mayar said the cost of testing would be a strain on Afghanistan\u2019s resource-strapped health system in an economy damaged by years of conflict. Each test kit - which would test around 50 cases - cost around $1600 (or $32 per test), he said. One of 2,400 passengers on board the Grand Princess cruise ship stranded off the Californian coast is a retiree with stage-4 cancer. Kari Kolstoe, 60, from North Dakota told Reuters she and her husband, Paul, 61, had looked forward to the Grand Princess cruise to Hawaii as a brief, badly needed respite from the grind of medical intervention she has endured for the past 18 months. Now facing the prospect of a two-week quarantine far from their home in Grand Forks, she worries their getaway cruise will end up causing a fateful delay in her next round of chemotherapy, scheduled to begin early next week. \u201cIt\u2019s very unsettling,\u201d she said in a cellphone interview from the ship on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s still a worry that I\u2019m going to not get back.\u201d In South Korea, more than 60% of the total cases are linked to a secretive church at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak, health authorities said. Reuters report the death toll also rose to 46 from 44, Kwon Jun-wook, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention\u2019s (KCDC) deputy director told a briefing on Saturday. South Korea\u2019s cases rose to 6,767 on Saturday, up by 174 from late Friday. The number of people infected with the contagious disease has spiked in South Korea since mid-February when a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cPatient 31\u201d tested positive after attending religious services at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu. A new smaller cluster case reported on Saturday at an apartment complex in Daegu, where some members of the church live, KCDC said. \u201c63.5% of the total cases is related to the Shincheonji Church and its members, but there is a possibility that new cases increase as tests are still underway,\u201d said the deputy director. The number of infections in Europe has more than doubled in just three days, the New York Times reports, as confirmed cases reached over 7,300 on Friday. According to Johns Hopkins, here are the ten countries in Europe with the highest number of infections. Italy: 4,636 Germany: 670 France: 653 Spain: 401 Switzerland: 214 UK: 164 Netherlands: 128 Belgium: 109 Norway: 108 Sweden: 101 Just an update on the global coronavirus numbers today, from Johns Hopkins. Total cases are now at 102,188. Of those, 80,651 are in mainland China. Total deaths: 3,491. Of those, 2,959 were in Hubei province, Mainland China. The countries with the next highest numbers of confirmed cases are: South Korea: 6,767 Iran: 4,747 Italy: 4,636 Germany has the next highest number of confirmed cases, but there is a fair gap between its numbers and those in Italy: Germany: 670 We learned four valuable lessons from Ebola. They can help us fight the coronavirus, writes Chris Withington, who works in the humanitarian and emergency response unit of Care Australia. \u201cCoronavirus is a global crisis that is going to require a global solution. The lessons from Ebola are there for us to use \u2013 but will we?\u201d The United Arab Emirates reported 15 additional cases on Saturday of a new and fast-spreading virus, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 45. The Health Ministry said 13 of the new cases had recently arrived from abroad, and they include three Emirati citizens, two Saudis, two Ethiopians and two Iranians, as well as a person each from Thailand, China, Morocco and India. The statement gave no further details on where the travellers had come, when they had arrived to the UAE and which ports of entry they had come in from. The other two cases, an Emirati and an Egyptian, were diagnosed after being monitored in connection with a cycling tour in the country that was halted a week ago after two Italians were first confirmed as having the virus. The emirate of Dubai is home to the world\u2019s busiest airport for international travel. American jails are on high alert for coronavirus. Below are sone of the measures that are being taken, and some of the particular challenges faced by prisoners as they seek to protect themselves. There have been no reports of Covid-19 inside US jails or prisons. But more people are incarcerated per capita here than in any other country in the world and prisons have become hot spots in other nations touched by the outbreak, AP reports. Inmates share small cells with total strangers, use toilets just a few feet from their beds, and are herded into day rooms where they spend hours at a time together. Practicing even the most simple hygiene, such as washing hands, is not a given in such environments. Hand sanitizer is often treated as contraband because it contains alcohol. Inmates go in groups to court, where they wait together in cramped holding areas. Many are poor, meaning that when they\u2019re released they often must get on public buses or trains to get home. In New York City, the Department of Correction is cleaning and sanitizing cells, common spaces, showers and transport buses more regularly. Anyone sick at Rikers Island, the notorious New York City jail where Harvey Weinstein is being held, is screened and could be sent to an area hospital or the department\u2019s communicable disease unit. In Miami, any newly arrested person suspected of having the virus will be diverted to a hospital. The department has also secured space for a medical quarantine for any of the 3,900 inmates already in custody if it becomes necessary. Prison staff are being trained in many facilities on how to recognize symptoms and are being given supplies for protection, such as masks, gloves and eye protection. Throughout the country, criminal attorneys are meeting with clients via video conference and exercising caution over how they handle and exchange legal documents with inmates. Despite the lack of much good coronavirus news in our liveblog today, here are precisely nine reasons to be reassured when it comes to the status of the outbreak so far. As we are hit with minute-by-minute updates from around the world, experiencing the advance of Covid-19 in real time \u2013 news alerts, huge headlines, social media hysteria \u2013 there\u2019s a risk that we might lose some essential context. Yes, this virus is obviously a massive challenge: medical, political and \u2013 perhaps most strikingly at present \u2013 social and economic. But it is worth remembering the world has never had better tools to fight it, and that if we are infected, we are unlikely to die from it. Here, courtesy of a number of scientists but mainly Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Go\u00f1i, a professor of microbiology and virology at the University of Navarra in Spain, are what might hopefully prove a few reassuring facts about the new coronavirus: \u2018It isn\u2019t the Thunderdome, it isn\u2019t Mad Max\u2019 Australia\u2019s toilet paper tensions continued on Saturday, this time with hair pulling at a Sydney Woolworths. NSW police had to be called to a western Sydney supermarket on Saturday morning after a fight broke out among three women over toilet paper. On Saturday afternoon NSW police asked the women involved to come forward, and warned shoppers to behave themselves. \u201cWe just ask that people don\u2019t panic like this when they go out shopping,\u201d police said. \u201cThere is no need for it. It isn\u2019t the Thunderdome, it isn\u2019t Mad Max, we don\u2019t need to do that. Here\u2019s what has happened in coronavirus news so far today: The US has confirmed its first East Coast deaths, as two people died in Florida. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. 21 people are infected on board the Grand Princess cruise ship, currently quarantined off the California coast. In Victoria, Australia a doctor has been confirmed as the eleventh case of the virus for the state. He treated 70 patients despite displaying flu-like symptoms shortly after travelling from America. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. New Zealand has confirmed its fifth case, a 40-year-old woman who contracted the virus from her husband, who was the country\u2019s third case South Korea\u2019s diplomatic spat with Japan escalated, as the country suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan. The first case in Central America was confirmed. Costa Rica said a 49-year-old woman from the United States had been infected with the virus. South by South West was cancelled. The annual technology and culture festival said its March events would not go ahead amid fears it could help to spread the virus in Austin, in Texas. In Australia, just a quick summary of that presser with deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly: The Australian government will be releasing 260,ooo masks from its stockpile The government is offering assistance to Indonesia as the Australian neighbour works to contain the spread of the virus there. It is looking \u201cincreasingly unlikely\u201d that Australia will be able to completely contain the virus over the long term The government is considering stockpiling some pharmaceuticals, including antibacterial and antiviral medicines With regard to the coronavirus-infected Melbourne doctor who treated 70 patients despite exhibiting flu-like symptoms, Kelly says: \u201cDon\u2019t soldier on... we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard\u201d. Kelly also said that the government is looking into the potential correlation between high rates of coronavirus spread and winter conditions. Australia is entering its winter season, so the government will be watching that closely, he says. In Canberra, Australia deputy chief medical officer Kelly says over the longer term there is a \u201crange of possibilities that may take place. We may be able to take it under control but that\u2019s looking increasingly unlikely... it may become endemic, so something that comes back around each winter.\u201d We\u2019re still in Canberra, Australia for the moment, where deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is giving a general update on the status of preparations for managing the spread of the virus. Kelly says Australia is offering support to Indonesia for testing and other control measures for the coronavirus outbreak. In Canberra, Australia, deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says the government is considering stockpiling some antibiotics and antivirals to a stockpile, though none of either type of pharmaceutical have been proved to be effective against coronavirus. In Canberra, Australia we\u2019re hearing more from the Department of Health on the Melbourne doctor who treated 70 patients despite exhibiting flu-like symptoms. The general principle is, as it is in flu season, \u201cDon\u2019t soldier on...and we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard,\u201d deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says. In Australia, 260,000 masks are to be released from stockpile, authorities say. We\u2019ll have more updates shortly. China\u2019s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world\u2019s supply chains. Exports fell 17.2 percent, the biggest drop since February 2019 during the trade war with the United States, and imports dropped 4 percent, according to official data released Saturday. China\u2019s trade surplus with the US - a key point of contention in the trade dispute between the two countries - plunged 40 percent in the first two months, from US$42 billion last year to US$25.4 billion. Chinese authorities said last month that January and February\u2019s data would be combined. This is in line with how some other indicators are released, to smooth over distortions from the Lunar New Year break. In an early sign of the economic impact to come, China\u2019s manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level on record in February, with non-manufacturing activity plummeting as well. Florida Health Department says in statement that two people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in the state, Associated Press reports. The deaths are the first on the East Coast, according to the New York Times. The Australian town of Cairns is deathly quiet in the wake of the coronavirus, Aaron Smith reports for the Guardian. The combined economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak and the bushfires have kept visitors away from Australia and nowhere is this more acutely felt than north Queensland. The wet season from January has traditionally been a low season for the Queensland tourism industry in the far north, so the growing Chinese market has been a much-needed boost for a region in recent years. However, since Chinese New Year this year, Chinese tourist numbers have dried up because of cancelled inbound flights from China. It\u2019s been a tough blow for region already suffering a struggling market since last year\u2019s floods, the summer\u2019s bushfires and the international attention on coral bleaching. In Sydney, Australia this morning, a scuffle broke out at a Woolworths supermarket over \u2013 what else? \u2013 toilet paper. A video posted to social media shows three women involved in a short scuffle over a 24-pack of toilet paper in a Chullora store. Now, NSW police have issued a sharp warning and appealed for information regarding those involved. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mad Max, you don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d New South Wales police have said. Officers spoke to a 49-year-old woman who had reportedly been assaulted. She was uninjured. No arrests have been made and as inquiries continue comic police are appealing to identify the women involved. As inquiries continue police are appealing. Violence of this nature will not be tolerated and anyone involved in this behaviour may be committing an offence and find themselves before the court. In Australia, Sydney police are appealing for information surrounding an argument that broke out at a Woolworths over toilet paper. A spokesperson is speaking now, we\u2019ll be following live. The city of Bethlehem is under lockdown after the first Palestinian cases of the deadly coronavirus were discovered there and authorities announced a state of emergency. Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said a total of 16 cases of coronavirus had been detected in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after nine new cases were discovered in Bethlehem, official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported Friday evening. The Palestinian government announced a month-long state of emergency late Thursday after the first seven cases were identified, while the Israeli defence ministry said it had imposed emergency measures on Bethlehem, with everybody \u201cforbidden from entering or leaving the city\u201d. It added that the lockdown had been imposed \u201cin coordination with the Palestinian Authority\u201d. The Church of the Nativity, built on the site Christians believe was the birthplace of Jesus, was closed on Thursday and along with other sites is expected to be shuttered for a month. The streets of Bethlehem and Ramallah, where the Palestinian government is based, were near-empty on Friday morning, with most shops closed, AFP journalists said. Israel controls all entrances to the West Bank from the Jewish state but the Palestinian government has limited autonomy in cities. The Palestinian health ministry said the cases had first been detected at a hotel in the Bethlehem area. Coronavirus confirmed in two attendees at US pro-Israel summit Influential US pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC said Friday that two people who attended its annual Washington conference alongside dozens of lawmakers had tested positive for coronavirus. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee said in an email to attendees, speakers and congressional offices that the pair had traveled from New York to go to the March 1-3 event. \u201cWe have confirmed that at least two Policy Conference attendees from New York have tested positive for the Coronavirus,\u201d AIPAC said in the message, posted to its Twitter account. The event attracted high-profile attendees including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democratic former White House hopeful Mike Bloomberg. About 18,000 people had been expected to travel from across the US to attend the conference, which typically attracts around two-thirds of the members of Congress. Attendees swamped Capitol Hill in their hundreds during the event, as is the custom. \u201cIf you test positive for Coronavirus, we urge you to inform your local health authorities so they can properly coordinate the response to this situation with the appropriate health authorities,\u201d AIPAC said. Facebook said on Friday it is closing its London offices until Monday after a visiting employee from Singapore was diagnosed with coronavirus. \u201cAn employee based in our Singapore office who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 visited our London offices February 24-26, 2020,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe are therefore closing our London offices until Monday for deep cleaning and employees are working from home until then.\u201d Facebook also advised employees based in the affected area of its Singapore office to work from home until March 13. It said it had immediately closed the area for deep cleaning. The Hong Kong government has warned the city\u2019s residents to consider deferring all non-essential travel outside of the territory. It had already placed a red alert - the second-highest warning in Hong Kong - on travelling to South Korea and the Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions of Italy, Reuters reports. However, the government said all travelers out of Hong Kong should now contemplate putting their plans on hold. Hong Kong has reported 106 cases of coronavirus and two deaths in the past six weeks, according to the city\u2019s health officials. Just three of the territory\u2019s 13 borders with mainland China remain open following the announcement of closures by Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on February 3. COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cAs the transmission of COVID-19 virus has been increasing around the world, they are advised to consider delaying all non-essential travel outside Hong Kong,\u201d the CHP said in a statement published on a government website on Friday. Mexican authorities on Friday said they have identified a sixth person infected with coronavirus, a 71 year-old man in the State of Mexico who recently traveled to northern Italy, Reuters reports. Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said the man, who suffers from hypertension, arrived in Mexico in \u201cgrave condition\u201d and is currently hospitalized in stable condition. Lopez-Gatell said two of the man\u2019s family members have been tested to check for the infection, with the results still awaited. In Australia, New South Wales Health confirmed six fresh cases of coronavirus on Saturday, taking the state\u2019s total to diagnosed cases to 34. NSW Health authorities are seeking to track down passengers on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha after a man in his 70s was among six new cases of the deadly virus diagnosed in the state. All of the new cases were close contacts or family members of previously confirmed cases except for a male who contracted the virus after visiting Italy. The man fell ill day the day after flying back to Sydney via Qatar before he was diagnosed this week. NSW Health said they were attempting to contact passengers on Qatar Airways flight QR908 which left Doha on March 1. \u201cScreening continues at Sydney International Airport,\u201d NSW Health said in a statement. \u201cAs at midnight 7 March, a total of 23,814 passengers have been assessed, and a total of 77 were sent for testing.\u201d Males in their 20s, 40s and 50s and two females in their 40s took the NSW total of confirmed coronavirus cases to 34 on Saturday with another 545 under investigation. We\u2019re just trying to confirm the number of infections for Turkmenistan. Radio Free Europe reported two days ago that \u201cMedical sources in Turkmenistan claim[ed] at least two Turkmen have tested positive for the coronavirus at a hospital near the capital, Ashgabat,\u201d but the Johns Hopkins database \u2013 which we use to confirm cases \u2013 does not yet show these. U.S. has raised its travel alert levels for Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan The U.S. State Department on Friday raised its alert level for travel to Azerbaijan, warning Americans to reconsider travel there due to a coronavirus outbreak and response measures implemented by the country\u2019s government. The State Department also raised its alert level for travel to Turkmenistan due to travel restrictions and quarantine procedures instituted in response to the virus. Neither country has reported many cases \u2013 Azerbaijan has six, according to Johns Hopkins \u2013 but both border Iran, which has been hard hit by the coronavirus. The U.S. State Department slapped a travel advisory warning on Iran last month, urging Americans not to travel there. India is bracing for a potential explosion of coronavirus cases as authorities rush to trace, test and quarantine contacts of 31 people confirmed to have the disease, the Associated Press reports. It is screening international travelers at 30 airports and has already tested more than 3,500 samples. The Indian army is preparing at least five large-scale quarantine centers. India has shut schools, stopped exporting key pharmaceutical ingredients and urged state governments to cancel public festivities for Holi, the Hindu springtime holiday in which people douse each other with colored water and paint. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s canceled travel plans to Brussels for an India-EU summit amid a rising caseload in Belgium, and tweeted that he would not attend any Holi festivities. Experts fear these precautions won\u2019t be enough for India\u2019s beleaguered, under-funded and under-staffed health system to stave off an epidemic. Facebook\u2019s director of product management has announced on Twitter that the company is banning ads selling medical face masks. In the US, CNN reports that the passengers on board the Grand Princess cruise ship currently quarantined off the California coast were not told of the number of infections on board before US Vice President Mike Pence announced it. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation says international tourist arrivals are expected to drop 3% due to to the new coronavirus. \u201cThis first assessment expects that Asia and the Pacific will be the worst affected region, with an anticipated fall in arrivals of 9.0 percent to 12.0 percent,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. The number of international tourist arrivals is expected to drop sharply this year, the UNWTO said Friday, reversing a previous forecast for a substantial increase. The United Nations\u2019 UNWTO said in a statement that arrivals were now projected to fall by 1.0-3.0 percent in 2020, instead of a previous forecast of growth of 3.0-4.0 percent. This will lead to an estimated loss of US$30-50 billion in international tourism receipts, the body said. If confirmed, this will be the first annual decline in the number of international tourist arrivals since 2009 when the global economic crisis hit the travel and tourism sector hard. In the US, Hawaii\u2019s KITV4 is reporting that the American state has confirmed its first case of coronavirus in one of the passengers on board the grand princess cruise ship. Local department of health officials say the man had no close contact with residents on the islands. The grand princess stopped at Nawiliwili, Honolulu, Lahaina, and Hilo during its voyage, KITV4 reports. Argentina has eight confirmed cases of coronavirus, all brought by people who had recently been in Europe, the Health Ministry said on Friday, adding uncertainty to an economy already slammed by recession, high inflation and unsustainable debt. \u201cArgentina continues in the containment stage, with eight confirmed cases with a history of travel to transmission areas,\u201d the Health Ministry said in a statement. The Argentine patients range between age 23 and 72, it said. The country is a major world food supplier struggling to pull out of recession and tame 50% inflation as the government hunkers down for what promise to be tough restructuring talks with bondholders. Fellow South American countries Colombia, Chile and Peru announced their first confirmed cases of coronavirus this week, and a number of cases have been confirmed in neighboring Brazil. In the US, Reuters reports that the United States is considering ways to discourage U.S. travellers from taking cruises, as part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to four officials familiar with the situation. The officials, who asked to remain anonymous, said no decision had been made. The discussions were taking place ahead of a meeting this weekend between Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of leading the U.S. response to the coronavirus, and the cruise industry. The cruise industry contributed nearly $53 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018 and generated more than 420,000 jobs, according to an analysis by the Cruise Lines International Association. During a press conference at the White House on Friday evening, Pence said elderly people should use \u201ccommon sense and caution\u201d when planning a trip on a cruise ship. \u201cCruise ships represent a unique challenge for health officials,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working closely with some great American companies in the cruise line industry to enhance and strengthen the screening procedures.\u201d Shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings have fallen around 50% since January. Kuwait has suspended all flights to and from Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Bangladesh, Philippines, India, and Sri-Lanka for a week starting on Saturday, Kuwait\u2019s civil aviation directorate said in a tweet. Kuwait also banned entry of anyone who has been in the seven countries in the last two weeks except for Kuwaitis coming from the seven countries, who will be allowed entry but will have to submit to quarantine procedures, the civil aviation directorate added. About a quarter of China\u2019s new confirmed cases and almost all of those outside Wuhan originated outside the country on Friday, according to official data. Mainland China had 99 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday, down from 143 cases a day earlier and marking the lowest number since Jan. 20, when the NHC started to publish nationwide figures. China also reported 28 deaths from those with the virus, all from Hubei province. Outside of central China\u2019s Hubei province, there were 25 new confirmed cases reported on March 6, of which 24 came from outside China. Most of these were in China\u2019s northwestern Gansu province, from quarantined passengers who entered the provincial capital of Lanzhou on commercial flights from Iran between March 2 and March 5. The capital Beijing reported four new cases on Friday, of which three came from Italy, according to a notice from the Beijing health commission posted on its official Weibo account on Saturday. There were also three cases in Shanghai that originated abroad, and one in Guangdong province on Friday, according to the National Health Commission. The total nationwide number of cases that originated outside China reached 60 as of the end of Friday. For the second day in a row, there were no new infections in Hubei outside of the provincial capital of Wuhan. Two federal health screeners at Los Angeles International Airport have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an email sent to their colleagues today and seen by Reuters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees were conducting secondary screenings of passengers arriving from overseas, including from China, and have been directed to self-quarantine until March 17, the email said. \u201cAt this time, we cannot confirm where these two screeners were exposed,\u201d said the email, which was sent by a senior CDC official. \u201cLet us keep our colleagues in our thoughts during this period.\u201d South Korea on Saturday reported 174 additional coronavirus cases from late Friday, taking the national tally to 6,767, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention said. The death toll remained unchanged at 44 from late Friday, the KCDC added. In the US, Donald Trump used a freewheeling press conference on Friday, intended to provide updates on the coronavirus, as an opportunity to attack Democrats, praise his own intelligence, lash out at CNN and spread false and misleading information about the status of the outbreak. Amazon is working to identify and prosecute coronavirus price gougers Amazon.com Inc said on Friday it is working with state attorneys general to identify and prosecute third-party sellers who are taking advantage of fears of the spreading coronavirus to engage in price-gouging on the Amazon website. In a letter to U.S. Senator Edward Markey, the company said it has removed more than 530,000 product offers over price-gouging concerns as well as \u201cmillions\u201d of products that make unsupported claims about their ability to fight coronavirus. Markey wrote Amazon earlier this week asking the company to stop third-party sellers from ramping up prices for items like Purell hand sanitizers as people seek to protect themselves from the coronavirus. Markey said he wrote the letter after finding that a pack of 24 2-ounce bottles of Purell, which should cost $10, was selling for $400 on the company\u2019s website. The number of cases in Japan grew to 1,112 on Friday, with 55 new infections reported from Yamaguchi prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north, according to the national broadcaster NHK. Thirteen of the new cases were people who visited a live music venue in Osaka or their family members, NHK said. The spread of the disease has raised doubts about whether Tokyo will be able to host the Olympics this summer, but the government has insisted the Games will go ahead as scheduled. The number of new cases of the virus fell to 505 in South Korea on Friday, from 760 the previous day, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said authorities had almost finished tests on more than 200,000 followers of a church in southeastern Daegu at the centre of the outbreak. The number of South Korean visitors to Japan fell nearly 26% last year to 5.6 million, the first drop since Japan\u2019s tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese tourism officials say. South Korea said on Friday it would suspend visas and visa waivers for Japan in response to Tokyo\u2019s own travel restrictions on Koreans, as fears over the spreading coronavirus rekindled a feud between the neighbours dating back to before World War Two. South Korea\u2019s curbs, which take effect on Monday, also include special entry procedures for non-Japanese foreigners arriving from Japan, Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young told a briefing. At present, Japanese can visit South Korea for 90 days without a visa. Seoul had earlier summoned the Japanese envoy to protest against Japan\u2019s decision to quarantine South Korean visitors for two weeks. Japan is among almost 100 countries to impose curbs on travellers from South Korea, which has suffered 44 deaths and 6,593 infections in the biggest outbreak outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. In case you missed this story, Victorian health authorities are trying to contact about 70 patients of a Melbourne doctor who has developed coronavirus after returning from the US. The doctor is the state\u2019s 11th case of the novel coronavirus and the state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says he attended work and treated patients after her was symptomatic. \u201cI have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flulike symptoms has presented to work,\u201d Mikakos said. The doctor returned from the US on 29 February and saw approximately 70 patients last week between Monday 2 March and Friday 6 March at the Toorak Clinic on Malvern Road. The clinic has been since closed. Patients have been contacted by text message, phone or email and two patients the doctor treated in a Malvern nursing home have been isolated. All patients the doctor saw and all clinic staff have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. The clinic\u2019s other patients have been asked to monitor their symptoms. Passengers on the flight with the doctor would be contacted, Mikakos said. Twenty-one people aboard a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco have tested positive for coronavirus, U.S. officials said on Friday, as half a dozen states reported their first cases of the fast-spreading respiratory disease. Vice President Mike Pence, who is running the White House\u2019s response to the outbreak, said at a news conference that 19 crew members and two passengers out of 46 people tested so far on the Grand Princess ship had the virus. He said the vessel with about 3,400 passengers and crew would be taken to a non-commercial port where everyone on board would be tested. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would rather have passengers remain on board the vessel, but that he would let others make the decision whether to let the passengers disembark. \u201cI\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off,\u201d Trump told reporters after touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus liveblog. As infections continue to spread around the world, authorities are racing to trace the contacts of confirmed cases. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d.

New Zealand has confirmed its fifth case, a 40-year-old woman who contracted the virus from her husband, who was the country\u2019s third case The UK confirmed its second fatality after tests performed on a man who died on Thursday came back positive. Medical staff and patients at the hospital where he died were placed in isolation amid family fears he was not isolated quickly enough. The first case in Central America was confirmed. Costa Rica said a 49-year-old woman from the United States had been infected with the virus. South by South West was cancelled. The annual technology and culture festival said its March events would not go ahead amid fears it could help to spread the virus in Austin, in Texas.

That actually isn\u2019t unusual \u2013 the government often borrows that amount in the form of a bond issue. What was unusual was the interest rate it is paying \u2013 just 0.8185%. Think on that \u2013 given the current inflation rate is around 1.8%, the government has borrowed $1.2bn dollars at an interest rate that is more than one percentage point below inflation. That is effectively borrowing $1.2bn for free. It highlights just how absurd is the economic debate in this country. The US economist Paul Krugman recently noted that \u201cfor a long period of time elites thought that debt was the greatest threat to the US economy. Now I think we\u2019ve largely come around to the correct view, which is that debt is just not a serious problem for the United States currently\u201d. Neither is it a problem for Australia, and yet our political debate remains stuck in a world where we still act like the government budget is equivalent to that of a household or company. A new paper by progressive think tank The Australia Institute, \u201cThe Budget Surplus Objective: An example of how economics is broken\u201d highlights the folly and cost of this fear of government debt. It\u2019s author, David Richardson, notes that given Australia\u2019s nominal GDP is expected to grow at around 4.5%, if government borrowing pays lower interest than that (as is currently the case) debt levels will fall over time. This is because the economy is growing much faster than is the interest on the debt. It means, to quote Larry Summers, the former chief economist of the World Bank, that \u201cpublic investment is essentially costless \u2013 the classic free lunch\u201d. Consider that back when the Howard government lost the 2007 election, the interest rate for a 10-year government bond was 6.03%; now it is 0.78%. Why on earth would we talk about debt in the same way as then? And given gross debt under Howard and Costello was 4.7% of GDP, compared with the current level of 27.7% of GDP, where is the evidence that higher debt means higher interest rates? Richardson notes that the argument put forward by the government (and many in the media) that \u201ca strong balance sheet provides the government with flexibility to respond to unanticipated events, such as financial crises or economic shocks\u201d is quite false. Such a belief suggests the government is like a company. But Australia cannot become insolvent like a company or bankrupt like an individual. Richardson argues \u201cgovernments do not fail if they cannot achieve sales; they have the power to raise taxes, which no private business can do, and the Australian government has the ability to print legal tender\u201d. The constraint on governments is that if they borrow too much or print too much money their currency will lose value and inflation will rise quickly and so too will the interest rate the government has to pay for its bonds. But inflation growth is now less than half what it was when the Howard government had no net debt and the interest rate is around a tenth of what it was then. Rate of return equals risk and right now the world sees Australian government bonds as essentially without risk. Investors don\u2019t give a damn about our level of government debt. This does not mean any government spending is justifiable, but it means we should not have any concerns about the size of the stimulus the government may undertake to counter the coronavirus. The question should always be about the effectiveness. With luck it will be as effective as the stimulus provided during the GFC. It also means we have absolutely no barrier to decarbonising our economy. The government should be embarking on the mother of all investments in renewable energy. We face a massive challenge, both in the short-term from the coronavirus and in the medium and long-term with climate change.

The current approach of the government and the media coverage of the virus in the UK is having a disproportionate influence on the behaviour of consumers,\u201d he said.Alex Proud of Proud Cabaret, which has venues in London and Brighton, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t look after the entertainment business, it is going to be dead in two months.\u201d However, owners of other attractions, including superclub Fabric in London\u2019s Farringdon, and the Dinerama and Hawker House streetfood venues, said they had yet to see an impact and believed that cold wet weather had been just as influential on people\u2019s plans. Nicholls said the government needed to act quickly to support businesses that were likely to face cash flow problems next month if the drop-off in trade persisted as many would be facing quarterly rent and VAT bills. said the government had anticipated that emergency support for business would not be required until the UK had moved out of the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase of the disease, when it is keeping a lid on the rate of infections. Moving into the next phase \u2013 delay \u2013 could see the introduction of \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures, such as closing schools and halting mass gatherings. \u201cThis is life and death for businesses if they have a downturn in bookings. Government thought that emergency business support would wait,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need it immediately, and it has to be in the budget next week.\u201d She suggested government introduce measures such as a three- to six-month business rate holiday and cut VAT to prompt demand.",

Egyptian officials did not clarify whether a Taiwanese national who tested positive for the virus on return to Taiwan one week ago is the same Taiwanese-American national named as the source of the outbreak on the Nile boat. \u201cOne trip to Egypt was the source of 11 cases out of 20 people\u201d in the French town of La Balme-de-Sillingy, according to Le Monde, and on Friday night, the city of Houston, Texas, announced five cases of the virus, all of whom had participated in a trip to Egypt and then returned to the US in late February. Egypt\u2019s minister of health, Hala Zayed, who recently travelled to China to discuss the outbreak, stated on Friday that 2,166 people in Egypt have tested negative for the virus since January. Egyptian officials have pushed for caution, in a country where tourism accounts for an estimated 11.9% of GDP. Official efforts to contain concern about the spread of coronavirus in Egypt have also increased friction with other Middle Eastern nations. Egypt\u2019s national carrier, Egyptair, suspended flights to Kuwait on Saturday \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, due to the spread of Covid-19 in the country, hours after Kuwait declared it was blocking all flights from seven nations, including Egypt, to \u201cstem the spread of Covid-19 and protect the safety of public health\u201d. Qatar previously blocked entry to Egyptian citizens over the virus, while a Sudanese official from the country\u2019s ministry of health voiced requests from residents in the north of the country to close their border with Egypt as a precaution.",

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will announce an increase from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a35.2bn in spending on flood defences between 2015 and 2021. He will tell MPs that the money will give protection to 336,000 homes in England and allow 2,000 new flood and coastal defence schemes to be built. The announcement will be a centre-piece of Sunak\u2019s first budget, which he is determined will focus not only on measures to combat the spread of coronavirus but also on national infrastructure to reduce risk of flooding in England by 11% by 2027. This follows grave warnings from scientists who have demanded far greater investment and Boris Johnson\u2019s aim to \u201clevel up\u201d the country. Ministers said the extra spending would reduce the needed planning for future disasters, and warned that extreme weather would become far more regular.

But Sunak \u2013 who is expected to delay announcing a far wider national infrastructure strategy until the summer or autumn \u2013 is coming under intense pressure to spend much more on the environment and the climate emergency to ensure the UK meets its climate targets. On Sunday, on the eve of the budget, the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank publishes analysis showing an additional \u00a333bn a year must be spent on measures to tackle the climate crisis if it is to meet its target of cutting carbon emissions to zero by 2050.

The huge sums would not only help tackle climate change but would also deliver an economic boost and help Johnson deliver on his ambition to \u201clevel up\u201d the country, IPPR says.

A week on, Taiwan has reported 45 cases \u2013 29 still active, 15 recovered \u2013 while the UK has 206, with two deaths. Now I am worried about what awaits me when I come home.",

      "bodyText": "A nursing home in Washington state that is at the center of the US coronavirus outbreak on Saturday reported an increased death total for people associated with their facility and said it has only just now received enough kits to test all residents for the virus. During the Life Care Center\u2019s first official press conference since the outbreak began, Tim Killian, the public information liaison for the facility, said that since 19 February, 13 people associated with the center have been diagnosed with coronavirus and died. The center, which is located in Kirkland, Washington, on the outskirts of Seattle, is an acute care facility and typically sees three to seven deaths each month, he noted. Killian said there are still 63 residents at the center, and they are confined to their rooms. There were 120 residents just two weeks ago. As of Saturday, Washington state health officials reported 102 cases of the virus, with 16 deaths in the state. Killian also reported that 70 of their 180 employees have shown symptoms of coronavirus and are not coming in to work. He said at the conference that the facility had received only 45 kits for in-house testing, but in a statement later on Saturday the center said it had been given an additional batch and was in the process of testing all remaining residents. When asked why the facility did not ask for help sooner, Killian said they\u2019ve been asking the local and federal government for \u201chelp every five minutes of every day since this became apparent here within the facility\u201d. Washington state\u2019s health department said a request was made to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 28 February for resources to help with an epidemiological investigation, infection control support and communications. Since then, the department said, 18 CDC employees have arrived, and they along with Seattle &amp; King County Public Health have been providing technical assistance to the center\u2019s staff. The department said it has also provided the facility with an infection control expert, and there is a team of clinicians on site from the US health and human services department. Calling the virus \u201cvolatile\u201d and \u201cunpredictable\u201d, Killian said they\u2019ve seen patients who within an hour have gone from no symptoms to acute symptoms to having to be transferred to a hospital. \u201cWe have seen some results that have frankly concerned us with how quickly symptoms have shown, become acute and led to, even, death in some cases within our residents,\u201d he said.",
