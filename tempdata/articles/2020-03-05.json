      "bodyText": "A M\u0101ori tribe in New Zealand\u2019s capital city has banned the traditional hongi at gatherings this week as more cases of coronavirus emerge. On Wednesday night a third case was confirmed and the ministry of health asked for calm after sufferers and their families were criticised on social media. In Wellington, local iwi (tribe) said a temporary ban would be placed on hongi between members at gatherings this week. A hongi is a traditional form of greeting in which two people press their noses to each other and inhale one another\u2019s breath. Te R\u016bnanga o Te Atiawa chairman Kura Moeahu said other tribes around the country were also grappling with whether to continue using hongi and he had been \u201cinundated\u201d with calls from government agencies seeking cultural advice. \u201cIt\u2019s not a ban \u2013 the word taup\u0101ruru is to actually confine or restrict movement in a certain place \u2026 it\u2019s common sense about when coming into contact with people really,\u201d Moeahu told RNZ. \u201cThat\u2019s not stopping people from doing what they want to do if they choose to do that but from a tikanga [correct] M\u0101ori perspective it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d The ministry of health said it had placed no restrictions on hongi and was leaving it up to iwi to make their own decisions around the issue. The deputy director general of M\u0101ori Health, John Whaanga, said similar concerns were raised about hongi during the Sars outbreak and his office had issued no directives then either. Meanwhile, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) has called for \u201ccalm and restraint\u201d after members one of the New Zealand families affected by the illness were subjected to online abuse. The ARPHS director Dr William Rainger said the family had done everything right and minimised their risk to others by self-isolating at home. \u201cThe woman with the virus has gone straight into isolation with her family when she was told she was suspected of having Covid-19,\u201d Rainger said. \u201cYet they have become the focus of sustained and abusive bullying on social media and are being hounded by the media.\u201d \u201cThere is a high level of anxiety and concern in the school and wider communities, but it is not acceptable to attack people who have been caught up in this global outbreak.

A close contact is defined as someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes with an infected person, or in the same closed space with an infected person for at least two hours without protective gear. Once you remove an infected person and their close contacts from a facility or isolate them in hospital rooms, and disinfect surfaces, there is no longer any ongoing risk of infection. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most sick, so out of caution health authorities trace back an infected person\u2019s close contacts to the day prior to them falling ill.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cCoronavirus is not in the hospital and you will do more harm if you don\u2019t present to the hospital because you\u2019re scared of coronavirus,\u201d Chant said. <br></p> \n  <p>She also made an important point; isolation, testing and quarantine measures are not designed to go on forever. If more widespread community transmission occurs -- and health authorities are preparing for that becoming the case -- the messages to the public and measures taken by health authorities would change, Chant said.<br></p> \n  <p>At the point of community spread, rather than diagnosing every person with symptoms, people who felt sick would be encouraged to stay at home and isolate themselves for 14 days. They would only need to call a doctor if they became worse.They should at that point alert ambulance or health workers on the phone ahead of time so health care workers could put measures in place such as wearing protective gear.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile we have a strong emphasis on testing at this point in time we won\u2019t be if there is community spread at significant levels,\u201d Chant said. \u201cIt\u2019s important the community understands the message will change depending on the circumstances. It\u2019s not because we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We ask that the community follows our messages.\u201d</p> \n  <p>There is still no need for members of the community to change their behaviour.

That\u2019s not quite the bounce that we saw on Wall Street where the Dow surged 4.53%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.22% and the Nasdaq rose 3.85%. But it will give investorts some cheer. That\u2019s it for the day on this blog but you can follow what happens with the virus story and the markets with a new blog that my colleague Helen Sullivan has just launched to take us through the next 24 hours or so. You can read that here: Still with the airline industry and Reuters reports that Donald Trump met executives from some of America\u2019s leading airlines to discuss the coronavirus outbreak. The airline bosses told the president they have stepped up procedures to keep planes \u201cclean and disinfected\u201d amid concerns about the the spread of the virus. Executives from Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue, among others, attended the meeting at the White House with Trump, vice president Mike Pence and other officials. Trump said airlines would be affected by the fall in international travel related to the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the airline business, as it would. And a lot of people are staying in our country and they\u2019re shopping and using our hotels in this country, so from that standpoint I think probably there\u2019s a positive impact, but there\u2019s also an impact on overseas travel which will be fairly substantial,\u201d Trump said. The airline executives said the industry was taking measures to intensify aircraft sanitation. \u201cWe\u2019ve stepped up our efforts to make sure the airplanes are clean and disinfected,\u201d said Southwest Airlines boss Gary Kelly. The struggling airline Flybe is set to collapse within hours, according to the Press Association. We reported earlier that the regional carrier, which narrowly avoided going bust in January, was on the brink of bankruptcy again thanks to a drop in demand caused by the coronavirus. But an airline source has told PA that it is expected to enter administration overnight after talks on Wednesday failed to secure a rescue package. Here\u2019s our story from transport correspondent Gwyn Topham: Here\u2019s a summary of the most recent developments: It was confirmed that two more people had died in the USA, bringing the total there to 11. They included the first person from outside Washington state to die, as well as another person within Washington. There was further deaths and cases in other nations across the world. Local authorities in Iraq said two people had died. In Stockholm, officials said 16 new cases had been identified, taking the Swedish total to 52 and Algerian authorities said 16 members of the same family had now tested positive. Other nations, including Slovenia and Hungary, identified their first cases. Sporting events in Italy are to be held behind closed doors for a month, the local government ordered. The events will include England\u2019s Six Nations match against Italy and a host of Serie A games. All events inside the \u201cred zone\u201d are cancelled altogether. Two recent patients at Kings College hospital, in south London, tested positive. The hospital was not allowing visitors on to the wards where the patients were being treated, the Guardian understands. A British woman was among two more confirmed cases in Senegal, local authorities said. The nation\u2019s health ministry identified her as a 33-year-old from London who arrived in Senegal on 24 February. A family of four in Ireland tested positive, bringing the number of confirmed cases on the island to nine. They included six cases in the Republic of Ireland and three in Northern Ireland. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier news here. A tourist in Darwin in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory has tested positive for coronavirus. It is the first confirmed case in the territory, which contains hundreds of remote communities. The 52-year-old man carrying the virus is in isolation in Royal Darwin Hospital. The man recently arrived in Darwin from Sydney and has had limited contact with the local community, NT Health said in a statement. The department was undertaking contact tracing and would reach out to those who may have been in contact with the man, the statement said. Stock markets have continued to rally at the opening of Thursday\u2019s trrading session in Asia Pacific. The Australian benchmark ASX200 index is up almost 2% this morning after losing more than 10% from its all-time highs in the past 10 days. All sectors were up but tech shares led the way with a rise of 3%. and follows a strong shjowing on Wall Street in Wednesday\u2019s session. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney said a number of factors were behind the big lift and that it was not just theresult of the US Fed\u2019s rate cut on Tuesday. A Congressional spending package, the rise of Joe Biden and stronger than forecast data lifted US optimism and sent stocks soaring. Major share indices leapt 4% overnight. Bonds sold off, gold prices eased and industrial commodities lifted. The US dollar rose against the yen and euro, but commodity currencies lifted further. Asia Pacific futures markets indicate the optimism will flow into today\u2019s trading. Saudi Arabia has identified a new case, its health ministry has announced in a statement published by the state news agency. The kingdom said the person in question was travelling with another already known to have been infected and that both had come from Iran via Bahrain; a fact the second person had not initially disclosed. The ministry confirmed the new case is quarantined in hospital and that everyone who interacted with him has been tested, though no results have yet been obtained. Kings College hospital has confirmed that two recent patients have tested positive. A spokesman for the south London hospital has said: The trust has had two recent patients who have tested positive for Covid-19. We have strict protocols in place to manage the control of infection and to reduce the possibility of cross-infection, and this includes restricting access for staff and visitors to the ward. Public Health England experts are carrying out contact tracing and will be in touch with individuals who may have been exposed to the virus to provide them with advice. For anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus, call 111 or visit here as the first port of call. The two patients at Kings College hospital are among the 87 already confirmed cases in the UK \u2013 not additional to them. A generally available coronavirus vaccine is unlikely to be available within the next 12 months, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said. Discussing the timeframe and feasibility of making such available to everyone in the country on this evening\u2019s edition of ITV\u2019s Peston programme, Sir Patrick Vallance says: I think a vaccine that can be used generally, we\u2019d be very lucky to get one within a year ... Clearly, what you\u2019d tend to do with a vaccine if you\u2019ve got an effective vaccine \u2013 and there\u2019s a whole question about how much of it you can manufacture and how much you can make available \u2013 but what you tend to do is protect the most vulnerable first and then grow it as you need to. And the same principle\u2019s taken with influenza vaccination. Asked if he feels it\u2019s time to move from the containment phase to the delay phase on managing the spread, Vallance says: This is clearly a global thing, it\u2019s not unique to the UK and, therefore, part of this is when the World Health Organisation decides that it moved from contain to delay because that should ideally be a global response. Failing that, we\u2019re keeping an eye on when we think we do reach that stage and we\u2019ll make that decision, ideally with other countries as well. As we reported earlier, Vallance is due to advise UK government minsters on their response on Thursday. Peston is due to air at 10.45pm GMT and is broadcast live on Twitter shortly beforehand. The US House of Representatives has approved an $8.3bn (\u00a37.3bn) funding bill to combat the spread of coronavirus, sending the emergency legislation to the Senate. The measure, which passed by 415 votes to two, funds a series of US government-sponsored initiatives, including expanded testing for the virus that has infected at least 129 people in the nation. The Senate is expected to take up the bill quickly and send it to the US president, Donald Trump, to be signed into law this week. Iraq has seen its second coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said in a statement published by the state news agency. It added that the patient lived in Baghdad and suffered from other chronic conditions. Slovenia has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, the local health ministry says. The patient travelled to the country from Morocco, through neighbouring Italy, and is now in a Ljubljana hospital, the Slovenian national news agency STA reported. So far, Slovenia has performed 352 coronavirus tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), which is chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, is due to meet on Thursday. The group provides scientific and technical recommendations to government, though Whitehall sources have stressed to the Press Association that the decision on whether or not to change from the contain to the delay phase in dealing with coronavirus would rest with ministers. A family of four in the Republic of Ireland has tested positive for coronavirus, raising the number of confirmed cases in the country to six and the number on the island of Ireland to nine. The two males and two females, who live in the west of Ireland, were all \u201cassociated\u201d with recent travel to northern Italy, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has announced. Two cases were confirmed in Northern Ireland earlier on Wednesday, raising the number of confirmed cases there to three. Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer with Ireland\u2019s department of health, said there was still no evidence of widespread or sustained community transmission in the country, as seen elsewhere in the EU. While we now have six confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland, we continue our containment efforts, central to which is that the public know what to do in the event they have symptoms. Paul Reid, the head of its Health Service Executive, said it was still in a containment phase but planning for all eventualities. From what we are learning however as we see how the virus spreads in countries across Europe and in the UK we are facing a potentially unprecedented situation in this country and across all of our health services. A worker at Google\u2019s European headquarters in Dublin who had flu-like symptoms tested negative for coronavirus, prompting the tech giant to tell staff they can safely return to the office after two days of working from home. Senegalese authorities have reported two new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to four since the first case was confirmed there on Monday, Reuters reports. The nation\u2019s health ministry have identified one of the patients as a 33-year-old British woman from London who arrived in Senegal on 24 February. The ministry said the other is the 68-year-old wife of the 80-year-old Frenchman from a Paris suburb whose case was confirmed on Wednesday. The couple arrived in Senegal on 29 February. Both new patients are in stable condition at a hospital in Dakar and the two earlier patients\u2019 conditions are \u201cevolving favourably\u201d, it said. Senegal is the only sub-Saharan African country besides Nigeria to have confirmed cases of the virus. Experts say it is not yet clear why sub-Saharan African countries have registered so few cases of the virus, which could challenge fragile health systems on the continent. All professional football matches and other big sporting events are to be held behind closed doors until 3 April due to the outbreak, the Italian sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora has said. The behind-closed-doors order does not apply to fixtures within the \u201cred zone\u201d, which are suspended.* On Tuesday, the Juventus and Milan\u2019s Italian Cup semi-final second leg match was postponed. The match was meant to be held on Wednesday night and would have followed the 1-1 first-leg draw in Milan\u2019s San Siro. Authorities have also announced the postponement of the other semi-final second leg between Napoli and Inter Milan. The upcoming derby d\u2019Italia, the name given to a match contested by Inter and Juve, is set to be played on Sunday or Monday. In the regions worst hit by the emergency, such as Lombardy, theatres and cinemas will also remain closed. *We originally reported such fixtures would go ahead behind closed doors. This post has been amended to reflect that they will not. Washington state, the hardest-hit in the union thus far, has confirmed the death of another person, taking the toll there from nine to 10, while the first death outside that state has also been announced. According to Reuters, the local health agency in Placer County, in California, has said a resident has died. That is alongside those in the greater Seattle area, which has also seen 12 new cases; taking the total there to 39, the local department of health has said. This is now backed up by a report in the Gazzetta di Parma newspaper. It says a draft order will go even further and decree that all sporting events in the \u201cred zone\u201d will be cancelled altogether, while those outside it will be played behind closed doors. It appears all sporting events in Italy will become behind-closed-doors fixtures for 30 days, until 3 April. Besides numerous rounds of domestic professional football fixtures, that would also cover the Italy v England Six Nations match a week on Saturday (14 March), though this has not yet been confirmed. The number of cases in Algeria has increased by nine to 17, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. They include 16 from the same family in the Blida province, about 30km south of the capital Algiers, as well as an Italian man. Sixteen new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Stockholm, according to local authorities, taking the total number of cases in Sweden to 52. Region Stockholm said: Sixteen additional patients were found infected with Covid-19 ... The infected patients are being cared for in isolation to reduce the risk of further transmission. The causes of four of the 31 confirmed cases in the Stockholm region remain under investigation, as \u2013 unlike the rest of the cases \u2013 no clear link to infection abroad or contact with people who had been infected abroad was found, the authority said. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has confirmed the nation\u2019s first two cases, saying each involves an Iranian student. Writing on his Facebook page, he said: We have the first infected individual, or rather two right away, whom we had to hospitalise. They have no symptoms yet but the fact of the infection has been confirmed. Iran has been one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus outside China. According to Reuters, the students had travelled home for the Iranian new year, and one of them reported for a health check once back in Hungary to make sure he was not infected, Janos Szlavik, the head of the national institute for infectious diseases, said. Szlavik declined to say which school the students attend. The wife of one of the students and the girlfriend of the other were isolated, he said, adding that Hungary was assessing their movements before the diagnosis and any risk of further contagion. Iraq has announced its first coronavirus death. The country\u2019s health ministry said the person died in the capital, Baghdad, according to the Reuters news agency. France now has 285 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the head of the public health service, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, has said, which is an increase of 73 compared to a day earlier. During a press briefing, he added that the death toll was still at four people and that 15 were in intensive care. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have discussed the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, Downing Street said. A spokeswoman said: They discussed the coronavirus epidemic and the prime minister updated the president on the UK\u2019s four-strand approach to contain the virus, delay its spread, research its origins and cure and mitigate the impact should the virus become more widespread. The two leaders agreed to work together on an international response to combat the spread of coronavirus. The people who have tested positive in Northern Ireland did not travel through the Republic, the latter\u2019s chief medical officer believes. Two new cases have been confirmed north of the border, bringing the total there to three and the number in the UK to 87. Perhaps more pertinently, it brings the number on the island to five. Speaking at a press briefing in Dublin, Tony Holohan said: The contact tracing process has only begun. We have not been alerted to any cross-border aspect in terms of that contact tracing. It is still quite early in the contact tracing process so it is still possible, but there are no indications as of yet. He added that there was no reason to cancel the St Patrick\u2019s Day parade due to take place in the Irish capital. As things stand and on the basis of our assessment, we see no implications for the St Patrick\u2019s Day parade. \u2022 The Italian government has ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March as it grapples to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus that has claimed 107 lives, an increase of 28 in 24 hours. \u201cWe are focussed on taking all measures for direct containment or delaying the spread of the virus,\u201d the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said during a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cThe health system risks going into overload, and we will have a problem with intensive care if an exponential crisis continues.\u201d \u2022 The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has jumped by more than 60% to 87 cases, in the biggest daily increase recorded to date. They include three who contracted the disease without travelling abroad, confirming fears that community transmission is already occurring in the UK and that attempts to contain the virus have at least partly failed. \u2022 The coronavirus outbreak has led India to restrict the export of dozens of drugs including paracetamol and various antibiotics, leading to fears of a global shortage of essential medicines. On Tuesday, concerns over supply chain shortages led the Indian government to place limits on the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines and vitamins made from them. \u2022 Fears of a coronavirus-driven global economic slowdown have mounted after stock markets gave a lukewarm reaction to the emergency cut in US interest rates and new data showed that China and Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill in February. As the World Health Organization warned that panic buying and market manipulation was \u201crapidly depleting\u201d supplies of protective equipment, world leaders and central banks continued their scramble to cushion the economic impact of the outbreak. \u2022 Schools and universities are being closed and concerts, conferences and sporting events cancelled around the globe. Cancelled events have included the London Book Fair, while MGM Universal has announced the postponement of the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die. The organisers of Britain\u2019s Cheltenham Festival expect the number of people attending the showcase horse racing event to be down this year because of concerns over the coronavirus. A record-breaking 266,000 people attended the four-day event in Gloucestershire last year but the Jockey Club, which runs the event, said ticket sales were slowing. The festival is bringing in a raft of measures to try to keep racegoers healthy including increasing the number of toilets and hand-washing stations. But any significant reduction in crowds would be a huge blow to Cheltenham and surrounding areas, which rely on the festival for a multi-million pound boost each year. Ian Renton, regional director for the Jockey Club, said the festival, which is due to begin on Tuesday, had taken part in numerous discussions over the past week with both the government and the racing industry. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to hear the messages the government has put out suggesting there will be no immediate change to business as usual. \u201cOn that basis we\u2019re proceeding and looking forward to a great festival and are taking steps to make sure we have got systems in place to make sure hygiene is at its maximum.\u201d The festival is setting up additional toilets and hand-washing facilities and extra staff will operate in all toilet areas to ensure that soap and drying facilities are constantly available. The release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, will be postponed until November 2020, MGM Universal have announced. Schools and universities in Italy will close from Thursday until 15 March, Italian authorities have announced. The number of confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for coronavirus in Italy has risen to 107 from 79, Italian authorities have said. The number of confirmed cases in Italy is more than 3,000. As we reported earlier, Italy\u2019s government is set to close cinemas and theatres and ban public events across the whole country to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, according to a draft decree drawn up on Wednesday. The decree, seen by Reuters, orders \u201cthe suspension of events of any nature... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.\u201d The Italian education minister, Lucia Azzolina, has said that the decision to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March - reported by the Italian news agency Ansa and several local outlets - has not yet been taken but will be decided \u201cin the next few hours\u201d. Health authorities and the energy company EDF are attempting to trace people who may have been in contact with a worker based in south-west England who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning to China. The 35-year-old Chinese national, who has been based in Somerset, left the UK after concluding a placement with the energy firm. He developed symptoms of Covid-19 two days later and was confirmed to have the virus on 1 March. Public Health England said: \u201cAuthorities in China report that the person did not have symptoms while in the UK, so the risk to other people in the UK is considered to be very low.\u201d It is understood that the man had been in the UK for a number of months before returning to China. Information posted online by Chinese authorities said the man flew with Cathay Pacific from London to Hong Kong on 27 February. He then took a ferry to China, at which time his temperature was normal, and then travelled in a taxi to his home in Futian district. The man developed symptoms on 29 February and was taken to hospital, then placed in isolation. He tested positive for Covid-19 at 12.40am on 1 March, Chinese authorities said. A cross-party group of MPs has asked the British government to adopt a \u201cflexible approach\u201d to social security rules to ensure people on welfare benefits or low incomes are not penalised if they self-isolate in line with official coronavirus guidance and are unable to work or look for jobs. The House of Commons Work and Pensions select committee said no one following public health advice should face an \u201cinvidious choice\u201d between financial hardship and putting themselves and others at risk. In a letter to the work and pensions secretary, Therese Coffey, the committee chair, Stephen Timms, wrote: \u201cI hope you will agree that the exceptional circumstances of this outbreak necessitate a flexible response from the DWP. To contain the spread of the virus, it is vital that those required to self-isolate are not deterred from doing so due to the threat of sanctions or loss of income.\u201d People who claim unemployment benefit or low-paid workers who claim in-work benefits through universal credit are required to meet stringent requirements to access welfare payments, known as claimant commitments. These include attending regular job centre meetings and providing proof they have been searching for jobs or seeking better-paid work. Claimants who are deemed to have failed to meet those requirements can be subject to financial penalties including the suspension of welfare payments for between four weeks and six months. Although the DWP says sanctions are applied as a last resort - and that claimants will not be penalised if they contact officials to explain why they cannot meet their claimant commitment - there is lots of evidence that the much-criticised sanctions have been applied capriciously or for trivial reasons, leaving claimants penniless and reliant on food banks. In England, three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Trafford, Manchester, and in Oldham, Greater Manchester. Trafford Council website said the three in its area were people who had travelled to northern Italy. Two further positive cases of the coronavirus have been detected in Northern Ireland, including one adult who recently travelled from northern Italy. The other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who has subsequently tested positive, health officials at the Northern Ireland Executive told the Press Association. The results are being sent to England for verification. As schools, universities and events are closed, cancelled and postponed around Europe, the Guardian\u2019s John Henley has written this wrap. It includes: France A total of 257 confirmed cases and four deaths. Thirteen regions affected. Four main clusters so far: Oise in northern France (64 cases), Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan in Brittany (12 cases); the fourth relates to a group of tourists who took part in an organised visit to Egypt (11 cases), while five members of the same family caught the virus after attending an evangelical church service at Mulhouse in eastern France. Italy By far the worst European outbreak: 2,502 confirmed cases so far and 79 deaths. The virus has spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, with the majority of cases (1520) in Lombardy, followed by Emilia-Romagna (420) and Veneto (307). Most Italian regions have under 50 confirmed cases. Two groups of Italian tourists were under quarantine in India today, with 16 testing positive for the coronavirus, prompting authorities to tighten controls. Health minister Harsh Vardhan said that passengers on all international flights would now be screened, the AFP news agency reported. Visitors from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan - except diplomats and officials from international bodies - were already barred, on Tuesday, along with those from China last month. Vardhan said a husband and wife in the first Italian group - who arrived last month and number around 20 - fell ill while visiting the western state of Rajasthan, a popular tourist destination. The remainder were moved to a quarantine centre in New Delhi, where 14 members plus their Indian driver were confirmed as being infected. This seems to be emerging a bit of a trend. Footage has appeared showing Iranian health workers dancing and singing in an effort to keep morale up as the country faces the worst coronavirus outbreak outside China. This was the scene in China meanwhile... The World Health Organization (WHO) has been running a live question and answer session online. The latest figures in the UK \u2013 where the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has jumped to 85 \u2013 do not suggest the country is past the stage where the containment approach is no longer valuable, according to a senior microbiology expert. Prof Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, was speaking after authorities said the number of coronavirus cases in the UK had jumped by 60% to 85, the biggest daily increase recorded to date. He said: \u201cToday\u2019s increase in numbers represents a three times greater increase in new cases per day than we\u2019ve seen in the last few days. However, most are associated with known cases or have history of foreign travel. \u201cThree of the cases appear to have no such contacts \u2013 this is further evidence that the infection is spreading in the community. \u201cHowever, the latest case numbers do not suggest we are past the stage where the containment approach is no longer valuable. Even though the increase looks dramatic, it should not alter our strategy at the moment.\u201d While Britain\u2019s Department of Health has said it will no longer tweet details of the locations of new coronavirus cases, some local authorities are doing so on what appears to be an ad hoc basis. Two new cases are in Lancashire and Newcastle upon Tyne respectively. In both areas, details were provided in the form of video messages from health officials. Update: Derbyshire county council says two further cases were confirmed in its area, bringing the county total to three. Twitter has said it will stop any attempt by advertisers to use the coronavirus outbreak to send inappropriate advertisements to its users. Government entities seeking to spread public health information will be allowed to promote epidemic-related ads, the company said in a blog post. It added that Twitter\u2019s \u201cglobal trust &amp; safety team\u201d was \u201ccontinuing its zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to abuse our service at this critical juncture\u201d. It added: \u201cAt present, we\u2019re not seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues. \u201cHowever, we will remain vigilant and have invested substantially in our proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviours.\u201d Russia has been targeted from abroad by foes spreading fake news about the coronavirus to sow panic, according to President Vladimir Putin. His remarks came as Russia\u2019s communications regulator said it had shut down access to some social media posts containing falsehoods about the outbreak. \u201cThe federal security service reports that they [the fakes] are mainly being organised from abroad. But unfortunately this always happens to us,\u201d Putin said on Wednesday, in televised remarks at a government meeting. \u201cThe purpose of such fakes is clear: to sow panic among the population.\u201d Reuters reports that a Russian cybersecurity company, Group-IB, on Monday identified what it said were thousands of fake news posts on messaging services and social networks such as Russia\u2019s VK alleging that thousands of Muscovites had caught the virus. Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round \u201cumrah\u201d pilgrimage amid fears of the new coronavirus spreading to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to the country\u2019s interior ministry. The state had decided \u201cto suspend umrah temporarily for citizens and residents in the kingdom\u201d, the ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi press agency. China\u2019s ambassador to Ireland has urged Irish authorities to make a speedy decision on mass gatherings, the Irish Times reports. While declining to say whether events such as St Patrick\u2019s Day parades should be cancelled, He Xiangdong said: \u201cThe authorities here in Ireland need to take the very smart and quick and cautious, while at the same time reasonable decision in terms of that [mass gatherings]. \u201cOur own experience is that [at] the early stage we needed to make some hard decisions in terms of if the mass gatherings needed to be held or not.\u201d The comments of the ambassador, speaking at a reception in Cork, come after the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said his government would not be advising the cancellation of St Patrick\u2019s Day parades at this stage. Prof John Oxford, a virologist from Queen Mary, University of London, has said it would not be the end of the world if the event, which draws hundreds of thousands of domestic and overseas visitors to Dublin, was cancelled or at the very least postponed. \u201cIf I were in their shoes I would say \u2018we must postpone it\u2019, it\u2019s not the end of the world for one year,\u201d he told RTE Radio 1. \u201cAfter all the Chinese postponed the Chinese new year, which is immense.\u201d Global business travel \u2013 and airline profits \u2013 are in deep trouble from coronavirus if the evidence offered at London City airport on a weekday morning is indicative of the sector\u2019s travails. On Wednesday, the business travel-dominated airport in the shadow of Canary Wharf had as many check-in staff as there were passengers, with customers reporting a decline in demand from European hubs such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt. The Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge spoke to travellers at London City and has filed this report. A man travelling through Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport has been put in quarantine in a portable room on a fire department parking lot after testing positive for the new coronavirus. The municipality of Haarlemmermeer, where Schiphol is located just outside the Dutch capital, set up six of the rooms last week as the virus began to spread across Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of portable container-like room with a door, window, toilet and shower,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Haarlemmermeer, Petra Faber. A Northern Ireland hospital is planning to send Covid-19 patients to England for treatment. Antrim Area hospital is ready for drive-through testing for the virus and expects patients will receive results within four hours. Dr Seamus O\u2019Reilly, medical director for the Northern health and social care trust, said: \u201cIf the test comes back positive there is a very well-rehearsed process that we do in conjunction with our colleagues in England.\u201d Italian football authorities look set to order Serie A to play matches behind closed doors as the country struggles to control the coronavirus outbreak. Following a series of postponements, including this week\u2019s Coppa Italia semi-finals, Italian football is facing a backlog of fixtures as the virus spreads. This has prompted the head of the Italian FA to suggest playing matches without crowds is an increasing likelihood. \u201cWe are heading towards that decision,\u201d Vincenzo Spadafora told reporters when asked if the government was thinking of barring fans. \u201cWe will continue all activities, and so will the league, but we will respect public health.\u201d The quarantined dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong could be the first case of human-to-animal transmission, animal health experts in Hong Kong have said, although they cautioned that the matter remained under investigation. The agriculture, fisheries and conservation department (AFCD) said a pet dog had repeatedly tested weak positive for the virus, which indicates a low level of infection. The AFCD added in a statement that it first collected samples from the dog for tests on 26 February and detected low levels of Covid-19 virus from its nasal and oral cavity samples on 27 February. Tests were repeated on 28 February and 2 March. There are now six confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York state, including four new cases today, according to the state\u2019s governor Andrew Cuomo. The wife, son, daughter and neighbour of a coronavirus patient in Westchester have tested positive. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York State, is giving a press conference. Follow live here: Italy\u2019s government is set to close cinemas and theatres and ban public events across the whole country to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, according to a draft decree drawn up on Wednesday. The decree, seen by Reuters, orders \u201cthe suspension of events of any nature... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.\u201d It also tells Italians to avoid hugging and shaking hands to prevent as much as possible a further spread of the potentially deadly illness which has been mainly concentrated in the country\u2019s northern regions. There was some confusion earlier when the Italian news agency Ansa said schools and universities were to close in Italy until mid-March as the country battles to control the coronavirus. Italian education minister Lucia Azzolina said that the decision had not yet been taken but would be decided \u201cin the next few hours\u201d. Global calls are mounting for restrictions to prevent the panic-buying of protective health equipment amid concern over shortages, as the World Health Organization called on governments and industry to increase production by 40% to help counter the spread of the coronavirus. As France issued a decree to requisition masks for key health workers and those suffering from the disease, other countries warned that stocks of masks and other equipment were running low in some of the worst-affected locations, with suppliers unable to meet demand. French health officials say around 8,300 masks and 1,200 bottles of sanitising health gel have been stolen from Paris hospitals. Another 2,000 surgery masks have disappeared from a hospital in Marseille. The French government said it would take legal measures to rein in the soaring price being demanded for bottles of hand gel. Exacerbating the problem around the world is the fact that China, which has been worst-affected by the coronavirus, is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of protective masks for medical use, producing half of the masks used around the globe. India\u2019s top pharmaceuticals export group has said that an Indian government curb on some drug exports as the coronavirus outbreak spreads has caused panic in Europe and will \u201cseverely impact\u201d businesses in the sector. The world\u2019s main supplier of generic drugs has restricted the export of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and the medicines made from them, in a move seen as aimed at tackling possible domestic shortages of medicine during the outbreak. Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil), told Reuters that some of the restricted APIs and medicines were widely exported to Europe and the United States. \u201cI am getting a huge number of calls from Europe because it is very sizeably dependent on Indian formulations and we control almost 26% of the European formulations in the generic space. So they are panicking,\u201d Dua said. Israel\u2019s chief rabbi has advised Jews to forego the traditional touching of the \u201cmezuzah\u201d, a decorative case containing a small holy scroll that is attached to many doorposts in the country. In an advisory published on Wednesday, the rabbi, David Lau, said there was no religious obligation to carry out the practice, and it was enough for Jews to reflect on the scroll\u2019s message when entering or leaving a home. The handwritten parchment contains the Biblical \u201cShema\u201d prayer verse that declares: \u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One.\u201d \u201cDuring these days, when we are witness to the spread of a serious disease, there is no doubt that one should not kiss the mezuzah or touch it at all,\u201d Lau wrote. Slowing growth will hit poorest countries hardest, the World Bank president, David Malpass, has said, as the institution announced it was making $12bn available to provide immediate support to low-income countries dealing with the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus. Malpass added that the money would go to helping developing nations strengthen their health systems, which are fighting an epidemic that has already spread to more than 60 countries. \u201cThe point is to move fast,\u201d Malpass told reporters. \u201cSpeed is needed to save lives.\u201d EU officials in Brussels have been alerted to a second possible case of coronavirus infection within the bloc\u2019s institutions. Staff in the EU council have been advised that an unnamed colleague has fallen ill and \u201cappropriate cleaning\u201d was being undertaken in the relevant offices in Brussels. Earlier in the day, the European Defence Agency confirmed that a member of staff had been diagnosed with the virus. It appears that the virus has caused the the first cancellations by a major sport in the United States. The Chicago State University men\u2019s basketball team will not travel for two regularly scheduled Western Athletic Conference games this week, and its women\u2019s team will not host two games. The school said in a statement it was making the move with the \u201chealth and wellbeing of the campus community in mind\u201d. The university said the men\u2019s team would not travel to Seattle University or Utah Valley University for Western Athletic Conference games on Thursday and Saturday. The school also said the women\u2019s team would not host Seattle or Utah Valley at the campus\u2019 Jones Convocation Center on the same days It looks like the (already troubled) British airline FlyBe risks becoming one of the first airlines to succumb to the turbulence being thrown up by the new coronavirus. Sky News and ITV have both been reporting that it is warning that it is running out of funds. Britain\u2019s Department of Health added that it would no longer be tweeting information on the location of each new case from today, due to the number of new cases. \u201cInstead, this information will be released centrally in a consolidated format online, once a week. We are working on this now and plan to share on Friday.\u201d The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has jumped by 34 in a day, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 85. The Department for Health said the figures included 32 new patients in England. The department added in a statement: \u201cTwenty-nine patients were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. \u201cThree additional patients contracted the virus in the UK and it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. \u201cThe total number of confirmed cases in England is now 80. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases is 85.\u201d Health officials in France say around 8,300 masks and 1,200 bottles of sanitising health gel have been stolen from Paris hospitals. Another 2,000 surgery masks have disappeared from a hospital in Marseilles. The French government says it will take legal measures to rein in the soaring prices being demanded for bottles of hand gel. Anyone wanting to buy masks from a pharmacy will have to get a medical prescription. The German airline Lufthansa has grounded 150 aircraft due to the coronavirus (as first reported by Reuters). A spokeswoman told the Guardian that 125 of the grounded planes were continental and 25 were intercontinental. Lufthansa has 752 aircraft according to its website so this amounts to approximately a fifth of its fleet. Earlier, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged to look into reports that airlines were flying half empty planes around the world just to retain lucrative slots under international allocation rules after a drop in demand for air travel. The Italian education minister, Lucia Azzolina, has said that the decision to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March - reported by the Italian news agency Ansa and several local outlets - has not yet been taken but will be decided \u201cin the next few hours\u201d. A 95-year-old woman who died in a Sydney hospital on Tuesday night has been confirmed to have had coronavirus, the second death from Covid-19 in Australia, according to Nine News Melbourne. Another person has tested positive for the coronavirus in England. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said a person who was admitted to Wythenshawe hospital had tested positive for the coronavirus. He said: The hospital remains open and we would ask that people keep their appointments and attend unless they are unwell. Please note the risk from the virus for the majority of people is low. The trust has strict protocols in place to manage the control of infection and to reduce the possibility of cross-infection. Public Health England (PHE) experts were carrying out contact tracing and would be in touch with anyone who may have been exposed to the virus, the spokesman said. The total number of known cases in the UK now stands at 54. It was 51 at the end of Tuesday (48 in England and one each in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) but two new cases were announced in Scotland earlier today. The daily update on total infections in the UK is expected at 2pm. The Italian government had already shut schools and universities in the worst-affected regions in northern Italy some 10 days ago and quarantined towns at the centre of the outbreak. However, it has struggled to contain the virus, with more than 2,500 people infected. All schools and universities are to close in Italy until mid-March as the country battles to control the coronavirus. The Italian news agency ANSA says the decision was taken at a meeting by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, with his cabinet. There have been 79 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, the third highest after China and Iran. Update: Italian Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said that the decision has not yet been taken but would be decided \u201cin the next few hours\u201d. Saudi Arabia has temporarily suspended Umrah pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina for Saudi citizens and the kingdom\u2019s other residents due to coronavirus concerns, the state news agency SPA said today. The kingdom had already closed its two holiest sites to foreign travellers. Britain\u2019s prime minister has pledged to look into reports that airlines are flying half empty planes around the world simply to secure lucrative slots under international allocation rules after a drop in demand for air travel. Boris Johnson said he was unaware of it when a backbench Conservative MP, Paul Maynard, asked him if he knew that airlines were flying the planes due to \u201cperverse incentives\u201d for them not to lose the slots. \u201cWill he seek a derogation for the UK from these international rules, if only for the sake of the environment?\u201d asked Maynard during questions in parliament. Johnson replied: \u201cI will look at it. It certainly seems crazy that planes should be flying simply to retain the slots to which they are entitled and we will see what we can do.\u201d Bill and Melinda Gates have paid for 15,000 medicinal molecules to be shipped to a leading laboratory in Belgium to be tested as a potential cure for the coronavirus. The therapeutic samples, all active ingredients in current antiviral treatments, will be screened at high speed for their inhibiting effect on particles developed from a swab from the first Belgian patient to be diagnosed. The molecules, from the Scripps research institute in California, will be shipped to the Rega Institute for Medical Research, in Leuven, 20 miles (32km) east of Brussels. The Scripps institute has an extensive collection of the active ingredients of existing or in-development drugs. With Covid-19 now spanning at least 79 countries, with more than 3,100 deaths, the Guardian has produced these maps on how the virus is spreading Brighton College, an independent day and boarding school in south-east England, is one of many schools borrowing from Hong Kong and Japan and preparing to switch to virtual learning for its pupils in the event of school closures, which it plans to trial next week. Richard Cairns, Brighton College\u2019s headmaster, has written to parents at the Sussex school: Clearly, the prospect of any school closure is a matter of great concern for those approaching public examinations and for all of our pupils whose education would be disrupted. As a consequence, we have for some time been exploring the use of online teaching and learning platforms for such an eventuality, drawing on the experience of schools in Hong Kong and Japan where schools have been closed for some time. We are now confident that we have an appropriate and impressive educational platform that will enable us to offer a meaningful programme of lessons, marking and feedback. In consequence, I have decided that all the schools of Brighton College will have a training day on Friday 13 March. There is no case of the coronavirus at Brighton College nor among anyone associated with it. There is some confusion in Thailand over what quarantine measures are being introduced for people travelling from countries hit by the coronavirus. On Tuesday, the country\u2019s public health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, posted an order on his official Facebook page stating that people arriving from Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, France, Singapore, Italy and Iran would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. But hours later the post disappeared, and the minister\u2019s Facebook page appeared to have been deactivated. A ministry spokesperson said that a correction was being made and that an updated announcement would appear soon. This is yet to materialise. This isn\u2019t Anutin\u2019s first comms slip-up. Last month, he caused controversy by stating that foreigners who refused to wear face masks should be kicked out of the country \u2013 a comment that contradicted health advice given elsewhere, and which many speculated was unhelpful given the country\u2019s tourism crisis. Thailand\u2019s ministry of public health has since stated that it is only necessary to wear a mask if you are a healthcare worker or if you are sick. Sony has sent staff at European offices, including London, home for the rest of the week. No cases have been detected but the move has been taken as a precaution. The Scottish government has now released more information about the two further patients in Scotland have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases across the country to three. One patient is resident in the Grampian area, the second patient is resident in the Ayrshire area. One patient has recently travelled to northern Italy and the other has had contact with a known positive case \u2013 but the Scottish government added that this contact was not with the first positive case confirmed in Scotland, a Tayside resident. Both patients are \u201ccurrently clinically well and are receiving appropriate clinical care\u201d. There have been a total of 914 negative test results in Scotland since the start of the outbreak. All 1,150 students at a high school in Israel, plus the members of an elementary school class in a different school, have been instructed by the government\u2019s health ministry to self-quarantine at home. The instructions come after a teenager and a 5th-grade teacher were diagnosed with the coronavirus, the Times of Israel reports. Football fans who sat in a particular area at a Tel Aviv match last week have also been told to go into isolation. Plans are being brought forward to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the very first day someone is sick instead of four days, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told MPs. \u201cI think that is the right thing. Nobody should be penalised for doing the right thing,\u201d he told parliament, in answer to a question about people who are self-isolating at home. Johnson was described by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, as \u201cour part-time prime minister\u201d after criticism that it had taken some time for Johnson to emerge before appearing to launch the government\u2019s action plan on the virus. The Labour leader said a decade of austerity under the Conservative government had put the UK in a difficult position to cope with the outbreak. Boris Johnson said people who self-isolate are \u201chelping to protect all of us by slowing the spread of the virus\u201d in announcing sick pay changes as part of emergency coronavirus legislation. \u201cIf they stay at home and if we ask people to self-isolate, they may lose out financially,\u201d he told the House ofCommons. \u201cSo, I can today announce that the Health Secretary will bring forward, as part of our emergency coronavirus legislation, measures to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the very first day you are sick instead of four days under the current rules, and I think that\u2019s the right way forward.\u201d The quarantining of cities and towns would be supported by 74% of people in the UK, according to a global poll by Ipsos Mori. The survey asked if respondents would support preventing anyone from entering or leaving if there has been a large number of coronavirus cases there. Of the countries included in the survey, Vietnam was most likely to agree (91%) while only three in five of those in Italy agree. There has been a drop in Britons\u2019 perceptions of how well the government is responding to the virus in the run-up to the announcement on Tuesday of the British government\u2019s action plan. When asked on 14-15 February, almost two-thirds of the UK public (63%) thought the government was doing a good job in containing the spread of the virus. One week later this has dropped, with only half (50%) feeling the same way. In comparison, seven in 10 (70%) believe national health organisations in the UK are doing a good job. The first case of the new virus in European Union offices in Brussels has been announced. It appears to have been in the European Defence Agency (EDA), according to this report. Euractive says a source told it that a senior EDA official who contracted the virus had returned from a trip to Italy last week. Afterwards, he had a meeting with around 30 officials from other EU institutions last week and started feeling sick on Saturday before testing positive for Covid-19. A member of the military staff of the European External Action Service (EEAS) who attended the meeting has started experiencing symptoms and is waiting for the outcome of the test, the source added. An EEAS source further said the other participants of the meeting have since held other meetings and/or travelled. Ireland has recorded a second case of coronavirus but plans to go ahead with St Patrick\u2019s Day festivities. Health officials revealed the second case \u2013 a female in the east of the country who recently travelled from northern Italy \u2013 on Tuesday night. The infection is not related to the Dublin schoolboy who was diagnosed last weekend after he also visited northern Italy. The foreign affairs ministry updated its travel advice to warn against non-essential travel to the Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna regions. The chair of Ireland\u2019s coronavirus advisory group, Cillian de Gascun, told RTE on Wednesday there was still no evidence of community transmission in Ireland. However, he said the situation was fluid and noted that two weeks ago Italy had only three cases and now had more than 2,000. The chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said the second infection was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d and that Ireland remained in a containment phase. He said that \u201cas things stand\u201d the celebrations leading up to St Patrick\u2019s Day on 17 March could go ahead. Meanwhile, Google asked most staff at its European headquarters in Dublin to work from home for a second day pending an update on an employee who on Monday showed flu-like symptoms. Public Health England has suggested it may recommend that people stop shaking hands \u201calthough we\u2019re not there yet\u201d. Its emeritus medical director, Prof Paul Cosford, said: We may get to a point where if we see more widespread infection we ask people to limit the social contact they have with each other. This could include limiting everyday interaction, although we\u2019re not there yet. What\u2019s most important at the moment is that people practise good hand and respiratory hygiene and wash their hands frequently and thoroughly. Our message is clear, simple handwashing with soap for 20 seconds is key to good hygiene and this will make a real difference in stopping this virus spread. On Monday, when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, extended her hand to her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, at a meeting on Monday, he refused her handshake and waved her away amid concerns about spread of Covid-19. Plans to increase the increase the availability of specialist equipment to provide oxygen in anticipation of more people suffering from breathing difficulties are being made by health authorities in the UK. There was confusion on Tuesday when the health minister, Matt Hancock, spoke about increasing the number of what he referred to as home ventilation kits, with doctors and medical professionals among those ridiculing or questioning what he meant. It has emerged that Hancock was referring to the NHS Home Oxygen Therapy service, which provides ventilators or oxygen concentrators to people requiring respiratory aid. Contingency planners are taking steps in anticipation of higher numbers of patients with breathing difficulties to increase the availability of the equipment so that doctors can have them as an option. It\u2019s not clear how exactly the plan will work, or if the equipment will be prescribed to patients to take home. According to NHS guidance, a oxygen concentrator machine is suitable if someone would benefit from having oxygen for many hours a day, including while they are asleep. The machines, which are about 75cm (2.5ft) high and plug into electrical sockets, filter oxygen from the air in the room and delivers it through plastic tubes to a mask or nasal cannula. Long tubing can be fixed around the floor or skirting board of a house, with two points where they can be can plugged in to the oxygen supply. When the machine is installed, an engineer or nurse normally discusses the length of tubing needed. The NASUWT, one of the largest teaching unions in the UK, has written to the Department for Education in England and its counterparts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, urging them to extend their coronavirus advice to schools to address a surge in incidents of racism and xenophobia. The union says it has received increased reports of black and minority ethnic teachers and pupils being subjected to \u201cracist name-calling and intimidation\u201d connected to the Covid-19 outbreak. Chris Keates, the union\u2019s acting general secretary, said:\u201cThe NASUWT is extremely concerned at the extent of increased incidences of abuse, prejudice, xenophobia and racism as a result of the coronavirus (Covid-19). \u201cMisinformation and false reporting about the coronavirus, its causes and how it is spread have fuelled fear and panic and in some cases led to the ostracising of people of east Asian heritage and others perceived to be \u2018foreign\u2019 or an \u2018immigrant\u2019 within the UK. \u201cUnfortunately, schools and colleges are not exempt from the associated xenophobic and racialised stereotyping of Chinese and other east Asian people. The NASUWT has received reports of increased covert and overt racial attacks perpetrated against some minority ethnic pupils and NASUWT members linked to coronavirus concerns. \u201cThe NASUWT is urging the Department for Education to communicate with schools and provide guidance and support for school leaders.\u201d The total number of deaths from the new coronavirus in Iran has reached 92, the country\u2019s healthy ministry is reporting. About 8% of the Iranian parliament\u2019s MPs have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday, as the country announced plans to mobilise 300,000 soldiers and volunteers against the deadliest outbreak of the epidemic outside China. Two senior Iranian officials have already died from the virus and several more are infected. Semi-official news agencies on Tuesday reported that the head of the country\u2019s emergency medical services, Pirhossein Kolivand, was now also ill. A hospital staff member in the north-west of England has been confirmed as a case of the new coronavirus.Although the patient is believed to have contracted the virus in Italy, the case is the latest example of a health worker succumbing to it. A spokesman for the North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust said: \u201cThe trust can confirm that a member of hospital staff has tested presumptive positive for Covid-19 following a trip to northern Italy. On returning from the trip, the member of staff sensibly self-isolated and did not come into work or have any contact with patients. \u201cWe can assure the public that the risk remains low. The trust is operating normally and there is no need to cancel any appointments.\u201d On Monday, a clinician at Hertfordshire Mount Vernon Cancer Centre was initially confirmed positive for the virus but then tested negative. A family doctor in Brighton and a member of staff at Worthing hospital, West Sussex, were among the first coronavirus cases to be identified in Britain last month. There were concerns last week that a Surrey GP may also have been infected. The regional director for Public Health England said on Monday that none of the four patients in a cluster in the county were GPs or health workers. The Hannover Messe, a major industrial fair in Germany, has announced its postponement until July. A pharmaceutical company in Japan has said it is developing a drug for high-risk patients infected with the new coronavirus, joining several other drugmakers seeking to develop a treatment for an illness. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co said it was working on a plasma-derived therapy that had previously been shown to be effective in treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections, Reuters reports. Its research would require antibodies from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus infections or who have been vaccinated, once a vaccine has been developed. \u201cBy transferring the antibodies to a new patient, it may help that person\u2019s immune system respond to the infection and increase their chance of recovery,\u201d Takeda said in a statement. Coronavirus is likely to be spreading undetected in the UK already, with health officials on the brink of moving into the phase of \u201cdelaying\u201d rather than trying to \u201ccontain\u201d transmission, the chief medical officer has said. Chris Whitty, who is helping to lead the government\u2019s response, said it was \u201clikely, not definite, that we will move on to onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Prof Whitty said the UK was almost in the second phase of the government\u2019s strategy of trying to contain, delay, research and mitigate the virus. \u201cWhen I was here previously, we were firmly in contain stage. Now I think we are on the borderline between containing and delaying. But many of the things you do to contain it also delay it.\u201d Whitty gave his assessment as the government designated coronavirus a notifiable disease, which means some companies will be able to seek insurance compensation for coronavirus cancellations. The move brings England into line with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland, which have already added coronavirus to their lists of notifiable diseases. The London Book Fair, a huge event in the publishing industry and due to take place between 10-12 March, has been cancelled. Publishers and agents had been pulling out day by day but it\u2019s still a major development in terms of the impact of the announcement. Here\u2019s a tweet from the organisers. This is Ben Quinn picking up the live blog now. You can flag up any news tips by email at ben.quinn@theguardian.com or on twitter at @BenQuinn75 The European Central Bank said on Wednesday that it\u2019s restricting all non-essential travel by members of its executive board and employees until 20 April as a precautionary measure amid the global coronavirus outbreak. The Associated Press reports the central bank for the 19-nation eurozone said visits to its Frankfurt headquarters and its public visitor centre are being suspended for the same period. It is postponing or cancelling conferences that were due to be held at the bank but says that news conferences after regular policy-setting meetings of its governing council are unaffected, and that the next one will go ahead on 12 March as planned. On Tuesday, the World Bank and the IMF announced they would be scrapping the spring meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington and replacing them with virtual meetings because of coronavirus outbreak Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and David Malpass, the president of the World Bank Group, said in a joint statement: Like everyone else around the world, we have been deeply concerned by the evolving situation of the coronavirus and the human tragedy surrounding it. Given growing health concerns related to the virus, the management of the IMF and World Bank Group and their executive boards have agreed to implement a joint plan to adapt the 2020 IMF-World Bank spring meetings to a virtual format. Our goal is to serve our membership effectively while ensuring the health and safety of spring meetings participants and staff. We remain fully committed to maintaining a productive dialogue with our stakeholders and will leverage our IT-related and virtual connection capabilities to the fullest to hold our essential policy consultations with the membership. We will also continue to share IMF and World Bank analyses. With this adapted format, we are confident that our member countries will be able to effectively engage on pressing global economic issues at these spring meetings. A couple of universities have decided to postpone their graduation ceremonies in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The University of Buckingham announced today it has postponed its graduation ceremonies due to fears of aiding the spread of the coronavirus. The event will be rescheduled for later in the year. Sir Anthony Seldon, the university\u2019s vice-chancellor, said: We have made the difficult decision to postpone our graduation ceremonies due to the precautionary warnings from the government regarding the coronavirus (Covid-19). Any disappointment felt is entirely understandable but we truly believe this is the best decision for our students and their guests. Our hope is that by announcing this news as early as possible, those who need to invoke cancellation policies on travel or accommodation will still have time to do so. The University of London has decided to postpone the graduation ceremony for students on its distance and flexible learning programmes. The ceremony was scheduled to take place in London on 3 March at the Barbican Centre. Pro-vice-chancellor Chris Cobb said: We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the event due to the ongoing coronavirus issue. We truly regret the inconvenience caused but, after careful consideration, we felt it important to minimise the risk to our students and their guests. This event is different to many others due to the large numbers of attendees travelling from affected regions and the potential impact it may have on others attending and travelling back to regions which are currently unaffected. Scotland\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has said that two more cases of coronavirus were confirmed overnight, taking the number of patients diagnosed in the country to three. She refused to give further details of the new cases in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme. Freeman said evidence globally suggested that for the vast majority of those infected the symptoms would be \u201cvery mild\u201d, but added that the advice was still to \u201cself-isolate\u201d in a bid to contain the virus. \u201cPeople have a conscience about it where they don\u2019t want to infect others so our expectation is that the overwhelming majority of people will follow that clinical advice and stay at home\u201d. Freeman added that a power existed under the 2008 Public Health Scotland Act to apply for a court order \u201cif someone has an infectious disease and will not follow clinical advice in order to make sure they are quarantined\u201d. But she added: \u201cThat\u2019s a very harsh power and we\u2019re not at that point.\u201d Asked about Scottish government figures suggesting a worst-case scenario of 160,000 being hospitalised, she said these numbers came from Chinese figures that were being refined and remodelled to fit the UK scenario, and said that not all of those people will require hospital treatment at the same time. Freeman said she was looking at capacity in the health service and aware of the need to create more headroom, in particular in areas such as where patients need high oxygen therapy. She said she would be meeting with local authorities later on Wednesday \u201cto ensure that people who are clinically ready to leave hospital are doing so as quickly as possible\u201d. The latest daily update from the World Health OrganiZation (WHO) states eight new countries \u2013 Andorra, Jordan, Latvia, Morocco, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Tunisia \u2013 reported cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The WHO is particularly concerned by the increase of coronavirus cases in the eastern Mediterranean region is of great concern and reiterated the need to enhance surveillance and response activities, and share critical information. Here are the latest numbers on Wednesday: Globally: 90,870 confirmed (1,922 new ) China: 80, 304 confirmed (130 new) and 2,946 deaths (31 new) Outside of China: 10,566 confirmed (1,792 new), 72 countries (eight new), and 166 deaths (38 new) WHO risk assessment: China: very high Regional level: very high Global level: very high The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Spain has risen to 167 after new cases were detected in Madrid (10 new cases) and Mallorca (two). Meanwhile, Spain has also confirmed its first coronavirus fatality: a 69-year-old man who died in the eastern region of Valencia on 13 February. He is reported to have travelled to Nepal before falling ill. The coronavirus was detected during a postmortem examination. On Tuesday, Spain\u2019s health ministry ordered that football and basketball matches involving teams from affected countries be played to empty stadiums and advised that large medical conferences and events should be cancelled to free up health professionals so they can attend to the coronavirus emergency. A fourth person \u2013 a 92-year-old man \u2013 has died in France after contracting the coronavirus; the health authorities have declared 212 confirmed cases in the country, a jump of 21 in 24 hours. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of the country\u2019s national health authority, said 13 regions are affected and there were three main clusters in mainland France: the largest in the Oise, north of Paris, where there are 64 cases, the Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan (12 cases). There is a fourth cluster made up of people who took part in an organised trip to Egypt, 11 cases. \u201cThe country has to hunker down. We are ready. I know we will know how to get through this, with strength and defiance,\u201d President Emmanuel Macron told heath personnel running a crisis management centre on Tuesday evening. The president announced that France would be requisitioning \u201call stocks and production of protective masks\u201d so they could be distributed to health workers and those who have been diagnosed with the virus. France\u2019s sport minister Roxana Maracineanu called representatives of sports federations to a meeting on Tuesday to examine \u201ccase by case\u201d whether events should go ahead. The Paris-Nice bike race due to take place between 8-15 March is still on for the moment. The Champions League football match between Paris Saint Germain and Dortmund on 11 March is also still happening, but the authorities are considering whether the match should take place without supporters. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted an update on Facebook on the steps the social network will take to respond to the coronavirus Facebook users who search for coronavirus on Facebook will see a pop-up that directs them to the WHO or local health authority for the latest information on the outbreak. The company will also give millions more in ad credits to other organisations. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said: We\u2019re also focused on stopping hoaxes and harmful misinformation. It\u2019s important that everyone has a place to share their experiences and talk about the outbreak, but as our community standards make clear, it\u2019s not okay to share something that puts people in danger. So we\u2019re removing false claims and conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations. We\u2019re also blocking people from running ads that try to exploit the situation -- for example, claiming that their product can cure the disease. The budget airline Wizz Air, which has already cut some flights to Italy, could further reduce capacity by about 10% in its next quarter after demand was affected by the coronavirus outbreak Reuters reports the low-cost carrier said on Wednesday that it was difficult to predict the extent and duration of the outbreak and its impact on its next financial year, which begins next month. On Twitter, journalist Laurel Chor highlighted the lack of demand on some routes with an image of her flight from London to Milan on an unnamed airline. Poland has confirmed its first coronavirus infection, Reuters reports. Poland\u2019s Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Wednesday that a man is in hospital in Zielona Gora, western Poland, and that his condition is good. The minister added that over 560 tests have been carried out so far and this is the only positive case, according to a report by local media. Hong Kong\u2019s first evacuation flight for residents stuck in Hubei has taken off, and is on its way back to Hong Kong, journalist Alvin Lum has reported. 109 passengers were onboard the chartered Cathay Pacific plane, which left Wuhan\u2019s international airport. One passenger presented with a high temperature and was prevented from boarding. The flight is expected to arrive shortly after 5pm, local time. On Wednesday Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive announced that four flights would bring home the 533 trapped Hong Kongers, including 14 pregnant women, 22 residents who need medical treatment in Hong Kong including cancer patients, and 11 students needing to take an exam. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has been doing the media rounds this morning to get a simple message out on how to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus \u2013 wash your hands regularly. Whitty told Sky News: \u201cAt the moment our advice is very clear. Although in the longer term we may well be needing people to take more extreme action, at this stage we do not think people need to change what they\u2019re doing in terms of their normal behaviour.\u201d He added that there will be a six-week period before the UK will start to see a significant amount of transmission of the virus. \u201cIts almost certain there will be more cases in the UK, probably a lot more cases as the prime minister laid out and we would expect some deaths,\u201d he said. When asked if people should be shaking hands, Whitty said: \u201cThe much more important thing is washing hands. Regular washing of hands with up to 20 seconds of soap is the key message we want to give people at this stage.\u201d If you\u2019re just joining us, here are the most important developments over the last few hours: The global death toll is now 3,190. More than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, reported 516 new cases on Wednesday, bringing its total to 5,328. In India, 17 Italian citizens have tested positive. There have been more infections recorded in Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Fears of a global recession are mounting, after stock markets gave a lukewarm reaction to the emergency cut in US interest rates and new data showed that China and Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill in February. Japan cancelled a ceremony commemorating the 2011 tsunami. The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people. Washington state residents are struggling to get tested. In Seattle, an Amazon employee tested positive for the virus. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, announced new screening measures, including for all travellers to the US on direct flights from South Korea and Italy. The WHO warned that supplies of protective gear \u201crapidly depleting\u201d, amid panic-buying and the manipulation of markets. Panic-buying hit Australia, causing a rush on essentials, canned food, and toilet paper. Fears of a coronavirus-driven global economic slowdown have mounted after stock markets gave a lukewarm reaction to the emergency cut in US interest rates and new data showed that China and Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill in February. Shares in Asia struggled to gain traction despite the US Federal Reserve\u2019s surprise 0.5% cut in borrowing costs. It is the first time the Fed has used an emergency cut outside its usual meeting schedule since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and was aimed at steadying investor nerves after 10 days of heavy losses on financial markets. The World Bank also announced a $12bn package to assist countries grappling with the health and economic impacts. Helen Davidson and Martin Farrer report. Here are a few of the latest big developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. Read the full summary below. Total number of cases so far The global death toll is 3,190 while more than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries. In China there have been 38 new deaths bringing the total to 2,981 and there are 80,270 cases in all. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, reported 516 new cases on Wednesday, bringing its total to 5,328. In India, 15 Italian citizens have tested positive. There have been more infections recorded in Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Chinese services sector falls to lowest level since GFC The coronavirus lockdown has wiped out demand for shopping, eating out and going to the cinema in China, according to a key survey. WHO warns protective gear \u2018rapidly depleting\u2019 The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that masks, goggles and other protective equipment used by health workers are running out amid panic buying. Panic buying hits Australia Supermarket chain Woolworths has said it will start rationing toilet paper as panic buying leaves store shelves empty across the country, which has 41 cases of Covid-19. In India, fifteen Italian citizens have tested positive for coronavirus, Indian state and private media said on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources. Reuters reports that on Monday, an Italian citizen tested positive in the state of Rajasthan, according to a health official. In Australia, Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer Jeanette Young has said that anyone who has travelled from Iran since the 19th of February must go into home quarantine for 14 days. The state has confirmed its 11th case of coronavirus, with a man who had visited Iran now isolated at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Authorities have begun contact tracing passengers who were seated close to him on the plane. \u201cNine contacts have been identified so far and that work is ongoing. The contacts that we really need to focus on now are those on the plane, the two rows in front, behind and either side of him,\u201d said Young. Authorities would soon make the flight number public, she added. Here are today\u2019s key developments: The WHO warned that protective gear \u201crapidly depleting\u201d, amid panic buying and the manipulation of markets. South Korea has reported 516 new Covid-19 cases, a day after the president, Moon Jae-in, declared \u201cwar\u201d on the illness. Mainland China confirmed 119 new cases. There were 38 new deaths from the virus on 3 March. China\u2019s services sector collapsed in February to its lowest level since the global financial crisis. There are now 41 cases of the virus in Australia, including a health care worker at an aged care home in Sydney. The Australian government extended self-quarantine requirements for those recently arrived from Iran. A second case of coronavirus was confirmed in New Zealand, with the infected woman having recently arrived in the country from Italy. Japan\u2019s total number of cases has hit 1,000, with one new case confirmed today. US Vice President Mike Pence announced new screening measures, including for all travellers to the US on direct flights from South Korea and Italy, as Washington state residents voiced their frustrations over obstacles to getting tested. On the latest episode of Today in Focus: Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018battle plan\u2019 for tackling a major outbreak of the coronavirus. The plan envisages the country close to a war footing, with schools closing, public gatherings cancelled and up to a fifth of the workforce off sick. The Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, says that while these measures may never be needed, the plan shows how seriously the government is taking this crisis. But there is also a realisation that the virus will be extremely difficult to control and the best hope could lie in delaying the worst of the effects until a vaccine is produced. Professional sport, its stadia packed to the brim with fans at close quarters, is anything but immune to the coronavirus outbreak. The Tokyo Olympics have come under threat and Uefa has expressed concerns as Euro 2020 approaches, while cricketers have been advised not to shake hands and NBA players have been told to avoid high-fiving fans. Think of any sport \u2013 tennis, golf, rugby, cycling, baseball, biathlon even \u2013 and chances are it has been impacted by coronavirus in some capacity. To Australians, these have hitherto been other people\u2019s problems. But as with most things, when the world sneezes Australia catches a cold. As another congested year of sport prepares to get even busier, fans should brace for a calendar that is at best disrupted, at worst decimated. The Guardian\u2019s Hallie Golden reports that an Amazon employee in Seattle has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an internal message sent on Tuesday afternoon. The employee went home after feeling sick on 25 February, and has stayed out of the tech company\u2019s offices ever since, according to the message from Amazon Human Resources, which was sent to most Amazon employees in the area and obtained by the Guardian. The employee is currently in quarantine. All other employees who came in close contact with the individual have been notified, according to the message. Japan will cancel a ceremony to mark the anniversary next week of the March 2011 triple disaster on its north-east coast, as part of government-led efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo on 11 March, exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In morale-boosting news from Iran, healthcare workers are posting videos of themselves dancing in their protective gear. In Australia, a 26-year-old man from Logan is in isolation in the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane after testing positive to Covid-19. It is the 11th confirmed coronavirus case in Queensland. The Queensland health department said the man had recently returned from Iran and is in a stable condition. Authorities are also awaiting the outcome of a test from the housemate of a 20-year-old man who tested positive to Covid-19 yesterday. Both the man and his housemate are in isolation at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital. The 63-year-old beautician who returned from Iran early last week also remains in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital, in a stable condition. The other eight patients have recovered. Queensland Health has urged anyone who has been overseas in the past 14 days and is feeling unwell to see a doctor immediately. People are recommended to call ahead to their GP or local hospital so they can prepare for the arrival of a potential coronavirus case. In Hong Kong, a monk from a worship hall linked to 16 of the region\u2019s 100 confirmed cases has tested positive in a preliminary screening, South China Morning Post is reporting. The 43-year-old man is being treated in hospital, and is awaiting a second test to confirm the diagnosis. Hong Kong health authorities have previously said that 16 people diagnosed with Covid-19 had visited the hall, or were related to someone who had visited it. The South China morning post reports that a third doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital has died from Covid-19. Mei Zhongming, 57, was an opthamologist. Wuhan Central Hospital is the same one at which whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang worked. It is located close to the market where the virus was detected. Li died from Covid-19 in February. The New Zealand government said they will consider more hardship funding for businesses who are suffering from the impacts of coronavirus, as many experience a dip in income, including those in the tourism, seafood and logging industry. Today New Zealand confirmed its second case of coronavirus, in a woman in her 30s who had recently returned from northern Italy. Her partner is also being tested, as he is showing symptoms of the virus. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said that although it was concerning two local schools had to be alerted because of the latest case, transmission rates of the disease were low among young people. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for all the different scenarios,\u201d Ardern said, of dealing with a coronavirus outbreak in schools. Ardern stressed the economy was still in good health, despite the upsets to the tertiary sector and various export industries. No further travel bans were announced, but Ardern said arrivals from affected areas were dropping \u201cdaily\u201d as airlines put their own measures in place. New Zealand is asking travellers from northern Italy and south Korea to self-isolate. New Zealand\u2019s travel restrictions were among the toughest in the world, Ardern said. There was no plan to ban or restrict travellers from Australia, where the disease was more widespread. Across the world, governments are ordering or contemplating school closures in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus virus. French officials closed about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of infections, its education minister said on Tuesday. In some countries parents have already had their children at home for more than a month. Some have taken holidays or sent the kids overseas to relatives. Most Hong Kong schoolchildren never returned to school following the lunar new year holidays after the government announced and then extended closures to 20 April. So, how are parents coping? Helen Davidson, Lily Kuo and Justin McCurry report. In more toilet paper-related coronavirus news out of Australia, the social enterprise Who Gives a Crap, which delivers toilet paper made out of 100% recycled materials and donates 50% of its profits to build toilets in the developing world, has sold out of toilet paper. \u201cWith all the panic buying madness, we\u2019ve sold out and are working as hard as possible to restock,\u201d said the company on their website. They asked customers to consider \u201chow we can all do our bit to encourage kindness, empathy and calm\u201d in these \u201ccrazy times\u201d. The news comes as Australia\u2019s supermarkets have reported selling out of toilet paper as people stock up in anticipation of being stuck in home quarantine due to the coronavirus. Australian supermarket giant Woolworths has begun rationing the sale of toilet paper to four packets per customer. #toiletpapercrisis has been trending on Australian social media all Wednesday. The Australian health minister has told doctors who are facing shortages of protective face masks that they should contact their primary health network to gain access to the government\u2019s stockpile of more than one million masks. Asked about reports that doctors and medical clinics are facing shortages of protective face masks, Greg Hunt said: \u201cWe have half a million masks in a first-round and in a second round we have allocated another 550,000 that are available to doctors through the primary health networks. If there are any GP practices that are having issues they should contact the Department of Health or first port of call will be their primary health network.\u201d South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has cancelled his planned trip to the UAE, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March because of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. \u201cIn response to the recent nationwide spread of Covid-19, we have decided not to go ahead with trips,\u201d said presidential blue house spokesman Kang Min-seok in a statement. Just looking back at the press conference given just after noon by the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and the chief medical officer Kerry Chant; the key take-away is there are now two cases in that state of people being infected with coronavirus where the infection can not be traced back to a source. This means community transmission has occurred, though the community transmission has so far been contained in both cases \u2013 there is no widespread infection occurring. The latest case of community transmission involves a 50-year-old woman working at the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility in northern Sydney. She had not travelled to an affected country. On Monday, a 53-year-old doctor working at Ryde hospital was also diagnosed, and again he had not travelled to an infected country. Neither had knowingly been in contact with an infected person. The press conference revealed some journalists are confused about how the disease is spread, with Chant and Hazzard grilled about how they could be sure the disease was not spreading around Ryde hospital and the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge. This is concerning, because people may avoid seeking medical treatment of visiting loved ones if they believe there is a risk of becoming infected. Chant reiterated that there is no ongoing threat of infection at either of the facilities. First of all, only close contacts of infected people are at risk. A close contact is defined as someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes with an infected person, or in the same closed space with an infected person for at least two hours without protective gear. Once you remove an infected person and their close contacts from a facility or isolate them in hospital rooms, and disinfect surfaces, there is no longer any ongoing risk of infection. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most sick, so out of caution health authorities trace back an infected person\u2019s close contacts to the day prior to them falling ill. \u201cCoronavirus is not in the hospital and you will do more harm if you don\u2019t present to the hospital because you\u2019re scared of coronavirus,\u201d Chant said. She also made an important point; isolation, testing and quarantine measures are not designed to go on forever. If more widespread community transmission occurs -- and health authorities are preparing for that becoming the case -- the messages to the public and measures taken by health authorities would change, Chant said. At the point of community spread, rather than diagnosing every person with symptoms, people who felt sick would be encouraged to stay at home and isolate themselves for 14 days. They would only need to call a doctor if they became worse.They should at that point alert ambulance or health workers on the phone ahead of time so health care workers could put measures in place such as wearing protective gear. \u201cWhile we have a strong emphasis on testing at this point in time we won\u2019t be if there is community spread at significant levels,\u201d Chant said. \u201cIt\u2019s important the community understands the message will change depending on the circumstances. It\u2019s not because we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We ask that the community follows our messages.\u201d There is still no need for members of the community to change their behaviour. Anyone with concerns can call the Coronavirus Health Information Line on 1800 020 080. Australia extends self-quarantine requirements for those recently arrived from Iran Australia\u2019s health minister Greg Hunt says it has become clear that in Iran \u201cthere is an uncontrolled spread\u201d of the virus and as a result, the \u201crequirements in relation to people who have travelled to Iran has now been extended\u201d. \u201cThat means that any person who has arrived in Australia having been in Iran from February 19 forward will be required to conduct home isolation, as has been the case with people from China, and has been the case with people from Iran from March 1. But they will be required to do that for 14 days from arrival in Australia, and that will now take effect for everybody who has arrived in Australia from and including February 19. Hunt said the Australian government had extended this quarantine order: \u201cout of an abundance of caution, but recognising that the situation in Iran is clearly far worse than has been documented and significantly higher than the recorded case numbers.\u201d Australia has 41 cases of Covid-19, says health minister Australia\u2019s health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now. He confirms that as of today Australia has 41 cases of Covid-19, including the worker in the aged care facility in Macquarie Park in New South Wales that we reported on earlier. \u201cAt this point, the advice I have is that they have isolated all of the relevant residents who have been in contact,\u201d said Hunt. Two residents of the home are under investigation, including a 95-year-old who died last night. \u201cAt this stage, NSW Health has not identified whether that resident has in any way, shape or form, been subject to coronavirus, but for full transparency, they have identified that case as one for investigation,\u201d Another resident has been placed in hospital for respiratory conditions and will be tested for coronavirus. Hunt said that globally, the numbers have increased to over 92,000 cases with over 3,100 lives lost and has now spread to over 78 countries. Among the countries that have seen their first cases of the virus are Ukraine and Morocco. Australia Institute chief economist Richard Denniss argues that the country is on the edge of a recession not because of coronavirus, but because the economy has been languishing since 2013. \u201cIf you thought the prime minister was slow to respond to the bushfire crisis, take a look at his response to Australia\u2019s ailing economy,\u201d he writes. \u201cMorrison is currently trying to pivot away from the government\u2019s economic inaction using the coronavirus outbreak as cover, but the only reason the coronavirus might push Australia into recession is because the economy has been languishing since the Coalition took office.\u201d China\u2019s services sector collapsed in February to its lowest level since the global financial crisis as the coronavirus lockdown wiped out demand for shopping, eating out and going to the cinema, a key survey showed on Wednesday local time. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) almost halved last month to 26.5 from 51.8 in January, Reuters reports. It was the first drop below the 50-point margin on a monthly basis for the first time since the survey began almost 15 years ago in late 2005. A reading over 50 indicates expansion while a reading below means the sector is shrinking. \u201cStagnating consumption amid the coronavirus epidemic has had a great impact on the service sector,\u201d Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin PMI release. The Hong Kong private sector PMI also confirmed it is heading further into recession. It fell to 33.1 in February from 46.8 in January. In Mainland China, 119 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed on March 3. This is lower than yesterday, when 125 new cases were confirmed \u2013 at the time, the lowest number of new daily cases since January. There were 38 new deaths, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,981. The total number of cases stands at 80,270 as of the end of March 3. South Korea reported 516 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the country\u2019\u2019s total to 5,328, a day after the president, Moon Jae-in, declared \u201cwar\u201d on the illness. South Korea - which has the highest number of infections outside China - has recorded 32 deaths, mostly among older people with underlying illnesses, Yonhap news agency said, citing figures from the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The government has proposed an extra budget of 11.7tn won (US9.8bn) to address the spread of the virus and limit its impact on the economy. The extra budget will be submitted to the national assembly on Thursday, with government officials urging MPs to pass the measures as quickly as possible. About 60% of South Korea\u2019s infections have been linked to a branch of the Shincheonji religious sect in the southeastern city of Daegu, although testing has been widened to include people in the city who re not connected with the sect, Yonhap said. Of the 516 new cases announced on Wednesday, 405 were in Daegu and 89 were in neighboring North Gyeongsang province, the KCDC said. In Washington state, where the coronavirus has claimed nine lives, residents on Tuesday reported a frustrating array of misinformation and obstacles as they were seeking to get tested. The virus has claimed nine lives in the state. Our reporter Hallie Golden spoke to residents in Seattle: A second case of coronavirus has been confirmed in New Zealand, with the infected woman having recently arrived in the country from Italy. The latest infection is a New Zealand citizen, a woman in her early 30s who recently returned from a trip to northern Italy and rapidly became ill. The woman\u2019s partner is also showing symptoms of the illness, health authorities said today, and is currently being tested. Here is our full story: US Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that US public health authorities had issued new guidance to make clear that a doctor\u2019s order was all that would be needed for any American to be tested for the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. The US would also begin screening all travellers coming to the US on direct flights from Italy and South Korea, he said. International travel to the United States will drop 6% over the next three months amid growing concerns about the outbreak, the US Travel Association forecast on Tuesday. The drop would be the largest decline in international inbound travel since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The chief executives of several major US airlines are scheduled to meet with Pence at the White House on Wednesday. American Airlines stock is down 40% since mid-February, and shares were down 2.8% on Tuesday. United Airlines shares, which fell 3.5% Tuesday, are down 28% since mid-February. The stocks of major hotel and cruise line companies have also fallen sharply. Pence is scheduled to meet with cruise line executives in Florida on Saturday. More on the situation in Australia: Dr Kerry Chant, NSW chief medical officer, said, \u201cWe have obviously had an increased number of cases reported from travellers returning overseas. In some of those cases, we will \u2013 we are initiating, and have commenced, contact tracing procedures in relation to the plane.\u201d She added that a list of the flight numbers and the rows of concern would be published on the NSW health ministry\u2019s website, with advice for travellers. \u201cSo, people seated in the same row as a case, or in the two rows in front or the two rows behind a confirmed COVID-19 case are defined as close contacts and are advised to self-quarantine at home for 14 days of the flight, and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms are present,\u201d she explained. The rest of passengers on those flights would be advised to self-monitor for symptoms for two weeks after the flight. In Australia, here\u2019s Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer for New South Wales, speaking at the conference. In Australia health officials say a health worker at an old people\u2019s home in Sydney has been infected with the new coronavirus. Brad Hazzard, New South Wales health minister, said the \u201cmuch-loved\u201d and longstanding member of staff at a residential care home has been confirmed as having the virus. She had been working with 13 residents at Dorothy Henderson Lodge, which is part of Baptist Care in Macquarie Park. Eleven of the residents have since been isolated. The other two residents presented with respiratory symptoms, Hazzard said at a media conference in Sydney, but it was not clear whether they had the virus. One of them, a 95-year-old woman, has died and the other is being tested. One of those was a 95-year-old lady who has passed away. Now, whether or not it was related to corona, we don\u2019t know at this point. And another resident who is being tested currently. The health worker has not been overseas, raising the question of how she ended up with coronavirus, Hazzard said. She was working on around about 24 February when she started to get those symptoms that I was just talking about \u2013 the sort of symptoms that we\u2019re all very familiar with, with flu,\u201d said Hazzard. \u201cAnd so we did the checks. And, of course, we\u2019re aware that it\u2019s likely that she could have been capable of passing on the coronavirus from at least the day before, 24 hours, so that\u2019s 23 February. The reaction of Asia Pacific stocks \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut means we\u2019re in for another volatile day\u2019s trading on the financial markets. Shares in Sydney are down 1.7%, although in Tokyo, where trading has just started, the market is pretty flat at 0.6% and in Seoul the Kospi index is up 1.39%. However, futures trading points to a fall in Hong Kong later. The Fed\u2019s move out of its usual meeting schedule is extremely rare. The last time they did this was at the height of Lehman crisis in 2008. So the fact they\u2019ve acted in such a way and for it to have so little impact is worrying. Fear is back, as Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natiixis bank in Hong Kong says: Kyle Rodda, of IG Markets in Melbourne, says market sentiment has been adversely affected by the Fed\u2019s 50 basis point cut, which has not calmed concerns about a global recession: \u201cThe Fed\u2019s 50-pointer initially supported market sentiment, as investors got a little giddy on the prospect of cheaper money. But the fundamental concerns about the coronavirus, and whether monetary policy would really stop a slow-down in the US and global economy, prevailed. The Vix volatility index spiked once again, to trade back around the 40 mark \u2013 a level entirely unconducive taking confident long positions in risk assets. Underlining official concern about Covid-19\u2019s impact on the world economy, the World Bank has announced a $12bn package to assist countries grappling with the health and economic impacts. World Bank president David Malpass said there were still \u201cmany unknowns\u201d about the fast-spreading virus and \u201cmuch more\u201d aid might be required, but he declined to elaborate. \u201cThe point is to move fast; speed is needed to save lives,\u201d Malpass said during a teleconference with reporters. \u201cThere are scenarios where much more resources may be required. We\u2019ll adapt our approach and resources as needed.\u201d Japan has confirmed another case of coronavirus infection, bringing the total in the country to 1,000 cases, Reuters reports. This number includes those from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had been quarantined off Yokohama. In Australia, Brendan Murphy, the country\u2019s chief medical officer, has just been telling the federal parliament in Canberra that the government is doing what it can to replenish stocks of protective clothing and equipment for health workers. The other dimension in preparation is there is a worldwide concern about the availability of personal protective equipment, you know, masks and the like, which there has obviously been a run on an government is very focused on making sure we enhance and build greater our stocks. We\u2019ve always had a stockpile and the states have stockpiles ... We are doing a full assessment of that and making sure that we buy more and do what we can to be prepared for every eventuality.\u201d Speaking more generally about the outbreak, he said: The focus is on containment, limitation and slowing any spread. We can keep the situation under control. We are a well prepared health system but even the best system can face a challenge.\u201d The World Health Organization has voiced concern that the masks, googles and other protective equipment used by health workers is running out amid panic buying and the manipulation of markets, warning that supplies are \u201crapidly depleting\u201d, Reuters reports. \u201cWe are concerned that countries\u2019 abilities to respond are being compromised by the severe and increasing disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment ... caused by rising demand, hoarding and misuse,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop Covid-19 without protecting our health workers,\u201d he said. The prices of surgical masks have increased six-fold, while the cost for ventilators had tripled, he added. Tedros said that WHO had shipped more than half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but urged a dramatic hike in production. The WHO estimates the response to Covid-19 will require 89 million medical masks, 76 million pairs of examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles each month. More than 3,100 people have died from the new virus, while over 92,000 have been infected across 77 countries and territories, according to AFP\u2019s latest toll based on official sources. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus. Today the World Heath Organization has warned that there is a global shortage of the protective equipment needed to fight the coronavirus. Governments worldwide are mobilising to protect economies from recession. Here is the summary from the last few hours. Iran will mobilise 300,000 soldiers and volunteers to against the country\u2019s outbreak, the deadliest outside China, as 2,300 cases are confirmed, including 23 MPs. Australia\u2019s sharemarket dropped 1.4% after the opening bell on Wednesday, despite the US Fed cut in interest rates. The losses reversed a rally on Tuesday that followed more than a week of losses. A ninth person with coronavirus has died in Seattle in the US. The person died six days ago, but the infection was only detected later. New York has identified its second case. Spain confirmed its first death from the new coronavirus. The man died almost three weeks ago, with new tests confirming the virus as the cause. New cases were identified in Algeria, Ireland, and Chile. Algeria\u2019s total number of cases now stands at eight. Ireland\u2019s stands at two. Chile\u2019s case is the country\u2019s first. The death toll from coronavirus in Italy has risen by 27 over the past 24 hours to 79. The total number of cases in the country reached 2,502, up from 2,036 on Monday. The agency said that of those infected, 160 people had fully recovered.

Health authorities are meeting with parents and children on Thursday night to conduct assessments.</p> <p>Hazzard said that as a precaution, childcare centres had been advised to suspend their regular visits to aged care homes until the risk of children being \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of the disease had been determined.</p> <p>He said that authorities had contacted 77 doctors who attended a radiology seminar on 18 February, which is being investigated as the possible source of infection for a 53-year-old doctor at Ryde hospital who tested positive to the virus this week.

      "bodyText": "Authorities in New South Wales are searching for 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with two people affected by Covid-19 and assessing more than a dozen children who visited a Sydney nursing home where four people have been diagnosed with the virus. \u201cI think at this point it is fair to say that we do have an evolution happening in the spread of this virus,\u201d New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard said. \u201cWe do know that containment is likely to be an unlikely outcome, so we need to work constructively with the community to continue our effort to emphasise to the community that [controlling the virus] is a partnership \u2026 Our community has to be doing everything they can do to support us in defeating what has really become a war in defeating this coronavirus.\u201d Four people at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility in northern Sydney \u2013 a 95-year-old woman who has since died, a 82-year-old man, a 70-year-old man and an aged care worker in her 50s \u2013 have so far tested positive to Covid-19. The 70-year-old man resided in a different area of the lodge and was cared for by different staff than the other affected residents, which Hazzard said suggested infection control protocols had not contained the spread. The aged care centre has since been isolated. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said about 17 children from the Banksia Cottage childcare centre at Macquarie University visited the aged care home on 24 February, on a day when the infected aged care worker was not working. Health authorities are meeting with parents and children on Thursday night to conduct assessments. Hazzard said that as a precaution, childcare centres had been advised to suspend their regular visits to aged care homes until the risk of children being \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of the disease had been determined. He said that authorities had contacted 77 doctors who attended a radiology seminar on 18 February, which is being investigated as the possible source of infection for a 53-year-old doctor at Ryde hospital who tested positive to the virus this week. Another doctor at that seminar, a registrar in her 30s from Liverpool hospital, was diagnosed with Covid-19 this week. Neither doctor had travelled overseas or had contact with known coronavirus patients. Hazzard said the process of tracing back possible contact between infected people was \u201ca bit like a police investigation in a sense, trying to track who is coming into contact with who and what possible associations there may have been\u201d. Meanwhile, a tourist in Darwin in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory has tested positive for coronavirus. It is the first confirmed case in the territory, which contains hundreds of remote communities. On Thursday NT Health said a 52-year-old man carrying the virus was in isolation in Royal Darwin hospital. The man recently arrived in Darwin from Sydney and has had limited contact with the local community, NT Health said. The department was undertaking contact tracing and would reach out to those who may have been in contact with the man. New South Wales confirmed overnight that the virus had spread to six new people in the state, bringing the number of cases to 22. The death of the woman in aged care is Australia\u2019s second recorded coronavirus death, after a 78-year-old who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess died in hospital in Perth. There have now been 52 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia since the outbreak began. The virus continues to spread in NSW, where the majority of cases have been confirmed. On Thursday prime minister Scott Morrison announced upgraded travel advice for South Korea, recommending people reconsider travel. Travel bans remain in place for China and Iran and citizens and permanent residents returning from those countries are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Besides the aged-care resident, health authorities said a female doctor at Liverpool hospital, a woman in her 30s from the northern beaches, a male from Cronulla in his 50s and a woman in her 60s who is believed to have returned from the Philippines had all tested positive. \u201cThe female doctor who was diagnosed on March 4 had no history of overseas travel,\u201d Chant said. \u201cWe are immediately establishing which staff and patients may need to self-isolate and be tested for Covid-19 should they be unwell.\u201d The woman in her 60s arrived back in Australia on 3 March and is believed to have returned from the Philippines. \u201cHer travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight,\u201d Chant said. The aged care worker became ill at work on 24 February. She had not travelled overseas, and is the second person to have acquired the virus in the community and cannot be traced back to a source. Both people worked with vulnerable people, including hospital patients and the elderly. \u201cIt is concerning when we have somebody present with coronavirus and we can\u2019t track the source,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cSo that raises the question, how did she end up with coronavirus?\u201d Hazzard said. The doctor had been in close contact with eight patients. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most sick, so out of caution health authorities trace back an infected person\u2019s contacts to the day before they fell ill. As a result, 11 of the health worker\u2019s patients had been placed in isolation. In Victoria on Wednesday, a man who has returned from Iran was confirmed as the 10th case of coronavirus in that state. Queensland now has 11 confirmed cases, including a 26-year-old man who returned from Iran on 26 February. But on Thursday health authorities in Queensland said the housemate of a 20-year-old international student who contracted the virus was not also infected. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said on Wednesday the man had felt unwell before the flight so authorities were tracking down people who had sat within two rows of him to recommend they begin 14 days of self-isolation. They have already identified and isolated nine people who had close contact with him. The state\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, said it was unnecessary for people to stockpile supplies against the small chance that they would be asked to go into home isolation.",

Each state gets a vote, and yesterday a big group of states \u2013 including two of the largest, California and Texas \u2013 got to have their say. </p> \n  <h2>Who was the favourite going into Super Tuesday and why?</h2> \n  <p>Bernie Sanders, the leftwing senator from Vermont, had been the favourite since his landslide victory in Nevada in February, but former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina and the withdrawal of Biden\u2019s fellow centrists Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar meant it suddenly became an extremely close-run thing. </p> \n  <p>Sanders was hoping to fend off Biden and cement his status as indisputable frontrunner. <br></p> \n  <p>Biden was hoping for a strong enough showing to make the case that he can pull ahead of Sanders, unite the centrist wing, and eventually win the race. <br></p> \n  <h2>So what happened?</h2> \n  <p>Biden had a great night and has probably reclaimed his former status as frontrunner from Sanders. <br></p> \n  <p>He won in at least nine of the 14 states up for grabs, including Texas, and he beat Elizabeth Warren, another leftwing contender, in Massachusetts, her home state. <br></p> \n  <p>But Sanders looks to be way ahead in California. Once all the delegates are divided up \u2013 which could take days or weeks \u2013 Sanders could end up coming out of Super Tuesday with a very similar number of delegates to his centrist rival.<br></p> \n  <p>What seems clear is that this is now a two-horse race between Sanders and Biden.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"97e0cb0e-eac4-4f56-ab9c-aecb69320519\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j03B1EthhvU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <h2>So no one has won yet?</h2> \n  <p>No \u2026 The race goes on. There is another set of primaries next week which Sanders hopes will give him another boost. </p> \n  <p>But it may be that Sanders and Biden now slug it out state by state, week after week, all the way to the Democratic convention in July. <br></p> \n  <p>If no candidate has got a majority of delegates by the time of the convention, party bigwigs get to play a role. Most of them are terrified of Sanders winning and they are likely to give the crown to Biden \u2013 even if Sanders is ahead at that point. <br></p> \n  <p>If that happens, Sanders\u2019 supporters will be absolutely furious and many may refuse to vote for Biden in the general election. <br></p> \n  <h2>What happened to Mike Bloomberg? </h2> \n  <p>The former New York mayor has spent about half a billion dollars on his campaign ads so far \u2013 a record-breaking amount. But he\u2019s worth $60bn. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/wealth-comparison/\">To put that in context</a>, that\u2019s the equivalent of someone whose net worth is $10 grand, say, spending $1 on the election. It\u2019s nowhere close to breaking the bank for him. </p> \n  <p>That said, there will be a great deal of pressure on him now to give way and back Biden too. He won his first two elections as mayor of New York as a Republican and he is not a fan of Sanders and his socialist platform, to put it mildly. <br></p> \n  <p>He is apparently planning to hunker down with his advisers on Wednesday and decide what to do next. <br></p> \n  <h2>What about Elizabeth Warren?</h2> \n  <p>On paper Warren could have been the ideal candidate to unite the liberal and centrist wings of the party but she only really cut through in her powerful attacks on Bloomberg. She has been squeezed out by Sanders on the left, and it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that sexism has also played a role. </p> \n  <p>Her campaign suggested last week that she would keep fighting and hope to be handed the crown at the convention if Sanders fails to win a majority of delegates. But that may be untenable and after coming third in her home state this is probably the end of the road for her. </p> \n  <p>The big question is whether she will throw her weight behind Sanders or Biden. Liberals have often fantasised about Sanders making Warren his vice-president and you\u2019ll hear a lot about that again now. </p> \n  <p>Whether he will or not I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a near-certainty that both Sanders and Biden intend to choose a female VP if they get that far. </p> \n  <h2>What does Trump think?</h2> \n  <p>Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in the Democratic race and kept up a running commentary on Twitter. He constantly tears into Biden and Bloomberg on Twitter, but is much kinder to Sanders \u2013 stirring the pot by claiming that the Democratic establishment is rigging the race against the Vermont socialist. It seems clear that he wants Sanders to win the race and thinks he\u2019d beat him. </p> \n  <h2>So when will the Democrats decide on a nominee? </h2> \n  <p>The primaries continue next week with contests in Michigan, Mississippi and Washington state, among other places. But this is looking like a battle between Bernie and Biden that will go down to the wire \u2013 so we may still be talking about this contest in July.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T10:45:46.548Z\">at 10.45am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5f58e68f086a28115b746e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laughland-oliver\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T07:30:50.127Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Oliver Laughland </strong>has just left the Texas Democratic party headquarters in Austin after a long night, just as Joe Biden declared a major victory for his campaign there. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Texas is the second largest state to vote on Super Tuesday with 228 pledged delegates at stake here. </p> \n   <p>It\u2019s worth noting that while Biden has been declared the victor this evening, it\u2019s the margin of victory that really matters as that will determine (via a number of complicated processes) just how many delegates Biden picks up. </p> \n   <p>The executive director of the Texas Democrats, Manny Garcia came to give us (and by us I mean the last three reporters left in the building) a quick briefing before he headed home.

      "bodyText": "Mike Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden. The billionaire candidate spent $500 million and failed to win a single Super Tuesday state. In an emotional speech to supporters, he said, \u201cI\u2019m just amazed at how many have stood with me shoulder to shoulder.\u201d Congress passed a bill that allocated $8bn to combat coronavirus, as the Trump administration faced continued criticism over its lack of adequate action to contain the outbreak. Bernie Sanders admitted his campaign had failed to galvanize youth turnout to the extent he\u2019d hoped. The Vermont senator did well in California, Colorado and his home state but lost ground to Biden in the east and south. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surrogates and allies are reportedly meeting with members of Sanders\u2019 team to discuss consolidating progressive support. After a weak performance on Super Tuesday, her chances of securing the nomination have dwindled. The Trump administration has chosen Marshall Billingslea, a former Bush-era official involved a torture program, as his nuclear envoy. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports: Billingslea is currently the under-secretary for terrorist financing at the US Treasury. His nomination last year for a top human rights job at the state department was stalled by controversy over the extent of his involvement in the torture programme established by the George W Bush administration, in which he oversaw the conditions of detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Neither the state department nor the treasury responded to a request for comment, but congressional staffers and former officials said Billingslea had accepted the post. Update: Symone Sanders, who said she broke a nail yesterday after blocking a protestor who tried to rush at Joe Biden, has gotten herself to the salon. Sanders, who is Joe Biden\u2019s senior advisor, and Jill Biden \u2014 the candidate\u2019s wife \u2014 emerged as heroes last night after swooping into action when anti-dairy protestors rushed toward the former vice president. While the main focus yesterday was on the race to win the Democratic presidential nomination, some of the down-ballot races were full of drama as well. Surrogates and allies of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are reportedly discussing strategies to unite to push a progressive agenda, the Washington Post reports. The expectation is that Warren, who has persisted despite a series of campaign setbacks, would drop out: The conversations, which are in an early phase, largely involve members of Congress who back Sanders (I-Vt.) reaching out to those in Warren\u2019s camp to explore the prospect that Warren (D-Mass.) might endorse him. They are also appealing to Warren\u2019s supporters to switch their allegiance to Sanders, according two people with direct knowledge of the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate discussions that are supposed to be confidential. The whirlwind of activity reflects the rapid changes in a Democratic primary that is still very much in transition. As late as Tuesday, many Warren allies believed she would stay in the race until the Democratic convention, despite her poor showing to date in the primaries, in hopes of retaining her clout and influencing the eventual nominee. The Guardian\u2019s Saad Ejaz was at Michael Bloomberg\u2019s farewell speech earlier today, here\u2019s his report from the room \u2026 Michael Bloomberg gave his last public appearance as a presidential nominee today, consoling a room full of staff and supporters at a Manhattan Hotel. \u201cMike will get it done,\u201d the crowd chanted, rather unenthusiastically, as they waited for Bloomberg. \u201cI entered the race for the president to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d explained Bloomberg once he took the stage, \u201cAnd today I am leaving the race for the same reason.\u201d Super Tuesday marked the first time the billionaire, his message or his money had been tested. The numbers were not kind. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that data should inform our decision,\u201d he admitted, \u201cAfter Yesterday\u2019s results, the delegate math had become virtually impossible and a viable path to the nomination just no longer existed.\u201d Instead, it was time to unite behind one candidate to defeat Donald Trump, Bloomberg said, and that could only be his \u201cfriend and a great American\u201d Joe Biden. \u201cI am glad to say that I endorse Joe Biden, and I hope you will join me in working to make him the next president of the United states,\u201d Bloomberg said of the candidate who, just 11 weeks before, he was unconvinced could beat Trump or run the country. \u201cHe\u2019s never been the manager of an organization, he\u2019s never run a school system,\u201d Bloomberg told MSNBC\u2019s Stephanie Ruhle in December.\u201cThe presidency shouldn\u2019t be a training job.\u201d Many of Bloomberg\u2019s supporters were in a somber mood; some were in tears as the speech ended. \u201cI\u2019m just so sad and disappointed,\u201d said Margaret Brick, who has supported Bloomberg for the past 17 years, \u201cBut I think he\u2019s really going to help Joe.\u201d Other members of the campaign, like Abdul Malik, were not as sure of Joe Biden. Malik had worked with the Bloomberg campaign to increase outreach with people of color. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Joe Biden yet,\u201d said Malik, \u201cMy biggest issue is criminal justice reform and no one else comes close to Bloomberg\u2019s plan.\u201d Bloomberg himself was overcome with emotion, as he reflected on his campaign\u2019s journey.\u201cI\u2019m just amazed at how many have stood with me shoulder to shoulder,\u201d he said at the verge of tears, \u201cWorking and fighting every step of the way.\u201d \u201cAnd you do it because you love America as much as I do and that\u2019s all I could ever ask for.\u201d Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, told CNN that Joe Biden would be a tough opponent in the election. \u201cI think Joe Biden\u2019s got a good reputation,\u201d said Graham, a Republican senator of South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019d be more moderate than Bernie, but I still think it\u2019s Trump\u2019s to lose.\u201d Biden\u2019s victory in Graham\u2019s home state is what gave the firmer vice president\u2019s flagging campaign the boost and momentum to take on Super Tuesday. Chuck Schumer\u2019s team has responded to Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 reprimand. In a rare statement, Roberts described a speech that Schumer delivered as the Supreme Court considered a case that could result in grave new abortion restrictions as \u201cthreatening\u201d. Schumer had said that the Trump-appointed justices would pay a price for restricting abortion access. \u201cSen. Schumer\u2019s comments were a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grassroots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision,\u201d said the senator\u2019s spokesperson Justin Goodman in a statement. \u201cFor Justice Roberts to follow the right wing\u2019s deliberate misinterpretation of what Sen. Schumer said, while remaining silent when President Trump attacked Justices Sotomayor and Ginsberg last week, shows Justice Roberts does not just call balls and strikes.\u201d After his big Super Tuesday wins, Biden just held a very brief press conference at a Los Angeles hotel, making about a dozen supporters and a large crowd of journalists wait over an hour for roughly seven minutes of remarks. He did not speak about Bloomberg\u2019s departure or his remaining rivals in the race, saying: \u201cWhat we can\u2019t let happen in the next few weeks is let this primary turn into a campaign of negative attacks. The only thing that can do is help Donald Trump ... Donald Trump poses an existential threat to our standing in the world.\u201d \u201cWe are going to take this fight all across America to rebuild the middle class,\u201d said Biden, who appeared relatively subdued in the small hotel conference room at the W Los Angeles in Westwood. Biden ignored reporters\u2019 questions as he walked out, but briefly responded to one question about criticisms that he is part of the Democratic \u201cestablishment\u201d, saying, \u201cThe establishment are all those hard-working middle-class people, those African Americans...\u201d LA mayor Eric Garcetti, a Biden supporter, showed up, but made no remarks. Lulu Lima, an 18-year-old supporter who also stood behind Biden, told me after that her father is a union member and supporter of the candidate. She said she was grateful to cast her first-ever vote for Biden and felt excited about his surge: \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see what can happen ... It means never lose hope, and in a broader sense, never lose hope for this nation.\u201d Asked if she was confident Biden would win, she said, \u201cAll we can do is hope.\u201d She said she avoids talking about politics with friends or others her age who are Sanders supporters: \u201cIt\u2019s important for individuals to have their own beliefs.\u201d The president blamed a federal agency decision during Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which Trump said made it harder to quickly roll out testing for the virus. \u201cThe Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we\u2019re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,\u201d he told reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, whom he had called to discuss the economic effects of the outbreak. \u201cThat was a decision we disagreed with,\u201d he said. I don\u2019t think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what decision, exactly, Trump is referring to. The Trump administration has been criticized for dismantling an Obama effort to respond to global health emergencies more quickly. The president has also come under fire for not rolling out widespread testing for coronavirus more quickly, and spreading false information about the disease. Bernie Sanders admitted he hadn\u2019t been as successful as he\u2019d hoped at galvanizing youth turnout. \u201cHave we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? And the answer is no,\u201d he said, speaking at his campaign headquarters in Vermont. \u201cWe\u2019re making some progress. But historically younger people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in. I think that will change in the general election.\u201d He told reporters he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the Super Tuesday results. \u201cOf course I\u2019m disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to win every state by a landslide. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d But he emphasized the importance of upcoming races Michigan and other midwestern states, where he and Joe Biden are competing to win over working-class voters \u2014 to whom both candidates seem to appeal. \u201cJoe and I are running very different campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my hope is that in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have.\u201d Hi, there! It\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. In a rare statement, Chief Justice John Roberts denounced comments from Senator Chuck Schumer, who spoke at a rally outside the Supreme Court as the court heard oral arguments in a case that could result in new restrictions on abortion access. \u201cJustices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,\u201d Roberts said. Schumer has said that Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 Trump\u2019s Supreme Court appointees \u2014 \u201cwon\u2019t know what hit\u201d them if they voted to uphold abortion restrictions. \u201cI want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,\u201d Schumer said. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House easily passed a bill aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. The bill, which lays out $8 billion in funding to combat the health threat, advanced to the Senate on a vote of 415 to 2. Mike Bloomberg delivered an emotional speech to supporters after suspending his presidential campaign and endorsing Joe Biden. The former New York mayor expressed pride in the race he ran, even though the billionaire candidate spent $500 million and failed to win a single Super Tuesday state. Bernie Sanders predicted he and Biden would be \u201cneck and neck\u201d in the nominating contest after California\u2019s delegates are allocated. Sanders was declared the winner of California, where 415 pledged delegates are up for grabs, as soon as polls closed, but Biden\u2019s 10 victories elsewhere will likely give him the lead in delegates. Elizabeth Warren said she was considering next steps for her campaign after a disappointing Super Tuesday performance. Warren\u2019s campaign manager said the Massachusetts senator was \u201ctalking with our team to assess the path forward.\u201d US markets rallied after Biden\u2019s strong Super Tuesday showing. After a string of market losses tied to concerns about coronavirus, investors appeared to breathe a sigh of relief about Sanders\u2019 sinking fortunes in the presidential primary. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Who were the two \u201cno\u201d votes on the House\u2019s coronavirus bill? Republican congressmen Ken Buck and Andy Biggs. The conservative lawmakers questioned the need for $8 billion in funding to combat the health threat. However, other House Republicans, including minority leader Kevin McCarthy, said the $2.5 billion originally requested by the White House was \u201ca little low.\u201d The House has passed the $8 billion bill aimed at combatting the spread of coronvirus with a vote of 415 to 2. The bill will now advance to the Senate, where it is also expected to easily pass. The $8 billion of funding laid out in the bill marks a significant increase from the $2.5 billion originally requested by the White House, reflecting escalating concern about the health threat. Some of congressman Matt Gaetz\u2019s House colleagues teased him about wearing a gas mask on to the House floor to vote on the coronvirus bill. The House is preparing to vote on its $8 billion bill aimed at combatting the spread of coronavirus. Congressman Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and one of the president\u2019s closest allies, drew attention to himself by wearing a gas mask on to the House floor as he prepared to vote. The $8 billion package, which marks a significant increase in spending from what the Trump administration originally proposed, is expected to pass the House and advance to the Senate. Here\u2019s a funny addendum to last night\u2019s coverage of the protest that disrupted Joe Biden\u2019s speech in Los Angeles: Symone Sanders, one of the former vice president\u2019s top aides, won Twitter praise after she physically grabbed one of the anti-dairy protesters and dragged her off stage. Sanders responded to the viral video by tweeting this: The top Biden adviser has now provided an update that she has made it to the salon to \u201crestore\u201d the nail: Following a string of losses tied to concerns about coronavirus, US markets surged the day after Joe Biden notched 10 victories in Super Tuesday states. Experts attributed the markets\u2019 rally to investors\u2019 relief about Bernie Sanders\u2019 sinking fortunes in the Democraic presidential primary. If reports of Steve Bullock\u2019s soon-to-be-launched Senate campaign are accurate, it would shift forecasts for the likely outcome of the Montana Senate race: Again, Democrats need to flip four Senate seats (or three seats and the White House) to take control of the chamber. Democratic senator Doug Jones is likely to lose his race in Alabama, given the conservative leanings of the state, so Bullock\u2019s candidacy would give a needed boost to Democratic hopes of taking back the Senate. Steve Bullock, the Montana governor and former Democratic presidential candidate, reportedly intends to run for Senate. The decision marks a reversal for Bullock, who spent months resisting Democratic overtures to challenge Republican incumbent Steve Daines. The New York Times reports: [Bullock] has told Democrats in the last week he is now inclined to run in what would immediately become one of the marquee Senate races of 2020. Mr. Bullock has only a few days to finalize his decision: the filing deadline to run in Montana is Monday. ... Bullock, who is barred by term limits from running for re-election this year, has faced one of the most sustained lobbying campaigns of any would-be Senate candidate \u2014 a reflection both of his potential as a candidate and how badly Democrats need to put another seat in play. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, flew to visit him in Montana last month. And when Mr. Bullock was in Washington last month for the meeting of the National Governors Association, he also met with former President Barack Obama, as was reported by Politico. Bullock\u2019s candidacy will bolster Democratic hopes of taking back the Senate in November. Democrats need to flip at least three Senate seats to regain the majority, four if they cannot win the White House. As a popular and well-known figure in Montana, Bullock will prove a formidable opponent for Daines, even though Trump is virtually guaranteed to carry the state in the presidential race. Senator Kamala Harris appears open to endorsing one of her former presidential primary rivals. Asked by a CBS News reporter on Capitol Hill whether she intended to endorse, the California senator said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Reports emerged in January that Harris, who dropped out of the primary in December, was considering an endorsement of Joe Biden. However, Harris did not wade back into the race before her state\u2019s Super Tuesday primary yesterday. Now that the primary is shaping up to be a two-candidate race between Biden and Bernie Sanders, Harris may be reconsidering her position. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s emotional address thanking supporters after suspending his presidential campaign came as a surprise to reporters who covered Bloomberg\u2019s tenure as mayor of New York. Getting a little emotional, Mike Bloomberg expressed his gratitude to supporters who helped power his short-lived campaign. \u201cNo matter what happened, this is the best day of my life, and tomorrow will be even better,\u201d the former New York mayor told the crowd. Bloomberg also invoked the imagery of Paul Revere hanging two lanterns in Boston\u2019s Old North Church to help Americans fighting the Revolutionary War to reflect on keeping hope alive in the country. \u201cWe will not allow any president to dim that light,\u201d Bloomberg said. Mike Bloomberg addressed supporters after suspending his campaign and endorsing Joe Biden. \u201cNot sure what to say, except thank you to everyone who tried to make a difference,\u201d Bloomberg said in New York. The former New York mayor celebrated the reach of his campaign, which he launched in late November. Bloomberg noted he had visited 73 cities in 27 states since announcing his candidacy and won 2 million votes yesterday, even though he did not win a single Super Tuesday state. \u201cYou really made history, you really did,\u201d Bloomberg told his supporters. \u201cNo campaign has accomplished as much as you did in such a short peiod of time.\u201d The billionaire candidate also applauded his team for pushing back against Trump\u2019s insults. \u201cEvery time he hit us, we hit back twice as hard,\u201d Bloomberg said. Bloomberg said he was now focused on \u201cvictory in November.\u201d \u201cNot victory for me or our campaign, but victory for the country,\u201d Bloomberg said. Turning to his endorsement of Biden, Bloomberg told the crowd, \u201cI will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life, and I hope you won\u2019t walk away either.\u201d Bernie Sanders said he still believes the presidential candidate with the most delegates should be the nominee, even if that person doesn\u2019t win a majority of pledged delegates. The Vermont senator made a similar comment during last month\u2019s debate in Las Vegas, but he was the undisputed frontrunner at the time. Now that Joe Biden appears to have taken the delegate lead, there was speculation that Sanders may change his tune, but he is sticking with his stance on the \u201cplurality vs. majority\u201d debate. For what it\u2019s worth, at the Las Vegas debate, every other presidential candidate, including Biden, said the nominee should have a majority of pledged delegates. If no one has a majority, they said, the rules of the convention should determine the nominee. Bernie Sanders appeared surprised by the news that Mike Bloomberg had dropped out of the presidential primary earlier today. \u201cFirst I heard about that,\u201d Sanders told a reporter who asked about the implications of Bloomberg\u2019s withdrawal and endorsement of Joe Biden. \u201cI suspect we will see a lot of money coming into Biden\u2019s campaign,\u201d Sanders said of Bloomberg\u2019s decision. \u201cProbably a lot of negative ads. That\u2019s what we\u2019re taking on.\u201d Bernie Sanders said he had talked to Elizabeth Warren earlier today, as the Massachusetts senator faces some calls to drop out of the race. Sanders said Warren had not made any decisions about the future of her campaign after she failed to win a single state on Super Tuesday. Sanders did not call on Warren to suspend her campaign, adding that he is \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the online vitriol directed at his Senate colleague. Bernie Sanders previewed the attacks he will unleash against Joe Biden now that the Democratic primary has effectively become a two-candidate race. Sanders cited Biden\u2019s support for international trade deals, opposition to Medicare for all and donations from billionaires as areas where the former vice president was vulnerable to criticism. Sanders said Biden, his former Senate colleague, was a \u201cdecent human being\u201d but has a \u201cvery different voting record\u201d than him. \u201cJoe and I are running very different campaigns,\u201d Sanders said. Turning to next week\u2019s primary in Michigan, where Sanders won in 2016, the candidate said his team has the \u201cfull expectation and the hope that we will win.\u201d However, Sanders acknowledged that he was disappointed in his performance yesterday. \u201cOf couse I\u2019m disappointed,\u201d Sanders told reporters, adding that he wished he could carry every state. Bernie Sanders opened his remarks to reporters in Vermont by thanking his supporters who delivered him victories in four states yesterday. Sanders predicted he and Joe Biden would be \u201cpretty close\u201d in the race for the nomination after California\u2019s 415 pledged delegates were allocated. \u201cWe go forward basically neck and neck,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat this campaign is increasingly about is, what side are you on?\u201d Sanders said, arguing his candidacy is aimed at taking on the \u201centire corporate establishment.\u201d Sanders also criticized the \u201cpolitical establishment,\u201d which he said was \u201cworking frantically to try to defeat us.\u201d The Vermont senator also bemoaned \u201cthe kind of venom we\u2019re seeing from corporate media,\u201d citing comments from former MSNBC host Chris Matthews comparing Sanders\u2019 campaign to the Nazi regime. The AP has now called every Super Tuesday race, and the final tally is: 10 state victories for Joe Biden. 4 state victories for Bernie Sanders. 0 state wins for Elizabeth Warren. 0 state wins for Mike Bloomberg, who has now dropped out. (But the billionaire did win the territory of American Samoa.) It\u2019s very important to remember that the margin of victory in each state will be crucial in determining Biden\u2019s net delegate gain from Super Tuesday. However, it\u2019s undeniable that those numbers were not what Sanders wanted out of Super Tuesday and certainly not what most political pundits were expecting a week ago. Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the primary in Maine, a state that was considered Bernie Sanders\u2019 to lose just days ago. With 95% of precincts reporting, Biden leads Sanders by just 1 point and a little over 2,000 votes. Given the incredibly narrow margin in the small state, Maine will not give Biden much of a net delegate gain over Sanders. However, the fact that Biden can declare victory in a state that went for Sanders by nearly 30 points in 2016 only gives the former vice president more momentum coming out of Super Tuesday. Trump addressed conerns about coronavirus while speaking at the Annual Latino Coalition Legislative Summit. \u201cWe\u2019re using every resource at our disposal,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThe heath and safety of our people is our first priority.\u201d Meanwhile, the House plans to vote on a nearly $8 billion package meant to prevent further spread of the virus in about two to three hours. As expected, the chair of the House homeland security committee is asking for an immediate review of whether Democratic presidential candidates merit Secret Service protection. Chairman Bennie Thompson wrote in a letter to congressional leaders and the acting secretary of the department of homeland security that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders appear to meet the criteria for a Secret Service detail. Bernie Sanders will deliver an update on his campaign in about 30 minutes from his headquarters in Burlington, Vermont. It\u2019s unclear what update the Vermont senator will offer, but a former top aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign predicted Sanders would come out swinging against Joe Biden after the former vice president\u2019s strong Super Tuesday performance: House Democrats are reportedly requesting Secret Service protection for presidential candidates, after two protesters ran onto the Los Angeles stage where Joe Biden was delivering his speech last night. Congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Biden\u2019s campaign, told reporters that Democratic lawmakers are \u201cworried\u201d about the safety of the candidates. Biden had so little security last night that, when two anti-dairy protesters charged the stage last night, Biden\u2019s wife and top aide were forced to help get the demonstrators off the stage. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt. Elizabeth Warren is facing calls to drop out of the race, after the Massachusetts senator failed to win a single Super Tuesday state. Allies of Bernie Sanders hope Warren\u2019s supporters will coalesce around him, the other progressive senator in the race, once she drops out, allowing him to run up the score against Joe Biden. However, it\u2019s important to note that many of Warren\u2019s voters have already drifted to Sanders, so those who are still supporting her may have reservations about both Sanders and Biden. It\u2019s hard to say how those voters will split once she\u2019s out of the race: Donald Trump held a meeting with airline chief executives earlier, where he claimed the coronavirus is \u201cprobably\u201d boosting some US businesses. \u201cA lot of people are staying in our country and they\u2019re shopping and using our hotels in this country, so from that standpoint I think probably there\u2019s a positive impact,\u201d Trump said. He did not provide date for this claim. \u201cBut there\u2019s also an impact on overseas travel which will be fairly substantial.\u201d \u2022Mike Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race, and endorsed Joe Biden. \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible \u2013 and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists,\u201d Bloomberg said in a statement. \u2022The billionaire former mayor of New York City spent about $500m on his campaign, but won just 44 delegates on Super Tuesday. Bloomberg said he would now work to elect Biden, who: \u201cHas fought for working people his whole life\u201d. \u2022Elizabeth Warren seems to be weighing dropping out of the race. Her campaign manager, Roger Lau, wrote to staff this morning saying Warren is taking time to \u201cassess the path forward\u201d. The Massachusetts senator, who once led the polls, failed to win a single state on Tuesday. \u2022Biden is basking in the glow of victory after his strong performance last night. The former vice-president is due to attend a fundraiser in Los Angeles today, and as the only remaining centrist he can expect the cash to start flowing in. \u2022Super Tuesday was slightly disappointing for Bernie Sanders, but the Vermont senator isn\u2019t quitting the race any time soon. Sanders has a rally in Phoenix, Arizona tomorrow, and another in Michigan on Friday. As we follow the tumult of the Democratic campaign, there is serious business going on in Washington DC, where the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments in case that could result in grave new restrictions on abortion access. My colleague Lauren Aratani is covering the case of June Medical Service LLC v Russo, the first major abortion case to be heard by the new conservative majority supreme court. The conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were appointed to the court by Donald Trump. Lauren writes: The case stems from a state law in Louisiana that requires doctors to be registered to a state-authorized hospital within 30 miles of an abortion clinic in order to be permitted to perform abortions. The state law is meant to heavily restrict access to abortion. Chief justice John Roberts has set himself up to be a key decider in the case as one of the only potential swing votes on the court. The main question Roberts seemed to be hung on is the similarity of this case versus one the court ruled on in 2016 (which struck down an identical law in Texas). There are both pro-choice and anti-abortion rallies taking place outside the Supreme Court as the judges listen to the arguments. Mike Bloomberg, we hardly knew ye. Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign is planning to assess the candidate\u2019s path forward, following a disappointing performance in the set of primary contests that voted on Tuesday. In the email to staff, obtained by the Guardian, Warren\u2019s campaign manager Roger Lau wrote: \u201cWe are obviously disappointed, and we are going to announce shortly that Elizabeth is talking to the team to assess the path forward. All of us have worked for Elizabeth long enough to know that she isn\u2019t a lifetime politician and doesn\u2019t think like one. She\u2019s going to take time right now to think through the right way to continue this fight.\u201d Lau\u2019s email comes after an undeniably bad night for Warren. She won none of the Super Tuesday states and came away with only 50 delegates. Former vice-president Joe Biden came out of the night with 453 and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders got 382. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot at stake for this country and the millions of people who are falling further and further behind. This decision is in her hands, and it\u2019s important that she has the time and space to consider what comes next.\u201d Some hot takes are coming in on Bloomberg\u2019s drop out. One thing that\u2019s clear is his current total of 44 delegates, per Associated Press, didn\u2019t come cheap. By my reckoning \u2013 and I have an A-level in Mathematics \u2013 Bloomberg\u2019s ~$500m expenditure equates to at least $11.3m per delegate. Of course, Bloomberg is only the second billionaire to drop out of the Democratic primary. The former hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer withdrew on Saturday, having spent $250m of his own money in return for zero delegates. Of course, Bloomberg is only the second billionaire to drop out of the Democratic primary. The former hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer withdrew on Saturday, having spent $250m of his own money in return for zero delegates. Well that was quick \u2013 moments after we learn that Mike Bloomberg has dropped out, we discover the billionaire has thrown his weight behind Joe Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday\u2019s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,\u201d Bloomberg said in a statement announcing the suspension of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve known Joe for a very long time. I know his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country \u2013 including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs. \u201cI\u2019ve had the chance to work with Joe on those issues over the years, and Joe has fought for working people his whole life. Today I am glad to endorse him \u2013 and I will work to make him the next President of the United States. Bloomberg won 44 delegates on Super Tuesday, but didn\u2019t carry any of the 14 states on offer. (He did triumph in American Samoa, where his 175 votes were enough for 49.9% of the total.) The former New York City mayor, who is worth about $60bn, spent more than $500m on his campaign, much of it on flashy tv and online adverts. Bloomberg\u2019s spending brought him a boost in the polls, but he and his campaign were dismantled during the recent Democratic debates \u2013 by Elizabeth Warren in particular \u2013 and seem to have never recovered. \u201cThree months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump \u2013 because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,\u201d Bloomberg said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday\u2019s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible \u2013 and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.\u201d After Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race over the weekend, Bloomberg was the remaining moderate challenger to Biden. All three have now endorsed the former vice-president, with Bloomberg\u2019s exit seemingly clearing the path for Biden in the states yet to vote. Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, is suspending his presidential campaign, according to reports. Axios reports that Bloomberg will make the announcement today. He has spent more than $500m on his campaign, but failed to make a breakthrough on Super Tuesday. US stocks jumped more than 2% this morning, according to Reuters: \u201cAs investors cheered Joe Biden\u2019s surprise lead in the Democratic primaries.\u201d Moments after markets opened, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 620 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up by 1.6%. CNBC reports: Biden\u2019s performance boosted stocks of health-care companies such as UnitedHealth, one of the largest health insurers in the United States and whose equity is sometimes viewed as a bellwether during political debates around the industry. The stock rose 10 percent in extended trading Tuesday night. It makes sense, given Biden\u2019s healthcare proposal would keep private insurance \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan would abolish it, which would be Not Very Good for health insurance companies. The self-help guru and former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson is not happy about last night\u2019s results. Early this morning she described Joe Biden\u2019s Super Tuesday performance as the result of \u201ca coup\u201d. Williamson endorsed Bernie Sanders in February, and has some advice for any fellow supporters feeling disappointed today. Bernie Sanders has pumped out a cheeky ad this morning linking himself to Barack Obama. \u201cBernie is somebody who has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless,\u201d Obama intones in the campaign advert, over video of the former president palling around with Sanders. The ad, which has some suspect audio-editing \u2013 take a look around the 24 second mark \u2013 scans rather like an endorsement from Obama... who is yet to endorse anyone in the race. Ps \u2013 this is Adam Gabbatt taking over from Paul Owen, hello! If you\u2019re waking up in the US after a late-night tracking the Super Tuesday results, here\u2019s a summary of probably the most consequential night of the 2020 presidential race so far. Former vice-president Joe Biden has reclaimed his frontrunner status in the Democratic race, winning in at least nine of the 14 states up for grabs, including Texas and Massachusetts, the home state of Elizabeth Warren, another contender. Only Maine is left to declare. But Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator who is Biden\u2019s main competitor, was way ahead in California \u2013 which, with 415 delegates, is by far the largest state. Once all the delegates are divided up \u2013 which could take days or weeks \u2013 Sanders could end up coming out of Super Tuesday with a very similar number of delegates to his centrist rival. This seems to be the end of the line for Warren \u2013 and whether she now endorses Sanders will be keenly watched \u2013 and for Bloomberg, who has got very little return from the half a billion dollars he pumped into his campaign. The billionaire former New York mayor is apparently due to discuss whether to continue with his advisers on Wednesday. The Democratic race seems now to have clarified and become a straight contest between Sanders and Biden, who are likely to slug it out week by week through the next sets of primaries all the way to the Democratic convention in July. Biden\u2019s comeback has revived speculation about a so-called \u201ccontested convention\u201d. If no candidate has got a majority of delegates by the time of the convention, party bigwigs get to play a role. Most of them are terrified of Sanders winning and they may well give the crown to Biden \u2013 even if Sanders is ahead at that point. It\u2019s unlikely Sanders\u2019 supporters would take that lying down. This contest is a long way from being over. Forgive and forget doesn\u2019t really seem to be in Trump\u2019s vocabulary. Here\u2019s how he greeted the news that his former attorney general Jeff Sessions failed to win back his Alabama Senate seat in one fell swoop and will instead face a run-off: You can refamiliarise yourself with the contents of the Mueller report here. One of America\u2019s most enthusiastic political commentators has swung in with his early-morning take on the Super Tuesday results. Donald Trump continued with his attempts to make the case that the Democratic establishment is ganging up to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination \u2013 a suspicion shared by many of Sanders\u2019 supporters. In my view Trump needs to be careful how far he goes portraying Bernie as a valiant outsider. If Sanders becomes the nominee, Trump may find he has lost his edge as the one candidate intent on smashing the system. Trump then moves more into gossip-mag territory ... Elizabeth Warren must also be considering her future, especially after coming third in her home state of Massachusetts. But her campaign was certainly putting on a brave face last night, firing out a bullish email that said: \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: There are six more primaries just one week away, and we need your help to keep up the momentum.\u201d The email adds: \u201cSix more states are voting a week from today on March 10. Can you chip in now as results are coming so we can get to work earning more votes and more delegates?\u201d According to Politico, the mood in her campaign is \u201cbleak\u201d, however. The campaign also has financial constraints that come with a unionized staff of over 1,000 people \u2014 the largest field operation in the race besides Mike Bloomberg\u2019s \u2014 even after raising $29 million in February. With a payroll at over $6 million per month, the campaign likely needs to keep at least several million dollars on hand to cover paychecks, benefits, and other assorted shutdown costs to avoid going into debt. Warren was able to raise a significant amount of that money with her strong debate performances, but there is not another debate until March 15. Axios has more on what Bloomberg might do today as he licks his wounds following last night\u2019s ultra-expensive electoral flop. Look for Bloomberg to drop out as soon as this morning, and try to save face by promising to spend a helluva lot more to defeat President Trump with someone other than him. Bloomberg returned to New York after speaking in West Palm Beach last night. Sources expect him to address staff at his headquarters today. He doesn\u2019t want history to remember him as the spoiler who helps Sanders win the nomination, or hands re-election to Trump. Not all of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s $500m went to waste. He won the US territory of American Samoa, with 49.9% of the vote. The chain of islands in the middle of the Pacific has a population of around 56,000 and provides six delegates for the Democratic race. The billionaire businessman and former New York mayor had other pockets of success \u2013 some of them in comically friendly territory for the super-rich. In Colorado, Bloomberg won Pitkin County, home of the Aspen ski resort, while in Napa Valley wine country in California he came a close second to Sanders, with 23.9% to 24.7%. But so far he has failed to win a single county in California, the state in which he spent so much money on TV ads. Maine is the last state to due to be called by AP. With 81% reporting, Biden is ahead by a whisker with 34% to Sanders\u2019 33%. The state has only 24 delegates up for grabs though. Meanwhile people are still voting in California and Texas, which have been plagued by long lines and delays. In California and Texas anyone in line at the time polls close must be allowed to vote. Texas is nearly there with 93% of the vote reported. Biden has been declared the winner by the Associated Press \u2013 the gurus in this field \u2013 with 34% to Sanders\u2019 30%. In California, only 43% of the vote has been counted, but the AP also called that race due to the size of Sanders\u2019 lead. So far he\u2019s ahead with 31% to Biden\u2019s 22%. Sanders\u2019 success in California \u2013 which with 415 delegates is by far the largest state voting last night (and generally) \u2013 means he remains in contention for the nomination. So far the AP estimates he has 382 delegates in total to Biden\u2019s 453. The US has an ongoing problem with long lines on polling day \u2013 much of it linked to deliberate voter suppression. The Guardian reported yesterday that Texas leads the US south in closing down the most polling stations. Here\u2019s more on what would probably be a nightmare for Democrats: a contested convention. This is basically when no candidate gets a majority on the first ballot, and party bigwigs (\u201csuperdelegates\u201d) get to swing in and take part in another round of voting. Sanders\u2019 supporters fear that even if he was ahead in the first round, the superdelegates would hand the nomination to Biden. Adam Gabbatt has the full details: What is Super Tuesday again? We\u2019re in the middle of the race to decide which Democrat will face Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November. Each state gets a vote, and yesterday a big group of states \u2013 including two of the largest, California and Texas \u2013 got to have their say. Who was the favourite going into Super Tuesday and why? Bernie Sanders, the leftwing senator from Vermont, had been the favourite since his landslide victory in Nevada in February, but former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina and the withdrawal of Biden\u2019s fellow centrists Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar meant it suddenly became an extremely close-run thing. Sanders was hoping to fend off Biden and cement his status as indisputable frontrunner. Biden was hoping for a strong enough showing to make the case that he can pull ahead of Sanders, unite the centrist wing, and eventually win the race. So what happened? Biden had a great night and has probably reclaimed his former status as frontrunner from Sanders. He won in at least nine of the 14 states up for grabs, including Texas, and he beat Elizabeth Warren, another leftwing contender, in Massachusetts, her home state. But Sanders looks to be way ahead in California. Once all the delegates are divided up \u2013 which could take days or weeks \u2013 Sanders could end up coming out of Super Tuesday with a very similar number of delegates to his centrist rival. What seems clear is that this is now a two-horse race between Sanders and Biden. So no one has won yet? No \u2026 The race goes on. There is another set of primaries next week which Sanders hopes will give him another boost. But it may be that Sanders and Biden now slug it out state by state, week after week, all the way to the Democratic convention in July. If no candidate has got a majority of delegates by the time of the convention, party bigwigs get to play a role. Most of them are terrified of Sanders winning and they are likely to give the crown to Biden \u2013 even if Sanders is ahead at that point. If that happens, Sanders\u2019 supporters will be absolutely furious and many may refuse to vote for Biden in the general election. What happened to Mike Bloomberg? The former New York mayor has spent about half a billion dollars on his campaign ads so far \u2013 a record-breaking amount. But he\u2019s worth $60bn. To put that in context, that\u2019s the equivalent of someone whose net worth is $10 grand, say, spending $1 on the election. It\u2019s nowhere close to breaking the bank for him. That said, there will be a great deal of pressure on him now to give way and back Biden too. He won his first two elections as mayor of New York as a Republican and he is not a fan of Sanders and his socialist platform, to put it mildly. He is apparently planning to hunker down with his advisers on Wednesday and decide what to do next. What about Elizabeth Warren? On paper Warren could have been the ideal candidate to unite the liberal and centrist wings of the party but she only really cut through in her powerful attacks on Bloomberg. She has been squeezed out by Sanders on the left, and it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that sexism has also played a role. Her campaign suggested last week that she would keep fighting and hope to be handed the crown at the convention if Sanders fails to win a majority of delegates. But that may be untenable and after coming third in her home state this is probably the end of the road for her. The big question is whether she will throw her weight behind Sanders or Biden. Liberals have often fantasised about Sanders making Warren his vice-president and you\u2019ll hear a lot about that again now. Whether he will or not I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a near-certainty that both Sanders and Biden intend to choose a female VP if they get that far. What does Trump think? Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in the Democratic race and kept up a running commentary on Twitter. He constantly tears into Biden and Bloomberg on Twitter, but is much kinder to Sanders \u2013 stirring the pot by claiming that the Democratic establishment is rigging the race against the Vermont socialist. It seems clear that he wants Sanders to win the race and thinks he\u2019d beat him. So when will the Democrats decide on a nominee? The primaries continue next week with contests in Michigan, Mississippi and Washington state, among other places. But this is looking like a battle between Bernie and Biden that will go down to the wire \u2013 so we may still be talking about this contest in July. Oliver Laughland has just left the Texas Democratic party headquarters in Austin after a long night, just as Joe Biden declared a major victory for his campaign there. Texas is the second largest state to vote on Super Tuesday with 228 pledged delegates at stake here. It\u2019s worth noting that while Biden has been declared the victor this evening, it\u2019s the margin of victory that really matters as that will determine (via a number of complicated processes) just how many delegates Biden picks up. The executive director of the Texas Democrats, Manny Garcia came to give us (and by us I mean the last three reporters left in the building) a quick briefing before he headed home. He said he expects the delegate count to be declared early Wednesday afternoon as the party waits for full results to come in from Texas\u2019s 254 counties, all of which administer their own elections here. Garcia also spent a significant amount of time addressing the long lines at various polling stations throughout the state, an issue that could come to plague the party at the general election, where the party see a small opportunity to make this deep red state competitive. In a statement the party hailed the high turnout that characterized this primary, but argued the long lines - some of which left voters queuing past 11pm - underline the need for state electoral reform. \u201cWe need major improvements across the board: more resources to assist county and state elections officials and increased access to voting. This year will see the highest turnout in Texas history with millions of new voters casting their ballots. We cannot have these long waits happen again in November,\u201d the statement says. This is Paul Owen taking the reins after the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries \u2013 probably the most consequential night of the 2020 presidential race so far. Former vice-president Joe Biden has swept back into contention for frontrunner status in the Democratic race, winning in at least nine of the 14 states up for grabs, including a surprise victory in Massachusetts, the home state of Elizabeth Warren, another contender. The Associated Press has just declared him the winner in Texas, the second biggest state that voted last night. But Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator who is Biden\u2019s main competitor, looks to be way ahead in California \u2013 which, with 415 delegates, is by far the largest state. Once all the delegates are divided up \u2013 which could take days or weeks \u2013 Sanders could end up coming out of Super Tuesday with a very similar number of delegates to his centrist rival. This seems to be the end of the line for Warren \u2013 and whether she now endorses Sanders will be keenly watched \u2013 and for Bloomberg, who has got very little return from the half a billion dollars he pumped into his campaign. The billionaire former New York mayor is apparently due to discuss whether to continue with his advisers on Wednesday. The Democratic race seems now to have clarified and become a straight contest between Sanders and Biden, who are likely to slug it out week by week through the next sets of primaries all the way to the Democratic convention in July. Biden\u2019s comeback has revived speculation about a so-called \u201ccontested convention\u201d. If no candidate has got a majority of delegates by the time of the convention, party bigwigs get to play a role. Most of them are terrified of Sanders winning and they may well give the crown to Biden \u2013 even if Sanders is ahead at that point. It\u2019s unlikely Sanders\u2019 supporters would take that lying down. This contest is a long way from being over. Joe Biden has officially been declared the winner of the Texas primary, narrowly edging out Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich state. The AP called the race moments ago, about five hours after most of Texas\u2019 polling places closed. Texas was considered one of the biggest prizes of the night, not just because of its 228 pledged delegates but also because of how the state\u2019s results were expected to reflect larger dynamics in the fight for the Democratic nomination: Joe Biden declared victory in Texas, even though the AP has not yet called the state. The former vice president celebrated the Texas results in a tweet that parodied the logo of the popular burger chain Whataburger, where Biden stopped with former rival-turned-endorser Beto O\u2019Rourke last night: With about 77% of Texas precincts reporting, Biden currently leads Bernie Sanders by about 3 points and 60,000 votes. Looking ahead to the next contests: six states will hold primaries next Tuesday, March 10. Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will head to the polls and collextively award 352 pledged delegates. It could be a good night for Bernie Sanders, considering he won Idaho, Michigan, North Dakota and Washington in 2016. But a new poll showed Sanders falling nearly 7 points behind Joe Biden in Michigan, the most delegate-rich state holding a primary next week. Bernie Sanders is also losing a key argument for his candidacy tonight: that he can increase turnout more than any of his competitors. The state of Virginia, where Joe Biden won decisively, offered a harsh reality check on Sanders\u2019 talking point tonight. Virginia has been viewed as a crucial swing state in recent years, but it has become increasngly Democratic as the state\u2019s DC suburbs lean more to the left. Tonight, the turnout in Virginia was nearly double that of the 2016 Democratic primary between Sanders and Hillary Clinton. The result of that increased turnout? Sanders lost to Biden by about 30 points. Joe Biden\u2019s team pointed to his victories tonight as evidence of his popularity among Democratic voters. When asked how the former vice-president had managed to win in states he had paid almost no attention to, like Tennessee, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told CNN, \u201cIt is the power of Joe Biden. It is the fact that people know him.\u201d On the flip side, Biden\u2019s success tonight raises questions about the effectiveness of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s massive advertising spending and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s vast field organization: The blog has already covered how Joe Biden\u2019s senior aide, Symone Sanders, won Twitter praise for jumping up to confront an anti-dairy protester who ran onto the stage tonight as the former vice president addressed supporters in Los Angeles. But it should be noted that former second lady Jill Biden also confronted one of the protesters who rushed the stage, as the below photo vividly demonstrates. The incident may have sparked some viral tweets, but it also raised concerns about whether top presidential candidates, like Biden and Bernie Sanders, need Secret Service protection. Some voters in Texas have been waiting for five hours to cast their ballots, as the state\u2019s primary remains too close to call. Long lines at polling places are often celebrated as a sign of voter enthusiasm, but a number of Democratic strategists pointed out they are also a clear sign of voter suppression. From a former National Security Council spokesman for Barack Obama: Former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders, described tonight\u2019s results as a \u201ccoup\u201d in a now-deleted tweet. Some of Sanders\u2019 allies have complained about moderate Democrats\u2019 efforts to consolidate their support around Joe Biden in recent days. Speaking to supporters in Vermont earlier tonight, Sanders pledged to take on the \u201cpolitical establishment\u201d as the party\u2019s nominee, but there\u2019s no question that Biden\u2019s wins tonight have dealt a serious blow to Sanders\u2019 presidential ambitions. The Guardian\u2019s Maanvi Singh reports from San Francisco: The mood has been a bit confused here in San Francisco. At Manny\u2019s \u2013 a local bar and gathering place - many patrons cheered as soon as it became clear that Bernie Sanders would win the state. But some Sanders supporters felt uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit disappointed and nervous,\u201d said Delia Cleveland, 40. \u201cI\u2019d hoped he\u2019d have a bigger lead.\u201d Kyle Schmolze, 30, said he was feeling \u201call the emotions\u201d. \u201cI feel better about progressive politics than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might actually win.\u201d But Joe Biden\u2019s wins didn\u2019t feel good, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying. I\u2019d feel safe had Bernie dominated.\u201d Joe Biden has taken a narrow lead in Texas, where 228 pledged delegates are up for grabs. With 63% of precincts reporting, Biden is at 30%, leading Bernie Sanders by 1 point and about 18,000 votes. Those numbers indicate the final result in Texas could be quite close, so Biden may not get much of a delegate advantage over Sanders from the state. On the other hand, California, the most delegate-rich state of the night, was immediately called for Sanders once polls closed, so he could have a significant delegate edge over Biden there. Here\u2019s some non-presidential primary news: Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s former attorney general, has advanced to a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama. Sessions and Tommy Tuberville, the former football coach at Auburn University, will face off on March 31 to determine Republicans\u2019 Senate nominee after both candidates failed to hit 50% in tonight\u2019s primary. Sessions represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, but he left his seat in 2017, when Trump nominated him to be attorney general. However, Trump soured on Sessions after he recused himself from the Russia investigation, clearing the way for the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Sessions is now fighting to get his old job back, but he will need to defeat Tuberville -- not to mention incumbent Democratic senator Doug Jones -- to do so. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar appeared to criticize Elizabeth Warren for not dropping out of the race as Joe Biden notched several victories in Super Tuesday states: Omar, one of the four progressive congresswomen known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d, is a top surrogate for Bernie Sanders, and Warren will likely face increasing calls from his supporters to suspend her campaign after tonight. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports from Los Angeles: An ebullient Joe Biden bounded on stage in Los Angeles, accompanied by his wife, Jill, and his \u201clittle sister,\u201d who he mixed up before quickly correcting himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a good night and it seems to be getting better,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey don\u2019t call it Super Tuesday for nothing.\u201d At the start of his remarks, Biden ticked through all the states he\u2019s won so far: Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Minnesota and \u201cmaybe even Massachusetts.\u201d After he left the stage, the Associated Press declared Biden the winner in an upset over Elizabeth Warren. \u201cJust a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead. And then came South Carolina came around and they had something to say about it. And then when he got to Super Tuesday it\u2019d be over. Well it may be over for the other guy.\u201d \u201cWe are very much alive,\u201d he declared. Biden thanked the former presidential candidates who endorsed him this week \u2013 Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 but he did not mention any of his present rivals by name. \u201cPeople are talking about a revolution,\u201d he said, taking an implicit jab at Bernie Sanders, who entered Tuesday as the prohibitive frontrunner. \u201cWell, we started a movement.\u201d Protesters rushed the stage at Joe Biden\u2019s event in Los Angeles, raising concerns about security for the leading presidential candidates. Two anti-dairy protesters, who have disrupted other candidates\u2019 events in recent days, ran on to the stage and had to be dragged off by some of Biden\u2019s staffers. Symone Sanders, one of Biden\u2019s top aides, actually jumped from her seat to grab the second protester and pull her offstage. Sanders won praise on social media for her courage, and she joked about the incident over Twitter: But the incident raised questions about whether the top candidates like Biden and Bernie Sanders should start receiving Secret Service protection: Here\u2019s how the AP was able to call the California primary so quickly for Bernie Sanders: News outlets conduct exit polls of voters to get a sense of which way a race is leaning. If those exit polls point to a decisive victory, the outlet may declare a winner right when the polls close. That\u2019s what happened in South Carolina on Saturday, and we\u2019ve seen it again tonight in states like Virginia and Vermont. The fact that the AP, the outlet of record for elections, was able to call California so quickly for Sanders indicates the Vermont senator will likely have a significant margin of victory in the delegate-rich state. Bernie Sanders\u2019 victory in California marks an incredible comeback for the Vermont senator, who lost the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Clinton defeated Sanders in California by 7 points in 2016, giving her a 33-delegate advantage in the state. However, even that single-digit margin was better than Sanders\u2019 team had initially expected. Early results showed Clinton easily defeating Sanders by double digits. Exit polls indicate Bernie Sanders has about a 15-point lead in California, the most delegate-rich state of the entire Democratic primary. If Sanders can maintain that lead, it will help him to counteract the post-South Carolina bounce that Joe Biden has clearly been enjoying tonight. However, it will be days if not weeks before we know Sanders\u2019 exact margin of victory because California has a slow vote-reporting operation, due to its large size and high rates of early voting. The polls just closed in California, but the AP has already called the state for Bernie Sanders, giving the Vermont senator a much-needed boost tonight. Sanders had been favored to win in California, where 415 pledged delegates were up for grabs. The margin of Sanders\u2019 victory in California will be crucial in helping him secure a delegate lead over Joe Biden, but his immediate win in the delegate-rich state will give him some positive press coverage on a night that seemed to be going very well for his rival. It is 11 pm ET, so the polls have officially closed in California, the biggest prize of the night. Bernie Sanders is still favored to win in California, where 415 pledged delegates are up for grabs. The Vermont senator may benefit from the fact that California has a robust early-voting operation, so Joe Biden may not see as much of a post-South Carolina bounce there as he has seen in other states tonight. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports from Charlotte, North Carolina: Democratic Congresswoman Alma Adams was celebrating at a watch party for Joe Biden supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where each state victory was greeted with cheers. Asked why African American supporters back Biden so strongly, Adams said: \u201cFirst of all, we know Joe. We know we share his vision. We trust him and that\u2019s the thing. We know that he\u2019s always been a Democrat so we don\u2019t have to wonder about where he really is in terms of party affiliation and that kind of thing. \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of trust and knowing that he has the skill set to do what we need for him to do. We trust him, we love him and so that\u2019s why we vote for him.\u201d Adams was critical of Bernie Sanders\u2019 attempts to engage with the African American community. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the same voice or vision for our folks. I don\u2019t know how much work he\u2019s done in the African American community but I\u2019ll tell you, he\u2019s been in my district twice that I know about and no one from his campaign ever called me. \u201cHe never called me and I am the congresswoman for this district. That\u2019s certainly not a good look.\u201d Joe Biden has won the primary in Massachusetts, the home state of Elizabeth Warren where Bernie Sanders was favored to win just days ago. With 59% of results in, Biden was at 34%, leading Sanders by 7 points and Warren by 14 points. Biden\u2019s victory in Massachusetts underscores that his wins tonight have been far-reaching, extending from the south to the midwest and now the northeast. Warren\u2019s apparent third-place finish raises serious questions about the future of her candidacy, as she has also failed to hit 15%, the minimum to win delegates, in states like Virginia. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports from San Diego: Like many California cities, San Diego has in recent years been losing its black residents, who now make up just 6.5% of the population. But in Southeast San Diego, a historically black part of the city, a steady stream of voters strolled into their polling place at the Malcolm X Library Tuesday afternoon. After a strong showing in South Carolina, observers have been watching to see if Joe Biden can capitalize on the victory and garner support of black voters. As I talked to voters trickling in to cast their ballots, however, no noticeable groundswell emerged in support of any of the candidates. Bakir, an area resident, said he wasn\u2019t excited about any of the Democratic options. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more about who you take out than who you put into the White House,\u201d Bakir said, referring to Trump. Joel Pagan, 38, was still undecided. He considered Mike Bloomberg, but says he\u2019s now thinking Biden. \u201cI\u2019m leaning toward Joe,\u201d says Joel Pagan, 38. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the candidate who will do the most for the black community.\u201d Bloomberg picked up a surprise endorsement from the area\u2019s assemblywoman, Shirley Weber, a Democratic who\u2019s pushed fiercely for accountability for police and schools. Despite the stop-and-frisk policies Bloomberg implemented as mayor of NYC \u2014 a record that\u2019s been roundly criticized \u2014 Weber told the San Diego-Union Tribune that she was impressed with his \u201cGreenwood Initiative,\u201d a plan that would lead to a million black homeowners and 100,000 new black-owned businesses in the next 10 years. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign released a statement saying the Super Tuesday results will create \u201cmore chaos\u201d for Democrats. \u201cThe results only increase the likelihood that no candidate will have enough delegates for a first ballot victory at their convention, which only means more chaos!\u201d said campaign manager Brad Parscale. The president\u2019s campaign also sought to equate Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, even though the two differ on a number of key policy issues. Even if Bernie is not on November\u2019s ballot, his big government socialist ideas will be because they have become mainstream in today\u2019s Democrat Party,\u201d Parscale said. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports from Fresno, California: Erica Sanchez, 48, and her mother, Maria Sanchez, 68, both voted for Joe Biden today in Fresno, California, a diverse city of half a million people in California\u2019s Central Valley. Their vote for Biden was a vote for \u201cnormalcy,\u201d Maria said. \u201cHe\u2019s been there before,\u201d Erica said. \u201cHe knows how to get the job done.\u201d Maria and Erica, both themselves blunt talkers, said they like Biden\u2019s frankness. They feel that they can trust him, that he has integrity. Many people in their family have served and are currently serving overseas in the US military, which they said is more than either Trump or his own children have done. Maria\u2019s parents were Mexican immigrants, farmworkers. Erica said she also has Native American ancestry. The past three years, since Trump\u2019s election, have brought a level of tension and division to the United States that Erica said seems like worst the country has seen since the Civil War. They both want that to be over, and to have a president who can heal the country. Erica\u2019s 24-year-old daughter is a Bernie Sanders supporter, but her two sons, who are both in their 20s, had been talking about following their grandmother\u2019s lead, and voting for Biden, Erica said. Bernie Sanders has won the primary in Utah, where polls closed about half an hour ago. With 36% of results in, Sanders is at 32%, putting him 13 points ahead of Mike Bloomberg and 17 points ahead of Elizabeth Warren. Joe Biden, who is so far the biggest winner of the night, is suprisingly in fourth place in Utah. Sanders similarly won the Utah caucuses in 2016, defeating Hillary Clinton by a resounding 60 points. However, Utah only has 29 pledged delegates, so his victory there won\u2019t help him much. The biggest prizes of the night, California and Texas, have not yet been called. Trump is reveling in Mike Bloomberg\u2019s disappointing performance tonight, saying the former New York mayor had thrown hundreds of millions of dollars \u201cdown the drain.\u201d Trump and Bloomberg have repeatedly sparred over social media, trading insults about each other\u2019s height and intelligence. But it is undeniable Bloomberg has severely underperformed tonight, and the billionaire candidate reportedly intends to reassess his campaign tomorrow. The Guardian\u2019s Maanvi Singh reports from San Francisco: At a watch party in San Francisco, the gasps and shrieks cut through the din as results from Colorado, Vermont and Texas come in. At Manny\u2019s, a bar and event space in San Francisco\u2019s Mission district, the crowd skews progressive. Many of the patrons are carrying Bernie Sanders placards \u2014 and donning Sanders swag. Joe Biden\u2019s successes in the south and east, where polls have already closed have worried many of the Sanders supporters here. \u201cI\u2019m a little anxious,\u201d said Christina Lopez, 28. \u201cBut it\u2019s early. There\u2019s hope.\u201d Lopez was initially an Elizabeth Warren supporter but cast her ballot for Sanders when it became clear he was a front runner. \u201cIt was strategic,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope Warren votes don\u2019t cost him a sweep here.\u201d Chants of \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d broke out as Sanders\u2019 speech from Colorado blared though Bars sound system. Ilona Pelaez, 29, said she\u2019d vote for Biden in the general if it came down to it. \u201cI guess I kind of have to,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it sucks.\u201d Joe Biden will undoubtedly see a fundraising bump from his victories tonight, and one of his donors may come as a bit of a surprise. George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, tweeted that he had donated the individual maximum to Biden. Conway has been a frequent critic of the president, even though his wife works for him, and he has now apparently joined Team Biden. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports from Fresno, California: I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen anything as perfectly, beautifully American as the drive-thru polling station today in downtown Fresno, California. Just pull your car up to the polling station, hand over your (already filled-in) ballot, get your \u201cI voted\u201d sticker, and then cruise away. And yes, you actually have to have filled out your ballot already \u2013 you don\u2019t get a fresh one in line and vote in your car. It\u2019s a ballot drop-off Drive Thru, not a full service, polling-station-in-your-car. Still, it\u2019s pretty fun to watch. And voters like it, too. \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d I heard one woman exclaim from her car. Poll worker Holly Brown said the downtown Fresno drive-thru I visited was one of ten total in Fresno County, in California\u2019s Central Valley. (Other counties in California have \u201cDrive-up Democracy\u201d as well.) Brown said she had been setting up at that drive-thru location since 5.30am, and that their location had been steadily busy since the polls opened \u2013 not crowded, but consistent traffic even through the middle of the day. In all, she said, they had collected more than 3,000 drive-thru ballots, and counting, just at that location. And voters really want that \u201cI voted\u201d sticker, she said \u2013 even if they don\u2019t have to get out of their cars. Bernie Sanders has taken the stage at his rally in Burlington, Vermont, as results indicate Joe Biden has won at least seven Super Tuesday states. \u201cTonight I tell you with absolutely confidence: we\u2019re gonna win the Democratic nomination,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country.\u201d Sanders promised to defeat the \u201cpolitical establishment,\u201d even as Sanders trailed Biden in the Super Tuesday results. Sanders has so far only won two states tonight, his home state of Vermont and Colorado, but the biggest prizes of Texas and California have not yet been called. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine and Oliver Laughland report: Texas voters in some parts of the state waited in extremely long lines Tuesday, some for several hours, to cast a ballot in the state\u2019s primary elections. Even after polls officially closed Tuesday, the website for the Travis County Clerk showed wait times as long as two hours at the University of Texas at Austin. Voters can cast a ballot as long as they remain in line. At one location on campus, students had been waiting in line for more than an hour. A pollworker said 2,200 people had voted there that day. The last student in line to vote was Sam Oh, a senior studying mechanical engineering. \u201cI planned this out,\u201d said Oh, who had been waiting an hour and a half. \u201cBut definitely this kind of a wait will keep people away.\u201d In Harris County, home of Houston, civil rights groups said minority voters faced excessively long wait times. One voter, Ahmed King, went to five different voting locations before he successfully cast a ballot, according to a statement from the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cI was at the point of not voting at all. I was at my limit. I said to myself, \u2018My vote will not count today,\u2019\u201d King said in a statement. Mike Bloomberg reportedly intends to reassess the future of his campaign tomorrow, as Super Tuesday results indicate a disappointing showing for the former New York mayor. Bloomberg spent $500 million advertising and building field operations in states like Virginia and North Carolina, where Biden won decisive victories. A number of moderate Democrats were already calling on Bloomberg to drop out of the race to allow Biden to further consolidate his support, and those demands will certainly only intensify after tonight. The AP has just called Arkansas for Joe Biden as well, marking his seventh victory of the night. With 19% of results in, Biden led Bernie Sanders by 11 points and Mike Bloomberg by 12 points. Some polls of Arkansas had indicated it could be a strong state for Bloomberg, and his disappointing performance there underscores what a bad night this has been for the billionaire candidate. Joe Biden has won the primary in Minnesota after receiving a last-minute endorsement from former rival Amy Klobuchar, one of the state\u2019s two senators. Just days ago, it looked like Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders were locked in a dead heat for Minnesota\u2019s 75 pledged delegates. Now, after Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden, the former vice president has won a state he looked barely viable in last week. Biden\u2019s victory in Minnesota makes two things clear: his momentum extends far beyond the South, and Sanders is in trouble. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe reports from a Bernie Sanders watch party in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Though Pennsylvania isn\u2019t voting in its own primary until April, about 100 people turnout out here for the viewing party in East Liberty. It was the sort of mixed crowd any of the candidates would kill for \u2013 young and old, racially diverse, and everyone with a really upbeat energy. The music is definitely more boomer though - they just played Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A Changin\u2019. One of the organisers Susan Sanders (no relation to the candidate), says people in Pittsburgh are more pro-Sanders now than they were in 2016, when he lost the primary to Hillary Clinton: \u201cThe fire is definitely hotter, just look at this crowd.\u201d Given Joe Biden\u2019s strong start on Super Tuesday, the Sanders supporters were worrying that Biden could be handed the nomination at the Democratic national convention in July \u2013 though there is still a very long way to go before then. \u201cEveryone in this room will be devastated if that happens,\u201d said Fatima Aslan, 23. It\u2019s still early in the night, and the two biggest prizes -- California and Texas -- have not yet been called. That being said, early results indicate Joe Biden may have done what no other candidate could: recreate the Obama coalition. From Cory Booker\u2019s former campaign manager: The Guardian\u2019s Aben\u00e9 Clayton reports from Richmond and Oakland in California: In Oakland and Richmond, two San Francisco Bay Area cities with majority Black and Latino populations, voters appeared split between frontrunners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Some worry that Sanders\u2019 signature policies, such as student debt elimination and wealth taxes, can be \u201ctoo radical\u201d for more moderate voters outside of the Bay Area to stomach in November. \u201cIf Bernie is the candidate, you\u2019ll have presidential candidates that represent two extremes,\u201d 26-year-old Andrea Rodriguez said on her way into a Richmond polling location. Other Biden California supporters say that they feel more comfortable with the former vice president because he understands the inner workings of Capitol Hill. \u201cBiden has White House experience; he knows how to play the game. Bernie hasn\u2019t had his foot in the game yet,\u201d said 55-year-old Troy Williams of Richmond. Still, Sanders supporters argue they are voting in the interest of \u201cwhoever\u2019s gonna help the most marginalized,\u201d not for the person who can convert the most swing state voters. \u201cThink of the future and what you would want your kids to have,\u201d 31-year-old student Caitlin Culman said. \u201cBecause they won\u2019t have as good a quality of life as the previous generations and moderates won\u2019t help that.\u201d Joe Biden has won the primary in Tennessee, where most polls closed about an hour and a half ago. With 56% of the results in, Biden was at 36%, leading Bernie Sanders by 12 points. The victory extends Biden\u2019s sweep of southern states tonight, as the former vice president has already won Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports from Manteca, California: Towns in California\u2019s Central Valley often don\u2019t get a lot of love from presidential candidates. When Pete Buttigieg visited the area earlier this year, a local Democratic congressman complained, \u201cThis is the first time for many people in this room to have ever seen a presidential contender.\u201d But in Manteca, a Central Valley town divided between registered Democrats, Republicans, and independents, according to the Manteca Bulletin, Democratic voters who showed up to the polls in the early afternoon reflected some of the divides within the party. Carolyn and David Croyle walked out of their polling place in Manteca together, but the married couple, both Democrats, had chosen different candidates. Carolyn had voted for Bernie Sanders, David for Elizabeth Warren. Carolyn Croyle said she supports Sanders because of his ideas, particularly on healthcare, and because \u201che gets the young people out,\u201d which Democrats need. Sanders \u201cgets people excited, and you don\u2019t see that with [Joe] Biden.\u201d David Croyle said he had once been a Republican, and had voted for George W. Bush, though not enthusiastically, before then voting for Barack Obama. Now, he\u2019s interested in voting for someone who can defeat Donald Trump. He sees Warren as presidential, and \u201ca little less demagogue-y\u201d than Sanders, but knows she\u2019s under pressure to quit the race. \u201cI will vote for a bucket of rocks over Trump,\u201d he said. Also in Manteca, in California\u2019s Central Valley, Elizabeth Grant, 85, explained why she cast her vote for Biden: \u201cBecause I like him. I think he\u2019s an upstanding person.\u201d Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has put out a rather vague statement on the future of his candidacy. \u201cTonight, only one-third of delegates will be allotted,\u201d campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said. \u201cAs Mike said tonight, \u2018No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible. In just three months, we\u2019ve gone from just 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination.\u2019 \u201cOur number one priority remains defeating Donald Trump in November.\u201d Bloomberg delivered a similar message moments ago at his campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. But as early results show the former New York mayor underperforming in states where he spent tens of millions of dollars, pressure is mounting for Bloomberg to bow out of the race. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports from Los Angeles: At Skid Row, the epicenter of the homelessness crisis in LA, voters living in shelters and on the street are able to cast ballots inside the Union Rescue Mission. Kevin Wilkerson, 52, who lives at the shelter, said he was a \u201cbona fide Joe Biden fan\u201d: \u201cHe got a surge in South Carolina and now everybody is saying, \u2018I\u2019m gonna stand by Joe.\u2019 This is how we win. We can\u2019t go too far left, we have to come down in the middle.\u201d He said he never misses a chance to vote: \u201cMy ancestors fought tooth and nail for my rights. People were killed so that I\u2019m able to vote in 2020.\u201d Rocio Martinez, 51-year-old living on Skid Row for nearly four years, said she was a registered Republican, but voted for Bernie Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m Hispanic and I\u2019m not happy with Trump\u2019s philosophy of immigration. It\u2019s cruel.\u201d She said she has struggled to get a job that pays well enough to get her stable housing. Yolanda Green, 56, who lives at the Downtown Women\u2019s Center at Skid Row, also voted for Sanders: \u201cHe\u2019s for the American people. He talks about healthcare. He talks about brown and black people. He says everyone is created equal. .. It felt great to vote. I always do. My mother said every vote counts. You gotta get out to vote to weed out the bad president.\u201d The AP has called Oklahoma for Joe Biden, about an hour after the polls closed in the Sooner State. The former vice president is running about 12 points ahead of second-place Bernie Sanders, with 53% of the vote in. The results deliver yet another blow to Elizabeth Warren, who grew up in Oklahoma and is struggling to cross the 15% threshold required to win delegates. The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports from Mike Bloomberg\u2019s (very short) rally in West Palm Beach, Florida: Barely 10 minutes after taking the stage in West Palm Beach, Mike Bloomberg is done, after delivering a largely flat address to supporters, perhaps reflecting the dawning reality that things are not going the way he had hoped on Super Tuesday, and that a big decision for his campaign is now looming. \u201cAs the results come in, here\u2019s what is clear,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cNo matter how many delegates we win tonight we\u2019ve done something no-one else thought was possible. We\u2019ve gone from one percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u201d The rest of Bloomberg\u2019s short speech was standard campaign stump, attacks on Donald Trump, policy promises on a range of issues from healthcare to immigration to gun reform, but it he gave the impression that his heart wasn\u2019t really in it. Supporters were streaming towards the doors within seconds of him wrapping up. Campaign manager Kevin Sheekey told reporters earlier: \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d when asked if Bloomberg would drop out tonight. But the odds of that now happening sooner than later appear much shorter as the Super Tuesday picture becomes clearer. Bernie Sanders has won the Colorado primary, his first victory of the night besides winning his home state of Vermont. Sanders had been expected to win Colorado, where 67 pledged delegates were up for grabs. Although Colorado isn\u2019t as delegate-rich as Virginia or North Carolina, both of which Joe Biden won earlier tonight, Sanders\u2019 victory there will give him some positive media coverage before much of east coast America turns off their televisions for the night. It\u2019s 9 pm ET, so the polls have officially closed in Colorado, Minnesota and Texas. Texas is the second-biggest prize of the night after California, with 228 pledged delegates up for grabs. Like California, Texas has a robust early-voting operation, and the initial results look favorable for Joe Biden: The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports from Joe Biden\u2019s Super Tuesday event in Los Angeles: It\u2019s 70 degrees with a gentle breeze at golden hour in Los Angeles \u2013 the picture perfect backdrop to what is already a very good night for Joe Biden. Outside his outdoor election night event at a downtown recreation center, located off of Obama Blvd., a line of supporters began to wrap around the building. An aide appeared to announce that North Carolina had just been called for Biden. Cheers rang out and two women, carrying California for Biden signs, began to dance. \u201cI love my Joe,\u201d she said to no one in particular. Polling had showed Bernie Sanders far ahead in California, but in a sign of how fluid the race remains after Biden\u2019s rout in South Carolina, many Democrats appear to have waited until the last minute to make up their minds. That indecision could prove decisive for Biden, especially in delegate-rich states like California and Texas. The schedule of tonight\u2019s voting has put Bernie Sanders at a bit of a disadvantage, as Joe Biden performs well in southern states. Sanders is predicted to do well in western states like Colorado, Utah and California, which is the biggest prize of the night. But those states\u2019 polls close later, so much of tonight\u2019s early coverage will be devoted to more eastern states, where Biden has already secured three decisive victories. What this means is that many Americans will likely go to sleep tonight thinking Sanders only won his home state of Vermont, even if he performs well in the delegate-rich states of California and Texas. The Guardian\u2019s Maanvi Singh reports from San Francisco: At Manny\u2019s - a bar/bookstore/event space in San Francisco\u2019s Mission district, people are anxiously sipping their wine and munching their crudit\u00e9s as they watch the first results and projections trickle in. There are a number of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporters here \u2014 and many are fretting over whether the two candidates have spilt the progressive vote. Stephenie Smith, 31, said she was torn until this morning. \u201cEven though after a lot of conversations, I was kind of leaning toward Bernie, I voted for Warren today,\u201d she said. \u201cI had such mixed feelings.\u201d She liked Warren a bit more \u2014 but ultimately supports both progressive candidates. \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed at how well Joe is doing,\u201d she said, as results from Virginia and North Carolina flashed on screen. In a broad, rapidly shifting race, many California voters, especially those who voted early, are unsure of what to expect tonight. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland reports from Corsicana, Texas: Navarro College, in Corsicana, Texas, became world famous this year after the success of the Netflix documentary Cheer, which followed the college\u2019s champion cheerleading squad as they fought to defend their national title last year. But on Super Tuesday, this community college is also home to one of the 20 polling stations in this small county of 48,000 people. On the morning of this critical vote in the Democratic primary race, in which Texas will play a major role in determining the nominee for president, the Guardian visited to gauge the mood. There were no queues outside the voting booths at the campus\u2019s Cook Center. Instead, the most frantic activity was a few hundred feet away at the college\u2019s health centre, where the cheer squad\u2019s now instantly recognizable head coach, Monica Aldama, was carrying a large cardboard box laden with red and black cheerleading uniforms. \u201cI have not voted yet,\u201d Aldama said, nodding towards the polling station. \u201cBut I plan on doing it as soon as I\u2019m done today.\u201d She would not say how she would cast her ballot, or whether she was voting in the Republican or Democratic primary. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a political affiliation,\u201d she said. \u201cI just go with a person that I\u2019m interested in.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports from Charlotte, North Carolina: \u201cBullshit!\u201d \u201cNo way! Already?\u201d These were the cries at a watch party for Bernie Sanders supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, when TV screens flashed the news that Joe Biden is projected to win the state. \u201cI kind of expected this,\u201d sighed Sarah Lundin-Erickson, 46, standing near the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s still conservative here.\u201d Kevin Gobuty, 28, agreed: \u201cKind of, yeah, it\u2019s still North Carolina.\u201d Polls here had suggested a narrow lead for Sanders, but Biden\u2019s resurgence in neighbouring South Carolina last Saturday gave him a boost. Gobuty added: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I\u2019m a high school teacher. I teach a lot of kids at a low income school and am very worried about their future if Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t win.\u201d The late rush of endorsements for Biden was a major factor, Gobuty believes. \u201cAbsolutely. The establishment is doing the smart thing for the establishment and the moderates are coalescing around the moderate.\u201d But he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a long road to the convention from here.\u201d Sanders supporters were drinking at a Tip Top Daily Market which, along with food and alcohol, sells vinyl records and had a DJ playing tracks such as Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cFight the Power\u201d. Lundin-Erickson, attending with her nine-year-old daughter, Suvi, said she voted for Sanders because of policies such as Medicare for all. \u201cI lived in England once, working and paying taxes, and was able to get medical treatment there so it was something I\u2019ve always wanted to see come to fruition in the States. But America is very capitalist.\u201d Mary Kate Finnigan, 33, a nurse practitioner, said: \u201cBernie\u2019s campaign and his supporters are very grassroots. People feel so strongly about him and want to stand up for something radical. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the media influences all of that. I am frankly surprised how Biden is doing so well. I don\u2019t know how a country can elect someone like Trump and then think Bernie\u2019s way isn\u2019t possible.\u201d It\u2019s 8:30 pm ET, so the polls in Arkansas have now closed. Considering Joe Biden\u2019s sweep of southern states so far, the former vice president looks poised to do well in Arkansas. However, some polls of Arkansas indicated it could be a strong state for Mike Bloomberg, who has had a disappointing night so far. The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports from Mike Bloomberg\u2019s rally in West Palm Beach, Florida: Mike Bloomberg is preparing to take the stage in West Palm Beach to address supporters who are well refreshed by the range of luxurious free nibbles and sips on offer at his election night party, including goat\u2019s cheese bites, mini-burgers, spinach flatbreads and a selection of beers and fine wines paid for by the billionaire\u2019s expansive war chest. It remains to be seen, however, if the former New York mayor\u2019s $500m investment in his campaign for the White House will pay off. Early results from states including Virginia and North Carolina were not looking good for the self-funded candidate, leaving some attendees and campaign workers here looking, and sounding, nervous. Not even Bloomberg\u2019s win in American Samoa could lift a largely flat mood. CNN reported one Bloomberg adviser had admitted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going as planned.\u201d Giant screens in the auditorium of the Palm Beach convention center that had been showing rolling CNN coverage of the Super Tuesday voting since the doors opened at 6pm were switched instead to Bloomberg 2020 graphics and shots of the crowd, leaving his supporters with only their mobile phones to follow developments in other states. Shortly after 8pm, long after Bloomberg\u2019s early warm-up acts including the former mayors of Tampa and Miami Beach had come and gone, and with no sign yet of their man taking the podium, campaign assistants told reporters that Bloomberg was expected on stage by about 8.30pm, but warned that was \u201csubject to change\u201d. It\u2019s still early in the night, but so far, it appears Mike Bloomberg\u2019s $500 million gamble on Super Tuesday has been a bust. The former New York mayor looks poised to receive no delegates in Virginia, where he spent nearly $18 million on advertising. Exit polls indicate Bloomberg is also struggling to clear the 15% threshold required to net delegates in North Carolina, where he spent more than $17 million and built a large field operation. If the night continues on this trajectory, Bloomberg will likely only hear one question tomorrow: when are you dropping out? Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home state of Massachusetts is too close to call, but exit polls indicate a close three-way race between Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. If Warren cannot carry her home state, it could deliver a fatal blow to the senator\u2019s struggling campaign. On the other hand, Sanders had hoped Massachusetts would be a weak spot for his main opponent, Biden. But exit polls indicate Biden is in the hunt for Massachusetts delegates, winning the majority of voters who made their decision in the past few days. Polls just closed in Alabama, but the AP has already called the state for Joe Biden, continuing the former vice president\u2019s sweep of southern states. The immediate call for Biden points to a large margin of victory in Alabama, where 52 pledged delegates are up for grabs. Biden\u2019s apparently decisive wins in Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama indicate this could be a difficult night for Bernie Sanders, who was previously the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. It is 8 pm ET, so the polls have closed in five states: Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Alabama appears to be a likely win for Joe Biden, considering the former vice president\u2019s success in southern states so far. Massachusetts represents a key test for Elizabeth Warren, who is at risk of losing her home state to Bernie Sanders. It\u2019s also worth noting some polling places in Tennessee are staying open late because of the tornadoes that rolled through the state earlier today, killing at least 25 and destroying hundreds of buildings. The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports from Mike Bloomberg\u2019s rally in West Palm Beach, Florida: Victoria Van Pelt was a Democratic delegate for Barack Obama in the 2012 election and loves Joe Biden, but thinks the vice president is too damaged by the impeachment scandal to be a viable candidate. So she is throwing her weight behind Mike Bloomberg. \u201cThey eviscerated Joe Biden with this impeachment,\u201d said Van Pelt, 78, from Delray Beach, Florida, as she queued to get into Bloomberg\u2019s Super Tuesday rally in West Palm Beach. \u201cThe chief justice put his thumb on the scale. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a Bloomberg person, I was a Biden person, but I don\u2019t see Biden coming out of this after they destroyed his reputation. Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat, he is a socialist and I don\u2019t think America is ready for that in a mainstream party.\u201d The mood of the crowd at the Palm Beach county convention center was buoyant ahead of the Super Tuesday results, notwithstanding the constant din from the motorcycles and pick-up trucks of the self-styled Trump Train, complete with flags and banner, constantly circling outside. Other Bloomberg supporters are here for a variety of reasons. Adam Schoenfeld, 56, is a New Yorker now living in West Palm Beach, said Bloomberg had the Big Apple \u201crunning like a fine timepiece\u201d when he was mayor from 2002 to 2013. \u201cHe\u2019s incorruptible and unlike the president is able to read and speak in a coherent manner,\u201d he said. Elementary school teacher Nicole Dedominicis admits to being undecided over who to support in Florida\u2019s 17 March primary. \u201cI just want to hear what Bloomberg has to say. I\u2019m from New York and I\u2019m a moderate and he\u2019s in my top two choices,\u201d said Dedominicis, who came to the rally with her 15-year-old son Tim McBride, who has been studying civics at high school. \u201cI love history and to be part of this is something special,\u201d said McBride, who is looking forward to casting his first vote in 2024. AP has called it, which means it\u2019s official: Joe Biden has won the North Carolina primary. Television networks called North Carolina for Biden as soon as polls closed 15 minutes ago, but AP waited a bit before making it official. Reagrdless, the rapid call for Biden indicates he likely secured a big win in North Carolina, where 110 pledged delegates were up for grabs. Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg are struggling to hit viability in Virginia and North Carolina, according to exit polls. The two candidates had hoped to clear the 15% threshold required to pick up delegates, even if they did not win either state. But early results indicate a resounding victory for Joe Biden, while second-place Bernie Sanders easily cleared 15%. The polls have closed in North Carolina, where 110 pledged delegates are up for grabs. Joe Biden\u2019s apparently decisive victory in Virginia had raised expectations for the former vice president in North Carolina, and immediately after polls closed, television networks called the state for Biden. The AP, the outlet of record for elections, has not yet called North Carolina, but the networks\u2019 immediate call for Biden indicates a sizeable victory. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports from Richmond, Virginia: Immediately after polls closed, Virginia was called for former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont was called for Senator Bernie Sanders. Vermont was to be expected. It\u2019s Sanders\u2019 home state, and he won it handily in the 2016 Democratic primary. But Biden\u2019s victory is more notable. Virginia was called almost immediately after polls closed. Biden\u2019s victory there suggests that more southern states are fertile ground for the former vice president to produce a victory. Biden\u2019s victory also means he has won a state with 99 delegates, more than some other Super Tuesday states. Here in Richmond, some local Democrats had expected Biden to win handily. Joe Biden said he felt \u201coptimistic\u201d about his chances after learning of his victory in Virginia. \u201cFeels good,\u201d Biden told reporters in California of his Virginia win. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the actual results are, but it feels good and we\u2019re optimistic. We\u2019re going to do well in some other states as well.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s polls close in just a few minutes, so stay tuned for more results. Vermont exit polls indicate Joe Biden cleared the 15% threshold to win delegates in the state. Bernie Sanders easily won his home state tonight and will collect the vast majority of Vermont\u2019s 16 pledged delegates. However, in 2016, Sanders was able to shut out Hillary Clinton from winning any of his state\u2019s delegates. It seems Sanders may not have achieved that tonight. Joe Biden\u2019s victory in Virginia spells trouble for Mike Bloomberg, who spent about $18 million in advertising there. Bloomberg is counting on his $500 million campaign investment to propel him to delegate wins across the country tonight. However, if Biden has secured a substantial victory in Virginia, that could indicate Bloomberg\u2019s gamble has not paid off. A huge roar has just gone up at Bernie Sanders\u2019 Super Tuesday rally in his home town of Burlington, Vermont, with chants of \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d. There are no surprises of course in Sanders\u2019 projected victory here. With a population of just 624,000, Vermont is small enough for Bernie to cut a giant figure in a state that he won in 2016 by a whopping 86% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 14%. In Burlington itself he is even more familiar, as the Sanders\u2019 headquarters are here and his distinctive head of white hair is frequently seen bobbing down Church Street in the town center. Everyone at the rally seems to know Sanders personally, or at least to have stories about him. I just talked to Jim Clancy standing in the crowd. He has a memory from his childhood of his mother and Sanders bouncing up and down on a sofa in a Burlington furniture store comparing notes on how firm the piece was. So that\u2019s Vermont. But when I asked Clancy was that why he voted for Sanders today, because he is the home-boy candidate, he said not at all. \u201cIt\u2019s his message. He relates to me. I\u2019m gay, and Bernie started gay pride in Burlington in 1981 when it wasn\u2019t all that common. He\u2019s been consistent, and I like that - there are no surprises with Bernie.\u201d Exit polls show African-American voters in Virginia went for Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders by more than 40 points, which could indicate the former vice president is in for a very good night in southern states like Alabama and Tennessee. The polls in Vermont and Virginia have just closed, but both states have already been called because of the results of entrance polls. Bernie Sanders has won his home state of Vermont, as expected, but Joe Biden has surprisingly already been declared the winner of Virginia. Election experts were closely watching Virginia for signs of Biden\u2019s post-South Carolina bounce. The immediate call for Biden indicates he likely won the state by a significant margin. It is 7 pm ET, so the polls have officially closed in Vermont and Virginia. Vermont is considered a guaranteed win for Bernie Sanders, who has represented the state in the Senate since 2007. Virginia will be closely watched for signs of how much of a bump Joe Biden received from his landslide victory in South Carolina and the endorsements of former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. For reference, Virginia polls had shown a close race in recent weeks, but a poll taken after South Carolina found Biden jumping out to a 20-point lead. Polls haven\u2019t even closed yet in Super Tuesday states, but candidates are already looking ahead to the next contests. Elizabeth Warren has just announced she will travel to Michigan, Arizona and Idaho this weekend. Michigan and Idaho are both holding primaries next Tuesday, while Arizona\u2019s voters will head to the polls on March 17. Mike Bloomberg is showing no signs of dropping out of the race, as the billionaire candidate faces his first test with voters tonight. The former New York mayor skipped campaigning in the four early voting states to focus on the bigger prizes of Super Tuesday, so tonight marks the first time his name will appear on the ballot. But some of Bloomberg\u2019s critics are already calling on him to suspend his campaign and endorse Joe Biden in the hope of further consolidating the moderate vote. When asked whether there was any chance Bloomberg would drop out tonight, campaign manager Kevin Sheekey told reporters, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Some Tennessee polling places are staying open later because of the tornadoes that swept through earlier today. The Tennessean reports: A Davidson County judge Tuesday afternoon ruled that polls can remain open until 8 p.m. CT at all sites across Nashville. Polls were originally set to close at 7 p.m. CT. Five polling sites will remain open until 10 p.m. CT. ... The ruling came at the request of four of the top Democratic presidential campaigns, along with the Tennessee Democratic Party. The groups filed suit in a Nashville court on Tuesday to extend poll times amid heavy tornado damage throughout the city. At least 25 people have been killed as a result of the storms, and hundreds of buildings in the state have been destroyed. The biggest prize tonight is California, which has 415 pledged delegates up for grabs. Bernie Sanders is favored to win the state, but the margin of his potential victory will be crucial in determining whether the Vermont senator can secure a substantial delegate lead coming out of Super Tuesday. However, it will likely take days if not weeks to determine the exact margin of victory in California because of the state\u2019s size and robust early voting operation. The LA Times explains: Even if a presidential candidate is declared the \u2018winner\u2019 of the California primary this week (or month), we probably won\u2019t know how many delegates that or other candidates won until county election officials complete their vote counts and audits in April. For political nerds who will be closely following tonight\u2019s returns, the Times offers this advice: \u201cdon\u2019t stay up for California results on Tuesday.\u201d Early exit polls indicate a signficant portion of Super Tuesday voters made their decision in the past few days, which could be good news for Joe Biden. According to the CNN exit polls, nearly half of Virginia voters said they made their decision in the past few days, and nearly 3 in 10 North Carolina voters said the same. Those late-stage decisions could be beneficial to Biden, who won the South Carolina primary by nearly 30 points on Saturday and has since been endorsed by former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. Virginia\u2019s polls close in about an hour, and North Carolina\u2019s polls close in an hour and a half, so we\u2019ll soon see how real the \u201cBiden bump\u201d is. Fourteen states across the country are voting today. Here\u2019s when each state\u2019s polls close, which is when results will start being reported: 7 pm ET: Vermont and Virginia. 7.30 pm ET: North Carolina. 8 pm ET: Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Tennessee. 8.30 pm ET: Arkansas. 9 pm ET: Colorado, Minnesota and Texas. 10 pm ET: Utah. 11 pm ET: California. The blog will have updates and analysis as those results come in, so stay tuned. Happy Super Tuesday, live blog readers! Voters in 14 states have been heading to the polls all day to decide which Democratic presidential candidate should face off against Donald Trump in November. More than 1,300 pledged delegates are up for grabs, and candidates need to win 1,991 pledged delegates to secure the nomination, so today\u2019s results are crucial in determining the direction of the race. After a series of exits in recent days, the race has narrowed to five candidates: Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard. Super Tuesday had been viewed as Sanders\u2019 to lose, but Biden\u2019s landslide victory in South Carolina on Saturday and endorsements from former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have given him momentum heading into today. Will Biden\u2019s momentum translate into victories today? We\u2019ll find out starting in about an hour and a half, when the polls close in Vermont and Virginia, so stay tuned.",

Hundreds of keywords and keyword combinations, including \u201cWuhan seafood market\u201d and \u201cSars variation\u201d were censored in late December, as doctors sought to warn about the new virus. The report, by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk school of global affairs and public policy, found that between January and February, \u201ca wide breadth of content\u201d was censored on WeChat and YY, a Chinese live-streaming platform, including criticisms of the Chinese government. Speculative and factual information, and neutral references to the government\u2019s handling of the outbreak, were also blocked. Chinese social media platforms have come under greater pressure to censor content about the Covid-19 illness, which has killed 3,285 and infected more than 95,000. Critical discussion and investigative reports about the virus have been removed from social media sites and Chinese leaders have called for more control over online media to ensure social stability during the outbreak. \u201cOur findings show that information on Covid-19 is being tightly controlled on Chinese social media,\u201d the report said. \u201cCensorship of Covid-19 content started at early stages of the outbreak and continued to expand blocking a wide range of speech, from criticism of the government to officially sanctioned facts and information.\u201d It said censorship of the outbreak was \u201ctroubling\u201d. \u201cCountering misinformation and uninformed speculation related to the epidemic may help keep public fear in check and remove information that would mislead people about how best to protect themselves. However, restricting general discussions and factual information has the opposite effect and limits public awareness and response.\u201d The report said YY began censoring keywords related to coronavirus on 31 December, the day after the late Dr Li Wenliang and seven others sought to warn of the outbreak in WeChat groups. The report said on 31 December that YY added 45 keywords or combinations referencing the unknown virus to its blacklist, including: unknown Wuhan pneumonia, Wuhan seafood market, Sars variation, Sars outbreak in Wuhan, and Wuhan health committee. WeChat\u2019s list vastly expanded in February, with 516 new keyword combinations added in the first 15 days, compared with 132 across the month of January. On WeChat, 192 keyword combinations referenced Chinese leaders\u2019 response to the outbreak, with 87% referencing Xi Jinping and the remainder referencing other key figures from the central government and party structure. \u201cWhile a number of these keyword combinations are critical in nature, criticising or alluding to the central leadership\u2019s inability or inaction in dealing with Covid-19, many of them refer to leadership in a neutral way,\u201d the report said. \u201cEight of the Xi-related keyword combinations reference his whereabouts during the outbreak, such as whether he had been to Wuhan city.\u201d Of 138 censored keyword combinations referencing government actors or policies, just 39% were critical in nature. The death of Li, who was seen as a whistleblower after he was accused of making false statements for warning colleagues of the virus, triggered significant anger and sympathy among Chinese internet users, with censors responding to mounting social media posts and hashtags critical of the government.

The Kimberley-Clark mill has increased its production to 24 hours a day in response to supermarket shortages, in an attempt to get supply back on to shelves. The ethical subscription toilet paper service Who Gives a Crap said it had sold out of all products. And he managing director of Australian Bidet, Randall Cadby, said the business had been inundated with calls, emails and website traffic. Attempts to stockpile toilet paper began this week amid panic buying of long-life food other staples. It remains unclear why people have begun hoarding vast quantities of the product, given that there has been no indication stocks might run low and there is not likely to be increased an need for toilet paper in the event the coronavirus spreads to a significant extent. The Twitter hashtag #ToiletPaperEmergency \u2013 featuring images of people attempting to stockpile massive quantities of paper, empty supermarket shelves and those trying to profit from reselling rolls \u2013 has become the top trend in Australia. On Thursday Australia\u2019s largest supermarket announced it would implement a four-pack limit for customers. On Thursday morning a truck carrying supplies of toilet paper caught fire on the Gateway Bridge, near Brisbane. About half the rolls were saved. \u201cThis is not overly common, particularly around the city areas, but the main thing is no one got hurt tonight and we\u2019ve been able to save quite a lot of toilet paper,\u201d a fire officer, Justin Francis, told the ABC. \u201cThere was quite an interesting fuel load on this particular vehicle as we believe toilet paper is quite precious at the moment, so we\u2019ve been able to save half the load on this particular truck,\u201d he said.",

Striving merely to stay alive is not entirely hopeless since the banks are also motivated to hope for a change in retail property weather and may waive covenants for a while. But Intu\u2019s misadventure with debt has taken it to a desperate position. The company owns nine of the top 20 shopping centres in the UK but the equity in this enterprise, after a Wednesday\u2019s 41% slump in the share price to just 6.3p, is now worth less than \u00a3100m. Prew was a seller at 400p in 2015, so take his analysis seriously: \u201cThe shares are option money but the business has run out of options.\u201d The sun always shines at Legal &amp; General One can rely on Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, for optimism. The coronavirus threat to the economy will pass; the second half of the year will be better than the first; so take the long view, he advised, alongside another slick set of results. L&amp;G\u2019s model of \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d \u2013 which essentially means investing in socially useful assets \u2013 has certainly coped with all recent challenges. Earnings per share have improved at a compound annual rate of 11% over the past nine years, and the dividend by 13%. Impressive. L&amp;G\u2019s shares have been whacked as hard as the banks in the recent stock market slide and it\u2019s not obvious why. Its core mix of investment management and annuities looks far less volatile.",

      "bodyText": "Most of the staff at a Sydney aged care home at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak did not turn up to work on Wednesday night because they were concerned about endangering their own family members, the union representing aged care workers has said. BaptistCare, which runs the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, refused to comment when asked if a number of staff had failed to turn up to their shift after news broke of a Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. But the Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes said the union had been told by staff at the facility that \u201cmost\u201d of the workers rostered to work on Wednesday night had called in sick and the shift was covered by a work hire agency. Residents at the aged care centre have been confined to their rooms and employees have been told to stay home and self-isolate if they show any symptoms, as health authorities struggle to contain the virus. Hayes said two employees at the facility told the union they were concerned that by attending work they risked exposing immunocompromised members of their own family. \u201cThey are concerned that if they go there they might bring it home and their loved ones might be impacted,\u201d he said. Guardian Australia understands the union planned to apply for a right of entry permit under workplace health and safety laws on Thursday afternoon to ensure the facility remained a safe workplace for staff. Meanwhile, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is conducting audits of aged care facilities that it viewed as \u201cpoorly equipped\u201d to handle Covid-19. Commissioner Janet Anderson told Radio National on Thursday that \u201cless than 100\u201d aged care facilities were identified on an annual basis as having \u201cfallen short of best practice standards in relation to infection control\u201d and those facilities would be the focus of the audits. Australia\u2019s chief health officers and federal officials are meeting with the aged care sector on Friday. Health authorities in New South Wales have confirmed four positive cases of Covid-19 at the facility. On Thursday they confirmed that a 95-year-old woman, who died in hospital on Tuesday night, had tested positive to the virus. The first person identified with the virus in the facility was an aged care worker in her 50s, who had not travelled overseas recently. An 82-year-old man who resided in the same part of the facility as the deceased woman and was cared for by a team that included the infected worker also tested positive, and is in a stable condition at Ryde hospital. Health minister Brad Hazzard said a 70-year-old male resident who lived in a different part of the facility had also tested positive, indicating that infection control measures had not stopped the spread of the virus. Hazzard said the facility had shown \u201cvery good practice\u201d by caring for its residents in \u201cpods\u201d, meaning that staff did not work across the whole facility. \u201cWhat is challenging for [NSW Health] to understand is that particular gentleman [the 70-year-old man] appears to have had no contact with the nursing staff member,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that presents obviously another challenge to try and trace contacts.\u201d He told reporters on Thursday that given the continued spread of the virus \u2014 with 22 confirmed cases in NSW alone and 52 Australia-wide \u2014 containment may be unlikely. Authorities have also contacted the parents of around 17 children who visited the centre in a group from Banksia Cottage childcare centre at Macquarie University on 24 February. The chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said the childcare centre reported an outbreak of sickness and that a partner of one of the childcare workers, who had respiratory symptoms, had tested negative for coronavirus. Chant said authorities would meet with parents and children on Thursday night to conduct assessments \u201cfor the abundance of caution\u201d. Children have shown a more mild response to Covid-19 than adults. Elderly people and those with underlying issues such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory conditions are most at risk of severe cases. In a statement released on Thursday, BaptistCare said the health and safety of its residents and staff was its \u201cutmost priority.\u201d It said it was \u201cexperienced in disease control measures and we have had best-practice precautions in place across our aged care centres in NSW and ACT\u201d. \u201cOur staff have shown great dedication in the past days in their commitment to care for our residents and we continue to bolster our regular teams on the ground with additional specialist support from other locations across the state,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNSW Health also has a team of experts guiding the response at Macquarie Park.\u201d BaptistCare said it had \u201ctaken a firm approach to ensure any staff identified as being at risk are isolated and we have taken the added precaution of confining residents to their rooms across the centre\u201d.",

Further, towards the end of 2019, there were encouraging signs emerging for the domestic economy. GDP growth was stronger in 2019 than in the second half of 2018, while the labour market continued to outperform expectations with employment growth remaining around 2% and the participation rate reaching record highs. </p> <p>At Myefo we forecast a gradual improvement in consumption in response to stronger household disposable income growth and an improvement in the housing market. Household disposable income growth is being supported by the personal income tax cuts, ongoing labour market strength, a pick-up in real wage growth, and supportive monetary policy settings. </p> <p>Consistent with our assessment at Myefo, the housing market is showing continued signs of improvement, with capital city housing prices continuing to pick up and auction clearance rates improving. Export performance has been strong and, as has been the case for a number of years, public final demand is strongly contributing to growth. </p> </blockquote> <p>Mining investment is predicted to grow though.

The data confirm that the Australian economy improved in 2019 relative to the weak second half of 2018. In the December quarter, real GDP grew by 0.5 % to be 2.2 % higher through the year. Calendar year growth in 2019 was 1.8 %, above the OECD average and higher than every G7 nation except the United States. </p> <p>This is a solid result given headwinds from the weaker global economy in 2019, as well as the ongoing drought. </p> <p>However, two key events have arisen since Myefo that materially affect our assessment of the economy \u2013 this summer\u2019s bushfires and the emergence of Covid-19. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T22:19:36.275Z\">at 10.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6027b08f085f0b8d942437\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-04T22:12:29.546Z\">10.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Treasury boss <strong>Steven Kennedy</strong> has started his estimates evidence with a bleak international economic outlook:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the time of the 2019-20 Myefo, our assessment was that global economic growth had weakened in 2019, with the weakness widespread, including among our major trading partners in Asia. We considered that this weakness was close to bottoming out, and there would be a gradual pick-up in global growth in late 2019 and into 2020. </p> <p>This was consistent with the IMF\u2019s update in January, forecasting global growth to lift in 2020 and 2021. The IMF forecasts were for global growth to rise from 2.9 % in 2019 to 3.3% in 2020 and 3.4% in 2021. </p> <p>Activity was expected to be supported by accommodative monetary policy settings, fiscal policy in some jurisdictions, an improvement in global manufacturing, signs of bottoming out in the electronics and auto cycle, and expectations for some form of a trade deal between the US and China. </p> <p>As it transpired, there was a \u2018Phase one\u2019 trade deal struck between those two countries in early 2020. The UK election and subsequent ratification of the withdrawal agreement also settled some of the uncertainties around Brexit. </p> <p>At the start of the year, we began seeing some signs of an improvement in global economic conditions. World merchandise trade volumes increased 0.5 per cent through the year to December 2019. The February 2020 data for PMI manufacturing saw the EU record its strongest PMI in over a year, and the US remained in expansionary territory. Labour markets also remained robust, with unemployment rates near record lows in the US, the euro area and Japan. </p> <p>However, the emergence of Covid-19 in late December has significantly negatively impacted the near-term outlook for China and in the past couple of weeks concerns have broadened to other nations as this virus has spread.

Please take care of yourself, support your local Chinese if you can, stop being crazy over toilet papers and supplies and wash your hands. And most importantly \u2013 take care of you, and those around you. Alex Hawke delivering his set down. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers: Diversity in action. Everything is fine. Butt-hurt over a letter to the editor Another motion. Kate Jenkins said: \u201cOur 2018 national prevalence survey found that one in every three Australian workers had experienced sexual harassment in the last five years, up from one in five in 2012. We heard throughout the inquiry that workplace sexual harassment is pervasive. It occurs in every industry, in every location and at every level. This is not simply the story of a few bad apples. Women are still most at risk, but we also heard from men who\u2019d been harassed at work ... \u201cYoung people under the age of 30 are at the highest risk, as well as LGBTQI workers, workers with a disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers and migrant workers. We also now understand that some industries and environments create a higher risk of sexual harassment. We heard that gender inequality is the key power disparity that drives sexual harassment, along with other cultural and systemic factors.\u201d Jenkins noted \u201cnew\u201d barriers to combatting sexual harassment including the impact of media reporting, the low rate of union membership and \u201cthe numbers of women in employment, if not in leadership\u201d. \u201cWe heard now more than ever making a complaint of sexual harassment can risk a complainant\u2019s income, job prospects, mental health, family wellbeing and community connection.\u201d Jenkins noted workplace sexual harassment was estimated to cost $3.8bn in 2018. Just back on the tone policing on Anne Aly from Alex Hawke there \u2013 which is what it was, let\u2019s be clear here. Maybe he should consider some of what the Cowan MP has to face every day, as part of her heritage, including this, at the recent election. Anyone who knows someone who is not white or white-passing, also knows what they personally face in this country on a regular basis. [Continued from the previous post] The proposed Workplace Sexual Harassment Council would be chaired by the sex discrimination commissioner and draw members from the Fair Work Commission and ombudsman, Safe Work Australia and state and territory workplace health and safety and human rights bodies, to be supported by a permanent secretariat. Jenkins said: \u201cWhat we found when we looked across Australia is that we do have strong workplace laws and they tend to sit in the safety regime or the Fair Work system, or the human rights system, and there\u2019s state and federal bodies. What we discovered was the system on sexual harassment for individuals, including employers and victims, was quite confusing as to where you go for what complaint. The purpose of that council was not to duplicate or create new bodies but bring those bodies together to ensure on sexual harassment we are all consistent, we understand what we\u2019re trying to do ... and we can create a better system going forward.\u201d Jenkins noted the terms of reference include a three-year review of changes, and she would like \u201cto have progressed as many [recommendations] as possible\u201d in that period. Other high priorities nominated by Jenkins include: Regulatory agencies giving out consistent information. In workplaces, industry initiatives \u201cseem to be where we get the most progress\u201d, Jenkins said. \u201cIndustries like the universities, all 39 of them moving on the issue of sexual harassment has no doubt made a difference, we\u2019ve seen it in the legal sector, I understand it\u2019s being considered in the mining sector.\u201d Primary prevention initiatives, namely \u201cbroader education of young people and the broader community\u201d. Of the 55 recommendations of the landmark sexual harassment at work inquiry report, the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, nominated setting up the Workplace Sexual Harassment Council and \u201cthe legislative change we\u2019ve proposed \u2013 particularly a positive duty under the Sex Discrimination Act\u201d as the top priorities. The proposed duty on employers is to \u201ctake reasonable steps and proportionate measure to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation as far as possible\u201d. Jenkins said: \u201cThe refocus to the positive duty was because it was really clear our laws on sexual harassment have really only been triggered when someone makes a complaint, and the evidence was really clear that Australians don\u2019t want to make a complaint, and if they do there is a high risk ... so our stats told us only 17% of people who\u2019ve been harassed make a complaint. So it was really clear relying on the idea this only comes into play if someone complains is a system that will never work.\u201d Jenkins said employers have responded to a positive duty to create a safe workplace, and the same will apply with respect to sexual harassment. \u201cEmployers as a general [rule] have been very well-intentioned about sexual harassment ... but I do think it will be something that they\u2019re comfortable with, in time,\u201d she said. Ken Wyatt is talking about the measures being taken to stop an outbreak of coronavirus in remote Indigenous communities to Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing: In some cases you restrict the number of people visiting a community. Because often you will have public servants from state and commonwealth agencies. You will have tourists going through the area. Now in discussions I\u2019ve had with communities over a period of time, they will make a decision to shut down an area or will appeal to government agencies not to go out there during the most vulnerable period when the peak of any infection occurs. ... What they want to do is restrict access of entry, which is showing that they\u2019re forward-thinking, they\u2019re understanding what the implications are and they\u2019re making a decision, because the community are doing it with their medical staff and with their community-controlled health services. But equally, the committee that minister Hunt has established will provide advice for where they believe measures should be taken. Now in this instance you\u2019ve had a community take the decision themselves. And so they\u2019re going to have a mix of those, Patricia, in the way that they deal with them and I have every confidence in our Indigenous leadership that are working with minister Hunt. But equally, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has flagged as well his concern for vulnerable communities and remote communities, isolated communities for a couple of reasons. One is their own health but the other is having access to the right people to provide the level of services. It is a good approach by the commonwealth and we\u2019re being proactive. Alex Hawke has attacked Anne Aly in the chamber during a matter of public importance on the strength of multiculturalism for \u201cciting her diversity as being something better than other people\u2019s diversity\u201d and \u201cignoring reality\u201d. \u201c[Many MPs] have had a parent or been born here ... myself and when the member opposite likes to cite her diversity than something better than other people\u2019s diversity, she ignores reality.\u201d \u201cThis is outrageous,\u201d Aly can be heard yelling back. Hawke smiles. The minister for international and Pacific development, who has maternal grandparents from Greece, continued, despite the obvious, obvious discomfort of most of the people in the chamber, including Llew O\u2019Brien, in the Speaker\u2019s chair. Hawke: If I have offended you, then I withdraw. But your tone and the words you take into this House ... ... The member for Cowan should reflect that people have come from all parts of Australia, over many years, and just because you are a migrant from one country, doesn\u2019t make you better than from another and the tone that you take, as you enter that debate, that just because you have arrived more recently, or you have more chips on your shoulder, that somehow you are better than others, is exactly the essence of what has happened in this debate from the member of Scullin [Andrew Giles, who introduced the MPI]. Aly was born in Egypt and moved to Australia when she was a young child. She is the first Muslim woman elected to the Australian parliament. She has often spoken of the very real struggle she and her family have experienced with racism and xenophobia. Hawke\u2019s contribution to this debate *is* outrageous. The sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, is launching the sexual harassment report. If you didn\u2019t think workplace harassment was a problem anymore \u2013 oh boy. I hope you enjoy your cakes filled with rainbows and butterflies and your rose coloured glasses of privilege. As Jenkins says: I met a health executive who had humiliating pornographic comments directed at her. She hoped that she would be able to make her workplace better by complaining. But instead, she was treated as the problem. Which has made it impossible for her to work in the industry again. An older male rural worker told me he was touched on his leg and propositioned by his male boss while driving home one night. When he rejected the advance, his contract was terminated and he couldn\u2019t get another job without a reference. And I spoke with younger workers who told me the best places to work were ones that were respectful, with leaders that were trusted, and where men and women were treated equally. These experiences speak of the impact that sexual harassment has on the lives of too many Australians \u2013 and on our productivity. They show how our laws, workplace practices and community attitudes have contributed to the surprisingly high rates of sexual harassment. While the same experiences I heard, over and over again, were all different, the message was the same. Australians don\u2019t want to complain about sexual harassment \u2013 they just want solutions to make it stop. And that is the purpose of this report \u2013 to improve how Australian workplaces prevent and respond to sexual harassment. To provide those solutions. And Craig Kelly on his \u2018misrepresentation\u2019: In the Age newspaper on the second of March, in the letters to the editor section it was represented that my comment, and I quote, \u201cthe evidence is clear \u2013 young Australians are living at a time when they are safer from climate disasters than any time in human history\u201d, was made without any evidence in support of my statement. Mr. Speaker, this is incorrect. My statement is in fact supported by evidence, evidence from the emergency events database known as EM-DAT, from the centre of research on [inaudible] on disasters... And my statement is further supported by analyse of that data by Professor [Bjorn] Lomborg. Anthony Albanese made a personal explanation at the end of question time in response to the attack from Scott Morrison that he was \u201ctoo busy having selfies with sports stars\u201d for a coronavirus briefing with Brendan Murphy last week: Mr. Speaker today in Question Time, the prime minister repeated a claim he\u2019s made outside this house that there was a refusal to have a briefing from the chief medical officer last Wednesday. That is not true. The facts of the case is at 7.25pm last Wednesday, the health minister\u2019s office rang the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, saying that they\u2019d been mixed up in Brendan Murphy\u2019s office, the CMO and that he had arrived at Parliament to give the opposition of briefing. That briefing went ahead at 7.30pm with the shadow health minister, my chief of staff and my senior health advisor. At that time, I was with the prime minister at the vigil for Hannah Clarke and her children. That\u2019s where I was when that phone call was made. I was unaware of any of this until the next day. I know it confirmed with Brendan Murphy when I met with the CMO this week, that that was the effect. Craig Kelly appears to be butt-hurt over a letter to the editor in the Age, which questions the evidence over some of his climate change rebuttals. Linda Burney is asking about people who have had to self-isolate, who don\u2019t have leave entitlements: The chief medical officer is recommending people that have potentially been exposed to the virus self-isolate for 14 days. The health minister has said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an Australian citizen, a permanent resident or a visitor from Iran, the message is very clear \u2013 you are now required to self-isolate.\u201d This will be very difficult for people who need to work in order to pay bills and the rent. It will also be difficult if parents have to stay home because schools and child care centres are closed. People will face a choice between self-isolating and potentially stopping the spread of the virus and earning an income to pay the rent. Existing payments simply aren\u2019t the answer, given this government has put in place a one week automatic wait for Newstart, AND the government is doubling the liquid asset waiting period for Newstart applicants. Many aged care, NDIS, transport, retail and hospitality workers are casual and they will be left short changed if they self-isolate. Because they don\u2019t have access to paid sick leave. Today the UK PM, Boris Johnson, has increased paid sick leave because people should not be, and I quote: \u201cPenalised for doing the right thing.\u201d Why isn\u2019t the government doing something similar in Australia? We have known about the virus for some time now \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be better to act now and prevent it spreading? Rather than waiting to see if it gets worse? Apparently the government is now looking at options. The motions fail and we get one last dixer. From the PMO: As of 5 March 2020: Foreign nationals (excluding permanent residents of Australia) who are in the Republic of Korea on or after today will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they have left or transited through the Republic of Korea. Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter Australia, as will their immediate family members (spouses, legal guardians or dependants only). They will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the day they left the Republic of Korea. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will raise the level of the travel advisory for the Republic of Korea to \u2018reconsider your need to travel\u2019 (level 3 of 4) up from \u2018exercise a high degree of caution\u2019 (level 2). The level of the travel advice will also be raised to \u2018do not travel\u2019 to Daegu (level 4 of 4) because of the significant outbreak of Covid-19 there. People in the Republic of Korea should monitor their health closely and follow the advice of local authorities. The Human Rights Commission has released a major report into sexual harassment. You\u2019ll find it here The motion: That the House notes that: a) the prime minister promised $2bn of immediate support for bushfire affected communities but months later he\u2019s spent just 10 per cent. b) the prime minister had an advertisement ready on the day he announced his bushfire response but bushfire affected communities are still waiting for support. c) the prime minister promised to \u201crephase and revise\u201d his bushfire efforts but bushfire affected communities are still waiting. d) the prime minister has sought to blame the states for months for his failed response to the bushfires instead of fixing it. e) the prime minister ran an advertising campaign for the urban congestion fund a year ago but still hasn\u2019t spent any money from this fund reducing urban congestion. f) in Question Time, the prime minister has repeatedly refused to provide the same straight answer the chief of the defence gave to the same question, and today bizarrely misled the Parliament about yesterday\u2019s non-answer. g) the prime minister has refused to give straight answers about his role in the sports rorts scandal despite the Australian National Audit Office finding his office was directly involved even on the day the election was called. Three: Today in Question Time, the prime minister engaged in deceptive conduct, attempting to criticise the leader of the opposition by tabling a document without revealing it was authorised by George Wright, the ALP national secretary twice removed, and said breaking news about Tony Abbott, the Liberal prime minister twice removed and therefore, condemns this prime minister for always putting marketing ahead of acting in the national interest and failing to provide straight answers to simple questions. Anthony Albanese has moved a motion to suspend standing orders, which will fail. I am chasing the motion for you. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: On the bushfires, the deputy prime minister has said, and I quote: \u201cIt really annoys me that I think states have been let off the hook largely this summer.\u201d When people in bushfire affected communities just want help, why is the government blaming Gladys Berejiklian? Michael McCormack gets the nod to explain what he meant: Well, what I also said, Mr Speaker, was that, under the federation model, the state governments take on responsibility as first responders, and they performed that role in fighting the fires. And they have. And well done to them. But as far as their recovery efforts, again, the states first and foremost rely on us when they call us. But we can\u2019t do it all as a commonwealth, because that\u2019s their obligation and responsibility. And what I also said \u2013 and this is important, and this is important \u2013 we will work with them, and we\u2019ll be there for the long haul. And we will. We will be there. We\u2019ve already put $2bn on the table, as we have. We will be there to help them through this crisis, but it will be ongoing. It will be months, if not years. That\u2019s what I said. And if you want to start talking about these things, you should say exactly what I\u2019ve said, not just a bit of it. Someone called Andrew Gee stands up at the despatch box, so he must be a minister of some type. Claire O\u2019Neil to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: has the government started work on an advertising campaign for a stimulus package? Morrison: No. Stuart Robert, ever the Gregory Goyle, finishes his dixer with \u201cbut it actually might help if you listen, rather than be a Twitter troll...\u201d because nothing says brown noser like echoing the bosses\u2019s lines. That one got quite personal \u2013 which is how you know Scott Morrison is p*i*s*s*e*d Anthony Albanese missed a briefing during the vigil for Hannah Clarke and her children. Scott Morrison was there. Chris Bowen has attended the briefings Albanese has not. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister: why is it that the prime minister ran an advertising campaign for the urban congestion fund a year ago but still hasn\u2019t spent any money reducing urban congestion from this fund? Why is it that he had an ad ready on the day he announced a bushfire response, but bushfire affected communities are still waiting for support? Why is marketing rather than substance always the priority of this prime minister? Morrison: What I\u2019ve noticed from the leader of the opposition is he always puts politics, Mr Speaker ... over the serious issues that need to be addressed in this place, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I reject the assertions ... I reject ... Mr Speaker, I totally reject the assertions that the leader of the opposition, as he constantly does, coming to the dispatch box, treating Question Time as smear time, Mr Speaker. The leader of the opposition treats Question Time like he\u2019s some sort of Twitter troll coming in here on a daily basis, seeking to smear and engage in misleading and misrepresentations, Mr Speaker, in one grubby attempt to simply try and prop himself up, because he\u2019s got nothing else to talk about, Mr Speaker. ...So, I reject absolutely what the leader of the opposition put to this chamber when he came to his feet yet again, Mr Speaker. This is what the leader of the opposition constantly does. He thinks this place is some sort of game. He thinks that the issues that are happening outside of this place, somehow they fall deaf on his ears, Mr Speaker. As all he does is constantly focuses on the smear games of politics, Mr Speaker. He talks about advertising. Mr Speaker, already, already on the Labor sites they have an advertisement which actually features defence force personnel. And he comes in here, lecturing this government about those types of practices, Mr Speaker. I would encourage the leader of the opposition to turn his attention ... to the focus of what is the government, right now, Mr Speaker, we are dealing with the very serious issues of Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus. The leader of the opposition is even yet to ask me a question on the fact, Mr Speaker. Last week, he couldn\u2019t even bother turning up, preferring selfies with sports stars than informing himself about the coronavirus. And when we approached him a week ago, Mr Speaker, so the National Security Committee could meet, they engaged in disruptive, pathetic games in this place. I\u2019m not going to take lectures from the leader of the opposition, who is the equivalent of a Twitter troll in this Parliament. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: yesterday, General Campbell, the chief of the defence force, and the prime minister were asked the same question - did they speak about the prime minister\u2019s bushfire ad? General Campbell answered yes. General Campbell could give a straight answer to that simple question. Why can\u2019t the prime minister? Did General Campbell speak to the prime minister to object to the Liberal party bushfire advertisement? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I confirmed yesterday that the CDF and I had discussed this matter. I confirmed that in this House yesterday. Those opposite may not have been paying attention, Mr Speaker. But if they reflect on what I said yesterday, I confirmed that he and I spoke, Mr Speaker, on regular occasions. It includes this matter, Mr Speaker. ...And I would not characterise the conversation in the way that the member just did at the dispatch box, Mr Speaker. As a reader pointed out earlier today, not accepting the \u201ccharacterisation\u201d of the question is the new \u201cCanberra bubble\u201d deflection. Scott Morrison continues: This is the government that, on the most recent national accounts, has seen growth well in excess of the OECD average, Mr Speaker, and compared to the G7 nations, Mr Speaker, only the United States was growing more quickly than Australia over the last 12 months. Mr Speaker, what I know about the economic management of those opposite is when they put stimulus measures in place, they sent cheques to pets and dead people, Mr Speaker. They engaged in programs which saw people\u2019s homes burn down, and overpriced school halls. They saw a stimulus package, Mr Speaker, that they were still spending money on four years after the crisis had passed, Mr Speaker. The Australian people remember the fiscal recklessness of the Labor Party, and that\u2019s why they keep rejecting them, time after time after time. This leader of the Labor party, Mr Speaker, this leader of the opposition is arguably the most financially inept of all the leaders they\u2019ve had in the past. Mr Speaker, he\u2019s cockier than the last bloke, Mr Speaker, he\u2019s more arrogant than the last bloke, Mr Speaker, and he\u2019s even more incompetent. Tanya Plibersek to Anthony Albanese: My question is to the prime minister: how can we trust the government\u2019s promised stimulus package will be effective when it\u2019s already bungled the bushfire recovery, not spent a cent of its promised $4.8bn urban congestion fund on urban congestion, and still hasn\u2019t implemented a business tax incentive that it flagged six months ago? Morrison: This is the government that, over the last six years, has restored the balance sheet of this country. Restored the balance sheet of this country from the reckless spending ... and, Mr Speaker, the inept financial management of those opposite, Mr Speaker. ...And Australians have returned this Government, not once, Mr Speaker, but twice, Mr Speaker, because they understand that the Liberal and National parties know how to manage money, Mr Speaker. And that\u2019s why they know, as we come together and we deal with this very real and significant challenge to our economy, which has been caused by the global coronavirus, Mr Speaker, they know that we will have the discipline to ensure that these measures will be targeted to those affected who need it most, that they will be measured and proportional to the challenge, Mr Speaker, and that they will be scalable to ensure that the Government can continue to respond as is necessary to support to keep Australians healthy, to keep Australians in jobs, to keep Australian businesses in business, Mr Speaker. This is the government that\u2019s cut taxes, this is the government that has led to the creation of 1.5m new jobs, Mr Speaker. Barnaby Joyce is still paying penance. He has to ask a dixer to Michael McCormack. His microphone is off, but no one notices he booms so loud. I\u2019m just going to take the opportunity to go to the bathroom. It\u2019s a better use of my time. Oh look, Josh Frydenberg has come back and said everything is fine. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: The treasurer flagged in September the government would introduce tax breaks for business investment. It\u2019s now March and still nothing has happened. Does the treasurer acknowledge this delay has, in fact, caused businesses to hold back investment decisions for the last six months, at a time when business investment was already at a 28 year low on his watch? Frydenberg: It\u2019s a bit rich, coming from the member for Rankin, who took to the last election a tax on family businesses, Mr Speaker! It\u2019s a bit rich coming from the member for Rankin, who talked about an investment allowance, which would start in 2021, Mr Speaker. He\u2019s interrupted for a point of order on relevance. He\u2019ll come back and say everything is fine. Josh Frydenberg continues his new habit of listing the backbencher\u2019s qualifications in his effusive thanks for their dixer, which can only be put down to banking goodwill for a future leadership tile. There are no leadership rumours. But Frydenberg is an ambitious MP. He\u2019s not in the game to stop at treasurer. Rebekha Sharkie to Scott Morrison: Interest rate cuts are hurting Australia\u2019s pensioners. Why doesn\u2019t the Government automatically pass on changes in the RBA cash rate to the pensioner deeming rate? Morrison: And I\u2019m going to ask the Treasurer to add further to this answer, Mr Speaker. But as the member will know, on the last occasion when there was a cut in rates, we also reconsidered the deeming rate, Mr Speaker. We are currently in the process of pulling together the response to the economic challenges that the country is facing in relation to the coronavirus, and I\u2019ll ask the Treasurer to make further comment. Frydenberg: (who looks like he didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night. Plus, he is using his very serious calm quiet voice, so you know he\u2019s feeling it) It\u2019s a significant issue. And as she would be aware, last year we made some changes to the deeming rate, so the lower-level deeming rate is at 1%, Mr Speaker. That was at a cost to the budget of $600 million over four years, and benefited around 1 million Australians. Now, Mr Speaker, when it comes to setting the deeming rates, you obviously need to take into account investments in a range of assets - superannuation, shares, in terms of managed funds, term deposits, not just the cash rate, Mr Speaker. But obviously this is a serious issue that we have under consideration and will be part of our broader response. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister guarantee that Australians will not suffer a recession under his government? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I can guarantee the Australian people that they will get the strong economic management they voted for. Catherine King to David Littleproud: And my question is to the minister for agriculture: is the minister concerned about the impact of the government\u2019s inland rail route on agricultural businesses on the Condamine flood plain? If so, what is he doing about it? Littleproud: And can I thank the honourable member for her question. And, yes, I do have concerns. In fact, I have been very public about those concerns. It is prime agricultural land. It is a complex flood plain in which inland rail is proposing to go across. This is an important piece of infrastructure for our nation, and obviously the farmers there \u2013 I have been working very closely with \u2013 they are pragmatic people and they understand, they want an engineering solution to something that is very difficult to get. That is why I have had many conversations with... Well, if you\u2019d like me to answer. The CEO of ARTC about some of those concerns that go back to the hydrology, the baseline hydrology. In fact, we have a meeting next week in Sydney to go through that with hydrologists from both the farming group and also ARTC to make sure those baseline hydrology parameters are set. And then the engineering solution that fits that hydrology is put in place. That is a calm, methodical approach to a key piece of infrastructure. But I will stand with those farmers, who I represent and I know personally. They have significant businesses, they are important to this nation\u2019s economy, they are important to those communities. So, we will work through this in a calm, methodical way, but ensure that this is predicated on science and engineering, not on emotion. Fiona Martin delivers the dixer reminding me that there are SO many frustrated would-be school captains in the parliament. Scott Morrison: We\u2019re putting together the technology plan, and a technology road map, Mr Speaker, which may well exceed a zero net carbon outcome in 2050, Mr Speaker. It may well exceed that, Mr Speaker. But those opposite came up with a target, they had no clue what it would cost, no clue how they would get there, Mr Speaker. The interview that the [deputy] leader of the opposition gave on David Speers needed encryption analysts to work out what he was actually saying, Mr Speaker. They still haven\u2019t worked it out. Mr Speaker, Labor has no plan, no clue, no targets, no idea. It\u2019s the final one of the sitting week and EVERYONE is in. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison \u2013 on whether he has done any modelling on climate change and 2050 and does he have the confidence in his position to agree to a debate at the National Press Club before the climate change conference in Glasgow this year? Morrison: Unlike the Labor Party, unlike those opposite, Mr Speaker, we\u2019ve got a plan. We\u2019ve got a plan, Mr Speaker. And we\u2019ve got a target for 2030, which we\u2019re going to meet, and we\u2019re gonna beat, Mr Speaker. Just as we have already met and will beat the target for 2020, Mr Speaker. And 10 years ago we were in opposition and we set out a plan to hit the 2020 target, Mr Speaker, and we have, and we\u2019ll hit that target, and we will beat that target with the plan we put in place 10 years ago. And we have a plan to meet the 2030 target, and we set that out before the last election, Mr Speaker. He goes on, but do I have to tell you again that the government plan is less of a plan and more of a vague mud map full of maybes and sort ofs? I hope not. Again, who says no one pays attention to Canberra. \u201cWhy we can all get into this blame game and we might feel better if we see our name in the newspaper, we have to help people, we have to help all people,\u201d says Bega MP Andrew Constance to Sky News. The NSW Liberal frontbencher, who still looks exhausted from the summer he went through with his community, was responding to Michael McCormack\u2019s latest ridiculous word vomit, saying he gets \u201cannoyed\u201d that the federal government has been left to carry the load when it comes to the bushfire response. It hasn\u2019t. The deputy prime minister, who couldn\u2019t even answer a question about whether or not he was in charge while Scott Morrison was on holidays in Hawaii during the bushfire crisis, is either getting some stupid advice, or is just taking it upon himself to be an idiot. You decide. Question time is almost upon us. It\u2019s the fifth last one before the budget is handed down in early May. Scott Morrison says he has no doubt people of Australia are doing things like \u201cmaking a curry and taking it over\u201d to people who might be self-isolating and don\u2019t have access to Uber Eats and I just need to go lay down for a little bit because I can. not. Scott Morrison then moves on to why you won\u2019t know what the government is modelling for: We\u2019ve been careful not to be speculative about this in the public domain. What we have done all the way through this global health crisis, I think, is to be very candid and upfront and we will continue to do that but what we won\u2019t do is be speculative, because we\u2019re not in the position of creating unnecessary anxiety. What we are in the business of doing is making plans to ensure that we can deal with any gaps, or any respective shortfalls, [and] have contingencies in place that address what we may be seeing coming through the modelling. But the modelling at this stage relies on a lot of data, some of which is being sourced from experiences we are seeing overseas where you have to have a degree of scepticism about a lot of the assumptions you put in place. In response to Sarah Martin\u2019s question about what we are facing, in terms of infections, Brendan Murphy says: There\u2019s a range of modelling, some is just mathematical predictions \u2013predictions from best-case scenario to worst-case scenario \u2013 and then looking at what impact that would have on every part of the set, primary care, emergency department \u2026 critical care beds, and we are looking at our current capacity and we will compare that with the model capacity, but we are looking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks. And we think our health system is able to cope with that, but we are making sure, the parameters have been very clear to us that we need to be sure that we plan for every eventuality, and build capacity where we think it may be under pressure if we have one of the worst-case scenarios. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy: The importation risk, as we have also said recently, has been significantly greater outside of China in recent weeks, particularly Iran, we are very worried about Iran. The other two highest risk countries are South Korea and Italy, where they have large caseloads. [In the case of] South Korea there is significant travel to Australia. We know that we will get more cases. We are seeing a couple of cases identified every day but we have very robust systems to detect, as [has been said] many times before, we have tested well over 10,000 people, the great majority have been negative, we will continue testing anyone with a return travel history or indeed now as New South Wales health department [has said], people who may have been in contact with someone who has a suspect disease. We need to broaden our testing capability, but we need to also remember the most important thing, and I say this every time I take to the media, is that any return travel from any part of the world where there is a Covid-19 outbreak who develop symptoms should isolate and seek medical attention. That is the most important way we can deal with and stop spread in Australia, but at the moment, there is no reason to put a mask on when you are walking around the shops, there is no reason to stop going to football matches or community activities, there is no reason to delude the shelves of lavatory paper in the supermarkets. We should continue normal activity, we should watch the development of this and we will focus on any outbreaks and control. Scott Morrison finishes his introductory spiel with a nice foray into Trump nationalism: To all Australians, let\u2019s get through this together, let\u2019s help each other, stay calm, go about business and continue to enjoy the most wonderful country in the world to live and that does not change. Under these circumstances, it does not change and we have always worked well together, we have always understood what our responsibilities are and we have always gone about business with common sense and that is what we are known for so let\u2019s do that and I am sure I have no doubt that Australians will get through this, as we get through everything else. *eye roll emoji* Of course we will get through it. We are not the first country to deal with a pandemic. We may be the first country to go nuts over toilet paper during a pandemic though. Scott Morrison: In relation to the Republic of Korea, we will also be upgrading the travel advice to level three, which is to reconsider the need to travel to the Republic of Korea, and it will be at level four which is do not travel to the province of Daegu. In relation to Korea, the reason we have taken this decision is because of the high level of visitation we are seeing from Korea then we have seen come from Italy and the ability to immediately put in place the enhanced screening measures that I\u2019ve talked about for Italy and to do that that Korea would be far more difficult. So that ban is put in place because it affords the best protection and enables us to slow down the rate of transmission which means that the health system and all the other plants put in place will be able to deal with the virus here, in Australia. Scott Morrison is giving the update on the coronavirus spread: \u2013 the travel ban on China will be extended, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) will be added to the ban list, for the time being: The first point I want to make is this, every Australian, all of our citizens, me as the Prime Minister, Minister for Health, Chief Medical Officer, mums, dads, schoolteachers, nurses, workers, boys and girls, we all have a role to play in containing and managing the spread of the coronavirus and ensuring that Australia is best prepared and best able to deal with this global virus. We all have a role to play. We all have responsibilities to play to support each other, help each other and inform each other, assist each other, as we all get through what will be a difficult time in the months ahead. Mike Bowers: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain that, so I am just going to put this in the system as \u2018Bob Katter press conference\u2019.\u201d Meanwhile, the Greens are flagging that they will play \u201cSenate hardball\u201d on any legislation that might be needed to enact the government\u2019s proposed coronavirus stimulus package. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that after the \u201csports rorts\u201d affair, he did not trust the government to follow independent advice to keep Australia out of recession. The party will demand changes to legislation to ensure the stimulus package included a lift to Newstart and Youth Allowance, as well as support for affected workers who have no paid sick leave. \u201cThe Greens will demand a \u2018bottom up\u2019, transparent stimulus package to keep Australia out of recession,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cThe best way to avoid recession and tackle inequality is through a green new deal, which starts with lifting Newstart and Youth Allowance by at least $95, because this money will be spent on essentials and go straight back into the economy.\u201d While Labor will likely back the stimulus package, details of which are expected next week, Bandt said their vote may still be \u201ccrucial\u201d if legislation needs to pass the Senate. It will also push the government to extend the Disaster Relief Allowance to workers without paid sick leave who get affected by the virus and follow government advice to stay home. \u201cOtherwise these workers may be financially forced to come to work, which would hamper efforts to contain the disease.\u201d \u201cThe Greens\u2019 votes in the Senate helped keep Australia out of recession during the GFC, and I\u2019m putting Scott Morrison on notice that we\u2019re prepared to pay hardball in the Senate to ensure a \u2018bottom up\u2019, transparent approach to keeping Australia out of recession.\u201d Scott Morrison has called a press conference for 1pm, to give an update on coronavirus. Look, I just feel like I need to apologise for Queensland today. It remains the greatest nation on earth, but still. I\u2019m sorry. Meanwhile, the economics committee has gone off on a tangent, with One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts trying to ask Treasury\u2019s fiscal group about funding to local government. He says he has questions about widespread corruption in Queensland councils and wants to know how much federal funding has gone to local government. He attempts to table a document, which chair Slade Brockman says he won\u2019t accept. \u201cI\u2019m not denying there might not be an issue with these councils ... I will just remind you that these are Treasury officials.\u201d Roberts says Treasury is looking after taxpayer money and he wanted them to be aware of his concerns. It seems like there would be a lot stronger liquids than coffee being poured into the #SmugMug this week. The economics committee is now hearing evidence from Treasury\u2019s fiscal group. Labor senator Katy Gallagher is grilling officials on the Coalition\u2019s claim last April that the budget was \u201cback in black\u201d. \u201cThere were mugs printed with that on it. My question is ... is the budget back in black?\u201d Gallagher asked. In response, Jenny Wilkinson, the deputy secretary of the department\u2019s fiscal group, said the budget was in balance. \u201cThe final budget outcome for 2018-19 was released at the end of last year in September, and that final budget outcome showed that as a percentage of GDP, the budget balance was 0.0 per cent of GDP.\u201d \u201cIn our mind that is a budget being in balance.\u201d Gallagher then challenged government senator Jane Hume, asking her whether the budget was back in black. \u201cThe budget is back on track ... the first balance budget has been delivered,\u201d Hume said. \u201cIt will be updated in the final budget outcome.\u201d Bob Katter also brought along props \u2013 a copy of Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, 1984, a giant scarf, $19,000 in cash and a gold bullion dealer. He has the seat of Kennedy for as long as he wants it. A bit from Mike Bowers this morning: Bob Katter has just held his latest unhinged press conference. He had about $19,000 which he handed to a gold bullion dealer. It will not surprise you to learn that Katter is also a prepper. If you are hoarding toilet paper, you follow the same thought process as Bob Katter. Let that sink in. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher is now delving into Wednesday\u2019s national account figures. Officials confirm the December figures did not reflect the economic fallout from the bushfires, apart from a boost from some insurance payments that flowed in the last three months of 2019. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t, at a macro level, a discernible impact,\u201d Meghan Quinn said. Gallagher is pushing Quinn on the strength of the economy. Gallagher says the economy was weaker in December than forecast in the budget, while Quinn is arguing that growth picked up in the last quarter and was stronger in the second half of the year than the first. \u201cWe would characterise the Australian economy as solid and certainly there was no news in December that would have changed our mind,\u201d Quinn said. Gallagher, however, said business investment \u201chad tanked\u201d and the government was responding to the coronavirus outbreak from a position of weakness, with growth figures downgraded since the April budget. Both are right. While Frances Adamson is under the Penny Wong estimates heat lamp, it is worth reheating one of my favourite Dfat stories. When she started as departmental boss (the first woman to take up the role) she and Julie Bishop had a chat to departmental officials about renaming some of the meeting rooms in the Dfat building. Because while several, distinguished male diplomats had been honoured with a room, the rest were named after flowers. FLOWERS It was politely suggested that perhaps there were some female diplomats who may deserve the same honour, a suggestion which appeared to take some of the men by surprise, but was never the less taken up. No word though on whether a man had to repeat a woman\u2019s suggestion for the idea to be taken on board. Over in social services estimates, Jordon Steele-John is grilling the officials over the NDIS. He opens with a novel question to the social services minister, Anne Ruston: \u201cDo you have life goals?\u201d She is stumped. \u201cI could take it on notice.\u201d Ruston says these are not really questions for her to answer in estimates. Steele-John has a point to this question. He asks why are scheme participants asked to articulate a \u201clife goal\u201d that is \u201cclear, realistic and measurable\u201d when working out their NDIS plans. The NDIA chief executive, Martin Hoffman, says it\u2019s always been a part of the NDIS Act, but Steele-John disagrees \u2013 saying that it was only required that supports are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d. Steele-John says it\u2019s part of a new trial, which introduces that the participant\u2019s life goal should be \u201cclear, realistic and measurable\u201d. Hoffman says that at the \u201cend of the day\u201d, the decisions about goals are made by participants. Steele-John still thinks it\u2019s none of the NDIA\u2019s business for the agency to comment on a person\u2019s life goals, which he says are subjective and philosophical questions. I can not tell you how much I laughed at Eric Abetz\u2019s lamenting \u201cwe are on the big issues here\u201d over the Brian Houston debacle, given one of his first questions in the ABC estimates hearing was over Gerard Henderson, who gets paid to observe the Australian media through the eyes of a dog, no longer appearing on Insiders. Can you bear it? We\u2019ve now rolled around to Scott Morrison attempting to get the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston an invitation to the White House in Dfat estimates. What a stupid saga this has been. The Labor senators Tim Ayers and Penny Wong want to know what Morrison asked the Americans for in terms of the invitation. The Dfat secretary, Frances Adamson, says she\u2019s not aware of that information. Ayers raises FOI applications about the Houston invite, which were denied on the basis the disclosure would harm the bilateral relationship with the US. Was Dfat consulted about those denials? Another Dfat official says the department was consulted. \u201cThe only embarrassment here was for the prime minister,\u201d Wong says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to answer the question so the whole public service had to fall into line with that\u201d. The Liberal senator Eric Abetz observes that\u2019s a comment. Wong agrees. It is, indeed, a comment. Ayers wants to know whether Dfat knew, when it last gave not very helpful evidence about this matter at estimates, that Morrison wanted Houston at the state dinner at the White House. Adamson says Dfat didn\u2019t have complete visibility over that issue, noting she travelled with Morrison during last year\u2019s visit to Washington. \u201cIt was a matter for the prime minister and his office,\u201d she says. Ayers asks when Adamson knew Morrison wanted Houston at the state dinner. Adamson says she knew when Morrison told the radio host Ben Fordham this week. She was aware of speculation prior to that, but she says Dfat wasn\u2019t handling that element of the visit. Ayers wonders why it was vital that information not be shared to protect the bilateral relationship, and then it was suddenly OK this week. Adamson tries to tough the reverse-ferret out, but Wong is on a roll about Morrison\u2019s embarrassment. \u201cWe are on the big issues here,\u201d Eric Abetz notes. Wong notes the honesty of the prime minister is a significant issue. It is also worth noting that Treasury official Meghan Quinn was asked a bit earlier about whether the department had done any modelling on the possibility of a recession. Quinn said the department provided all sorts of forecasts, but \u201cat the moment, we are not forecasting a recession for the Australian economy.\u201d In the economics committee, secretary Steven Kennedy has been asked about wages growth, which Labor senator Katy Gallagher said was \u201cstagnating\u201d, according to figures in the mid year budget update that show the wage price index at 2.5%. Kennedy said Australia shared the \u201cconundrum\u201d with other countries, but he was confident that wages would grow once labour productivity improved. \u201cIt remains my view that the fundamental driver of wages in the longer term ... will be about lifting labour productivity, and labour productivity is low.\u201d \u201cWe have to continue the long hard work of trying to make ourselves more productive and I think the labour market and wages would lift as a result of that.\u201d Treasury official Meghan Quinn said Wednesday\u2019s national accounts showed a \u201cwelcome pick-up\u201d to average earnings across the economy, which take into account other payments. Finance minister Mathias Cormann said wages were continuing to grow faster than inflation, but Gallagher said people were not feeling that they were any better off. Cormann also indicated that the government\u2019s failed company tax cut agenda had been part of its productivity agenda. Labor has asked education, skills and employment department officials about the PaTH internship scheme, which so far has created 56,000 internships and had 88,700 people participate (there are other elements, such as job readiness training). Labor\u2019s Louise Pratt wants to know whether the government is on track to meet its target of 30,000 internships this financial year. Departmental official Derrick Stiller replies that in the first six months to 31 December, 1,881 internship placements have occurred. Stiller: \u201cWe always seek and strive to have internships that help young people. Our key driver is getting young people into work. We know internships have a good outcome rate post a completed internship.\u201d The government is trying to boost its numbers by starting industry pilots with nine organisations, which are expected to add a further 2,000 internships \u2013 but that still seems a long way short of 30,000. Officials then note that 30,000 is a cap applied for funding purposes, not a guarantee that 30,000 internships will be created. You can see why this enrages Labor: the government sets aside money, gets to claim it\u2019s creating a BIG NUMBER of internships which then don\u2019t get created. It\u2019s marketing. Michaelia Cash said the young people being targeted \u201cface serious barriers to entering work\u201d and the government hopes by working with industry it can tailor the program more to young people\u2019s needs. The Labor senator Penny Wong has more questions about what charges Julian Assange will face if he is expedited to the US. Wong confirms Assange will not face the death penalty, but could face a sentence of up to 170 years in prison for 17 counts of violating the US Espionage Act. Dfat officials say it is impossible to know the extent of the penalty that could be applied. Wong wants to know whether the government has made any representations to the UK about the terms of any extradition should Assange be sent to the US. Marise Payne says not at this stage, but that remains an open issue. Wong wonders whether the government would make representations to the UK about the possibility that Assange could face further charges if he\u2019s sent to the US, including charges which would attract the death penalty. \u201cWe have an Australian, we have a view about the death penalty, the UK has a similar position,\u201d Wong says. \u201cPresumably it is open for Australia to make representations to the UK government?\u201d Payne says the prospect of doing that remains open. Wong wonders whether Assange has still withdrawn his consent for consular assistance. Officials say they have written to him seven times to try and ascertain whether the withdrawal of consent remains current. Here are the videos Scott Cam has done for Michaelia Cash\u2019s department. This one has had a whopping 538 views since it was launched in October last year: And this one, launched in last month, has had 65 views: We asked the shadow minister, Tanya Plibersek, what she thought: Today in Senate estimates we learnt that the Liberals have paid celebrity tradie Scott Cam $145,000 for two short videos, four social media posts, and a press conference with Scott Morrison. Given Mr Morrison\u2019s marketing experience, does he consider that value for money? The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has questions about Julian Assange. Are consular officials in the court? The answer is yes, and regular reports are being provided to the government. Whish-Wilson references new reports that Assange doesn\u2019t have proper access to lawyers in the court, and can\u2019t hear because of noise. The Dfat official, Andrew Todd, says the court has ruled on those matters, and \u201cwe are not in a position to comment\u201d. The official says Assange has withdrawn consent for information to be provided to the department, and that makes things more difficult. Whish-Wilson asks whether Dfat believes a Assange is getting a fair trial. Todd says words to the effect that there is no current reason to believe he isn\u2019t getting a fair trial. The Greens senator wonders whether being stripped naked is fair treatment. Marise Payne says standard pre-court procedures are being applied. \u201cThe approach being taken to Mr Assange is no different,\u201d Payne says. Whish-Wilson asks whether Dfat has confirmed whether Assange\u2019s meetings inside the Ecuadorian embassy were filmed? The Dfat official says there are separate legal proceedings under way in Spain addressing that issue. \u201cLeaving it to a foreign court is one thing, do you not have a view?\u201d Whish-Wilson says. Todd notes his personal views aren\u2019t relevant. Whish-Wilson asks will the Australian government advocate for the Spanish proceedings to be paused until the British legal matters are concluded? I didn\u2019t hear a direct answer to that question. Payne says she raised her expectations that Assange will be subject to proper due process with the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, when he was in Australia recently. In the wake of sports rorts, every government program is now under the microscope for partisan allocation. In education estimates, Labor has asked about the $50m industry training hubs program, on the basis that, of the 10 locations announced after the election was called, six were in Coalition seats and three were in marginals (Herbert, Braddon and Cowan), two of which the Coalition then went on to win. Skills minister Michaelia Cash said she signed off on the locations, but she\u2019s taken on notice a string of questions about when she did that, whether she followed the department\u2019s recommendations and whether there was any contact with the prime minister\u2019s office. Labor also wants to know why other areas with very high youth unemployment missed out, such as Coffs Harbour (23.3% youth unemployment), outback Queensland (25.7% youth unemployment), Bendigo (18.3% youth unemployment). Speaking of Bob Katter: Alan Jones is also very upset about this. Glad they are speaking up for the little people, who are gagging to be able to transfer more than $10,000 at a time. The quorum games are in full force today. Labor is calling quorums because the government keeps shutting down its debates. And around and around we go. It doesn\u2019t impact Scott Morrison, but it is really starting to piss off government backbenchers, who keep being dragged back into the chamber. This has upset Bob Katter Katter: \u201cI am demanding to know whether this announcement from Mr Entsch is just hot air and baloney, or whether, as we hope, he has been genuine and sincere, in which case we want to see the money. \u201cShow me the money! \u201cWe have put a lot of time and effort into promoting the region, as the community is aware, and we worked hard to secure these breakthroughs from state and federal governments. \u201cWe are very proud of the region\u2019s prominent tourism leaders that we have been able to support. \u201cWe will be launching a promotional campaign that will roll out every fortnight.\u201d The Green senator Mehreen Faruqi is asking Dfat officials why their climate change strategy is based on the Paris agreement scenario of 2C warming rather than 3 or 4C warming, which agencies like the Bureau of Meteorology (and others) are pointing to as a potential scenario. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that is being discussed across government,\u201d says the Dfat climate ambassador Jamie Isbister. But he adds there are a range of expert reports, with a range of temperature scenarios. He points out the fundamental objective of the Paris agreement is to keep warming below 2C. The Dfat secretary, Frances Adamson, says the climate strategy, which was released by Dfat last November, remains the current working document. AAP has more on Scott Cam\u2019s taxpayer pay day: The Morrison government has defended TV tradie Scott Cam\u2019s job as taxpayer-funded careers ambassador despite the Gold Logie winner attending just one event since October. The Block star\u2019s sole public appearance was a press conference alongside the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and skills minister, Michaelia Cash, to announce his appointment last year. Since becoming national careers ambassador, Cam has pocketed $145,000 of his $350,000 18-month contract. Skills department officials told Senate estimates on Thursday that Cam had also appeared in three short videos, made four social media posts and put a profile on a government website. The skills minister, Michaelia Cash, defended Cam\u2019s work, saying his job was about influencing people\u2019s views of vocational education and training. \u201cIt\u2019s about utilising that profile to draw people\u2019s attention into what otherwise they may not actually give any notice to,\u201d she told the committee. The skills and training deputy secretary, Nadine Williams, said his pay packet wasn\u2019t a salary. \u201cMr Cam has been contracted to do a range of activities that are designed to raise the profile of VET and designed to raise the profile of careers advice more generally,\u201d she said. Senator Cash also told estimates the celebrity builder would host the Australian Training awards in November. \u201cIt is literally the Logies of training awards,\u201d she said. It was also promised Cam would appear at eight events this year, including one with Senator Cash next week. \u201cLike The Block, we\u2019re going to have to wait for the reveal,\u201d Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill said. The previous Labor government also paid Cam to open trade fairs. Back on the coronavirus, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has confirmed the government is looking at boosting stockpiles of certain items, saying they are \u201cmaking judgments right now\u201d about what is needed. When asked by Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick to give examples, Cormann said things like masks and various medications were being considered. \u201cThere are stockpiles ... available to deal with emergencies if and when they happen, and we are currently seeking to supplement some of those arrangements,\u201d Cormann said. This exchange shows how the potential difficulties the government might have if the robodebt class action gets to trial. Greens senator Rachel Siewert asks: \u201cDoes the government consider it has a common-law duty of care to people that are on income support payments?\u201d Social services minister, Anne Ruston: \u201cAs the minister for social services I believe that I have a responsibility to develop policy that is administered through the agencies \u2026 that provides the support system that people in Australia expect.\u201d But Ruston says she is not going to go into a \u201clegal discussion in relation to the interpretation of duty of care\u201d, nothing that there is a federal court case into robodebt \u2013 a class action being run by Gordon Legal. Siewert: \u201cShould our social security system not cause harm to another person?\u201d Ruston takes it on notice. \u201cI understand where you\u2019re going but I would like to take that on notice so I can make sure the clarity of my answer is absolutely correct as it relates to social services guide and policy,\u201d she says. \u201cAs we often know, the common use of a term or words are not necessarily interpreted the same by law, and I would like make sure response to you is absolutely accurate\u201d. There\u2019s been a session in Dfat estimates about the impacts of the phase one trade deal between Washington and Beijing (which is the start of a settlement to the trade dispute between presidents Trump and Xi). The Labor senator Penny Wong has been asking questions about the (negative) impact of this deal on Australian exports to China, given it covers commodities such as coal, LNG, barley and wheat. One of the economists at the table says there is the potential for \u201cimport replacement\u201d (which in simple terms means American imports to China replace Australian imports) but the negative consequences for Australia are expected to be relatively minor. Wong raises comments made by Australia\u2019s outgoing ambassador in Washington, Joe Hockey. Hockey reportedly said the trade deal was \u201cwritten on rice paper, anyone can tear it up at any moment\u201d. Wong is not amused by rice paper. When I say not amused I mean annoyed. I think it\u2019s fair to say the secretary, Frances Adamson, and the minister, Marise Payne, aren\u2019t amused either. Wong asks Adamson whether she can explain the rice paper analogy. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can senator,\u201d Adamson replies, deadpan. Wong asks Payne whether Hockey ran these comments past the government. \u201cThey were not discussed with the government,\u201d Payne says, deadpan. What is the government\u2019s position, Wong asks? The position is Australia welcomes the agreement. Senators have clashed in the economics committee over climate change after Treasury refused to reveal whether they had been involved in modelling emission reduction scenarios. Labor senator Jenny McAllister asked whether the department was undertaking any modelling about different emission reduction scenarios that could be taken to the UN climate change summit in Glasgow later this year, known as Cop 26. There is fierce debate within Coalition ranks about the possibility of signing up to a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050, as has been agreed to by more than 70 other countries. Treasury official Meghan Quinn said she would need to take the question on notice, prompting accusations that she was not answering the question for fear of \u201cretaliation\u201d from the government. There was lots of yelling, so it was hard to hear what everyone was saying, but McAllister at one point said \u201cyou are kidding?\u201d, suggesting the officials would know if modelling work was taking place and was deliberately obfuscating. McAllister then asked whether Treasury had been asked to cost the effect of a trajectory of warming, but Quinn revealed no work had been done since the update to the Garnaut review, more than a decade ago. \u201cNot in recent times, no, but we were involved in looking at different scenarios \u2013 but going back more than 10 years ago, as part of the two Garnaut review process, and that did look at different scenarios,\u201d Quinn said. While saying the work was possible to do, she said there was an \u201cinexact translation of climate impacts\u201d into the economy. She also said that Treasury often worked with other departments on scenario analysis, but said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was the lead agency for international agreements. Quinn confirmed that before Australia signed up to the Paris target of cutting emissions by 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030, Treasury had provided advice at that time. This comes after Michael McCormack screwed up his other big moment \u2013 asking the states, who agreed to bring forward infrastructure projects in October last year, to get cracking, by asking the states to once again bring forward infrastructure projects. So what he actually ended up doing was contradicting the prime minister, who less than 24 hours before had said: Now, we brought forward $3.8 billion worth of infrastructure projects last year. And I sat down together with the iInfrastructure minister and the urban infrastructure minister with states and territories to identify those elements of the supply pipeline and our infrastructure program to get as much of that into this next, you know this six months and the next financial year. Now, I\u2019m pleased we did that, because that means those projects are now being accelerated and that will play a part in what can be made to occur. And if there are any elements of that that we can move more quickly, fine. But it\u2019s not a simple thing to do. You can\u2019t just turn on an infrastructure project, not even necessarily one that\u2019s even under way in terms of ramping up its level of activity. I mean, they will have issues about supply lines as well. And so what you have to focus on is that is the things that can move more readily. Cool beans. Michael McCormack has once again shown why he has earned the \u201csentient loaf of white bread\u201d title, blaming the states for the bushfire recovery issues, in the Australian: Mr McCormack, who is playing a central role in the bushfire recovery process led by Andrew Colvin, also launched an attack on state governments and suggested the commonwealth had been left with the heavy lifting. The Transport and Infrastructure minister said on both coronavirus and bushfire responses, the state governments have to \u201cstump up too\u201d. \u2018It really annoys me that I think states have been let off the hook largely this summer,\u2019 he said. \u2018Everything has fallen in the lap of the federal government. The states \u2014 some of their members have come out swinging, and swinging hard, when in fact they needed to look a little bit closer in their own backyard to see that their own governments, and some of them were in government, weren\u2019t doing enough and weren\u2019t doing anything, quite frankly.\u2019 Mr McCormack said that under the federation model, the state governments take on responsibility as \u2018first responders\u2019 and had performed that role in fighting the fires. \u2018But as far as the recovery efforts, again the states first and foremost rely on us when they call us, but we can\u2019t do it all as a commonwealth because that\u2019s their obligation and responsibility.\u2019 This is seriously what he believes has happened. The man who couldn\u2019t admit or work out if he was leading the country while Scott Morrison was in Hawaii during the bushfire crisis is now all \u2018iT\u2019s tHE stAte\u2019s FaULt\u2019. Jim Chalmers spoke to Fran Kelly on ABC RN radio this morning, and said Labor would work to support the government on its stimulus package: Let\u2019s see what they announce and then we\u2019ll respond to it. We all want the economy to grow because when the economy grows it creates jobs and opportunities for people in our communities. That\u2019s the overarching goal. We want to support the government where we can. If it turns out that it\u2019s insufficient or poorly designed then we have a responsibility to point that out too. Our default position is to do what we can and to work with the government to get Australia through a difficult period. This is also worth noting This came after one of the defenders in the original article, Vasan Srinivasan, was revealed to be a long time Liberal party member and failed candidate The Labor senator Penny Wong has moved on to informing the Chinese government about the government\u2019s decision to impose a travel ban to help contain the spread of coronavirus. The Dfat secretary Frances Adamson has provided an exhaustive tick tock. The decision was taken by NSC on the afternoon of 1 February. That meeting was over by 4.10 pm. Adamson left Parliament House, drove back to Dfat, climbed the stairs to the fifth floor, and spoke first to her staff in Canberra and the Beijing post and then to the Chinese ambassador in Canberra \u201cby two minutes after 5\u201d. Adamson says the call was cordial. \u201cThere was no issue, if you like,\u201d she says. She says the ambassador was a little hard to reach because it was a Saturday afternoon, but reaching him by 5pm \u201cis fast by any stretch of the imagination\u201d. Steven Kennedy is now talking about how Treasury models the effects of climate change, saying the department is \u201cstepping up our work\u201d in that regard. He says there has been very little work done modelling the benefits of mitigating climate change risk. \u201cA lot of the economic modelling that is done looks really at the cost of transmission and has not considered the benefits of mitigation on the other side,\u201d Kennedy said. He says fully-integrated climate models are \u201ccomplex\u201d, but Treasury is working with the CSIRO to develop this capability. He says the last time an attempt was made to model both sides of the climate change equation was the climate change review undertaken by Ross Garnaut in 2008. But on the more serious matter \u2013 the pulling of the bill \u2013 there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a reason why. Tony Burke attempted to appeal to government backbenchers: You\u2019re not just being asked to silence opposition members; you\u2019re being asked to put off something substantive. You\u2019re being asked to put off a bill about multinational tax reform. To use the prime minister\u2019s trick, hands up how many of you know why. How many of you know why it\u2019s being put off? This is a bill that\u2019s gone through your party room. You\u2019ve had a minister stand up in the party room and tell you why this was a good thing to support, and you\u2019ve all agreed it should be supported. Every office was delivered the bill today and you were told this is what we\u2019d be debating next. Now, all of a sudden, you\u2019re not and you haven\u2019t been told why. The parliament hasn\u2019t been told why. Don\u2019t think that this room doesn\u2019t matter. This room is not a bubble. This room is the heart of democracy in Australia, and that\u2019s why you contested elections and that\u2019s why your constituents voted for you. The man who normally sits in that chair opposite has reduced your contribution to your principal role being to silence people with a different view \u2014 which makes the term \u2018debating chamber\u2019 a bit odd \u2014 and now to get rid of a bill about multinational tax reform without telling any of you why. Reading through the Hansard, the government rearranged business last night to postpone the tax avoidance bill. There was a pretty big debate about it in the chamber, with Tony Burke levelling this burn at Damian Drum (who you might remember missed out on being deputy speaker after Labor nominated his former National party room colleague Llew O\u2019Brien and won): I acknowledge the interjection from the former future deputy Speaker. I acknowledge his interjection as he leaves the room. His interjection matches the contribution that he has made to the parliament, and the parliament has already had a chance to vote specifically on a vote about him. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson is asking Treasury officials about a potential lift to Newstart, asking whether modelling had been done about what impact an increase to these payments could have on consumption. The short answer is no. Treasury secretary Kennedy says the department is mindful about the potential impact to low-income earners from a potential economic downturn, but that a permanent change to Newstart is something that should be considered separately to fiscal stimulus. \u201cIn terms of what is the case for increasing Newstart on a permanent basis, that is obviously a matter for government and ...it is a matter that should be considered in its own right. \u201cPredominantly our focus is more on the temporary measures, on the more macro aspects, and then it is a matter for the government to consider the adequacy of the Newstart. And in my view that should be considered as a structural feature of the system and that should be considered in its own right.\u201d The Labor senator Penny Wong has asked the officials to confirm the age of the youngest unaccompanied child (and by unaccompanied I mean minus parents) still in Wuhan. The answer is eight months old. Over in skills and training estimates, it turns out we are paying $355,000 to Scott Cam as \u201cnational skills ambassador\u201d to be a social media influencer. Cam, born in 1962, who hosts a reality home renovation show or something, is meant to be appealing to kids and convincing them to get into a trade. As Shalailah Medhora reports, his page on the department website has had a whopping 1,400 views and he has made a total of four social media posts. I will give a roll of toilet roll if any 16-year-old could pick him out of a line-up. Morning all, I\u2019ve tuned in to Dfat estimates. As Amy flagged, there\u2019s been an extensive conversation about Australians, including small children, left in Wuhan. Officials have outlined a list of reasons why it\u2019s not practical to bring home unaccompanied children at this point. The Labor senator Penny Wong is now asking about the decision to charge people $1,000 to leave Wuhan (cost-recovery that was subsequently dropped after a minor public stink). Wong wants to know how that decision-making unfolded. The answer is there was an NSC decision to impose cost recovery and then Scott Morrison made a decision not to impose cost recovery after advice from the Dfat secretary, Frances Adamson. \u201cI made the decision myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI was quite open with the minister and the prime minister that Dfat had given incorrect advice\u201d. Wong asks Marise Payne (the foreign minister) whether she or the prime minister told Dfat they were intending to reverse the decision to impose cost-recovery. Payne says the government was in constant contact with officials. Adamson said she expected the government would reverse the decision. The Greens\u2019 Rachel Siewert is pressing DSS officials about coronavirus and welfare payments. Siewert makes the point that people in precarious work \u2013 who don\u2019t get sick leave, for example \u2013 are currently expected to use up their savings before they are eligible for welfare payments. This is called the liquid assets test waiting period \u2013 which the government is trying to toughen through legislation right now. Essentially, the department says there is no change as yet, although Kathryn Campbell adds: \u201cWe are looking at these measures.\u201d Siewert wants them to waive the test. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve thought about this,\u201d a frustrated Siewert says. Campbell replies: \u201cWe are providing advice to government. These will be government decisions.\u201d Oh look, there is some legislation being put into the House. And it\u2019s to do with security. Because of course. From Peter Dutton\u2019s office: The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (International Production Orders) bill 2020 sets up a new framework in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 for the issue of orders for data directly to communications providers subject to an international agreement. The Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said the bill was an important step towards standing up agreements with close partner countries such as the United States for faster authorised access to electronic information. ... The bill\u2019s new framework is an essential precondition for Australia obtaining a proposed bilateral agreement with the United States pursuant to its Clarifying the Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (the CLOUD Act). \u201cThe United States, where many of the world\u2019s biggest communication providers are based, paved the way for much more efficient international crime cooperation with the CLOUD Act,\u201d Mr Dutton said. \u201cA CLOUD Act agreement with the United States will significantly benefit our law enforcement and national security agencies by allowing orders for communication data to be directed at those providers, with robust privacy and civil liberty protections. \u201cThere will be no trade-off of Australia\u2019s existing privacy and civil liberty protections to achieve this most welcome boost to our agencies\u2019 ability to keep Australians safe.\u201d The Bill includes technical amendments that ensure Australian service providers can respond to lawful orders for communications data from trusted countries with which Australia has an international agreement. Steven Kennedy continues: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be immediate support potentially around business to maintain people in employment.\u201d Kennedy flags keeping people employed in the tourism sector, as an example, until the shock passes, and help for business, particularly in the non-mining sector where growth has been slow. \u201cNot all businesses are affected to the same degree,\u201d Kennedy says, pointing to \u201chealthy balance sheets\u201d in some sectors. \u201cThe mining sector for example is enjoying good growth ... but there are certainly small and medium businesses that have been affected,\u201d Kennedy says. Finance minister Mathias Cormann says the government is focused on making \u201ca substantial response very soon to ensure that business is in business and that people keep their jobs.\u201d \u201cYes, this is going to be a challenging period but the fundamentals in the Australian economy are sound and on the other side of dealing with this challenge ... there will be a strong economy.\u201d Steven Kennedy is now talking about the shape of a government stimulus package, expected within the next week. He says that Treasury began work on a fiscal stimulus package \u201cin the last couple of weeks\u201d after it realised that the Covid-19 virus was going to have a broader effect than previous shocks, such as the Sars virus. Labor\u2019s shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, asks Kennedy to characterise what he thought the best fiscal response might be, asking him to compare it to the advice from former treasury secretary Ken Henry in the global financial crisis, who urged the government \u201cgo hard, go early, go households\u201d. Kennedy says that the impact of the virus is different as it captures both supply and demand. \u201cThe nature of the fiscal response in this case needs to reflect these supply and demand elements,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened with the GFC with the virtual closing of financial markets ... was aggregate demand really stopped on a dime, so to speak, and so a response to support demand very quickly, in light of what Ken Henry described, was appropriate in those circumstances. \u201cIn this case we need to accommodate the fact that our community is going through the spread of a virus and its own behaviour is disrupted through this. \u201cWe need to be thoughtful around when there is broader support for aggregate demand. We have a community and business sector well placed to respond to that stimulus because they feel like they are on the other side of the Covid-19 shock.\u201d Penny Wong to Dfat boss, Frances Adamson, on the question of Australian children stranded in China: \u201cSo what is the plan? We just wait?\u201d That appears to be what we have to do, yes. Australia has not requested a further flight, at this stage, says Marise Payne. Penny Wong \u201cwants to be clear\u201d that the government has not requested China officials enable non-Australian citizens help unaccompanied Australian children return to Australia. Payne confirms that no, the government has not made that request. She says we can\u2019t get the flight in \u2013 so there is no point in asking the question as yet. The Department of Social Services secretary, Kathryn Campbell, is being asked by Labor\u2019s Malarndirri McCarthy about coronavirus planning. Campbell says she received an email from a Newstart recipient who is in self-quarantine, raising concerns about their payments. \u201cThey were concerned they wouldn\u2019t be able to meet their mutual obligations requirements,\u201d Campbell said. Campbell said she passed on the person\u2019s details to Services Australia. Centrelink has been telling concerned welfare recipients that those who self-isolate will be exempted from the mutual obligations, such as job search and appointments. (Failing to meet these can see a person\u2019s payments suspended.) Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy has updated parliament on the economic impact of the coronavirus and the summer bushfires, saying the combined hit will be to see 0.7% slashed from economic growth in the first three months of the year. Kennedy said Treasury had believed that the weakness seen in the global economy was \u201cclose to bottoming out\u201d at the end of 2019, with some improvement being seen in before the hit. \u201cHowever the emergence of Covid-19 in late December and early January has significant negative impacts for the near term outlook for China ... and other nations as this virus has spread,\u201d Kennedy said. He said domestically the economy had performed better in the second half of last year than the first six months, with the economy delivering a \u201csolid result\u201d amid the headwinds of the global economy. But he said the recent \u201cdevastating\u201d bushfires and the emergence of the virus were two factors that were having a \u201csignificant negative effect\u201d on the economy. He said most of the effects of the bushfires would not be felt until the March quarter, with an estimated 0.2 percentage point hit to growth. He also said the fires had brought the economic consequences of climate change to the forefront.\u201d This past bushfire season has reminded people of the increased probability of these events in the face of climate change,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cTreasury continues to work with its portfolio agencies and with departments to understand the impacts of climate change and the implications of the economy.\u201d He said Treasury\u2019s \u201cpreliminary\u201d estimate of the effect of the coronavirus was that \u201cat least\u201d 0.5 percentage points would be wiped off growth in the March quarter, taking into account the hit to tourism and education, and the exchange rate. However, he said that this does not include supply chain issues and it was likely that there would be further domestic disruption arising from the virus. He said the Australian economy was very well placed to respond to the shock, and said it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for the budget to deteriorate as the government responded with fiscal stimulus. Over in Dfat, we have learned there are 199 Australian citizens and 236 permanent residents still in China\u2019s Hubei province. That\u2019s ground zero for Covid-19. Among that group, there are 27 children between newborn and two, who are away from their parents/guardian. So far, it doesn\u2019t seem like there is any way or plan to get them out. So the bushfires are expected to shave 0.2% off Australia\u2019s economic growth and coronavirus will take an additional 0.5% off the GDP in the next economic quarter. And that is why negative growth is a very, very real possibility. It is possible we are already experiencing it \u2013 there is another month to go in this quarter, but we have already felt quite a few impacts. And then we get to Covid-19. Steven Kennedy says it is still too early to tell, but it is not going to be great. And this is why we are seeing the no-stimulus government suddenly talking up stimulus: Given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic impacts of Covid-19, Treasury is assessing the situation on an ongoing basis. Global equity markets have fallen sharply during the past couple of weeks and remain volatile. Importantly, despite the volatility in markets, there are no indications of systemic stress or financial market malfunctioning at this time. The scale of the economic impact on Australia and the world will depend on a number of factors. The extent to which the virus spreads, how quickly it spreads, disruptions to ports and seaborne freight, and should Covid-19 become more prevalent in Australia, the direct impact it has on domestic economic activity. We have undertaken a preliminary assessment of what the impact of Covid-19 might be in the March quarter, and at this stage, we expect the virus to detract at least a half of a percentage point from growth in the March quarter 2020. This preliminary estimate takes into account the direct impacts on tourism, international education exports and some exchange rate effects. It does not include supply chain disruptions or other potential broader impacts. Beyond this preliminary estimate for the March quarter it is too early to tell, given the uncertainties, what the full impact of the Covid-19 coronavirus will be on the Australian economy. The bushfires are also not great (Steven Kennedy prefaced this by talking about the social and mental health impacts) for the economy: The bushfires have also had a negative economic impact. Our current expectation is that the bushfires will detract around 0.2 percentage points from GDP growth across the December 2019 and March 2020 quarters. Most of this impact will fall in the March quarter, before reconstruction and recovery activity picks up and other spending supports growth from the June quarter onwards. The negative economic impacts will primarily be as a result of lower household consumption and tourism in combination with other effects on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Household consumption is expected to be lower both as a result of the direct impact on affected regions, as well as from the impact of widespread smoke haze across major east coast cities. This past bushfire season has reminded people of the increased probability of these events in the face of climate change. The CSIRO predicts climate change will make bushfires more likely as fire weather patterns worsen as a result of an increase in weather patterns with hot and dry winds and fuel becoming drier (Sullivan 2010 and CSIRO 2019). Treasury continues to work with its portfolio agencies and other departments to understand the impacts of climate change and their implications for the economy. Which has led to a slightly troubling domestic outlook. Steven Kennedy: Turning to the domestic outlook, at Myefo, a number of the factors affecting domestic growth in 2019, such as falling housing prices, low housing turnover and the drought, were expected to wane. Further, towards the end of 2019, there were encouraging signs emerging for the domestic economy. GDP growth was stronger in 2019 than in the second half of 2018, while the labour market continued to outperform expectations with employment growth remaining around 2% and the participation rate reaching record highs. At Myefo we forecast a gradual improvement in consumption in response to stronger household disposable income growth and an improvement in the housing market. Household disposable income growth is being supported by the personal income tax cuts, ongoing labour market strength, a pick-up in real wage growth, and supportive monetary policy settings. Consistent with our assessment at Myefo, the housing market is showing continued signs of improvement, with capital city housing prices continuing to pick up and auction clearance rates improving. Export performance has been strong and, as has been the case for a number of years, public final demand is strongly contributing to growth. Mining investment is predicted to grow though. Although the drought is not great, and farm GDP has dropped 0.2% and the rainfall will not break the drought in all areas. Kennedy: Turning now to yesterday\u2019s release of the December quarter 2019 national accounts. The data confirm that the Australian economy improved in 2019 relative to the weak second half of 2018. In the December quarter, real GDP grew by 0.5 % to be 2.2 % higher through the year. Calendar year growth in 2019 was 1.8 %, above the OECD average and higher than every G7 nation except the United States. This is a solid result given headwinds from the weaker global economy in 2019, as well as the ongoing drought. However, two key events have arisen since Myefo that materially affect our assessment of the economy \u2013 this summer\u2019s bushfires and the emergence of Covid-19. Treasury boss Steven Kennedy has started his estimates evidence with a bleak international economic outlook: At the time of the 2019-20 Myefo, our assessment was that global economic growth had weakened in 2019, with the weakness widespread, including among our major trading partners in Asia. We considered that this weakness was close to bottoming out, and there would be a gradual pick-up in global growth in late 2019 and into 2020. This was consistent with the IMF\u2019s update in January, forecasting global growth to lift in 2020 and 2021. The IMF forecasts were for global growth to rise from 2.9 % in 2019 to 3.3% in 2020 and 3.4% in 2021. Activity was expected to be supported by accommodative monetary policy settings, fiscal policy in some jurisdictions, an improvement in global manufacturing, signs of bottoming out in the electronics and auto cycle, and expectations for some form of a trade deal between the US and China. As it transpired, there was a \u2018Phase one\u2019 trade deal struck between those two countries in early 2020. The UK election and subsequent ratification of the withdrawal agreement also settled some of the uncertainties around Brexit. At the start of the year, we began seeing some signs of an improvement in global economic conditions. World merchandise trade volumes increased 0.5 per cent through the year to December 2019. The February 2020 data for PMI manufacturing saw the EU record its strongest PMI in over a year, and the US remained in expansionary territory. Labour markets also remained robust, with unemployment rates near record lows in the US, the euro area and Japan. However, the emergence of Covid-19 in late December has significantly negatively impacted the near-term outlook for China and in the past couple of weeks concerns have broadened to other nations as this virus has spread. I will address the potential economic impact of Covid-19 shortly. Penny Wong is in Dfat estimates. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, will be up in estimates at 9am. Kristina Keneally followed that up with a defence of Gladys Berejiklian: And where was the state premier, Glady Berejiklian? I\u2019ll tell you where she wasn\u2019t \u2013 she wasn\u2019t in Hawaii. She was out every day, talking with communities, working with the Rural Fire Service and our other emergency services. She was leading; she was leading a response. And, by the way, while Scott Morrison was in Hawaii, where was and who was the acting prime minister? It was Michael McCormack. Michael McCormack, while Scott Morrison was in Hawaii you should have been out leading. You should have been out as the acting prime minister. It is extraordinary to open up the front page of our national broadsheet and see our National deputy prime minister taking such a significant swipe at the states \u2013 some of them his own Liberal colleagues. It is shameful and, quite frankly, people are frustrated with this government. They are frustrated and disappointed because Scott Morrison is not a leader, he\u2019s an ad man. He doesn\u2019t have a plan, he just has a marketing strategy and he\u2019s sending out his deputy to go out there and blame shift to other levels of government. Well, simply not good enough. Kristina Keneally stopped by doors this morning to let Michael McCormack have it. Fair. Well, I got up this morning and, as I always do, read a copy of the Australian. There on the front page \u2013 open warfare. Let\u2019s start with the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack. Inexplicably, Michael McCormack is out blaming the states. That\u2019s right, when it comes to the bushfire crisis and the bushfire recovery, the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack is not standing up and leading, he is sitting down and shifting blame. He is blaming the states. Michael McCormack says in the Australian today, quote, he is quite annoyed that the states haven\u2019t stepped up and done more to help with the bushfire crisis and the recovery. He is annoyed that somehow, to quote Michael McCormack, this has all \u201cfallen in the lap of the federal government\u201d. Well, breaking news for you Michael McCormack \u2013 you\u2019re the deputy prime minister, you are the federal government and, in a time of crisis, the Australian people look for leadership. They don\u2019t look for blame shifting, they don\u2019t look for marketing spin, they don\u2019t look for Defence forces being used in a political advertisement from the prime minister trying to tell us what a great job he\u2019s doing, they look for action, they look for response, they look for help. And let\u2019s talk about the states. My home state of New South Wales [sic: and Australia] had 33 people die. My home state of New South Wales had significant loss when it comes to the death of citizens, the death of firefighters and, quite frankly, the loss of wildlife, the loss of homes, the devastation that was reaped upon New South Wales in this bushfire crisis was the worst in living memory for that state. Mike Baird has left the NAB. That follows some pretty strong rumours he is preparing for a run in Zali Steggall\u2019s seat of Warringah. The Liberals have begun plans to take back Tony Abbott\u2019s former seat. Less than a year after the election and the games have begun. To be clear, there is no confirmation that Baird is running \u2013 but the talk has been around since May, so just keep a close eye on that one. Paul Karp also reported on this story last night. It might get missed in the mix today but is worth noting. The Australian Signals Directorate has already spied on Australians in the last year, invoking \u201crare circumstances\u201d and seeking ministerial approval to extend its powers in an unspecified number of cases. ASD\u2019s director general, Rachel Noble, indicated in Senate estimates on Wednesday that although the focus of the agency\u2019s powers was directed at gathering intelligence about people or organisations outside Australia, it had also produced intelligence about Australians. The evidence follows the home affairs department secretary Michael Pezzullo\u2019s confirmation on Monday that \u201cdetailed consideration\u201d is under way to better use law enforcement to tackle \u201cevils\u201d on the dark web. Sarah Martin and Ben Butler wrote a bit about what could be in the stimulus package last night: A new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the government\u2019s economic stimulus package aimed at protecting the economy from the fallout of the coronavirus. The package, expected within days, comes as economists warn that the country is at risk of falling into recession, despite the latest national accounts figures showing the economy grew by 0.5% in the December quarter. Following the rate cut, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was finalising its response to the coronavirus outbreak, with the severity of the downturn expected to be outlined in a meeting with the International Monetary Fund and Treasury officials on Wednesday night. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, will update parliament on the growth forecasts when he fronts Senate estimates on Thursday morning. Part of the reason the government is so worried is because coronavirus isn\u2019t something that is just going to be around for a few months. Natural disasters have to eventually end. Droughts impact productivity and exports but other parts of the economy can hold up. But a pandemic? That stops things from moving around everywhere. So the government, which was working on holding on to its surplus no matter what, is now starting to hit the panic button. The definitely-not-a-stimulus-don\u2019t-call-it-that \u201ceconomic boost\u201d is now all but throwing off its cloak as a full-blown stimulus. For this government, that\u2019s the equivalent of your parent\u2019s pulling you aside as the oldest child and letting you know that sSanta won\u2019t be coming this year but that there might be something small for the younger kids. Josh Frydenberg spoke to ABC radio this morning: We just don\u2019t know how the virus will evolve in coming months. Ultimately it won\u2019t be the economists that solve for this problem, it will be the scientists who solve for this problem and, as you know, a lot of good work is being done. Well, the V that became a U is now a holy moly, we have to do something about this. After speaking to the IMF and Treasury, the government will announce the predictions of just how hard the coronavirus is expected to hit the Australian economy. And Josh Frydenberg has got out ahead, telling Sky News that the government\u2019s stimulus package will be \u201cin the billions\u201d. Exactly what is in it won\u2019t be revealed until next week. It had been expected sometime in the next few weeks, but the RBA\u2019s emergency rate cut has sped quite a few things up. \u201cCash\u201d and \u201cflow\u201d are the treasurer\u2019s buzzwords. We are not spending enough money, which was already having a flow-on effect \u2013 after the drought and bushfires it wasn\u2019t great (as Shane Wright at the Age told me yesterday, up to billion dollars injected into the economy icame from insurance payouts from the Queensland and northern NSW fires from September onwards, which is not exactly a sustainable boost) so coronavirus is not great. The treasurer is trying to avoid a recession. So there needs to be some money in the floating. \u201cIt will be worth billions in terms of the impact it will have,\u201d Frydenberg told Laura Jayes this morning. A business investment allowance, changing to deeming rates and tax breaks are all on the table. Jim Chalmers says Labor will look at the package but its standing position at this stage is to be supportive. We\u2019ll have all of that and more as the day rolls on. Treasury estimates are up this morning. Mike Bowers is heading down the hallways already. You have Sarah Martin, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp, as well as the rest of the Guardian brains trust. I will hunt down a coffee so as to stop looking hungrily at the coffee stain on my desk. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

His family had reported him missing hours earlier. Witnesses reported seeing the group of men near the station at around 7.50 the previous evening. DCI Larry Smith said: \u201cA young teenage boy has died and his family and friends are devastated. They want answers and they deserve all the help the public can give them.

Jeremy Corbyn asked repeated questions on Wednesday about how much the PM knew when he appointed Patel as home secretary last summer. Several sources claim the Cabinet Office was told about her alleged intimidation of staff in 2017. Patel faces a Cabinet Office inquiry, overseen by Johnson, and an employment tribunal brought by Sir Philip Rutnam, her former permanent secretary. She denies any allegation of wrongdoing. Westminster sources claim the Conservative party was warned about a bullying allegation in the Department for Work and Pensions when Patel was employment minister but failed to take any action.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Alarm over gender bias \u2013 </strong>Almost 90% of people are biased against women, according to a new index that highlights the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/05/nine-out-of-10-people-found-to-be-biased-against-women\">\u201cshocking\u201d extent of a global backlash towards gender equality</a>. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which produced the findings, is calling on governments to introduce legislation and policies that address engrained prejudice. Despite progress in closing the equality gap, 91% of men and 86% of women hold at least one bias against women regarding politics, economics, education, violence or reproductive rights. It found that almost half of people feel men are superior political leaders and more than 40% believe men make better business executives. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Climate ultimatum to FTSE companies \u2013 </strong>The Investment Association, which represents 250 members with \u00a37.7tn under management, has set a three-year deadline for UK-listed companies to explain in their annual reports how they plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/leading-investor-group-tells-companies-to-set-out-climate-crisis-plans\">measure and manage the threat of global heating</a>. There are fears that shareholder investments could end up being worthless if companies fail to adapt their business models. Andrew Ninian, the IA\u2019s director of stewardship and corporate governance, said: \u201cWith one-third of the FTSE owned by IA members, our industry is looking to the UK\u2019s largest listed companies to demonstrate that climate change is being taken seriously in boardrooms.\u201d Globally, people in some of the poorest countries are receiving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/analysis-shows-climate-finance-not-reaching-most-vulnerable\">as little as $1 each a year</a> in climate finance to help cope with the impacts of the crisis. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>While you\u2019re stockpiling \u2026 </strong>it just might be the perfect time to take a detour down aisles less travelled.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Troubled skies ahead for other airlines Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray bringing you Thursday\u2019s best and breaking stories. Exeter-based Flybe, which operates almost 40% of UK domestic flights, collapsed into administration early this morning leaving passengers stranded all over Europe. After the government stalled for two months on a controversial \u00a3100m loan, the impact of the coronavirus on bookings proved to be the last straw. Flybe and the Civil Aviation Authority are telling people due to board one of its planes that they should not go to airports. Gwyn Topham, the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, predicts this morning that Flybe won\u2019t be the last. Virgin has enacted emergency money-saving measures after bookings halved; Ryanair and easyJet have cancelled hundreds of flights to Italy and elsewhere; BA has even cut transatlantic flights; and Donald Trump has held crisis talks with US airline bosses. * * * \u2018Family devastated\u2019 after murder \u2013 A 16-year-old boy has been found dead after a group of 30 men were seen armed with baseball bats near a railway station. Ahmed Shamur, from Manor Park in east London, was found with head injuries on scrubland near Gallions Reach DLR station just after 8.30am on Tuesday. His family had reported him missing hours earlier. Witnesses reported seeing the group of men near the station at around 7.50 the previous evening. DCI Larry Smith said: \u201cA young teenage boy has died and his family and friends are devastated. They want answers and they deserve all the help the public can give them. If you were a passing motorist using a dashcam you may have recorded something vital. Please make contact.\u201d Anyone with information can call police on 020 8345 3985 quoting CAD 1573/03MAR, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 Authorities in Hong Kong say a pomeranian dog has caught Covid-19 from its owner. Owners are being told not to kiss their pets, but not to abandon them either. In the UK there is talk of parliament shutting down, while health authorities have said they will stop providing daily coronavirus updates \u2013 both of which are seen as sitting oddly when there were 36 new cases announced on Wednesday alone and the people want to be kept informed by their leaders. The death toll in mainland China has passed 3,000 with a further 31 deaths on Wednesday. California\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency after the announcement of the first virus-related death there and 53 confirmed cases in the state. Italy has closed all schools and universities until 15 March and ordered all major sporting events to be played behind closed doors. Australia has introduced a travel ban for South Korea and brought in enhanced screening for arrivals from Italy \u2013 Australian officials say containment now seems unlikely and their worst-case scenario is millions infected over the course of a few weeks. The latest developments are at our live blog and here is the situation at a glance. * * * PM pressured over Patel \u2013 Boris Johnson is under pressure to disclose when he first heard claims of bullying by Priti Patel as new details emerged of her alleged behaviour towards staff in three government departments. Jeremy Corbyn asked repeated questions on Wednesday about how much the PM knew when he appointed Patel as home secretary last summer. Several sources claim the Cabinet Office was told about her alleged intimidation of staff in 2017. Patel faces a Cabinet Office inquiry, overseen by Johnson, and an employment tribunal brought by Sir Philip Rutnam, her former permanent secretary. She denies any allegation of wrongdoing. Westminster sources claim the Conservative party was warned about a bullying allegation in the Department for Work and Pensions when Patel was employment minister but failed to take any action. * * * Alarm over gender bias \u2013 Almost 90% of people are biased against women, according to a new index that highlights the \u201cshocking\u201d extent of a global backlash towards gender equality. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which produced the findings, is calling on governments to introduce legislation and policies that address engrained prejudice. Despite progress in closing the equality gap, 91% of men and 86% of women hold at least one bias against women regarding politics, economics, education, violence or reproductive rights. It found that almost half of people feel men are superior political leaders and more than 40% believe men make better business executives. * * * Climate ultimatum to FTSE companies \u2013 The Investment Association, which represents 250 members with \u00a37.7tn under management, has set a three-year deadline for UK-listed companies to explain in their annual reports how they plan to measure and manage the threat of global heating. There are fears that shareholder investments could end up being worthless if companies fail to adapt their business models. Andrew Ninian, the IA\u2019s director of stewardship and corporate governance, said: \u201cWith one-third of the FTSE owned by IA members, our industry is looking to the UK\u2019s largest listed companies to demonstrate that climate change is being taken seriously in boardrooms.\u201d Globally, people in some of the poorest countries are receiving as little as $1 each a year in climate finance to help cope with the impacts of the crisis. * * * While you\u2019re stockpiling \u2026 it just might be the perfect time to take a detour down aisles less travelled.

That fact is itself remarkable, since it shows both that the party is not, in fact, as united as it pretends, and also that Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority does not guarantee his control over the direction of the Conservative government as decisively as it may seem. The Tory party may have settled its arguments over Brexit. But it has not settled its arguments over the state\u2019s role in the economy and social policy. These debates have indeed now revived. Patel stands for an essentially Thatcherite approach. At the end of a decade in which David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson have all attempted, in their very different ways, to follow something they all called \u201cone nation\u201d policies, Patel continues instead to emulate Thatcher\u2019s distinctive and divisive combination of liberal possessive individualism and authoritarian social policy. Whatever she may think about it herself, Patel is no Thatcher. But Patel as home secretary has become one of the embodiments of the Tory right\u2019s current capture of the party. She knows it, and so does Johnson. It is why she is still there, at least for now. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist.",

The airline employed more than 2,000 people directly and was one of the leading carriers at airports including Belfast, Southampton, Manchester and Birmingham. About 8 million people a year used its services. Unions have warned that other jobs would be put at risk by Flybe\u2019s collapse and transport links lost on dozens of domestic routes where it is the sole operator. Flybe has long struggled to balance the books, despite cost-cutting plans and redundancies, and was reporting losses of about \u00a320m a year before the Connect takeover. With the new government having promised to \u201clevel up\u201d the economy, it was anxious to demonstrate it was helping the ailing airline and ministers announced the Flybe rescue in January. However, the measures \u2013 which included some deferral of tax, a potential loan and promises to review regional air connectivity and APD levels \u2013 have not proved enough. Public anxiety and curbs on business travel because of the coronavirus outbreak have forced airlines around the world to retrench in the face of falling bookings and Flybe was also suffering from the drop in demand. The government has been unwilling to bail out Flybe, despite calls from unions and MPs in the regions, with other airlines, led by the British Airways owner, IAG, and Ryanair, objecting about the prospect of state aid and threatening legal action. It is the second major British airline to go bankrupt in six months after the collapse of Thomas Cook last September. Unite\u2019s national officer for aviation, Oliver Richardson, said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that the government had not learned the lessons of last year\u2019s collapse of Thomas Cook or of Monarch in 2017 . He said Flybe staff would be feeling \u201cangry and confused\u201d. He said: \u201cThe UK economy is highly dependent on a viable and supported regional airline and airport network. For central government not to support and nurture this, especially as we deal with the twin uncertainties of the Covid-19 virus and the changes that will come with Brexit, is unhelpful and irresponsible.\u201d Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the loss of Flybe would cause \u201creal anxiety\u201d throughout the country. The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association hit out at the government and Connect for the collapse. The trade union\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cSix weeks ago, when the ownership consortium lost confidence, the government promised a rescue package, apparently at that time recognising the value of Flybe to the regional economy of the UK. \u201cThroughout, pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have done their jobs brilliantly, while behind the scenes the owners and, sadly, government connived to walk away. Flybe staff will feel disgusted at this betrayal and these broken promises.\u201d A government spokesman said the closure of Flybe was a commercial decision by the company. He added: \u201cWe will bring forward recommendations to help ensure that the whole of the UK has the connections in place that people rely on. \u201cFlybe\u2019s financial difficulties were longstanding and well-documented and pre-date the outbreak of Covid-19. We are well prepared for a potential outbreak and this week we have set out an action plan with details of our response.\u201d The CAA will not be operating a repatriation programme for any stranded customers in Europe and said passengers should make their own alternative travel arrangements via other airlines, rail or coach operators.",

ITV said total advertising revenue was set to grow 2% in the first quarter. Analysts at Citi had expected growth of 3.3%, indicating a significant pull back by advertisers as the crisis has spread from Asia to Europe.</p> <p>\u201cIn March and April, we have seen an impact from travel advertising deferments relating to the coronavirus,\u201d said ITV, announcing its full-year results on Thursday. \u201cEarly indications suggest total advertising revenue will be down 10% in April.\u201d ITV added that the virus-related <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/04/james-bond-no-time-to-die-november\">postponement of the latest James Bond film</a>, which had readied a substantial marketing campaign, would also hit revenues.</p> <p>Shares in ITV fell 8.5% to a seven-month low of 106.5p in early trading.</p> <p>ITV is banking on this summer\u2019s European championship football competition to deliver a major advertising boost.

ITV said the drop in profits was due to investments in programming and the costs associated with BritBox UK.</p> <p>The broadcaster said that a 21% rise in online advertising, through its ITV Hub service, more than offset the decline in TV advertising.</p> <p>ITV Studios, which makes shows including Love Island and Hell\u2019s Kitchen, performed ahead of expectations with revenues up 9% to \u00a31.8bn and adjusted rose 5% to \u00a3267m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "ITV is forecasting a slump in advertising revenues of at least 10% in April as companies in the travel sector pull spend in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. ITV acts as a bellwether for the wider UK TV ad market and its forecast paints a grim picture for other broadcasters. The company is already feeling the impact of the spread of the virus, with total advertising revenue in the first quarter growing significantly slower than analysts forecast. ITV said total advertising revenue was set to grow 2% in the first quarter. Analysts at Citi had expected growth of 3.3%, indicating a significant pull back by advertisers as the crisis has spread from Asia to Europe. \u201cIn March and April, we have seen an impact from travel advertising deferments relating to the coronavirus,\u201d said ITV, announcing its full-year results on Thursday. \u201cEarly indications suggest total advertising revenue will be down 10% in April.\u201d ITV added that the virus-related postponement of the latest James Bond film, which had readied a substantial marketing campaign, would also hit revenues. Shares in ITV fell 8.5% to a seven-month low of 106.5p in early trading. ITV is banking on this summer\u2019s European championship football competition to deliver a major advertising boost. However, with public events and exhibitions being cancelled and postponed across Europe the fate of the tournament is far from certain. ITV, which also announced the launch of subscription video-on-demand service BritBox in Australia later this year, said it had limited visibility on the longer term impact of the virus on advertising. \u201cAt this stage it is too difficult to assess the further implications of the coronavirus but we continue to monitor the situation closely,\u201d the company said. Overall, ITV grew total revenues by 3% last year to \u00a33.3bn as the company managed to overcome the ongoing decline in traditional TV advertising affecting the broadcast industry. Total advertising revenues fell by 1.5% last year to \u00a31.76bn as adjusted profits dropped 10% to \u00a3729m. ITV said the drop in profits was due to investments in programming and the costs associated with BritBox UK. The broadcaster said that a 21% rise in online advertising, through its ITV Hub service, more than offset the decline in TV advertising. ITV Studios, which makes shows including Love Island and Hell\u2019s Kitchen, performed ahead of expectations with revenues up 9% to \u00a31.8bn and adjusted rose 5% to \u00a3267m.",

His novel <em>The Eyes of Darkness</em> made reference to a killer virus called \u201cWuhan-400\u201d \u2013 eerily predicting the Chinese city where Covid-19 would emerge. But the similarities end there: Wuhan-400 is described as having a \u201ckill\u2011rate\u201d of 100%, developed in labs outside the city as the \u201cperfect\u201d biological weapon. An account with more similarities, also credited by some as predicting coronavirus, is found in the 2011 film <em>Contagion</em>, about a global pandemic that jumps from animals to humans and spreads arbitrarily around the globe.</p> <p>But when it comes to our suffering, we want something more than arbitrariness. We want it to mean something. This is evident in our stories about illness and disease, from contemporary science fiction all the way back to Homer\u2019s <em>Iliad</em>. Even malign actors are more reassuring than blind happenstance. Angry gods are better than no gods at all.</p> <p>In Homer\u2019s<em> Iliad</em>, the Greeks disrespect one of Apollo\u2019s priests. The god manifests his displeasure by firing his arrows of contagion into their camp. The plague lasts nine days, brief by modern epidemiological standards.

Thucydides, the Athenian historian, has a simple explanation for the epidemic: Apollo. The Spartans had cannily supplicated the god and he in return had promised victory. Soon afterwards, Sparta\u2019s enemies started dying of the plague. Hindsight suggests that Athens, under siege \u2013 its population swollen with refugees, everyone living in unsanitary conditions \u2013 was at risk of contagion in a way the Spartan army, free to roam the countryside outside, clearly wasn\u2019t. But this thought doesn\u2019t occur to Thucydides. It can only be the god.</p> <p>Between then and now there have been prodigious advances in medical science. We understand contagious disease vastly better, and have a greater arsenal of medicine and hygiene to fight it. But in one respect we haven\u2019t advanced at all. We still tend to see agency in our pandemics.</p> <p>Disease has no agency. Bacteria and viruses spread blindly where they can, their pathways facilitated by our globalised world. We, meanwhile, bring to the struggle our ever-improving drugs and hygiene. With Covid-19, experts insist, your two best bets are: wash your hands often, touch your face never. But people do not warm to the existential arbitrariness of this. Just as the Peloponnesian plague was seen as evidence that the gods were angry with Athens, so HIV was seen by a deluded minority as God\u2019s judgment on homosexuals. Of course, HIV spreads wherever it can and cares nothing for your morals or sexual orientation.</p> <p>This attribution of agency is clearest in the many imaginary plagues science-fiction writers have inflicted on humanity. In place of gods we have aliens, like those in Alice Sheldon\u2019s chilling and brilliant short story \u201cThe Screwfly Solution\u201d (1977). A new disease provokes men to begin murdering women en masse. At the story\u2019s end we discover an alien species had introduced a brain infection so that the human race will destroy itself and the aliens can inherit the emptied planet. It\u2019s a story about what we now call \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and it says: it\u2019s not gods we have angered, but goddesses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0a0fce533079cf638eab16898028400cf56b6a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0a0fce533079cf638eab16898028400cf56b6a9/0_163_2720_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from The Andromeda Strain (1970), directed by Robert Wise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from <em>The Andromeda Strain</em> (1970), directed by Robert Wise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes the alien plague is less picky.

Dozens of zombie franchises start with a rogue scientist infecting the population with a genetically engineered bioweapon virus. In Frank Herbert\u2019s <em>The White Plague</em> (1982) a geneticist, pushed into insanity by the murder of his family, creates a pathogen that kills all humanity\u2019s females. A cure is eventually found, but not before the world\u2019s population balance has been shifted to leave thousands of men to every woman.</p> <p>In Joanna Russ\u2019s feminist masterpiece <em>The Female Man</em> (1975), \u201cWhileaway\u201d, a gender-specific virus has wiped out all the men, creating an effective utopia for women left behind, procreating by parthenogenesis and living in harmony. By the novel\u2019s end it is hinted that the man-destroying plague was actually engineered by a female scientist. Never mind the antibacterial handwash: it is patriarchy that we need to scrub out.</p> <p>So characteristic is assigning agency to pandemics in today\u2019s culture that a video game such as <em>Plague Inc</em> (Ndemic Creations 2012) styles its players not as doctors attempting to stop the spread of a pandemic, but as the sickness itself. The player\u2019s mission is to help their plagues spread and exterminate the human race. In HG Wells\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/the-war-of-the-worlds-review-doom-dystopia-and-a-dash-of-downton\" title=\"\"><em>War of the Worlds</em> (1898)</a> and in its various modern retellings, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/08/how-we-made-independence-day-roland-emmerich\" title=\"\"><em>Independence Day</em> (1996)</a>, the virus is on our side, destroying alien invaders that lack our acquired immunity.</p> <p>One of the most striking twists on this conceit is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/apr/14/best-novels-about-politics-of-technology\" title=\"\">Greg Bear\u2019s novel <em>Blood Music </em>(1985)</a>. A scientist, angry at being sacked by his lab, smuggles a virus out into the world in his own body. It infects everybody, becomes self-aware, and assimilates everybody and everything to itself: human beings and their infrastructure melt down into a planetwide sea of hyperintelligent grey goo. It sounds unpleasant, but it\u2019s actually a liberation: the accumulation of concentrated consciousness, our own included, punches through a transcendent new realm. The plague becomes a kind of secular Rapture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8105964647934410eb9457802e112c22d39bd4ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8105964647934410eb9457802e112c22d39bd4ec/0_25_3307_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mad scientists of Channel 4\u2019s Utopia hope their germ will wipe out humanity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mad scientists of Channel 4\u2019s <em>Utopia </em>hope their germ will wipe out humanity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If on some level we still think of contagion as the gods\u2019 anger, these stories become about how we have angered the god \u2013 about, in other words, our guilt. When Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver planned their reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, they decided an agent, a neuroenhancer spliced into simian flu, would both raise the apes\u2019 level of intelligence and prove fatal to humans. The resulting movie trilogy (2011-17) was more than just a commercial hit; it proved an eloquent articulation of broader environmental concerns. The few surviving humans move through the film\u2019s lush rejuvenated forestscapes, compelled to confront avatars of humanity\u2019s generational contempt for the natural world.</p> <p>The plague that has destroyed us has uplifted these animals, given them wisdom, and they are angry with us \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t they be? It\u2019s a common genre trope. The scientist in Alistair MacLean\u2019s <em>The Satan Bug</em> (1965) is an environmental fundamentalist who hopes his germ will wipe out humanity.

In Frank Herbert\u2019s The White Plague (1982) a geneticist, pushed into insanity by the murder of his family, creates a pathogen that kills all humanity\u2019s females. A cure is eventually found, but not before the world\u2019s population balance has been shifted to leave thousands of men to every woman. In Joanna Russ\u2019s feminist masterpiece The Female Man (1975), \u201cWhileaway\u201d, a gender-specific virus has wiped out all the men, creating an effective utopia for women left behind, procreating by parthenogenesis and living in harmony. By the novel\u2019s end it is hinted that the man-destroying plague was actually engineered by a female scientist. Never mind the antibacterial handwash: it is patriarchy that we need to scrub out. So characteristic is assigning agency to pandemics in today\u2019s culture that a video game such as Plague Inc (Ndemic Creations 2012) styles its players not as doctors attempting to stop the spread of a pandemic, but as the sickness itself. The player\u2019s mission is to help their plagues spread and exterminate the human race. In HG Wells\u2019s seminal War of the Worlds (1898) and in its various modern retellings, including Independence Day (1996), the virus is on our side, destroying alien invaders that lack our acquired immunity. One of the most striking twists on this conceit is Greg Bear\u2019s novel Blood Music (1985). A scientist, angry at being sacked by his lab, smuggles a virus out into the world in his own body. It infects everybody, becomes self-aware, and assimilates everybody and everything to itself: human beings and their infrastructure melt down into a planetwide sea of hyperintelligent grey goo. It sounds unpleasant, but it\u2019s actually a liberation: the accumulation of concentrated consciousness, our own included, punches through a transcendent new realm. The plague becomes a kind of secular Rapture. If on some level we still think of contagion as the gods\u2019 anger, these stories become about how we have angered the god \u2013 about, in other words, our guilt. When Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver planned their reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, they decided an agent, a neuroenhancer spliced into simian flu, would both raise the apes\u2019 level of intelligence and prove fatal to humans. The resulting movie trilogy (2011-17) was more than just a commercial hit; it proved an eloquent articulation of broader environmental concerns. The few surviving humans move through the film\u2019s lush rejuvenated forestscapes, compelled to confront avatars of humanity\u2019s generational contempt for the natural world. The plague that has destroyed us has uplifted these animals, given them wisdom, and they are angry with us \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t they be? It\u2019s a common genre trope. The scientist in Alistair MacLean\u2019s The Satan Bug (1965) is an environmental fundamentalist who hopes his germ will wipe out humanity. The mad scientists from Channel 4\u2019s TV drama Utopia (2013\u201114) and Margaret Atwood\u2019s Oryx and Crake trilogy are both driven by the same animus. Having invested ourselves with the crown of all creation, coronavirus arrives to puncture our hubris. Think of the computer intelligence Agent Smith in The Matrix (1999), played with sneering panache by Hugo Weaving: humans, he tells Laurence Fishburne\u2019s Morpheus, are incapable of developing a natural equilibrium with their environment: \u201cYou move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.\u201d In this telling, we are the virus.",

      "body": "<p>Political prognostication is perilous. Less than a week ago, the conventional wisdom among American pundits and pollsters was that the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders was cruising toward the Democratic presidential nomination. Then came Super Tuesday. Joe Biden won critical states such as Texas, Virginia and North Carolina, and finished first in Massachusetts and Minnesota, where a week ago he was projected to finish fifth. Now much of the talking-head consensus is shifting toward proclaiming Biden the favorite. Do the people who pronounce on politics really know any more about what\u2019s going on than the random loudmouth in the pub or coffee shop?</p> <p>One thing the pundits got right was their consistent message that the Democratic party is deeply divided. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/primary-results-biden-sanders-03-04?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Super Tuesday results</a> showed that majorities of African Americans, moderates and older Americans cast their votes for Biden, while younger voters, progressives and Hispanics favored Sanders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/joe-biden-resurrection-super-tuesday-2020\">The resurrection of Joe Biden is almost complete: the race is his to lose | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pollsters had also long predicted that Biden would do well among black voters and that, by extension, he would do well in the 29 February primary in South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/29/south-carolina-primary-african-american-voters-key-victory/4881243002/\">majority black</a>. The overwhelming margin of Biden\u2019s victory among black voters in that primary was something of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/1/21160030/biden-black-vote-south-carolina-results\">surprise</a>: he won almost two-thirds of their votes, coming in almost 44 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor. The impressive scale of his victory reversed the perception of failure that had grown from his tongue-tied debate performances, poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire, and reported <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/02/12/donors-set-to-leave-joe-biden-after-iowa-and-new-hampshire-results/\">donor exodus</a>. Given the importance of African Americans in the Democratic party base \u2013 the Democratic candidate who has won the most primary support from black voters has won the nomination <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-black-voters/2019/12/06/89195a7c-1788-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html\">every time</a> over the past 30 years \u2013 Biden\u2019s South Carolina triumph gave him tremendous momentum going into Super Tuesday.</p> <p>Why do black voters support Biden? Obviously he benefits from the residual good will of having spent eight years as vice-president to Barack Obama, who remains <a href=\"https://theatlas.com/charts/ry0--pRUe\">enormously popular</a> among black people. He also benefits from his reputation as a moderate. There\u2019s a widely held stereotype that African Americans, since they vote Democratic by overwhelming majorities, must also be liberal. In fact, 70% of black voters identify as moderate or conservative, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/17/liberals-make-up-largest-share-of-democratic-voters/\">January survey</a> from the Pew Research Center. Even black voters who found Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism appealing may have voted for Biden in the belief that white voters would find him the more electable candidate. \u201cBlack voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves,\u201d one black South Carolinian <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/black-voters-south-carolina-primary.html\">told a New York Times reporter</a>. \u201cSo yeah, we\u2019ll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media.\u201d</p> <p>In general, people who predict political outcomes for a living lean heavily on history. Why are most of them skeptical that there will be a contested Democratic national convention this year? Because there hasn\u2019t been one since 1952. Why don\u2019t they believe that the candidate with the most enthusiastic following wins? Because if that were the case, Barry Goldwater and George McGovern would have been elected president. Why are they skeptical that Sanders, if he were to become the Democratic nominee, would draw in huge numbers of energized young voters to make up for the moderates who would stay home?

      "bodyText": "Political prognostication is perilous. Less than a week ago, the conventional wisdom among American pundits and pollsters was that the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders was cruising toward the Democratic presidential nomination. Then came Super Tuesday. Joe Biden won critical states such as Texas, Virginia and North Carolina, and finished first in Massachusetts and Minnesota, where a week ago he was projected to finish fifth. Now much of the talking-head consensus is shifting toward proclaiming Biden the favorite. Do the people who pronounce on politics really know any more about what\u2019s going on than the random loudmouth in the pub or coffee shop? One thing the pundits got right was their consistent message that the Democratic party is deeply divided. The Super Tuesday results showed that majorities of African Americans, moderates and older Americans cast their votes for Biden, while younger voters, progressives and Hispanics favored Sanders. Pollsters had also long predicted that Biden would do well among black voters and that, by extension, he would do well in the 29 February primary in South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is majority black. The overwhelming margin of Biden\u2019s victory among black voters in that primary was something of a surprise: he won almost two-thirds of their votes, coming in almost 44 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor. The impressive scale of his victory reversed the perception of failure that had grown from his tongue-tied debate performances, poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire, and reported donor exodus. Given the importance of African Americans in the Democratic party base \u2013 the Democratic candidate who has won the most primary support from black voters has won the nomination every time over the past 30 years \u2013 Biden\u2019s South Carolina triumph gave him tremendous momentum going into Super Tuesday. Why do black voters support Biden? Obviously he benefits from the residual good will of having spent eight years as vice-president to Barack Obama, who remains enormously popular among black people. He also benefits from his reputation as a moderate. There\u2019s a widely held stereotype that African Americans, since they vote Democratic by overwhelming majorities, must also be liberal. In fact, 70% of black voters identify as moderate or conservative, according to a January survey from the Pew Research Center. Even black voters who found Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism appealing may have voted for Biden in the belief that white voters would find him the more electable candidate. \u201cBlack voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves,\u201d one black South Carolinian told a New York Times reporter. \u201cSo yeah, we\u2019ll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media.\u201d In general, people who predict political outcomes for a living lean heavily on history. Why are most of them skeptical that there will be a contested Democratic national convention this year? Because there hasn\u2019t been one since 1952. Why don\u2019t they believe that the candidate with the most enthusiastic following wins? Because if that were the case, Barry Goldwater and George McGovern would have been elected president. Why are they skeptical that Sanders, if he were to become the Democratic nominee, would draw in huge numbers of energized young voters to make up for the moderates who would stay home? Because turnout among young voters typically lags 20 to 30 percentage points behind older voters. Obviously the 2016 election results embarrassed the predictions of a legion of pundits and pollsters, leading many people to believe that any argument from history is useless in our present era of political volatility. But many patterns of American political life show considerable persistence. Biden seems to have received a boost in South Carolina, for example, from his endorsement by influential powerbroker congressman Jim Clyburn, the dean of the state delegation and the third-ranking Democrat in the House. By the same token, after Super Tuesday it seems a more serious vulnerability that Sanders so far hasn\u2019t been endorsed by a single Democratic state governor. The 2020 election may give new life to The Party Decides theory that party elites and insiders have considerable influence over the eventual choice of nominee, even though that theory completely failed to predict Donald Trump\u2019s overthrow of the Republican establishment in 2016. It\u2019s also obvious, however, that historical analogies carry limited weight when it comes to some of the unique dynamics of the 2020 race. You could argue that Biden\u2019s comeback is reminiscent of John McCain\u2019s Lazarus-like 2008 revival, when he managed to win the South Carolina Republican primary and go on to take the nomination despite having run out of funds and having been written off as a non-contender for the previous six months.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Coronavirus cruise ship held off coast of San Francisco The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared a state of emergency after a 71-year-old man with underlying health issues died from the coronavirus near Sacramento, the first of the 11 known US deaths to occur outside Washington state. A cruise ship on which the man is thought to have contracted the virus is being held off the coast of San Francisco. Elsewhere, the death toll in China has passed 3,000 people, while Italy has closed all schools and universities to slow the spread of the outbreak. Political agenda. Donald Trump and his allies have attacked Democrats and the media, claiming their criticism of the administration\u2019s response to the virus is simply an effort to further their anti-Trump agenda. Thanks, Obama. Trump sought to blame a national shortage of virus testing kits on the previous administration, though experts were unsure how any Obama-era rules would have hindered testing as Trump claimed. Sanders awaits his fate as Super Tuesday counting continues Bernie Sanders remains upbeat about his presidential prospects after Super Tuesday, despite the surge of so-called \u201cJoementum\u201d that has left his rival Joe Biden leading the party\u2019s delegate count. With several million votes still being counted in California \u2013 where some voters had to wait several hours to cast their ballots \u2013 Sanders\u2019 final haul may not be known for days. Biden\u2019s comeback has been partially credited to an endorsement from Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American Democrat in Congress. Bye, Bloomberg. Mike Bloomberg left the race on Wednesday, endorsing Biden as he bowed out. But Ankita Rao says his campaign was really over two weeks ago, after he faced Elizabeth Warren on the debate stage. Also-rans. Amid the noise of the presidential primary, there were some smaller Super Tuesday races you may have missed: from a Bush loss in Texas, to Jeff Sessions facing a run-off. Beijing hints at retaliation over Trump\u2019s state media bans A fresh diplomatic feud is brewing between Beijing and Washington, over the treatment of American and Chinese journalists by each other\u2019s governments. The Trump administration said this week it would cap the number of US-based Chinese nationals working for five state-owned media outlets, after China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters over a critical editorial by the newspaper. Now the Chinese have hinted at further retaliation. \u2018Political oppression\u2019. One Chinese government spokesperson described Washington\u2019s actions as \u201cpolitical oppression\u201d based on a \u201cCold War mindset\u201d, while another tweeted: \u201cNow the US kicked off the game, let\u2019s play.\u201d Supreme court hears arguments in high-profile abortion case The US supreme court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in its most high-profile abortion rights case for decades. The justices are being asked to consider a Louisiana state law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital \u2013 which would leave the state \u201cwith just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions\u201d, said Julie Rikelman, lead counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights. Texas law. Four years ago the court struck down an almost identical law in Texas, ruling it unconstitutional. But that was before the arrival of Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both considered hostile to abortion rights. Cheat sheet A new index analysing attitudes to gender in 75 countries have found that almost nine out of every 10 people are biased against women, in relation to at least one of the spheres of politics, economics, education, violence or reproductive rights. Tropical forests are losing their ability to act as \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d that mitigate the scale of human pollution, while the world\u2019s poorest people are not receiving the necessary funds to help cope with a looming climate breakdown. Scientists have warned of a potential health risk posed by \u201cthirdhand\u201d smoke in cinemas: the stale cigarette smoke that clings to the bodies and clothing of moviegoers and could be a lingering source of hazardous chemicals. The producers of the new James Bond movie No Time to Die have pushed its April release date back to November, after \u201cthorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace\u201d in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.

Geek Bowl: building America\u2019s biggest pub quiz empire Some 233 six-player teams have paid up to $750 to take part in this weekend\u2019s Geek Bowl XIV at the Navy Pier in Chicago. John Dicker tells Dave Caldwell how he came to create America\u2019s top trivia mega-competition. Opinion The Netflix series Love is Blind is a superior car crash of a reality TV show, says Yomi Adegoke. And in showing women candidly expressing their desire to find a relationship, it also demonstrates the limits of the single positivity movement. Self-love and romantic love aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive \u2013 and women who are open about their romantic aspirations shouldn\u2019t need to be coy. Sport The former New York Knicks enforcer Charles Oakley has slammed the team\u2019s management for its \u201cplantation\u201d mindset, following an altercation between superfan Spike Lee and security officials at Madison Square Garden, which saw Lee bail on his courtside season ticket for the remainder of the NBA season.

      "bodyText": "It is a global emergency that has already killed on a mass scale and threatens to send millions more to early graves. As its effects spread, it could destabilise entire economies and overwhelm poorer countries lacking resources and infrastructure. But this is the climate crisis, not the coronavirus. Governments are not assembling emergency national plans and you\u2019re not getting push notifications transmitted to your phone breathlessly alerting you to dramatic twists and developments from South Korea to Italy. More than 3,000 people have succumbed to coronavirus yet, according to the World Health Organization, air pollution alone \u2013 just one aspect of our central planetary crisis \u2013 kills seven million people every year. There have been no Cobra meetings for the climate crisis, no sombre prime ministerial statements detailing the emergency action being taken to reassure the public. In time, we\u2019ll overcome any coronavirus pandemic. With the climate crisis, we are already out of time, and are now left mitigating the inevitably disastrous consequences hurtling towards us. While coronavirus is understandably treated as an imminent danger, the climate crisis is still presented as an abstraction whose consequences are decades away. Unlike an illness, it is harder to visualise how climate breakdown will affect us each as individuals. Perhaps when unprecedented wildfires engulfed parts of the Arctic last summer there could have been an urgent conversation about how the climate crisis was fuelling extreme weather, yet there wasn\u2019t. In 2018, more than 60 million people suffered the consequences of extreme weather and climate change, including more than 1,600 who perished in Europe, Japan and the US because of heatwaves and wildfires. Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe were devastated by cyclone Idai, while hurricanes Florence and Michael inflicted $24bn (\u00a318.7bn) worth of damage on the US economy, according to the World Meteorological Organization. As the recent Yorkshire floods illustrate, extreme weather \u2013 with its terrible human and economic costs \u2013 is ever more a fact of British life. Antarctic ice is melting more than six times faster than it was four decades ago and Greenland\u2019s ice sheet four times faster than previously thought. According to the UN, we have 10 years to prevent a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial temperature but, whatever happens, we will suffer. Pandemics and the climate crisis may go hand in hand, too: research suggests that changing weather patterns may drive species to higher altitudes, potentially putting them in contact with diseases for which they have little immunity. \u201cIt\u2019s strange when people see the climate crisis as being in the future, compared to coronavirus, which we\u2019re facing now,\u201d says Friends of the Earth\u2019s co-executive director, Miriam Turner. \u201cIt might be something that feels far away when sitting in an office in central London, but the emergency footing of the climate crisis is being felt by hundreds of millions already.\u201d Imagine, then, that we felt the same sense of emergency about the climate crisis as we do about coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "The government has reversed a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus, as England\u2019s chief medical officer admitted a \u201ccommunications fumble\u201d. On Wednesday, the Department of Health said the government would stop providing daily updates on the location of patients who had tested positive \u201cdue to the number of cases\u201d following a 70% increase. The decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would lead to the spread of fake news. But on Thursday morning Prof Chris Whitty announced a U-turn, saying the government would provide daily updates but they would be delayed by 24 hours to allow time for information to be verified. Speaking to the Commons health committee he said: \u201cI think we had a bit of a communications fumble on this one. We are intending to provide geographical information. \u201cWe are intending to have some delay of about 24 hours to be absolutely sure we\u2019ve got the details right.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office tower after an employee was confirmed to have caught coronavirus. The bank has sent 100 people home and ordered a deep clean of the 10th floor, which houses its research department. This has so far not affected HSBC\u2019s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions. HSBC said: \u201cWe have been informed that one of our employees at 8 Canada Square has been diagnosed with Covid-19. This colleague is under medical supervision and has self-isolated. We are working closely with the health authorities. \u201cWe are deep-cleaning the floor where our colleague worked and shared areas of the building. Colleagues on that floor, and others who came into contact with him, have been advised to work at home. Based on medical and official advice the building remains open and operates as normal. Our first priority and concern is the health of our employees and customers \u2013 and we are encouraging our colleagues to monitor their health carefully and stay at home or call a doctor if they feel unwell.\u201d About 20 people were sent home from the global banking division on the second floor of the HSBC tower on Wednesday, after an employee had contact with someone who subsequently developed coronavirus symptoms, according to a person familiar with the matter. HSBC has also banned all non-essential travel. The floor evacuation was first reported by Financial News. Other companies are also making plans to send staff home, if the epidemic escalates. Tesco on Wednesday told more than 5,000 staff at its Welwyn Garden City headquarters in Hertfordshire and other offices to prepare to work from home. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, this week announced \u201cemergency trading protocols\u201d to allow the market to remain open if the situation escalates. Lloyd\u2019s 1,000 staff, along with thousands of brokers and underwriters who work for other firms, would be asked to work from home and to resort to electronic trading. Britain\u2019s financial services regulator said on Wednesday it has \u201cno objection\u201d in principle to City staff working remotely due to coronavirus quarantine measures. However, the Financial Conduct Authority said firms must take all reasonable steps to keep operating effectively and support their customers. The FCA said: \u201cFor example, we would expect firms to be able to enter orders and transactions promptly into the relevant systems, use recorded lines when trading and give staff access to the compliance support they need.

He puts on his serious face, slightly unrumples his hair and tells people to wash their hands. As no one voted for him for public health advice he would do well to let untrusted politicians opine as little as possible, leaving public announcements to the respected chief scientific officer and chief medical officer.</p> <p>But there is no way of keeping politics out of this. If this epidemic is only half as bad as the official worst-case scenario, the pressure on every aspect of public services will be tested to breaking point. The full effect of a decade of austerity is about to be brutally exposed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Tories have won and won again, confident that most people most of the time know nothing of cuts in services</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until now, the Tories have won and won again, despite the deepest austerity \u2013 confident that most people, most of the time, know nothing of cuts in public services they aren\u2019t using now or can\u2019t see. Though the A&amp;E crisis is never off our TV screens, the remainder stays below most voters\u2019 radar. But this virus may expose the true state of the country for all to see.</p> <p>Tim Cook, an ICU doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/icu-doctor-nhs-coronavirus-pandemic-hospitals\" title=\"\">writing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/icu-doctor-nhs-coronavirus-pandemic-hospitals\" title=\"\">in the Guardian</a>, gave a graphic picture of the lack of intensive care and critical care beds \u2013 Britain ranking 23rd out of 31 countries for provision, and almost bottom for the number of hospital beds overall. But what of every other service?</p> <p>Local authorities have the lead role in public health emergencies: they do disaster rehearsals for imaginary terror or biohazard attacks, coordinating with the army for emergency tents and temporary morgues, says Tony Travers, professor of government at the LSE. But coronavirus would probably be a crisis in every council simultaneously, with each being unable to call on help from the others. Over the past decade councils have lost between a third and a half of their income, with a quarter of their staff gone and up to a half lost in some places. Already the flooding has left those local authorities warning they haven\u2019t got the money to cope.</p> <p>Councils\u2019 incapacity was exposed, Travers says, over the Grenfell tragedy. Kensington and Chelsea was not exceptionally badly run, but it could not cope with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/16/grenfell-survivors-and-bereaved-still-fighting-frustrating-battles\" title=\"\">rehousing and supporting</a> its residents after the tower block calamity: a team of chief executives from other local authorities had to come in and take over. The council on its own had lost too much administrative capacity. Councils run most services, and most, such as environmental health, have been <a href=\"https://www.cieh.org/food-safety-integrity/2019/june/food-standards-interventions-in-decline-says-nao-report/\" title=\"\">hugely depleted</a>: the National Audit Office describes that service as \u201cfailing\u201d.</p> <p>That civic incapacity will be revealed time and again by a coronavirus outbreak, with Whitehall\u2019s civil service reduced to its smallest size in decades: look at the panic-hiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/28/extra-50000-border-staff-needed-for-post-brexit-trade-says-gove\" title=\"\">just announced</a> to manage the Brexit customs fallout. If, as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan\" title=\"\">government plans</a> suggest, one in five staff are out of action, the care sector will be hit hardest and fastest, as it is already so fragile and understaffed. That puts at risk the lives of old people at home alone or in care homes unable to care, with day centres mostly closed down in the cuts.</p> <p>Money will need to flow fast to stop some care homes going bust and to hire emergency staff from agencies, no doubt at higher rates.

      "bodyText": "Blame Boris Johnson for almost everything, but not for the arrival of the coronavirus. He puts on his serious face, slightly unrumples his hair and tells people to wash their hands. As no one voted for him for public health advice he would do well to let untrusted politicians opine as little as possible, leaving public announcements to the respected chief scientific officer and chief medical officer. But there is no way of keeping politics out of this. If this epidemic is only half as bad as the official worst-case scenario, the pressure on every aspect of public services will be tested to breaking point. The full effect of a decade of austerity is about to be brutally exposed. Until now, the Tories have won and won again, despite the deepest austerity \u2013 confident that most people, most of the time, know nothing of cuts in public services they aren\u2019t using now or can\u2019t see. Though the A&amp;E crisis is never off our TV screens, the remainder stays below most voters\u2019 radar. But this virus may expose the true state of the country for all to see. Tim Cook, an ICU doctor, writing in the Guardian, gave a graphic picture of the lack of intensive care and critical care beds \u2013 Britain ranking 23rd out of 31 countries for provision, and almost bottom for the number of hospital beds overall. But what of every other service? Local authorities have the lead role in public health emergencies: they do disaster rehearsals for imaginary terror or biohazard attacks, coordinating with the army for emergency tents and temporary morgues, says Tony Travers, professor of government at the LSE. But coronavirus would probably be a crisis in every council simultaneously, with each being unable to call on help from the others. Over the past decade councils have lost between a third and a half of their income, with a quarter of their staff gone and up to a half lost in some places. Already the flooding has left those local authorities warning they haven\u2019t got the money to cope. Councils\u2019 incapacity was exposed, Travers says, over the Grenfell tragedy. Kensington and Chelsea was not exceptionally badly run, but it could not cope with rehousing and supporting its residents after the tower block calamity: a team of chief executives from other local authorities had to come in and take over. The council on its own had lost too much administrative capacity. Councils run most services, and most, such as environmental health, have been hugely depleted: the National Audit Office describes that service as \u201cfailing\u201d. That civic incapacity will be revealed time and again by a coronavirus outbreak, with Whitehall\u2019s civil service reduced to its smallest size in decades: look at the panic-hiring just announced to manage the Brexit customs fallout. If, as government plans suggest, one in five staff are out of action, the care sector will be hit hardest and fastest, as it is already so fragile and understaffed. That puts at risk the lives of old people at home alone or in care homes unable to care, with day centres mostly closed down in the cuts. Money will need to flow fast to stop some care homes going bust and to hire emergency staff from agencies, no doubt at higher rates. Children\u2019s homes face the same crisis, with many more children in care than a decade ago: social work departments are already overstretched. As for understaffed prisons, the prospect of virus outbreaks there and many staff off sick is frightening. A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said yesterday, somewhat over-reassuringly: \u201cThe UK is extremely well prepared for these types of outbreaks and Public Health England has issued tailored guidance for care providers setting out action to be taken in a variety of circumstances.\u201d Public Health England does indeed inspire trust in its advice and oversight, but boots on the ground and helping hands are provided locally, and councils have taken the heaviest hit in the great austerity. Ever since George Osborne\u2019s first budget in 2010, the plan was to \u201cdevolve the axe\u201d to them. The Local Government Association this week warns they have lost \u00a315bn. The public realm will be exposed: the number of people working in it has fallen to just 16.5% of all jobs, the lowest since 1945.

About half of travel policies sold in the UK offer SAF as standard, with a further 19% offering it as an add-on according to Defaqto, although payouts will be reduced by any excess on the policy. Anyone buying travel insurance in the current climate is strongly advised to buy a policy with SAF, and ideally \u201ctravel disruption cover\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Greece has become the latest country to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus by closing schools and universities and cancelling large public gatherings, as the World Health Organization insisted the virus could still be \u201cpushed back\u201d if governments around the world took the necessary action. Greece followed the lead of Iran and Italy, where deaths on Thursday rose to 148, by shuttering educational institutions and cancelling sports events and other public gatherings in three western regions. The national public health organisation said the two-day shutdown included \u201ca suspension of all mass gatherings\u201d at theatres, cinemas, museums and sports events in the Peloponnese regions of Achaia and Ileia and the island of Zakynthos. As the number of infections jumped from 10 to 31 in a single day, a health ministry official said it expected a significant rise in cases in the coming weeks. All 21 of the new cases were detected among travellers who had recently returned from Israel and Egypt, and are believed to be connected with a 65-year-old man battling pneumonia in a hospital isolation unit in the western port city of Patras. At least nine people were said to be in serious condition. Announcing the measures, health authorities said efforts were moving into the second phase of a multi-pronged strategy to contain the outbreak, focussing on stopping the virus spreading from western Greece\u2019s Amaliada region to other parts of the country. Ancient Olympia, where the flame for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to be lit on 12 March, is situated in Ileia. The Greek Olympic committee said it was drastically scaling back accreditations \u201cto those absolutely necessary\u201d, limiting festivities and cancelling all event dinners and galas. Greece\u2019s precautionary measures came as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, said countries should be preparing for sustained community transmission and called for governments to play their part in stopping the spread of the coronavirus within their own borders. Tedros said: \u201cOur message to all countries is: this is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back. Your actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country.\u201d Iran said it would begin erecting checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and urged people to reduce their use of paper banknotes, as authorities scramble to contain the coronavirus, which has caused at least 107 deaths and infected more than 3,500 people across the country. The Iranian health minister, Saeed Namaki, announced that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March. Namaki told people to stay in their vehicles at petrol stations and allow attendants to fill their tanks to avoid the spread of the virus. Iran has also cancelled Friday prayers in major cities. The coronavirus outbreak has had a dramatic effect on Islamic worship elsewhere in the Middle East. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia \u2013 which has already banned citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca \u2013 took the unprecedented step of emptying out Islam\u2019s holiest site so that it could be sterilised. State television broadcast images of an empty white-tiled area surrounding the Kaaba - a large black cube structure inside Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque \u2013 which is usually packed with tens of thousands of pilgrims. The move was a \u201ctemporary preventive measure\u201d but the upper floors of the Grand Mosque were still open for prayers, a Saudi official told Agence France-Presse. Iran and Italy have the world\u2019s highest death tolls outside China, where the outbreak began at the end of last year. So far, the virus has infected 95,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,200. The Italian government on Wednesday ordered the closure of all schools and universities after the virus spread to all 20 regions, infecting 3,296 people \u2013 590 more than Wednesday. It also confirmed that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors due to the outbreak, until 3 April. South Africa on Thursday became the latest country to confirm its first case of the coronavirus, which was linked to Italy: a 38-year-old man who had travelled to the country with his wife in a group of 10 people. South Korea\u2019s infection toll neared 6,000 on Thursday, while there were a further 31 virus deaths in Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases \u2013 a rise on the previous day\u2019s total. As more than 3,740 cases were confirmed across the Middle East, the Palestinian health ministry declared a state of medical emergency in the West Bank city of Bethlehem and closed all mosques and churches in the area, including the Nativity church in Bethlehem, built over the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born. Authorities in the Palestinian territories also cancelled all sports events in the city and shut schools. Four Palestinians are reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus but the cases have yet to be confirmed. On Thursday, the German airline group Lufthansa cancelled all flights to Israel until 28 March after Israeli authorities barred entry to almost all non-resident arrivals from five European nations, including Germany, over coronavirus fears. Israel also ordered citizens and Israeli residents from the same countries \u2013 France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland \u2013 into quarantine. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates warned its citizens and foreign residents not to travel, and sent the 215 foreigners it evacuated from Hubei in China to a quarantine centre set up in a humanitarian hub in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The UAE is home to Emirates, the government-owned airline based at Dubai international airport, the world\u2019s busiest for international travel. In the US, California declared a state of emergency over its 53 confirmed cases, and a cruise ship linked to the state\u2019s first virus death was being held off the coast of San Francisco.

Luckily for him, the real box-office action was taking place elsewhere in the expensive seats.</p> <p>Directly underneath a sign bearing the famous Spurs motto \u201cTo Dare Is To Do\u201d, one young scamp had apparently <em>dared</em> to get in a war of words with a home player\u2019s brother and was now <em>doing</em> a runner towards the exit in terror, frantically flicking Vs over his shoulder in a futile bid to save face. The reason? Well, showing a turn of speed that had been conspicuously absent all evening, Tottenham midfielder Eric Dier \u2013 whose brother was in peril \u2013 had vaulted the advertising hoarding and was making his way over row after row of seats towards the alleged aggressor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/eric-dier-confronts-fan-in-stands-after-tottenhams-fa-cup-defeat-to-norwich\">with Terminator-like determination</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/eric-dier-confronts-fan-in-stands-after-tottenhams-fa-cup-defeat-to-norwich\">Eric Dier confronts fan in stands after Tottenham's FA Cup defeat by Norwich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the brave boo-boy scarpered, Dier was held back by stewards and fans who helped ensure he did not emulate the actions of another slightly more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/eric-cantona-kung-fu-kick-hooligan-25-years-later\">moody and violent footballer named Eric</a>. They are to be commended for their intervention, even if the sight of Dier in full kit chasing a supporter out of the stadium and down the Tottenham High Road would have made for one of the more surreal vistas in an already strange season. And while he may not have done enough on the field to help his manager, Dier did at least provide the valuable post-match service of helping deflect media attention away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/tottenham-hotspur-norwich-city-fa-cup-fifth-cup-match-report\">yet another ignominious defeat</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think Eric Dier did something that we professionals, we cannot do, but in these circumstances, I think everyone of us will do,\u201d chirped Jos\u00e9, upon being briefed regarding his player\u2019s apparent show of brotherly love. \u201cBecause when somebody insults you and your family is there and your family gets involved with the person insulting you, in this case a younger brother, I think Eric did what we professionals we cannot do. But I repeat, probably every one of us would do.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/mar/05/eric-dier-climbs-into-stands-and-confronts-tottenham-fan-video-report\">Dier\u2019s hands-on, vigilante approach</a> to heckling constituted one of those \u201cunsavoury\u201d footballing incidents The Fiver feels dutifully compelled to say we never want to see, even if it is exactly the kind of the thing we would like to see on a regular basis. After all, faced with the prospect of having to explain themselves, face-to-face with the angry targets of the abuse they have hurled from the stands, no end of braying, cowardly yahoos might think twice before opening their yaps and polluting the air with their toxic bile.</p> <p>For now, Dier faces a period of uncertainty as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/05/fa-contacts-eric-dier-for-his-observations-after-confrontation-with-supporter-tottenham-spurs\">the FA investigates what exactly happened</a>. While speculation abounds that he could face a lengthy ban, it remains abundantly unclear if, in vaulting 20 rows of seats to confront somebody who was no longer there, he actually did much technically wrong. While Dier will almost certainly have to accept an FA charge for his actions, The Fiver seems far from alone in hoping he will also accept our heartiest thanks and congratulations.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Simon Burnton from 7.45pm GMT for hot FA Cup MBM coverage of Derby County 1-3 Manchester United, while Bryan Graham will be on hand for SheBelieves Cup business and USA!

Constantly. I remember thinking: \u2018Why\u2019s he keep having a go at me? There\u2019s players far worse than what I\u2019ve been.\u2019 But the older you get, you realise why he\u2019s doing it. He would have a go at me for dribbling, which I very rarely \u2026 well, I dribbled a bit more then. But for [players such as] Nani, it would just maybe trigger something in their head, make them think: \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t dribble as much.\u2019 If he spoke to Nani the way he spoke to me, he\u2019d break down in tears\u201d \u2013 Wayne Rooney waxes lyrical about Lord Ferg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/wayne-rooney-derby-manchester-united-fa-cup-argue-sir-alex-ferguson\">as he gets his chat on with Ben Fisher</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5b5c0ee014ba2a5189f3062d6645cc96a3a4f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5b5c0ee014ba2a5189f3062d6645cc96a3a4f6/102_0_4195_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The big man does some big chat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The big man does some big chat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Williams/News Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cReally?

Well, showing a turn of speed that had been conspicuously absent all evening, Tottenham midfielder Eric Dier \u2013 whose brother was in peril \u2013 had vaulted the advertising hoarding and was making his way over row after row of seats towards the alleged aggressor with Terminator-like determination. As the brave boo-boy scarpered, Dier was held back by stewards and fans who helped ensure he did not emulate the actions of another slightly more moody and violent footballer named Eric. They are to be commended for their intervention, even if the sight of Dier in full kit chasing a supporter out of the stadium and down the Tottenham High Road would have made for one of the more surreal vistas in an already strange season. And while he may not have done enough on the field to help his manager, Dier did at least provide the valuable post-match service of helping deflect media attention away from yet another ignominious defeat. \u201cI think Eric Dier did something that we professionals, we cannot do, but in these circumstances, I think everyone of us will do,\u201d chirped Jos\u00e9, upon being briefed regarding his player\u2019s apparent show of brotherly love. \u201cBecause when somebody insults you and your family is there and your family gets involved with the person insulting you, in this case a younger brother, I think Eric did what we professionals we cannot do. But I repeat, probably every one of us would do.\u201d Of course, Dier\u2019s hands-on, vigilante approach to heckling constituted one of those \u201cunsavoury\u201d footballing incidents The Fiver feels dutifully compelled to say we never want to see, even if it is exactly the kind of the thing we would like to see on a regular basis. After all, faced with the prospect of having to explain themselves, face-to-face with the angry targets of the abuse they have hurled from the stands, no end of braying, cowardly yahoos might think twice before opening their yaps and polluting the air with their toxic bile. For now, Dier faces a period of uncertainty as the FA investigates what exactly happened. While speculation abounds that he could face a lengthy ban, it remains abundantly unclear if, in vaulting 20 rows of seats to confront somebody who was no longer there, he actually did much technically wrong. While Dier will almost certainly have to accept an FA charge for his actions, The Fiver seems far from alone in hoping he will also accept our heartiest thanks and congratulations.

USA!! USA!!! 3-0 England at 12am. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHis man-management is the best I\u2019ve ever seen. I always remember as a kid, every half-time arguing with him. Constantly. I remember thinking: \u2018Why\u2019s he keep having a go at me? There\u2019s players far worse than what I\u2019ve been.\u2019 But the older you get, you realise why he\u2019s doing it. He would have a go at me for dribbling, which I very rarely \u2026 well, I dribbled a bit more then. But for [players such as] Nani, it would just maybe trigger something in their head, make them think: \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t dribble as much.\u2019 If he spoke to Nani the way he spoke to me, he\u2019d break down in tears\u201d \u2013 Wayne Rooney waxes lyrical about Lord Ferg as he gets his chat on with Ben Fisher. FIVER LETTERS \u201cReally? Not only do you publish his letter, but you give Simon Mazier (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) letter of the day. If I wanted to read \u2018Emptihad\u2019 jokes, I\u2019d stick to the million or so Facebook pages which have been recycling them for years. Meanwhile, roll on next Wednesday when City could play Arsenal in a match rearranged with only seven days\u2019 notice, so there will be loads more empty seats for armchair critics to get excited about counting\u201d \u2013 John Caley. \u201cNice of you to give Cambridge United\u2019s \u2018Gin Night\u2019 a plug (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). I hear ticket sales have been quite sloe\u201d \u2013 Daniel Doody. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Daniel Doody, who bags a copy of Premier League Nuggets, by Richard Foster. We\u2019ve got one more to give away, so get scribbling. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The Premier League is \u201clikely\u201d to go behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Everton\u2019s chief financial officer, Sasha Ryazantsev. We feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks,\u201d he told the FT Business of Football Summit in London. Michel Platini\u2019s appeal against his ban from football has been thrown out by the European court of human rights. \u201cThis complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected,\u201d ruled the court. Ronaldinho has been questioned by police in Paraguay, after entering the country with what authorities have claimed is a fake passport. \u201cBoth Mr Ronaldinho and his brother said they were a gift,\u201d said public prosecutor Federico Delfino. The Portuguese attorney\u2019s office has conducted dozens of searches in connection with its investigation into tax evasion and money laundering at some of the country\u2019s biggest clubs, as well as the homes of Jorge Mendes. Jonathan Leko is less than impressed by Kick It Out and the PFA for what he claims was their lack of support during the racism case against Kiko Casilla. \u201cSome guidance would have been very welcome,\u201d he said. Lucas Torreira faces a lengthy spell out after suffering ankle-snap in Arsenal\u2019s FA Cup win at Portsmouth. Carlo Ancelotti has been fined \u00a38,000 but avoided a touchline ban for the hot centre-circle funk which led to a red card from referee Chris Kavanagh. The FA Cup quarter-final draw will see Newcastle host Manchester City, Leicester entertain Chelsea, Derby or Manchester United head to Norwich, and endless loops of one of history\u2019s most overrated saves as Arsenal visit Sheffield United. And, uh-oh, $tevie Mbe is letting this slip again, his Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers team slumping to a 1-0 home defeat against Hamilton and falling 13 points behind the Queen\u2019s Celtic. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it could get any worse,\u201d he parped.

They were never happy occasions for Davis, because mostly they would consist of Barnier politely complaining that the UK could not make up its mind what it wanted, and David being unable to refute this (because it was true - the government was hopelessly divided).</p> <p>David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser on Europe and lead negotiator in these talks, is not keen to relive the Davis experience, and so Barnier was on his own when he summed up the outcome of the first round of UK-EU trade talks.</p> <p>Both sides have set out their respective positions at length, in negotiating documents, and most of what he said was not particularly surprising. But his confirmation that the UK is refusing to sign up to a deal that would compel it to remain party to the European convention on human rights will alarm liberals in the UK.</p> <p>Here are the main points.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Barnier said that the UK was refusing to commit to remaining part of the European convention on human rights as part of any EU deal.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e610ad88f085f0b8d942b58#block-5e610ad88f085f0b8d942b58\"> 2.38pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that there were some \u201cvery serious divergences\u201d between the two sides in the talks. </strong>He focused on four particular areas of disagreement: the level playing field, criminal justice policy, the nature of the agreement, and fisheries. He said that the talks this week had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, and he complemented the professionalism of the British team. But he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> To be completely frank with you ... there are many divergences. And they are very serious divergences. Which is probably quite natural after a first round of negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he thought the difficulties that would be posed by Brexit in January 2021, with or without an agreement, were \u201cunderestimated\u201d.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will not be business as usual. I am very keen that this will be understood and I don\u2019t think next January is the same as last January, it will be very, very different.</p> <p>Why I am saying this quite so forcefully? It\u2019s because the definitive changes which will happen because of the decision of the UK and the difficulties will be linked to that, my impression is that they are still very often underestimated.</p> <p>On that today, the 1 January customs formalities will be applied to all our imports and all our experts to the IUK and the UK will do the same.</p> <p>On that day, the 1 January next, the financial institutions will lose automatically the benefit of the financial passport, that is a consequence of Brexit.</p> <p>Third example, UK certification will no longer mean it can be marketed in the European Union, industrial goods, vehicles medical devices, whatever those are the consequences of Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d to read the UK document about its position in trade talks with the US setting out British demands for a level playing field, in the light of the UK\u2019s reluctance to make commitments in this area to the EU.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was unrealistic to expect the EU to agree to negotiate fishing access annually with the UK, as it does with Norway.</strong> \u201cWhat we can do with Norway on five species simply isn\u2019t possible for 100 species,\u201d he said. He hinted that, if the UK were not willing to grant fishing access as part of a trade deal, the EU could refuse to grant it financial equivalence.

Barnier said this could make cooperation on criminal justice and law enforcement very difficult. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ambitious cooperation in [criminal justice and law enforcement] requires commitment on both sides with respect to fundamental rights of persons. Yet the UK informs us that they do not wish to commit formally to continuing to apply the European convention on human rights, nor do they wish the European court of justice to play its full role in interpreting European law.</p> <p>When it comes to security and legal cooperation, judicial cooperation, you are talking for example about the exchange of personal data, sometimes very personal data, like DNA. In that area this is a must-have for us ...</p> <p>I say this is serious, I say this is grave because if the United Kingdom\u2019s position does not move, it will have an immediate and concrete effect on the level of ambition of our cooperation which will remain based on international conventions but will not be as ambitious as we wish.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868874/The_Future_Relationship_with_the_EU.pdf\">its document (pdf) </a>setting out the UK negotiating position, the British government does not explicitly say it will reject an agreement that involves committing to continued membership of the ECHR. But it does hint at this, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The agreement should not specify how the UK or the EU member states should protect and enforce human rights and the rule of law within their own autonomous legal systems.</p> </blockquote> <p>The disclosure of the true nature of the government\u2019s position will fuel fears that at some point in the future Boris Johnson would like withdraw the UK from the ECHR, which has always been unpopular with Tory rightwingers. As <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/29/boris-johnson-rejects-eu-demands-bind-uk-european-human-rights/\">the Sunday Telegraph recently reported (paywall),</a> <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, is on record as opposing the ECHR.

Whitty gave evidence to the Commons health committee for about an hour and a half, and Johnson gave a much shorter interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. They did not contradict each other in any way, but there was a marked difference in tone. Whitty was calm and factual, in no way alarmist, but also very honest about the fact that coronavirus is likely to lead to a significant disruption to normal life, and particularly to the NHS, for a short period later this year. In contrast, Johnson was much keener to gloss over the downsides and assure viewers that the UK was going to get through this \u201cin good shape\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps this is a sophisticated \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d routine. But it is more likely that Johnson is just congenitally programmed for optimism, and resistant to anything that might make him sound like a \u201cgloomster\u201d. People expect their leaders to be positive, and at the moment Johnson is getting mostly plaudits for his handling of this crisis, but there may come a point where he does not seem to be acknowledging the risk.</p> <p>Here are the main points</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that for the moment it should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for people and that Britain would get through the coronavirus outbreak \u201cin good shape\u201d. </strong>Although the risks were appreciable, they were quite small, he said. At the end of his interview he summed up his message like this.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most important message at this stage, as we start to see the spread, is number one, wash your hands, but number two, as far as possible, it should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country, for the simple reason this is a great country, massively strong economy, the British public I think understands completely the balance of risk involved. The scientists have done a very good job of explaining to us what the risks are, and they are really quite small. They are appreciable, but quite small. And people can see that this country is going to get through this in good shape.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said the government was trying to stop the outbreak reaching a peak. </strong>He summed up his approach like this, saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance.</p> <p>I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is the approach that has been recommended by the health experts, but what was surprising was that Johnson seemed to accept that there was a case for \u201ctaking it on the chin\u201d in the first place. This approach would lead to more deaths. </p> <p>As the Spectator\u2019s <strong>James Forsyth </strong>has <a href=\"https://beta.spectator.co.uk/article/the-budget-s-corona-contagion\">pointed out,</a> Johnson used to say that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557765/Boris-Johnson-inspired-by-Jaws-mayor.html\">his hero was the mayor in the town features in the movie Jaws</a>, because he kept the beaches open when he was under pressure to close them. (As Jeremy Vine wrote in a revealing article, <a href=\"https://reaction.life/jeremy-vine-my-boris-story/\">Johnson was so fond of this argument he used it repeatedly.)</a> Now (and, for anyone with an elderly relative, thankfully), Johnson seems to be adopting a different approach to risk.</p> <p>The Economist has <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse\">a good graphic </a>showing the difference between the two approaches - letting the epidemic peak, to speed up the recovery, or reducing the peak, while prolonging the impact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"053619e2b6a3e48ddc460d48c57ddbd1ce6260a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/053619e2b6a3e48ddc460d48c57ddbd1ce6260a1/0_0_736_633/500.jpg\" alt=\"What reducing the peak means\" width=\"500\" height=\"430\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What reducing the peak means</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Economist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that closing schools and cancelling big public events was not favoured at the moment.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the moment what they are telling me is, actually, slightly counter-intuitively, things like closing schools and stopping big gatherings don\u2019t work as well perhaps as people think in stopping the spread.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that the government was withholding information about the spread of coronavirus.</strong> Responding to a question about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/move-to-weekly-uk-coronavirus-updates-criticised-by-experts\">this story</a> about the location of new cases not being published on a daily basis, he confirmed t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-minister-hints-u-turn-decision-stop-daily-uk-updates\">hat this decision is being reversed.</a> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me clear that up immediately because it is very important that we are transparent, people understand that we are transparent.</p> <p>Public Health England needs to be absolutely sure about the diagnosis of these cases so what they are doing is they are immediately identifying the region where they think there\u2019s an incidence and then within 24 hours confirming the exact location to be sure that we have got the right thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Whitty said that the government\u2019s response to coronavirus had now moved from the point where it was mainly focusing on containing the disease to the point where it was mainly focusing on delaying its spread.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60c1c68f08c2df6d2739cb#block-5e60c1c68f08c2df6d2739cb\"> 9.15am.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that for a short period of time at the peak of the epidemic the NHS could end up looking \u201cquite different\u201d because of the number of normal services or operations that might have to be suspended or postponed.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60c9b28f08c2df6d273a12#block-5e60c9b28f08c2df6d273a12\">9.48am.)</a> Under a worst case scenario, the NHS could run out of beds, he said.

The number of coronavirus infections in the UK has exceeded 100, with 115 people having now tested positive, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The announcement came as Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told MPs that the government\u2019s response to coronavirus had now moved from the point where it was mainly focusing on containing the disease to the point where it was mainly focusing on delaying its spread. But Boris Johnson said that for the moment it should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for people and that Britain would get through the coronavirus outbreak \u201cin good shape\u201d. (See 1.17pm.) For full coverage of the latest coronavirus developments, in the UK and around the world, do read our separate live blog. Gordon Brown has backed Keir Starmer to be Labour leader, saying he has all the qualifications needed to become prime minister. Drugs and terrorism have driven the recent rise in homicides - with each killing costing society an estimated \u00a33.2m, according to a new report (pdf). The rate of murders and manslaughters in England and Wales soared by 39% between the year ending March 2015 and 2018, to a higher point than at any time between 1900 and 1970, Home Office research found. As the Press Association reports, there were four times as many homicide deaths in the year ending March 31 2018 as those resulting from terror attacks since 1980. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, said: These are damning but frankly unsurprising findings. The home affairs committee has repeatedly warned that deep cuts to policing would have dangerous consequences for public safety. For years Home Office ministers have insisted that there is no direct relationship between the number of police officers and levels of crime on our streets \u2013 this report indicates that there is one and that more police officers mean fewer homicides. Boris Johnson has signalled he has no regrets about refusing to visit areas devastated by floods this year and claimed the emergency services advised him to stay away. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, who has been at the No 10 lobby briefing. The acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has strongly criticised the government for refusing to commit to remaining signed up to the European convention on human rights as part of its trade agreement with the EU. (See 2.38pm.) In a statement he said: The European convention on human rights empowers people to hold governments to account when ministers trample on individual rights and freedoms. It was largely a British creation and has helped to improve people\u2019s lives across Europe. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are determined to take power away from the British people and hoard it for themselves. Now they are weakening the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiating position by refusing to uphold our longstanding commitments on human rights. Liberal Democrats will always stand up for individuals and their human rights, in the UK and around the world. We will oppose any Tory attempts to undermine the ECHR or water down the Human Rights Act. The academic and Brexit expert Simon Usherwood has posted an interesting thread on Twitter exploring the advantages and disadvantages of governments avoiding making legal commitments to principles they profess to be committed to anyway. (See 3.07pm.) It starts here. The House of Lords EU committee has published a report (pdf) on the negotiating positions adopted by the EU and the UK at the start of the trade talks. It says that since they agreed the political declaration last autumn the two sides have moved apart, and it says there is a particularly problem with state aid, where the positions taken by the UK and the EU \u201care essentially incompatible\u201d. None of this is very surprising. But the report will trigger a debate in the House of Lords, which could potentially be awkward for the government. This is a consequence of a section 29, an amendment passed to the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 that amended a section of the original EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 that was originally included after a campaign to ensure parliament got a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Brexit. The amendment says if the Lords EU committee publishes a report on Brexit raising a matter of \u201cvital national interest\u201d, the government has to find time for a debate. For a debate to happen in the Commons, the European scrutiny committee would have to demand one using the same process. The debate on this report will be the first so-called section 29 debate. The UK government has just released its own statement about the end of the first round of talks with the EU. A spokesperson said: We have just concluded the first round of negotiations, and are pleased with the constructive tone from both sides that has characterised these talks. This round was a chance for both sides to set out their positions and views. Following detailed discussions, we now have a good idea where both parties are coming from. These are going to be tough negotiations \u2013 this is just the first round. In some areas there seems to be a degree of common understanding of how to take the talks forward. In other areas, such as fishing, governance, criminal justice and the so-called \u2018level playing field\u2019 issues there are, as expected, significant differences. The UK team made clear that, on 1 January 2021, we would regain our legal and economic independence \u2013 and that the future relationship must reflect that fact. We look forward to continuing these talks in the same constructive spirit when the parties meet again in London on 18 March. This is from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on Michel Barnier\u2019s comments about the ECHR. (See 2.38pm.) This, of course, begs the question, if the government really is committed to the EHCR, what\u2019s the harm in putting it in writing? In his press conference Barnier made this exact point about the UK\u2019s refusal to make a formal commitment to the level playing field standards it says it wants to maintain. (See 12.28pm.) During the first round of Brexit negotiations Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, often held joint press conferences with his UK counterpart, David Davis. They were never happy occasions for Davis, because mostly they would consist of Barnier politely complaining that the UK could not make up its mind what it wanted, and David being unable to refute this (because it was true - the government was hopelessly divided). David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser on Europe and lead negotiator in these talks, is not keen to relive the Davis experience, and so Barnier was on his own when he summed up the outcome of the first round of UK-EU trade talks. Both sides have set out their respective positions at length, in negotiating documents, and most of what he said was not particularly surprising. But his confirmation that the UK is refusing to sign up to a deal that would compel it to remain party to the European convention on human rights will alarm liberals in the UK. Here are the main points. Barnier said that the UK was refusing to commit to remaining part of the European convention on human rights as part of any EU deal. (See 2.38pm.) He said that there were some \u201cvery serious divergences\u201d between the two sides in the talks. He focused on four particular areas of disagreement: the level playing field, criminal justice policy, the nature of the agreement, and fisheries. He said that the talks this week had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, and he complemented the professionalism of the British team. But he said: To be completely frank with you ... there are many divergences. And they are very serious divergences. Which is probably quite natural after a first round of negotiations. He said he thought the difficulties that would be posed by Brexit in January 2021, with or without an agreement, were \u201cunderestimated\u201d. He explained: It will not be business as usual. I am very keen that this will be understood and I don\u2019t think next January is the same as last January, it will be very, very different. Why I am saying this quite so forcefully? It\u2019s because the definitive changes which will happen because of the decision of the UK and the difficulties will be linked to that, my impression is that they are still very often underestimated. On that today, the 1 January customs formalities will be applied to all our imports and all our experts to the IUK and the UK will do the same. On that day, the 1 January next, the financial institutions will lose automatically the benefit of the financial passport, that is a consequence of Brexit. Third example, UK certification will no longer mean it can be marketed in the European Union, industrial goods, vehicles medical devices, whatever those are the consequences of Brexit. He said that he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d to read the UK document about its position in trade talks with the US setting out British demands for a level playing field, in the light of the UK\u2019s reluctance to make commitments in this area to the EU. He said it was unrealistic to expect the EU to agree to negotiate fishing access annually with the UK, as it does with Norway. \u201cWhat we can do with Norway on five species simply isn\u2019t possible for 100 species,\u201d he said. He hinted that, if the UK were not willing to grant fishing access as part of a trade deal, the EU could refuse to grant it financial equivalence. (See 12.50pm.) He said Frost had assured him that the UK was committed to implementing the Northern Ireland protocol. He said the EU had proposed talks on foreign policy and defence, but that the UK said it did not want to negotiate any particular agreement in these areas. In his opening remarks Michel Barnier said that one serious problem in the negotiations was the UK\u2019s refusal to commit to remaining party to the European convention on human rights (ECHR). Barnier said this could make cooperation on criminal justice and law enforcement very difficult. He said: Ambitious cooperation in [criminal justice and law enforcement] requires commitment on both sides with respect to fundamental rights of persons. Yet the UK informs us that they do not wish to commit formally to continuing to apply the European convention on human rights, nor do they wish the European court of justice to play its full role in interpreting European law. When it comes to security and legal cooperation, judicial cooperation, you are talking for example about the exchange of personal data, sometimes very personal data, like DNA. In that area this is a must-have for us ... I say this is serious, I say this is grave because if the United Kingdom\u2019s position does not move, it will have an immediate and concrete effect on the level of ambition of our cooperation which will remain based on international conventions but will not be as ambitious as we wish. In its document (pdf) setting out the UK negotiating position, the British government does not explicitly say it will reject an agreement that involves committing to continued membership of the ECHR. But it does hint at this, saying: The agreement should not specify how the UK or the EU member states should protect and enforce human rights and the rule of law within their own autonomous legal systems. The disclosure of the true nature of the government\u2019s position will fuel fears that at some point in the future Boris Johnson would like withdraw the UK from the ECHR, which has always been unpopular with Tory rightwingers. As the Sunday Telegraph recently reported (paywall), Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, is on record as opposing the ECHR. In 2018 he wrote: If I get involved in politics again, then a referendum on the ECHR should be high on the agenda \u2014 and bear in mind most people probably think we\u2019re already leaving it because of the 2016 referendum, so imagine how mad they\u2019ll be when they realise we\u2019re still in it. However, withdrawing from the ECHR could be hugely problematic, not least because it is an integral part of the Good Friday agreement. Asked on Monday at the No 10 lobby briefing if the government was committed to remaining a signatory to the ECHR, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman just said that the UK was a signatory and that there was no change in the UK\u2019s position. The EU has released the text of Michel Barnier\u2019s opening statement at the press conference. It is the original, mostly in French. The English translation should be available later. MPs will receive a pay rise of 3.1% from April this year, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) has said. As the Press Association reports, the increase will raise MPs basic pay from \u00a379,468 to \u00a381,932 and will be effective from April 1. It follows a decision confirmed in 2018 by IPSA to adjust the pay of MPs at the same rate as public sector earnings, which are published by the Office of National Statistics. The announcement marks the first time MPs\u2019 salaries have exceeded \u00a380,000 and is an increase of \u00a316,194 compared to the \u00a365,738 salary in April 2010. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming Michael Gove is to be the UK\u2019s representative on the all-powerful Brexit UK-EU \u201cjoint committee\u201d which will oversee the implementation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement, Michel Barnier has said. As head of the exiting operations unit in the Cabinet Office and a member of the exiting strategy team, Gove has now cemented his position as the country\u2019s Brexit tsar. The joint committee will hold its first meeting on 30 March, Barnier has disclosed in a press conference at the end of the first round of talks. Beneath it will sit six or seven specialised committees tasked with implementation of key issues including the Northern Ireland protocol, Gibraltar and EU citizens rights. The EU side will be led by European commission vice president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, but no other details have yet emerged on the appointments process or how often any of these committees will meet. Boris Johnson and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England and the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser have both been speaking about coronavirus this morning. Whitty gave evidence to the Commons health committee for about an hour and a half, and Johnson gave a much shorter interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. They did not contradict each other in any way, but there was a marked difference in tone. Whitty was calm and factual, in no way alarmist, but also very honest about the fact that coronavirus is likely to lead to a significant disruption to normal life, and particularly to the NHS, for a short period later this year. In contrast, Johnson was much keener to gloss over the downsides and assure viewers that the UK was going to get through this \u201cin good shape\u201d. Perhaps this is a sophisticated \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d routine. But it is more likely that Johnson is just congenitally programmed for optimism, and resistant to anything that might make him sound like a \u201cgloomster\u201d. People expect their leaders to be positive, and at the moment Johnson is getting mostly plaudits for his handling of this crisis, but there may come a point where he does not seem to be acknowledging the risk. Here are the main points Johnson said that for the moment it should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for people and that Britain would get through the coronavirus outbreak \u201cin good shape\u201d. Although the risks were appreciable, they were quite small, he said. At the end of his interview he summed up his message like this. The most important message at this stage, as we start to see the spread, is number one, wash your hands, but number two, as far as possible, it should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country, for the simple reason this is a great country, massively strong economy, the British public I think understands completely the balance of risk involved. The scientists have done a very good job of explaining to us what the risks are, and they are really quite small. They are appreciable, but quite small. And people can see that this country is going to get through this in good shape. Johnson said the government was trying to stop the outbreak reaching a peak. He summed up his approach like this, saying: One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance. I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do. This is the approach that has been recommended by the health experts, but what was surprising was that Johnson seemed to accept that there was a case for \u201ctaking it on the chin\u201d in the first place. This approach would lead to more deaths. As the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth has pointed out, Johnson used to say that his hero was the mayor in the town features in the movie Jaws, because he kept the beaches open when he was under pressure to close them. (As Jeremy Vine wrote in a revealing article, Johnson was so fond of this argument he used it repeatedly.) Now (and, for anyone with an elderly relative, thankfully), Johnson seems to be adopting a different approach to risk. The Economist has a good graphic showing the difference between the two approaches - letting the epidemic peak, to speed up the recovery, or reducing the peak, while prolonging the impact. Johnson said that closing schools and cancelling big public events was not favoured at the moment. At the moment what they are telling me is, actually, slightly counter-intuitively, things like closing schools and stopping big gatherings don\u2019t work as well perhaps as people think in stopping the spread. He rejected claims that the government was withholding information about the spread of coronavirus. Responding to a question about this story about the location of new cases not being published on a daily basis, he confirmed that this decision is being reversed. He said: Let me clear that up immediately because it is very important that we are transparent, people understand that we are transparent. Public Health England needs to be absolutely sure about the diagnosis of these cases so what they are doing is they are immediately identifying the region where they think there\u2019s an incidence and then within 24 hours confirming the exact location to be sure that we have got the right thing. Whitty said that the government\u2019s response to coronavirus had now moved from the point where it was mainly focusing on containing the disease to the point where it was mainly focusing on delaying its spread. (See 9.15am.) He said that for a short period of time at the peak of the epidemic the NHS could end up looking \u201cquite different\u201d because of the number of normal services or operations that might have to be suspended or postponed. (See 9.48am.) Under a worst case scenario, the NHS could run out of beds, he said. (See 9.33am.) And he said access to critical care beds could come under pressure first. He said: The bit of the system which will come under pressure first will be those conditions that require people to have oxygen and particularly to have critical care beds, and that bit, I think, will come under pressure at quite an early stage if we have a high-end-of-the-range epidemic for this. He said in future, as the outbreak got worse, older people would be told to avoid crowded spaces. (See 9.38am.) He said it might be necessary to give medical students more responsibility to help the NHS at the peak of the epidemic. (See 10.25am.) Q: Will coronavirus affect the talks? Barnier says there are a lot of people at these meetings. At most there are 200 people at a meeting. But the EU will be taking steps to protect people. He says he is very interested in this. Some years ago he even wrote a book about global risks. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What happens if there is no agreement on fisheries by 1 July? Will you tie fisheries to the rest of the trade talks, or to a deal on equivalence? Barnier says the agreement commits the EU to using \u201cbest endeavours\u201d. Fishing is a dangerous profession, he says. He will do his utmost to get a deal on fisheries by July. If he cannot get one then, he will try to get it in the overall agreement. He says there are other issues on which the EU will not compromise, such as financial equivalence and adequacy decisions (ie, whether the EU will acknowledge the UK\u2019s laws). Barnier hints that the EU could withhold financial equivalence if the UK refuses to consider fishing as part of the trade deal. Q: The UK published its terms for a trade deal with the US this week. In it they acknowledge the need for a level playing field. Why won\u2019t they accept one with the EU? Barnier thanks the questioner, and says he does not have much to add. He was surprised to read the UK document. Good luck to the UK getting a trade deal with Donald Trump, he says. He says the philosophy, to use a word David Frost uses a lot, is the same; the EU wants a level playing field, to stop the UK getting any unfair advantages. Q: You accept there will be changes after Brexit. So why won\u2019t you accept changes in relation to fisheries? Barnier says there are definitive changes that will be the consequence of Brexit. He says the EU is willing to seek out a balanced result on this issue. But for the EU member states a balance agreement on fisheries should be part of the trade agreement. Barnier is now taking questions. Q: Could you tell us more about how the joint committee overseeing the withdrawal agreement will work? Barnier says the first meeting of this has been set for 30 March. Michael Gove will lead to the UK side, he says. And the European commission vice president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d will lead for the EU, he says. Michael Gove to represent Britain on joint committee overseeing implementation of withdrawal agreement, Barnier says. Barnier says he thinks an agreement is possible, even though difficult. Barnier switches to English for his final remarks. He thanks David Frost and the British negotiating team for their work. He says two principles should guid the talks: no going back on our commitments, and mutual respect. He says the British team spent a lot of time this week stressing Britain\u2019s independence. But no one is contest that, he says. The question is not independence, but what you do with that, he says. Barnier says the second area of divergence relates to criminal justice policy. He says the UK\u2019s refusal to accept any role for the European court of justice is a problem. The third is on the nature of the agreement. The EU wants an all-encompassing agreement, while the UK disagrees. And the fourth area is fishing. He says the EU has annual negotiations on fishing with Norway. But an agreement with the UK would be far more complicated, because there are far more species of fish involved. He says an agreement on fisheries will have to be part of the trade agreement. Barnier turns to the level playing field provisions. He says, if the UK is serious about maintaining high standards, why won\u2019t it commit to them? Barnier says he now wants to take stock of what has been achieved. He says the EU set out its goals in its negotiation mandate (pdf). He says this week the two sides noted their different positions. But there are some \u201cvery serious divergences\u201d, he says. He says that is what you would expect at this stage. He says he will discuss four of them. Barnier says the EU will defend its interest in these talks. Barnier says the media need to help people prepare for change. He says the UK will leave the customs union and the single market. This will have a lot of consequences. They need to be prepared for. He says next January will not be like January 2020. It will be very, very different, he says. He says he thinks the difficulties are still \u201cunderestimated\u201d. Customs formalities will be applied to all exports. Financial institutions will lose the benefits of passporting. And commercial certificates will no longer be recognised by the EU, he says. He says the partnership that is being negotiated will not avoid these areas of friction. He says the UK delegation accepted this in this round of talks. Barnier says the first priority is to implement the withdrawal agreement. Both sides have to ensure that the rights of citizens are preserved. Then there is the need to preserve peace in Northern Ireland. He says all the obligations on the UK and on the EU were set out in that agreement. He says David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, confirmed to him this week that the UK would honour all its legal obligations. He says the Northern Ireland protocol is not up for negotiation now. It needs ot be implemented. He says companies in Northern Ireland need \u201cclarity\u201d about how this will be implement. This is a matter of urgency, he says. Barnier says he wants to hold regular press briefings throughout the process. He says this worked well in phase one of the Brexit process. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit spokesman, is holding a press conference now to mark the end of the first week of talks in the UK-EU trade negotation. There is a live feed here. Gordon Brown has backed Keir Starmer to be Labour leader, saying he has all the qualifications needed to become prime minister. Brown said all three candidates were worthy but Starmer was his first choice. He highlighted Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s commitment to a green new deal and Lisa Nandy\u2019s focus on the importance of empowering communities. He said: There is one candidate with the expertise, with the eloquence, with the dedication, with the commitment and indeed with the values that are necessary for Labour to return to power. Keir Starmer has all the qualifications that are necessary for a prime minister of the future. A vote for Keir Starmer is a vote for hope. It\u2019s a vote for the future. It\u2019s a vote for the values that all of us believe in deeply. Join Keir Starmer and let\u2019s elect a Labour government. As the Press Association reports, Boris Johnson did appear to get flustered when asked on ITV\u2019s this morning whether he would be chaning nappies when his partner, Carrie Synonds, has their baby. Here is the PA story. Boris Johnson appeared flustered when asked if he will be changing nappies when his new baby arrives. The prime minister and fiancee Carrie Symonds are expecting a child in the early summer. Appearing on ITV\u2019s This Morning, host Holly Willoughby told the PM: \u201cWe can\u2019t let you go without saying congratulations.\u201d Johnson admitted he was \u201cvery excited\u201d, but did not add anything else, prompting co-host Phillip Schofield to ask: \u201cIs that it?\u201d When asked: \u201cHow good are you at changing nappies? Will you change nappies?\u201d, the PM appeared flustered before eventually saying: \u201cI expect so.\u201d He would not answer when asked how the rest of his family are taking the news, and when Schofield questioned him on his reticence to discuss his personal life, saying: \u201cAll family life is happening in Downing Street and you won\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cVery sensibly.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve spent an awfully long time deliberately not going on about it, for the very good reason that there are people that I love that I don\u2019t want to put in the debate and that\u2019s the reason.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, told MPs during business questions that there are no plans to close parliament because of coronavirus. He said: There are no plans to close the house down. The public will expect parliament to sit and get on with its job. parliament has proven itself to be very resilient over the years. There is no medical reason on current advice to think that shutting parliament would be necessary or helpful. Rees-Mogg was responding to this story in the Times (paywall), claiming parliament could be suspended for five months. Matt Chorley and Chris Smyth say: With public bodies boosting preparations for months of disruption, plans are being drawn up that would mean the Commons and Lords not returning after Easter. MPs rise on March 31 and sitting would be suspended until September in \u201cthe longest summer recess we have known\u201d, according to one senior parliamentary source. There was a \u201cnot\u201d missing in an earlier post, which has now been corrected. Boris Johnson told ITV that he told his cabinet that he does not like bullying, not the opposite. Sorry. Johnson ends up by saying his advice to people would to carry on with business as usual. And that\u2019s it. The Boris Johnson interview, and the Chris Whitty select committee hearing, are now both over. I will post summaries from both of them soon. Q: Is Priti Patel a victim of sexism? Johnson says he does not know about that, but he knows she is trying to advance a very difficult agenda. Q: But how many stories do you have to hear before you realise that there is substance to this? Johnson says his instinct is to stick with Patel. Or \u201cstick with Prit\u201d, as he puts it. Q: Have you told her not to bully staff? Johnson says he has told all his cabinet that he does not like bullying. Q: Where were you in the week of the flooding? Johnson starts talking about what the government is doing. Q: Why did you not go yourself? Johnson says we have a wonderful system called cabinet government. Q: Do you wish you had gone? Johnson says, when you visit a flood zone, \u201ceverybody has to down tools\u201d. They meet for an hour or more to brief you, when they could be getting on with the emergency. He says, \u201cThey said to us, all you will do is distract us.\u201d Boris Johnson claims he was advised by emergency services not to visit areas affected by flooding last month. Q: Can you guarantee that people will be able to get food? Yes, says Johnson. He says the budget next week will contain measures to help business, and to help people generally. Q: Have you prepared your dad? Johnson says he is generally ready for anything. But he says both his parents are a concern. Q: Does the NHS have enough nurses? Johnson says the government is recruiting 50,000 more nurses. Q: You are not going fast enough. Johnson says he would not disagree. Q: If you bring back retired medical staff, aren\u2019t they they most vulnerable people? Johnson says this is an issue. He says the government will be getting the NHS ready. Chris Whitty is still giving evidence to the health committee, but Boris Johnson is currently speaking about coronavirus on ITV\u2019s This Morning. He says SAGE, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergency, is meeting today. He says the experts are telling him that measures like school closures do not work as effectively as people think. He says this might be counter-intuitive. It is only if there is a case in a school that it should close now, he says. Q: Are you trying to delay the peak into the summer? Johnson says he favours trying to delay the peak. Q: Could we reach a point where people have to be turned away from hospitals? And do you expect to see isolation wards in hospitals? Whitty says most people will be treated at home. It is safer and more comfortable for people with mild versions of the disease to stay at home. Q: What advise to you have for people considering stockpiling medicines or other goods? Whitty says there is no rational reason why this should be necessary. Q: When do you think you will be able to start publishing geographical information about the spread more regularly? Whitty says this is a matter for Public Health England. He thinks they will do this soon, perhaps within a couple of weeks. But he says his view is that it is important to ensure the information is accurate before it gets published. Q: How will you communicate with the public? Whitty says he thinks the delay phase is least understood by the public. At this phase, actions are mostly about case finding, and isolating. Q: Should we be sending the public to other sources of information? Whitty says the government is trying to centralise its own information in one place. Second, it is working with social media companies, to try to ensure that accurate information comes to the fore. And, third, it is taking out paid information to ensure that people get accurate information. There will be a full communications strategy around this, he says. Whitty says he is not a social media expert. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is interested in this area, and he has been approaching social media companies, he says. Q: Would you suspend Care Quality Commission inspections during the outbreak? Whitty says this is one of many issues being kept under review. Q: Would you consider making more use of medical students? Whitty says the government is considering changing what foundation year 1 medics (new doctors who are training, having just finished medical school) or final year medical students are allowed to do, alongside brining back retired doctors. Medical students could be given more responsibility if the coronavirus hits a peak, Whitty says. Asked if he is recommending that smokers should self-isolate, Whitty says his advice to smokers if that they should stop smoking. This is a good time to do that, he says. Whitty says it looks as if the average time between getting the infection and showing symptoms is five days. And, if people have symptoms but only very mildly, that lasts for about five days. But, where people get more seriously ill, they tend to do so after about six days of having the illness. Q: Can fit and healthy people die from this illness? Yes, says Whitty. He says fit and healthy people can die from anything. They can die from flu. But it is incredibly rare. Whitty says people who smoke may be more at risk, as is the case with any respiratory illness. But the evidence on this is not available, he says. Q: Are children with asthma at risk? Whitty says he does not think so, on the basis of the Chinese data. If people have asthma, this could trigger an asthma attack. But this would be like any other respiratory illness. And he would expect that to happen just once. Q: So you would not advice parents to self-isolate? Whitty says if children have very bad asthma, then that might be sensible. But it would not be necessary for children with mild asthma. Q: What can older people do to reduce their chances of getting coronavirus? Whitty says isolating older people from the virus is important. But you have to do that without isolating them from society. He says the government is giving a lot of thought to what can be done to give people practical help. But it is important not to start too early. And the moment there is very little communal spread, he says. So the government would not encourage people to start self-isolating now. Q: When the advice changes, what would your advice be to families concerned about older relatives? Whitty says the government wants to stop the virus coming into contact with the older person, not society. He says the government is still looking at this. He says, if face to face contact is not possible, then the government may consider other ways in which people can stay in contact. And he says that past experience has shown that people remarkably altruistic. Q: Schools are being told that pupils should wash their hands four times a day. How practical is that? Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, who is giving evidence alongside Whitty, says children are not always very scrupulous about where they put their hands. She says there is a good case for supervised hand washing in schools. And pupils can then take good habits back into the home environment, she says. Q: What advice do you have for pregnant women? Whitty says we don\u2019t know at this stage, because this disease has not been around long enough. But other coronaviruses have not caused a problem. And he says there have been cases of women who caught coronavirus in the late stage of pregnancy, who then went on to give birth without major problems. Q: What is the likelihood of schools closing? Whitty says, at this point, in the contain phase, if a single pupil is found to have coronavirus, then there is a case to close the school. But generally at this stage the government does not want to close schools, he says. Whitty says this will change when you get to the major epidemic phase. You may have to close schools because so many staff are off sick. But he does not expect that to be a big problem. And then there might be an argument for closing schools to reduce the spread. Ministers would have to decide, he says. He says his view is that this would be less effective than under a flu epidemic. He says the data is not available yet to show whether the benefits would justify this. Whitty says he is in daily, almost hourly, contact with the chief medical officers in the other parts of the UK. He says this is valuable, because they have different backgrounds, and look at the problem in different ways. Whitty says he does not think a vaccine for coronavirus will be available within less than a year. I think ... a year would be lucky to get this - so we will not have a vaccine available for the first wave if we have a first wave. Important to develop because it may then become important if this continues to circulate in society, which I think there is a high chance it will, but I think we need to be realistic. Whitty says, once you pass a critical moment for infections, once 90% of infections are self-generated, it does not matter much what other countries do. But countries with weaker health services will need help, he says. Whitty says closing schools is not an attractive option because it would only have a fractional effect on the spead of the disease, and there would be a huge impact on parents. Whitty says the health experts will present ministers with a range of measures that could be introduced as part of the mitigation phase. He says ministers will be told what impact they might have on the peak, what impact they might have on delaying the virus, and what the social cost would be. Ministers will then have to choose a \u201csensible and proportionate\u201d response, he says. Whitty is now talking about things that could happen in the mitigation stage. There would be three things you could do, he says. One aim would be to reduce the peak of the outbreak. That would involve decisions that would have a big impact on ordinary life. Second, the aim would be to protect people most at risk - the elderly and the vulnerable. And, third, the mitigation strategy would involve postponing other demands on the NHS during that period. You would \u201cflex\u201d the service, he says. He says he has seen this done in different ways in different countries. But for a short period of time \u201cthe NHS may look quite different from the ordinary NHS we are used to\u201d, he says. Whitty says NHS may have to \u2018look quite different\u2019 from way it is now at peak of coronavirus outbreak. Q: Have you done any evaluation of how many retired NHS staff might want to come back to work? Whitty says the willingness of doctors to come back is very high. People become doctors for a reason; they want to help. But they are sensible too. If they thought their health was at risk, or that they had been out of medicine too long to be of use, they would stay away. Q: Can you envisage a situation where MPs were considered super-spreaders? There has been talk of parliament having to be shut down. Whitty says he has discussed this with Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, and Norman Fowler, the Lords Speaker. Fowler was a distinguished health secretary, he says. He says he would not presume to tell them how to run their houses. But he says that in the future the government may advise older people, and people with pre-existing health conditions, to avoid crowded places. One of the bits of advice that we will give when this starts to run is for people who are older or who have pre-existing health conditions to have some degree of isolation from more public environments. That could affect individual MPs and peers, he says. Whitty says older people may in future be told to avoid crowded places. Q: How will this impact on, say, cancer patients in hospital? Whitty says there are three kinds of impact. There will be direct impacts on some people; some people will die. There will also be an impact on the NHS, which will affect its ability to treat other people. He says 50% of all cases could come during a three-week period. During that period the NHS would be under huge strain. One of the things which is clear, if you model out the epidemic, is you will get 50% of all the cases over a three-week period and 95% of the cases over a nine-week period, if it follows the trajectory we think it\u2019s likely to. If all of those were spaced out on the NHS over two or three years, that would be easily manageable, but it\u2019s the fact they are so heavily concentrated. He says, under one scenario, this could be like the NHS dealing with a bad winter flu, but in late spring. But in another scenario this could involve a \u201chuge number\u201d of cases, \u201covertopping the ability of the NHS realistically to put everybody in beds\u201d. Whitty says NHS could run out of beds for coronavirus victims under a worst case scenario. Q: Is there any reason why a higher proportion of the population might get the virus in the UK than in China? Whitty says the Chinese are taking some \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures to contain the disease. But he sees no reason why the disease should spread more in the UK than in China. He says, when planning, you need to start with the highest plausible number for planning. And an 80% infection rate would be the highest possible rate for a disease coming out of nowhere. He says it is possible that 70% of people could get it without displaying any symptoms. Whitty says the mortality rate for people over 80 seems to be between 8 and 9%. But this is based on figures from China, he says. Q: The director general of the World Health Organisation says the mortality rate is 3.4%. But you are putting it at 1%. Whitty says the WHO figure does not take account of people who only got the disease very midly. He says he has a \u201creasonably high degree of confidence\u201d that the real mortality rate is 1%, or lower. Whitty is asked about this Guardian story. He describes it as a \u201ccommunications fumble\u201d. He says in the medium term more details information will be provided. We are intending to provide geographical information - in fact, in the medium term we will provide a lot more information with maps and other things, with a proper dashboard as we gradually move into a phase where there are many more cases. What we are, though, intending to do is have some delay - about 24 hours - to be absolutely sure we\u2019ve got the details right. Q: Are you anticipating moving from the \u2018contain\u2019 phase of the plan to the \u2018delay\u2019 phase in the next few days? Whitty says the government has had four aims. First, containing the outbreak. That is now an \u201cextraordinary unlikely\u201d long-term outcome, he says. He says \u201ccontaining looks pretty optimistic\u201d now. Second, delaying the outbreak. Whitty says this approach overlaps in many ways with contain. He says if you can push back the peak of the outbreak, you get at least two, and possibly three benefits. He says you delay the peak until the NHS is in a better to respond. He says you also get more time to deal with the disease, either by managing it or developing drugs. And he says there may be a seasonal element to this; if you move into spring and the summer, the rate of infection may go down. That is the case with flu, he says. Q: So are you going to move from contain to delay within the next few days? Whitty says there won\u2019t be a \u201cstep move\u2019\u201d to delay. He says it is a matter of putting more emphasis on the delay elements. In the early stage the contain and delay strategies are similar. But later other measures will be needed. Q: So there won\u2019t be a moment where you move from stage one to stage two. That\u2019s correct, Whitty says. But he says the UK has move from the \u201cmainly contain\u201d stage to the \u201cmainly delay\u201d stage. We have moved from a situation where we are mainly in contain, with some delay built in, to we are now mainly delay. Whitty says he is expecting the number of UK cases to go up. And there are several cases where it is not clear where the outbreak has come from. He says that means it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that there is some level of community transmission (ie, that people are catching it from people in the UK, not as a result of people bringing it in from abroad). Prof Chris Whitty starts. He says he appreciates Hunt\u2019s comment thanking NHS staff. He says he will start with the global situation. Three weeks ago he would have said the key to the epidemic was in China. But now the situation has moved on. The Chinese are seeing their rates of coronavirus fall quite rapidly. But the Chinese still have strict travel restrictions in place. It is not clear what will happen when those are lifted. Whitty says there are large outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. The Iranian one is probably larger than they say. And he says there are probably some countries not reporting outbreaks where outbreaks are taking place. Either they are not aware of them, or they are not reporting them. He says the chances of the outbreak being restricted now to China are \u201cslim to zero\u201d. The hearing is starting now. Jeremy Hunt, the committee chair, is asking the first set of questions. Hunt used to be health secretary, and his election as committee chair was controversial, because the committee will probably end up reviewing decisions that he took during his time running the health department. Commons select committee hearings only started this week, because it took a while to establish the committees after the election, and this morning we will have what will probably be the most watched hearing of the week - Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England and the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser, giving evidence to the Commons health committee about coronavirus. My colleagues Ian Sample and Lisa O\u2019Carroll have a very good profile of him here. And here is our main coronavirus outbreak live blog, where you can read all the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak story, from the UK and from around the world. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, gives evidence to the Commons health committee. 9.30am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: The British Chambers of Commerce conference opens. The speakers include Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who will be on at 11.45am. 10am: The Home Office publishes an analysis of homicide trends. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions on the Commons business statement for next week. 11am: Boris Johnson meets he president of Malta in Downing Street. 11.45am: The Investigatory Powers Commissioner\u2019s Office (IPCO) publishes its annual report. 12pm: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, holds a press conference in Brussels at the end of the first week of the UK-EU trade talks. This morning I will be covering the Chris Whitty committee hearing in detail and otherwise I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>University academics are also struggling to cope with the closures.</p> \n<p>James Schwarten, an American university lecturer based in Rome, acknowledges the hardships the situation has created. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has generated a stressful predicament for university institutions that accommodate US study-abroad students, not to mention for university professors,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2019This adverse situation has created a general climate of uncertainty as many students have already returned to the US, as well as concern for student enrolments in summer and fall, which could be negatively affected. If that scenario is borne out, many adjunct faculty members could find themselves in severe financial straits.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the township of Vo\u2019, the first to be placed in the red zone, schools have been dealing with closures for the last 15 days.</p> \n<p>A school in Lozzo Atestino, in the province of Padua and in the red zone, has been using remote online learning tools in place of classroom teaching.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had to do something,\u201d said Alfonso D\u2019Ambrosio, the headmaster. \u201cThe education minister sent us 25 tablets for needy students.

      "body": "<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I didn\u2019t care about this coronavirus outbreak until Peter Andre almost had it. We never stop to think about what we would do if Peter Andre was forced into a period of self-isolation. Our world would surely change beyond recognition, no? Who would soothe the Loose Women with a biweekly pop-in? Who would walk through the corridors of exotic hotels making explanatory hand gestures on This Morning? Who would \u2013 what else does Peter Andre do? He, uh \u2026 Hmm. The shadow Andre casts is huge compared with the actual career that preceded it. If you really think about it, he did one song and married Jordan for a bit, 15 years ago. But Andre has a unique place in British culture and British hearts, and for that reason, were he absent from celebrity life for any time due to coronavirus, our economy would soon sink like a ship.</p> <p>I should clarify, before the lawyers get involved, that Andre does not have coronavirus. But this week he acted as a sort of canary-in-the-coalmine for what would happen if one of our daytime TV stars did get it, and what would happen, broadly, is \u201cmild to medium panic\u201d. At a meet\u2019n\u2019greet event Andre held in Southampton on Saturday, signs were allegedly put up reading: \u201cDue to recent cases of the coronavirus please DO NOT have any physical contact with Peter Andre. Please DO NOT take any selfies with Peter Andre. Apologies for any inconvenience.\u201d</p> <p>After Andre started trending on Twitter \u2013 for the outlandish and diva-like demand of not wanting to get actively infected with a deadly respiratory illness \u2013 he issued a denial, stating that he <em>did</em> hug everyone at the Q&amp;A who asked for it, and that he never asked for the posters to be put up. \u201cOK this must be a wind up because I hugged everyone I met,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrPeterAndre/status/1234387582043246592\" title=\"\">he said</a>. \u201cPeople were saying to me that they had been told not to touch me and that there were signs. I thought they were joking. Brilliant.\u201d Thing is, it would be <em>very</em> Peter Andre of Peter Andre to get coronavirus from politely hugging too many giddy Southampton mums, wouldn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Celebrities are cautious of coronavirus, just like the rest of us are; they just express it in very different ways. While we all panic-wash our hands for 20 seconds and get incredibly tense when someone coughs on public transport, stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow share <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gwynethpaltrow/?hl=en\" title=\"\">face mask selfies</a> from the recline position of the first-class cabin of a jet airliner. Same disease, different threat: if we get coronavirus, we get up to 14 days off work, statutory sick pay and an increasingly arsey set of emails from our boss (\u201cHow ill are you, really? That spreadsheet can be done at home if needs be\u201d).

      "bodyText": "I don\u2019t know about you, but I didn\u2019t care about this coronavirus outbreak until Peter Andre almost had it. We never stop to think about what we would do if Peter Andre was forced into a period of self-isolation. Our world would surely change beyond recognition, no? Who would soothe the Loose Women with a biweekly pop-in? Who would walk through the corridors of exotic hotels making explanatory hand gestures on This Morning? Who would \u2013 what else does Peter Andre do? He, uh \u2026 Hmm. The shadow Andre casts is huge compared with the actual career that preceded it. If you really think about it, he did one song and married Jordan for a bit, 15 years ago. But Andre has a unique place in British culture and British hearts, and for that reason, were he absent from celebrity life for any time due to coronavirus, our economy would soon sink like a ship. I should clarify, before the lawyers get involved, that Andre does not have coronavirus. But this week he acted as a sort of canary-in-the-coalmine for what would happen if one of our daytime TV stars did get it, and what would happen, broadly, is \u201cmild to medium panic\u201d. At a meet\u2019n\u2019greet event Andre held in Southampton on Saturday, signs were allegedly put up reading: \u201cDue to recent cases of the coronavirus please DO NOT have any physical contact with Peter Andre. Please DO NOT take any selfies with Peter Andre. Apologies for any inconvenience.\u201d After Andre started trending on Twitter \u2013 for the outlandish and diva-like demand of not wanting to get actively infected with a deadly respiratory illness \u2013 he issued a denial, stating that he did hug everyone at the Q&amp;A who asked for it, and that he never asked for the posters to be put up. \u201cOK this must be a wind up because I hugged everyone I met,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were saying to me that they had been told not to touch me and that there were signs. I thought they were joking. Brilliant.\u201d Thing is, it would be very Peter Andre of Peter Andre to get coronavirus from politely hugging too many giddy Southampton mums, wouldn\u2019t it? Celebrities are cautious of coronavirus, just like the rest of us are; they just express it in very different ways. While we all panic-wash our hands for 20 seconds and get incredibly tense when someone coughs on public transport, stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow share face mask selfies from the recline position of the first-class cabin of a jet airliner. Same disease, different threat: if we get coronavirus, we get up to 14 days off work, statutory sick pay and an increasingly arsey set of emails from our boss (\u201cHow ill are you, really? That spreadsheet can be done at home if needs be\u201d). If Gwyneth Paltrow gets it, she gets to recline on a pile of jade eggs, drink a load of juice until it\u2019s over, then sell an essential anti-coronavirus candle on Goop straight afterwards for $80 a go. And you will buy it, won\u2019t you? You measly little pig.

      "body": "<p>With the inevitable increase in coronavirus cases, we have heard suggestions that schools may have to be closed (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/twelve-more-people-test-positive-coronavirus-in-uk\" title=\"\">New cases raise fears virus spreading undetected in UK</a>, 2 March). Surely one thing that the government could do before getting to the point of closing schools \u2013 with the negative knock-on effects of parents having to take time of work etc \u2013 would be to make arrangements for schools to have plentiful supplies of free alcohol-based hand sanitiser, soap, tissues and other cleaning products.</p> <p>Austerity has seen schools openly begging parents for essential supplies such as toilet tissues, pens and writing paper. If the government funded these supplies, schools would be the ideal places to teach hand-washing and protocols for coughs and sneezes. This would be a great boost to containment and help prevent the spread of not just the coronavirus but many other common viruses and bacteria.<br><strong>Dr James D Williams</strong><br><em>Senior lecturer in education, </em><em>University of Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 We are advised to wash our hands regularly, not to touch our faces, and to cough or sneeze into our elbows, our hands or a paper tissue.</p> <p>Washing our hands after sneezing into them may not always be feasible. While we do not yet know how long the virus can survive out of the body, I am unclear as to how effective sneezing into a clothed elbow will be other than as a good breeding place for the virus.</p> <p>If we are to cough into a tissue and then discard it, where should that be? I would expect large numbers of potentially contaminated tissues to join the discarded coffee cups and other waste food containers that litter our streets or, perhaps, placed in overflowing waste bins in our cities.</p> <p>It must be possible for our medical leaders to come up with better ways of controlling the spread of this virus.<br><strong>Dr Michael Robert Martin</strong><br><em>Retired GP, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 The picture on your front cover (4 March), of a man hanging on to a rail in a train carriage with his whole arm, is the reason why I consider the advice to sneeze into the crook of your elbow to be actively harmful.<br><strong>Catherine Rose</strong><br><em>Olney, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 According to the World Health Organization and infection experts, banknotes are high-risk suspects in the spread of coronavirus (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2020/mar/03/from-banknotes-to-handrails-10-objects-that-help-spread-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Six objects that can spread coronavirus</a>, G2, 4 March). As an elderly, vulnerable category person, not at ease with \u201ccontactless payment options\u201d, cash is my primary payment method. Hand-washing facilities are not always available, and avoiding instinctive touching of the face is not always avoidable at my age. So to help minimise the spread of the virus, am I supposed to use coins only? An alternative, I suppose, is to copy the Queen and wear disposable or washable gloves. Fine when you\u2019ve got people at hand to fully take care of everything, but not practicable otherwise for my age group.<br><strong>Jack Redfern</strong><br><em>Congresbury, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Harry Venning\u2019s brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/picture/2020/mar/03/clare-in-the-community-coronavirus-smoke-signals\" title=\"\">Clare in the Community cartoon</a> on Wednesday summed up the weird hysteria around face masks so perfectly. Could we now perhaps have fewer photos of people on the tube with some sort of mask? I think we\u2019ve all got the picture now.<br><strong>Jonathan Harris</strong><br><em>Royal Wootton Bassett</em></p> <p>\u2022 Taking a comfort break at a motorway service station, I noticed that many men seem to have more faith in mobile phones as a guard against coronavirus spread than using a sanitiser or hand-washing (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19\" title=\"\">G2, 2 March</a>).

      "bodyText": "With the inevitable increase in coronavirus cases, we have heard suggestions that schools may have to be closed (New cases raise fears virus spreading undetected in UK, 2 March). Surely one thing that the government could do before getting to the point of closing schools \u2013 with the negative knock-on effects of parents having to take time of work etc \u2013 would be to make arrangements for schools to have plentiful supplies of free alcohol-based hand sanitiser, soap, tissues and other cleaning products. Austerity has seen schools openly begging parents for essential supplies such as toilet tissues, pens and writing paper. If the government funded these supplies, schools would be the ideal places to teach hand-washing and protocols for coughs and sneezes. This would be a great boost to containment and help prevent the spread of not just the coronavirus but many other common viruses and bacteria. Dr James D Williams Senior lecturer in education, University of Sussex \u2022 We are advised to wash our hands regularly, not to touch our faces, and to cough or sneeze into our elbows, our hands or a paper tissue. Washing our hands after sneezing into them may not always be feasible. While we do not yet know how long the virus can survive out of the body, I am unclear as to how effective sneezing into a clothed elbow will be other than as a good breeding place for the virus. If we are to cough into a tissue and then discard it, where should that be? I would expect large numbers of potentially contaminated tissues to join the discarded coffee cups and other waste food containers that litter our streets or, perhaps, placed in overflowing waste bins in our cities. It must be possible for our medical leaders to come up with better ways of controlling the spread of this virus. Dr Michael Robert Martin Retired GP, Devon \u2022 The picture on your front cover (4 March), of a man hanging on to a rail in a train carriage with his whole arm, is the reason why I consider the advice to sneeze into the crook of your elbow to be actively harmful. Catherine Rose Olney, Buckinghamshire \u2022 According to the World Health Organization and infection experts, banknotes are high-risk suspects in the spread of coronavirus (Six objects that can spread coronavirus, G2, 4 March). As an elderly, vulnerable category person, not at ease with \u201ccontactless payment options\u201d, cash is my primary payment method. Hand-washing facilities are not always available, and avoiding instinctive touching of the face is not always avoidable at my age. So to help minimise the spread of the virus, am I supposed to use coins only? An alternative, I suppose, is to copy the Queen and wear disposable or washable gloves. Fine when you\u2019ve got people at hand to fully take care of everything, but not practicable otherwise for my age group. Jack Redfern Congresbury, Somerset \u2022 Harry Venning\u2019s brilliant Clare in the Community cartoon on Wednesday summed up the weird hysteria around face masks so perfectly. Could we now perhaps have fewer photos of people on the tube with some sort of mask? I think we\u2019ve all got the picture now. Jonathan Harris Royal Wootton Bassett \u2022 Taking a comfort break at a motorway service station, I noticed that many men seem to have more faith in mobile phones as a guard against coronavirus spread than using a sanitiser or hand-washing (G2, 2 March). It seems almost common practice at the urinal to have equipment in one hand and mobile phone in the other. I thought that maybe they were carefully reading the advice on singing Happy Birthday twice, but then, with a shake and zip, a glance at the wash basin and a final look at the screen, out they went. David Bricknell Plymouth \u2022 I say three Hail Marys while washing my hands. Hopefully that way both my physical and spiritual wellbeing is taken care of.

Having campaigned in December\u2019s general election on a promise to \u201clevel up\u201d the disparate and unequal regional economies of the UK \u2013 and having won a spectacular election victory in some of the more deprived English regions \u2013 ministers had been keen to show that they meant it. When the Exeter-based airline threatened to collapse in January, the government duly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/flybe-saved-after-successful-last-ditch-talks\" title=\"\">stepped in</a> to attempt a rescue package to keep it in the air. Now, less than two months later, Flybe has gone into administration anyway. The coronavirus outbreak\u2019s impact on airline bookings was the last straw. The effect on regional connectivity in these islands is likely to be grim. Around 2,000 people have lost their jobs, with others likely to follow in the supply chain.</p> <p>The wider lesson of Flybe is that ministers can do the right thing, as they did here, but without achieving the sustained effect that they had hoped for. This lesson matters a lot, because the problem of regional inequality is very extensive and extremely complex. It also matters because the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to set out a more strategic approach to the problem and to make it a centrepiece of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/levelling-up-britain-why-cornwall-needs-more-than-just-tourism\" title=\"\">next week\u2019s budget</a>. It is important for the regions and the country, never mind the government, that he gets it right. Flybe is a reminder in two ways that this is not easy: first because big sums of money are often involved over a long period in effective government interventions, and second because the economic impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-could-push-uk-to-brink-of-recession-says-goldman-sachs\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a> may also be fierce in unforeseen ways.</p> <p>None of this should cast doubt on the importance of the levelling-up project. But it underlines that such a project is costly, complex and long-term.

But it won\u2019t do either to dismiss it as hopelessly inadequate even before it has begun. The test of it will lie in a variety of things, among them the scale of the financial commitment, the breadth and adaptability of the approaches, the role of local democracy, and the recognition that the benefits (and any disbenefits) may only become clear over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/economists-warning-boris-johnson-election-pledge-output\" title=\"\">much longer period</a> than one electoral cycle. For that reason, the chair of the Industrial Strategy Council, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/04/set-targets-to-level-up-regions-says-industrial-strategy-council\" title=\"\">Andy Haldane</a>, was right to suggest last month that a system of targets will be necessary.</p> <p>In a well-timed pre-budget intervention this week, a report from the centre right thinktank <a href=\"https://www.ukonward.com/\" title=\"\">Onward</a> proposes a series of areas and goals on which Mr Sunak could concentrate. The core of the report is its argument that investment to improve prosperity and productivity goes disproportionately to regions that are already more prosperous and productive. This argument has often been made in relation to capital investment in transport, and is also a frequent source of complaint in the cultural sphere. But the report broadens the charge. London, it argues, gets nearly twice the UK average R&amp;D spend per head and five times as much support for affordable housing as the rest of England. Only London and Scotland consistently benefit from above-average spending levels in all the areas surveyed in the report.</p> <p>Mr Sunak has an opportunity to start to turn the tide next week. The Onward report lists several options: they include changing the Treasury\u2019s \u201cgreen book\u201d methodology favouring London and the south-east, ringfencing funding for less wealthy regions like the east Midlands, and more devolution. This last is particularly important. Regions need an effective democratic voice in this reallocation. Mr Sunak could also consider the suggestion that instead of confining the UK\u2019s cutting-edge technology research inside the south-east\u2019s existing \u201cgolden triangle\u201d, it could be centred in Glasgow or Newcastle.</p> <p>This is, in every sense, a national debate for Britain. The country is out of joint. The nations and regions need a new growth-enhancement settlement. All the political parties know it. Innovative thinking on the centre-right exists alongside Labour\u2019s big debate about the revival of towns. Britain has a long and at times effective tradition of levelling through economic transfers. It is in need of revival. This could be a big moment for that.

Five people in hazmats turned up at our apartment, they looked like ghostbusters,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took swabs from our nose and throat and said they\u2019d return in the morning so we should start packing.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the end, they came sooner. Late on Sunday night, a team of masked officers who described themselves as police arrived at their door. They announced that the couple were being forcibly quarantined and warned that if they resisted, the police would use force.</p> \n<p>It transpired that Laura, 30, an international schoolteacher, and her partner, had been onboard the same ferry as a man who later tested positive for coronavirus, while traveling from Hong Kong to Shenzhen two days earlier.</p> \n<p>The couple were told they would have to stay in state-organised isolation for two weeks from the date of the ferry journey, and are now counting down the days until they can leave on 13 March.</p> \n<p>Laura and her partner were told they couldn\u2019t self-isolate because they had been in close contact with a confirmed case. They have read, however, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/chinese-social-media-censoring-officially-sanctioned-facts-on-coronavirus\">Chinese state media</a> that other passengers on the ferry have been allowed to quarantine themselves at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how they determined that we were that close to the guy who was infected, it\u2019s a mystery,\u201d Laura said.</p> \n<p>The couple were allowed 20 minutes to pack their belongings and feed their two cats before being put in the back of an ambulance and taken to a hotel across the road, which was being used by the Chinese authorities.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone around us was in hazmat suits and staying really far away,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we got to the hotel, I saw that my partner and I had different room numbers allocated.

I was in tears, so it was concerning that they didn\u2019t call me again,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Inside the hotel they found their bedroom to be dirty, with hair and broken glass strewn on the floor. They have been told they must remain a metre apart, despite being in the same room, and wear masks at all times.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d12003cd573922e7bc59757d8d7c1c5e95b30f31\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d12003cd573922e7bc59757d8d7c1c5e95b30f31/0_516_756_454/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rubbish piling up in the corridor\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rubbish piles up in the corridor outside the hotel room.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The couple are woken at 7am each day to be tested for coronavirus symptoms, given masks, and even asked about their bowel movements.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLaura\u201d (not her real name) and her partner were relaxing in their flat in Shenzhen, China, when the phone rang. She was told by the Chinese authorities that they had been exposed to the coronavirus at close proximity and that officials were on their way. \u201cIt was terrifying. Five people in hazmats turned up at our apartment, they looked like ghostbusters,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took swabs from our nose and throat and said they\u2019d return in the morning so we should start packing.\u201d In the end, they came sooner. Late on Sunday night, a team of masked officers who described themselves as police arrived at their door. They announced that the couple were being forcibly quarantined and warned that if they resisted, the police would use force. It transpired that Laura, 30, an international schoolteacher, and her partner, had been onboard the same ferry as a man who later tested positive for coronavirus, while traveling from Hong Kong to Shenzhen two days earlier. The couple were told they would have to stay in state-organised isolation for two weeks from the date of the ferry journey, and are now counting down the days until they can leave on 13 March. Laura and her partner were told they couldn\u2019t self-isolate because they had been in close contact with a confirmed case. They have read, however, in Chinese state media that other passengers on the ferry have been allowed to quarantine themselves at home. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how they determined that we were that close to the guy who was infected, it\u2019s a mystery,\u201d Laura said. The couple were allowed 20 minutes to pack their belongings and feed their two cats before being put in the back of an ambulance and taken to a hotel across the road, which was being used by the Chinese authorities. \u201cEveryone around us was in hazmat suits and staying really far away,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we got to the hotel, I saw that my partner and I had different room numbers allocated. I was in hysterics. Eventually they just agreed it was easier to let us stay together.\u201d Laura contacted the British consulate but found them \u201cdisinterested\u201d and \u201cnon-responsive\u201d. \u201cI rang the crisis centre in London and the line cut off, and no one called me back. I was in tears, so it was concerning that they didn\u2019t call me again,\u201d she said. Inside the hotel they found their bedroom to be dirty, with hair and broken glass strewn on the floor. They have been told they must remain a metre apart, despite being in the same room, and wear masks at all times. The couple are woken at 7am each day to be tested for coronavirus symptoms, given masks, and even asked about their bowel movements. Later their temperatures are checked again. \u201cThe tests are painful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe swab up your nose feels like it\u2019s prodding your brain.\u201d Despite this, Laura and her partner say they are grateful to be together as they face another nine days in the hotel. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what this experience would be like if we were separated,\u201d Laura said. Britons \u201cFrances\u201d, 25, and her fianc\u00e9 \u201cJames\u201d (not their real names) haven\u2019t been so lucky and have been isolated in different rooms. They were onboard the same ferry as Laura and were also deemed to have been in close proximity to the infected individual. Frances and James were tested at their home on Sunday night but were not told they would have to leave. \u201cLater that night, at about 11pm, we got a call saying, we\u2019re going now. There was an ambulance outside our place. We got in and a police car followed the ambulance with its sirens on. We didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d she said. Despite the couple\u2019s protests, they were put in hotel rooms two doors apart, after authorities insisted they could get infected more quickly, or from one another, if they were quarantined together. Like Laura, Frances found her room \u201cfilthy\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The government has defended its role in Flybe\u2019s collapse, as business groups, trade unions and passengers around the country voiced dismay at the loss of the UK\u2019s biggest regional airline.</p> <p>Flybe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-two-months-after-government-announces-rescue\">went into administration</a> in the early hours of Thursday morning, with the loss of 2,400 jobs, less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal, having promised to \u201clevel up\u201d Britain by investing in transport links.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/02/airline-industry-braced-for-major-threat-from-coronavirus-turmoil\">impact of the coronavirus</a> on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based Flybe, which had operated almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/flybe-could-collapse-within-weeks-without-help\">stalled on a controversial \u00a3100m loan</a>. Flybe was the fourth UK airline to go bust in a little over two years, following just months after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\">demise of travel group Thomas Cook</a>.</p> <p>While cabinet ministers raced to announce they had saved Flybe in January, when the airline flirted with bankruptcy, it was left to the transport minister Kelly Tolhurst to defend the government\u2019s actions in the Commons on Thursday. She said the government had been working \u201ctirelessly\u201d with Flybe\u2019s owners Connect Airways \u2013 a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and the hedge fund Cyrus Capital \u2013 since then.</p> <p>Existing problems had been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak which had a \u201csignificant impact on demand\u201d, Tolhurst said. \u201cThe directors, therefore, decided it was not viable to keep Flybe operating.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cUnfortunately, in a competitive market, companies do fail, and it is not the role of government to prop them up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902gs5DhRZFzqpZ/\" data-alt=\"flybe airports\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902gs5DhRZFzqpZ/\">flybe airports</a> </figure>  <p>The Department for Transport said it would bring forward \u201crecommendations to help ensure that the whole of the UK has the connections in place that people rely on\u201d.</p> <p>A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said the consortium had invested more than \u00a3135m to keep the airline flying for an extra year, adding: \u201cSadly, despite the efforts of all involved to turn the airline around, not least the people of Flybe, the impact of Covid-19 on Flybe\u2019s trading means that the consortium can no longer commit to continued financial support.\u201d</p> <p>However, unions hit out at both the government and the owners of the airline, which was one of the leading carriers at airports including Belfast, Southampton, Manchester, Cardiff and Birmingham, carrying around 8 million people a year. It flies to 56 destinations across Europe, including 26 in the UK and Ireland.</p> <p>The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cSix weeks ago, when the ownership consortium lost confidence, the government promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/17/government-accused-of-covering-up-true-terms-of-flybe-rescue-deal-ryanair-michael-oleary\">a rescue package</a>, apparently at that time recognising the value of Flybe to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-business-and-political-leaders-warn-of-severe-impact-on-regional-economies\">regional economy of the UK</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout, pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have done their jobs brilliantly, while behind the scenes the owners and, sadly, government connived to walk away. Flybe staff will feel disgusted at this betrayal and these broken promises.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB union warned that up to 1,700 further job losses at airports and in the supply chain could follow. It claimed eight regional airports could close, where more than half of the routes were filled by Flybe.</p> <p>Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the loss of Flybe would cause \u201creal anxiety\u201d throughout the country.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grantshapps/status/1235404194842017792?s=20\">tweeted</a> that the government was \u201curgently working\u201d with the airline industry to \u201cidentify how key routes can be re-established by other airlines as soon as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Some Flybe services will be taken over by the Scottish regional airline Loganair, which said it would add almost 400 flights a week on 16 routes.</p> <p>Belfast City airport said it was in talks with multiple airlines to fill the routes. Its chief executive, Brian Ambrose, insisted there was no threat to the future of the airport despite two-thirds of its passengers using Flybe, although he said there was a \u201csignificant hole\u201d.</p> <p>Job losses are likely to hit hardest in the south-west, where Flybe was based.

      "bodyText": "The government has defended its role in Flybe\u2019s collapse, as business groups, trade unions and passengers around the country voiced dismay at the loss of the UK\u2019s biggest regional airline. Flybe went into administration in the early hours of Thursday morning, with the loss of 2,400 jobs, less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal, having promised to \u201clevel up\u201d Britain by investing in transport links. The impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based Flybe, which had operated almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial \u00a3100m loan. Flybe was the fourth UK airline to go bust in a little over two years, following just months after the demise of travel group Thomas Cook. While cabinet ministers raced to announce they had saved Flybe in January, when the airline flirted with bankruptcy, it was left to the transport minister Kelly Tolhurst to defend the government\u2019s actions in the Commons on Thursday. She said the government had been working \u201ctirelessly\u201d with Flybe\u2019s owners Connect Airways \u2013 a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and the hedge fund Cyrus Capital \u2013 since then. Existing problems had been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak which had a \u201csignificant impact on demand\u201d, Tolhurst said. \u201cThe directors, therefore, decided it was not viable to keep Flybe operating.\u201d She added: \u201cUnfortunately, in a competitive market, companies do fail, and it is not the role of government to prop them up.\u201d The Department for Transport said it would bring forward \u201crecommendations to help ensure that the whole of the UK has the connections in place that people rely on\u201d. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said the consortium had invested more than \u00a3135m to keep the airline flying for an extra year, adding: \u201cSadly, despite the efforts of all involved to turn the airline around, not least the people of Flybe, the impact of Covid-19 on Flybe\u2019s trading means that the consortium can no longer commit to continued financial support.\u201d However, unions hit out at both the government and the owners of the airline, which was one of the leading carriers at airports including Belfast, Southampton, Manchester, Cardiff and Birmingham, carrying around 8 million people a year. It flies to 56 destinations across Europe, including 26 in the UK and Ireland. The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cSix weeks ago, when the ownership consortium lost confidence, the government promised a rescue package, apparently at that time recognising the value of Flybe to the regional economy of the UK. \u201cThroughout, pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have done their jobs brilliantly, while behind the scenes the owners and, sadly, government connived to walk away. Flybe staff will feel disgusted at this betrayal and these broken promises.\u201d The GMB union warned that up to 1,700 further job losses at airports and in the supply chain could follow. It claimed eight regional airports could close, where more than half of the routes were filled by Flybe. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the loss of Flybe would cause \u201creal anxiety\u201d throughout the country. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, tweeted that the government was \u201curgently working\u201d with the airline industry to \u201cidentify how key routes can be re-established by other airlines as soon as possible\u201d. Some Flybe services will be taken over by the Scottish regional airline Loganair, which said it would add almost 400 flights a week on 16 routes. Belfast City airport said it was in talks with multiple airlines to fill the routes. Its chief executive, Brian Ambrose, insisted there was no threat to the future of the airport despite two-thirds of its passengers using Flybe, although he said there was a \u201csignificant hole\u201d. Job losses are likely to hit hardest in the south-west, where Flybe was based. Among the former crew was Katherine Densham, who had been due to work on a flight from Exeter to London on Thursday. She said she had worked for the airline for 13 years straight from college, and had heard in the early hours. She said: \u201cI feel really sad. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do now. I heard in the early hours of the morning. I thought we\u2019d be saved. I\u2019ve no idea what I\u2019ll do next \u2013 try and find some work to pay the bills.\u201d Flybe also linked Newquay in Cornwall to London under a state-subsidised flight, which another carrier is likely to take on. Kim Conchie, chief executive of Cornwall chamber of commerce, described the collapse as a \u201chuge blow\u201d to businesses in the area. A review of regional connectivity was promised in January as part of the rescue deal, along with possible reform of air passenger duty, which could have come as early as next week\u2019s budget. Flybe had long argued that its tax burden was effectively doubled as APD is paid on takeoff from UK airports, and thus applies to both legs of domestic return flights. However, talks over a possible \u00a3100m loan from the government \u2013 a key part of the January package \u2013 ran into problems. Other airlines, led by the British Airways owner, IAG, and Ryanair, objected about the prospect of state aid and threatened legal action.

Flybe\u2019s chief executive, Mark Anderson, said: \u201cThe UK has lost one of its greatest regional assets. Flybe has been a key part of the UK aviation industry for four decades, connecting regional communities, people and businesses across the entire nation.\u201d Flybe\u2019s administrator, the accountancy firm EY, referred to coronavirus in its statement as it flagged \u201cadded pressures\u201d on the travel industry in the past few weeks that made its precarious financial situation worse. The airline had long struggled to balance the books, despite cost-cutting plans and redundancies, and was reporting losses of about \u00a320m a year before the Connect takeover in early 2019. The impact of Brexit included lower demand and rising costs due to the decline of the pound, with airlines purchasing fuel in dollars. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced around 3.30am on Thursday that Flybe had entered administration and that all flights were cancelled. It said it would not be operating a repatriation programme for any stranded customers in Europe, and said passengers should make their own alternative travel arrangements via other airlines, rail or coach operators.

      "bodyText": "Opec is on the verge of making its deepest oil production cuts since the global financial crisis amid warnings that the coronavirus may wipe out the world\u2019s oil demand growth this year. The world\u2019s largest oil-producing nations plan to avert an oil market crash by cutting millions of barrels from their daily production, but traders fear the economic impact of Covid-19 could still drive global market prices to multi-year lows. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel, which is holding crunch talks in Vienna this week, put forward proposals for the deepest oil production cuts since the global financial crisis after warning that the virus could halve the world\u2019s forecasts for oil demand growth over the first half of this year. The 14-strong group, led by Saudi Arabia, plans to deepen its existing production cuts by a further 1.5m barrels a day from next month, effectively holding back 3.6% of global oil supplies from the market to keep prices from collapsing. The benchmark oil price reached almost $69 a barrel in January, before the coronavirus outbreak, before plummeting to one-year lows around $50 a barrel last week. Opec will put the plans to its allies in the Opec+ group, led by Russia, in a separate meeting on Friday in the hope they will agree to make up one-third of the planned cuts which are due to begin next month. Major commodity traders have warned that Opec\u2019s measures might not go far enough, even with the support of Russia, because the impact of the coronavirus could cause oil demand to flatline in 2020 for the first time since 2008. US investment giant Goldman Sachs said Opec\u2019s plans are too little too late to save oil prices from falling back to lows not seen in over three years. The bank expects oil prices to fall to $45 a barrel next month, the lowest price since late 2016.

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog is considering asking the government to regulate prices of hand sanitiser and other protective kit relating to the coronavirus amid concern that businesses and individuals are cashing in on fears of shortages. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was monitoring reports of price rises and other changes in sales practices during the outbreak and wanted to \u201censure that traders do not exploit the current situation to take advantage of people\u201d. The regulator said it would take \u201cdirect enforcement action\u201d against any companies that had broken competition or consumer protection law by, for example, \u201ccharging excessive prices or making misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment\u201d. In the past the CMA has taken similar action against misleading tactics by hotel booking sites. It is also assessing whether to advise the government to consider taking direct action to regulate prices. The CMA\u2019s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: \u201cWe urge retailers to behave responsibly throughout the coronavirus outbreak and not to make misleading claims or charge vastly inflated prices. We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces.\u201d With some products, particularly hand sanitiser and other anti-bacterial products, sold out or being rationed in some stores, shoppers have turned to online retailers. Last week Amazon admitted it was struggling to prevent profiteering as \u201cbad actors\u201d attempt to cash in on coronavirus fears by raising prices of masks and sanitisers by as much as 2,000%. The US company said it had removed \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of listings. Other websites including eBay, Walmart and Etsy have also struggled to limit profiteering by sellers. Analysts have likened the situation to a game of whack-a-mole, with products reappearing soon after deletion. The CMA\u2019s chairman, Lord Tyrie, said: \u201cWe will do whatever we can to act against rip-offs and misleading claims, using any or all of our tools; and where we can\u2019t act, we\u2019ll advise government on further steps they could take, if necessary.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe UK is highly exposed to global activity (which we expect to contract in the first quarter), tourism exports are significant and the virus is spreading steadily within the UK,\u201d Goldman\u2019s note said.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, analysts at Deutsche Bank have halved their UK growth forecast for this year to only 0.5%, a post-financial crisis low, because of the outbreak and said the Bank of England could respond with two interest rate cuts of 0.25 percentage points by May, from their current level of 0.75%.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our latest news story on the crisis: One tiny comfort - the Dow didn\u2019t lose a thousand points today. But it came close! It just closed down 970 points, or over 3.5%, as this week\u2019s highly volatile trading continues. Ouch. Again. Here\u2019s a catch-up on coronavirus, as the global infection total heads towards 100,000: Stocks are sliding as more cases are reported in the US, with the death toll now at least 11. Traders aren\u2019t cheered by the news that the US Senate has approved $8.3bn in new funding for America to tackle the expanding coronavirus outbreak; the legislation has gone to Donald Trump for his signature. Here\u2019s we go again (again). With a hour\u2019s trading left, the Dow is on track for another hefty loss. It\u2019s currently trading at 26,055 points, down 1,035 or 3.82%. That means pretty much all Wednesday\u2019s rally has been swept away. After another busy day.... here\u2019s our latest news story on the collapse of Flybe, by Gwyn Topham: The government has defended its role in Flybe\u2019s collapse, as business groups, trade unions and passengers around the country voiced dismay at the loss of the UK\u2019s biggest regional airline. Flybe went into administration in the early hours of Thursday morning, with the loss of 2,400 jobs, less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal, having promised to \u201clevel up\u201d Britain by investing in transport links. The impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based Flybe, which had operated almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial \u00a3100m loan. Flybe was the fourth UK airline to go bust in a little over two years, following just months after the demise of travel group Thomas Cook. While cabinet ministers raced to announce they had saved Flybe in January, when the airline flirted with bankruptcy, it was left to the transport minister Kelly Tolhurst to defend the government\u2019s actions in the Commons on Thursday. She said the government had been working \u201ctirelessly\u201d with Flybe\u2019s owners Connect Airways \u2013 a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and the hedge fund Cyrus Capital \u2013 since then. Existing problems had been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak which had a \u201csignificant impact on demand\u201d, Tolhurst said. \u201cThe directors, therefore, decided it was not viable to keep Flybe operating.\u201d More here: The coronavirus crisis has forced Starbucks to stop customers bringing in their own cups. The coffee chain is \u201ctemporarily suspending\u201d the programme, which gives a small discount to encourage people to be environmentally friendly. Apparently you\u2019ll still get the discount if you arrive with your own receptacle - but you\u2019ll get the drink in a new plastic cup. The coronavirus outbreak has also struck commodity pricing agency S&amp;P Global Platts, forcing staff to be sent home. Reuters has the story: S&amp;P Global Platts told employees at its Canary Wharf office in London to work from home until further notice after a visitor was diagnosed with the coronavirus, the company said. \u201cPlatts has a robust business continuity plan to ensure there are no disruptions to our MOC (market-on-close) price assessment process and the essential commodity market intelligence our customers rely on across news and analytics,\u201d a company statement said. Platts said about 1,200 employees work in that office. Britain has so far registered 115 cases and reported its first death from the coronavirus on Thursday. There are also some anecdotal signs that fewer financial workers are heading into the City right now -- perhaps because banks are experimenting with home working? Business figures and politicians around the UK have warned that Flybe\u2019s collapse could lead to severe consequences for regional economies following the loss of key air transport links. My colleagues Steven Morris and Joanna Partridge report: Exeter-based Flybe operates nearly 40% of the country\u2019s domestic flights and there were fears over the impact of its collapse from around the country. In the south-west, Flybe\u2019s failure was met with alarm that there could be substantial ripple effects financially. \u201cA huge pack of cards has just fallen over,\u201d said Tim Jones, chairman of the South West Business Council. Jones said that if the services the airport provided were not replaced quickly \u2013 and lost jobs restored as well \u2013 the result could be losses of up to \u00a3600m a year to the regional economy. Exeter airport \u2013 where all but one of the scheduled departures on Thursday was supposed to be a Flybe service \u2013 is an important hub not just for holidaymakers but for business people who use it to hop to London and other major cities in the UK and Europe. It is also used by people flying in from other parts of the UK to work on infrastructure projects for a week at a time, such as the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant site on the Somerset coast. Back on Wall Street, the sell-off is gathering more momentum. The Dow is now down 3.7%, or 1,010 points at 26,080. Before this crisis began, a 1,000-point move was very rare -- occurring only three times before. We\u2019ve now seen four in the last fortnight (two up, two down), and could be on track for a 5th. Volatility, of course, is up: Outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pledged that global policymakers will deliver a \u201cpowerful and timely\u201d response to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus. Speaking in London tonight, Carney tries to calm market concerns, saying the Bank is in talks with the UK Treasury (finance ministry) to plan its response. Carney declared: The Bank will take all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system, consistent with our statutory responsibilities. Our policy arsenal includes monetary policy instruments, special liquidity facilities, and macroprudential tools. We are also coordinating with HM Treasury to ensure that any initiatives are complementary and that they will collectively have maximum impact, consistent with our independent responsibilities. And lines of communication are wide open with our international colleagues at the G7, G20 and the IMF. While there will be differences in the exact timing and form, the collective impact of our efforts will be both powerful and timely. This is Carney\u2019s last (scheduled) public speech before his departure. It\u2019s got a suitably grand title-- The Grand Unifying Theory (and practice) of Macroprudential Policy -- and tries to explain how central bankers can ensure the financial system supports the economy. An important issue at this time in particular -- with Carney pointing out that financial crises occur roughly once a decade: The Italian government has doubles its stimulus programme to protect its economy from the coronavirus. Ministers have announced that the plan now totals \u20ac7.5bn, up from \u20ac3.6bn. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte says the money will be available to help \u201cfamilies and businesses tackle this emergency which is not just a health one but also an economic one\u201d. The boost comes as Italy shuts all its schools for several weeks, as my colleague Lorenzo Tondo explains: Italy has been grappling to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus, which so far has claimed 107 lives. On Thursday, Rome revealed that is evaluating the possibility of providing support to families, including reimbursements for babysitter costs and unpaid leaves of absence from work. \u201cWe should not assume that people are home using up holiday pay or paid leave,\u201d Elena Bonetti, minister of family affairs, told Radio Capital. The collapse of Flybe today will be felt the most severely in outlying regions, where domestic flights are crucial lifeline for those travelling for work, writes my colleague Jessica Murray. Down in Cornwall, one 52-year-old who travels frequently to London and further afield for meetings, said losing the Flybe service would have a major impact. With four Flybe flights a day to Heathrow, it was possible to get to London and back in a day. \u201cWith the collapse of Flybe and no sign of a viable alternative I will have to start travelling the previous day and stay over in London.\u201d Meanwhile, David Eyes commutes to Edinburgh from Manchester every week, flying up on Monday morning and returning on Wednesday evening. He has booked his flights with Flybe up until the end of March, and still has no guarantees about whether he will be refunded. Eyes, a consultant in financial services, said: \u201cFlybe is central to commuters all over the country to get from region to region. I\u2019m amazed the government hasn\u2019t stepped in and done something. It will impact the country\u2019s economy and people getting around.\u201d Holidaymakers have also been affected, with one unlucky hen party seeing their flights cancelled for a second time, after originally booking through Thomas Cook last year. Hannah, 27, is organising a trip to Disneyland at the end of March for her friend\u2019s hen do, and after having to deal with cancelled flights twice, the party of 10 have now spent nearly \u00a32,000 on Eurostar tickets to get to Paris. Hannah says: \u201cFor two airlines we\u2019re using to go into administration in the space of six months, it just feels like sod\u2019s law. Now the group are keeping their fingers crossed that the Disneyland resort remains open as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout Europe. US hypermarket giant Walmart is restricting staff from travelling to conferences, trade shows and other events. It is also restricting cross-border international travel to \u201cbusiness-critical trips\u201d only (and they\u2019ll require high-level approval), while domestic travel is only allowed if it\u2019s essential. Even group meetings are being cut back, Marketwatch reports, with Walmart telling staff: \u201cLet\u2019s use video conferencing or call in rather than travel.\u201d European stock markets have closed in the red, hit by coronavirus gloom. ITV was the top faller in London, down 12% after warning that advertising revenue would fall 10% in April due to a plunge in travel adverts. Cruise company Carnival and holiday firm TUI both tumbled 7.2%, with traders expecting much less demand for its services until Covid-19 is under control. British Airway\u2019s parent company, IAG, fell 5.3% after Flybe\u2019s collapse showed the crisis facing airlines. IATA\u2019s warning that a fifth of global revenues could be wiped out this year also drove its shares down. Here\u2019s the damage. FTSE 100: down 110 points or 1.6% at 6705 German DAX: down 182 points or 1.5% at 11,944 French CAC: down 103 points or 1.9% at 5,361 This leave the EU-wide Stoxx 600 slightly up on the week, but still 11% less than two weeks ago. The steady increases in cases in Europe, the UK (now 115) and the US are alarming investors, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Health fears have ramped up again and traders are running for the hills. Even though governments along with international bodies have pledged huge sums of money to help combat the health crisis, dealers are still scared. It is as if the more money is thrown at the problem, the more nervous dealers become - the intervention acts as an indication of weakness. Getting back to Flybe\u2019s collapse... there are concerns about the security of the airline staff\u2019s pensions. This is because the firm\u2019s scheme, the British Regional Airlines Group (BRAG) pension scheme, is registered in the Isle of Man. That means it is not protected by the UK\u2019s pension lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), following the airline\u2019s collapse this morning (5 March). A PPF spokesperson told Pensions Age: \u201cWe understand this must be a worrying time for Flybe employees and pension scheme members. \u201cThe Flybe pension scheme is based in the Isle of Man under the jurisdiction of their government, which is separate from the UK government, meaning the scheme is not protected by the PPF.\u201d According to Pensions Age, the scheme has liabilities of \u00a3170m across 1,350 members, with an overall deficit of \u00a311.6m as of November 2018. A ray of sunshine for British manufacturing amid coronavirus disruption: digger manufacturer JCB has ended short-time working at its UK factories, reverting back to a full working week. JCB had cut back hours for about 4,000 employees in mid-February as it struggled to source parts. They moved to a 34-hour working week, banking the extra hours to be worked later while not having their pay cut. However, those pressures had eased as the outbreak slowed in China, although the disease\u2019s spread elsewhere could also affect it, JCB said. Graeme Macdonald, JCB\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis is not a moment for celebration, but it is a step in the right direction. There has been some improvement in the shipment of components from China but new threats are emerging from our supply chain in other parts of the world, notably Italy and South Korea. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation very closely on a daily basis and take any necessary measures to protect the business.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s tumble is quite a contrast with China, where the main stock index hit a two-year high today. The CSI 300 jumped 2.2% today, meaning it has more than recovered its slump after the Lunar New Year. Traders are encouraged by signs that Chinese factories are getting back to work, and by falls in the number of new Covid-19 cases. Beijing\u2019s efforts to stimulate its economy through cheap loans for banks, tax cuts, and loan relief, are all helping too. More and more companies are asking staff to work from home, or reining in their travel plans. In the US, Amazon and Facebook are encouraging their employees in Seattle to stay home after workers for each company tested positive for Covid-19. CNN explains: Amazon revealed earlier this week that one of its Seattle-based employees has been diagnosed with the virus. On Wednesday, Facebook said a contractor who works at one of its offices in Seattle had tested positive. The market turmoil has provided one benefit for Americans - mortgages rates are now their lowest ever. Associated Press explains: The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has hit a record low of 3.29%, driven down by investors shifting money into the safety of U.S. Treasurys as the viral outbreak deepens. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on the benchmark 30-year loan this week tumbled from 3.45% last week. The new rate is the lowest level since Freddie Mac started tracking it in 1971, the company says. Capital Economics have had a stab at estimating the impact of coronavirus on the US economy. They freely admit it\u2019s a \u201cfinger in the air\u201d exercise, as we simply don\u2019t know how far the virus will spread. And they\u2019ve come up with two scenarios - one rather more alarming than the other. Their current working assumption is still that the number of coronavirus cases in the US is restricted to the low tens of thousands (out of 325m people), and drops off by the summer. That would only knock 0.2% off US growth this year. But....in a worse-case scenario that resembles past pandemics, up to one-third of the population could eventually become infected, with the disruption lasting for closer to 12 month. And in that severe scenario, they estimate that GDP would fall by 3.0% over that year -- a painful downturn. The resulting recession would prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to near-zero again and we would expect a major fiscal stimulus too. Today\u2019s selloff means the Dow Jones industrial average is 9% below its levels on 21 February, before the coronavirus selloff began. It\u2019s still up on the week, following surges on Monday and Wednesday. Those gains appeared to be driven by hopes of stimulus moves, and relief that Joe Biden did so well on Super Tuesday (he\u2019s less of a threat to Wall Street than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren). Shares in major cruise operators are also sliding: Every member of the Dow is falling. Financial stocks are being hit by the prospect of a fall in US growth, with American Express down 4%, JP Morgan losing 3.8% and Goldman down 3.1%. Boeing has lost 3.45%, as a slump in airline revenues is going to hurt demand for new planes. Consumer-focused companies are also being hit. Nike are down 3.1%; it would suffer from a drop in retail spending. Media company Walt Disney has lost 3.3% Newsflash: Stocks are tumbling on Wall Street at the start of trading, as fears of a global recession sweep the markets again. Another very nervy session has begun with a wave of sell-orders. This has driven the Dow Jones industrial average down by 709 points, or over 2.6%, to 26,381. That\u2019s wipes out two-thirds of yesterday\u2019s rally, and sends New York stocks back towards the lows seen last week. The S&amp;P 500 is taking a buffeting too, down 71 points or 2.2% at 3,058. Airline stocks are leading the selloff, following IATA\u2019s grim warning that the coronavirus could knock $113bn of global revenues this year. Some Flybe customers should be able to recover the cost of cancelled flights -- but they\u2019ll still be hit in the pocket. My colleague Miles Brignall explains your rights: Those who bought a tour package should get a full refund, or the offer to reschedule the trip to a later date. However, many passengers will have been left holding expensive onwards flights, hotel, and other holiday bookings that they will not be able to cancel. In many cases they have lost their money. Onward flights booked with a second airline, will likely go ahead, and as a result the second airline is under no obligation to refund you. Passengers booked onto a flight that has been cancelled by the airline because it no longer wishes to operate the flight, are entitled to a full refund, but will struggle to recoup their \u201cconsequential\u201d losses Cinema operator Cineworld has also been hit by the coronavirus crisis. Shares in Cineworld have slumped by 17% so far today, to a near seven-year low, as the Covid-19 virus threatens to keep people out of its seats. The delay of the next James Bond film, from April to November, is clearly a major blow to Cineworld, as my colleague Benjamin Lee explains: No Time to Die will now face competition from the Disney animation Raya and the Last Dragon, Godzilla vs Kong and King Richard, a drama starring Will Smith as the father of Venus and Serena Williams. The move comes after fears that the coronavirus could impact the global box office by as much as $5bn. There have been cinema closures in Italy, South Korea, China and Japan. Just in. Britain\u2019s train operators have agreed to provide free travel to Flybe staff and customers who are unable to travel over the next week (as the Caledonian Sleeper also pledged earlier). Robert Nisbet, Director of Nations and Regions at the Rail Delivery Group, on behalf of train operators, says: \u201dWe know how distressing the news about Flybe is for their staff and customers which is why train operators have arranged free travel to help them get to their destinations.\u201d The threat of a global recession has forced the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree the deepest oil production cuts since the global financial crisis in 2008. The oil cartel said Covid-19 could halve the world\u2019s expected oil demand growth for the first half of this year. In response it plans to deepen its existing production cuts of 2.1 million barrels of oil a day by another 1.5 million barrels, or 3.6% of global oil supplies, from next month. Opec will take responsibility for cutting 1 million barrels of oil a day, and expects its allies in the Opec+ group, led by Russia, to cut the remaining 500,000 barrels from their combined oil production. Opec+ is expected to give its verdict on the plan tomorrow. The proposed cuts are the deepest since Opec agreed to hold back around 4.2 million barrels of oil a day during the global financial crisis. Jeff Currie, Goldman Sachs\u2019 head of global commodities research, told Bloomberg that the plans might be too little too late to prop up oil prices \u201cI think the damage is done. \u201cCutting production by 1.5m barrels a day in April or May is not going to not really going to save you in the current environment. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s too little too late.\u201d Overnight rail service Caledonian Sleeper is rather decently offering free travel for the next week to Flybe customers stranded by its collapse. They can secure a seat on either the Lowlander route (which runs from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London), or the Highlander (which links Aberdeen, Fort William, Inverness and London). Ryan Flaherty, Serco\u2019s Managing Director for Caledonian Sleeper, says: \u201cThe news about Flybe entering administration is extremely sad and we\u2019re aware that many passengers and crew will be struggling to get home. It\u2019s best to phone their Guest Service Centre [0330 060 0500], rather than just turning up at the station. The Sleeper\u2019s not as fast as flying -- although much better for the environment -- and the service has been hit by teething problems. The \u2018hotel on wheels\u2019 relaunch last April was something of a disaster, with delays, booking errors, a water leak, and problems serving food to customers. But on the upside, the Guardian\u2019s Gwyn Topham was accidentally served three \u2018delicious\u2019 game pies.... HSBC has confirmed that an employee has tested positive for the coronavirus, and that around 100 colleagues from its research department have been sent home while the office is deep-cleaned. A spokesperson says: We have been informed that one of our employees at 8 Canada Square has been diagnosed with COVID-19. This colleague is under medical supervision and has self-isolated. We are working closely with the health authorities. We are deep-cleaning the floor where our colleague worked and shared areas of the building. Colleagues on that floor, and others who came into contact with him, have been advised to work at home. Based on medical and official advice the building remains open and operates as normal. Our first priority and concern is the health of our employees and customers \u2013 and we are encouraging our colleagues to monitor their health carefully and stay at home or call a doctor if they feel unwell.\u201d Back at the British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting today, health secretary Matt Hancock said he was working with the Department for Work and Pensions on a way to extend sickness benefit to all workers. That could including contract workers and the self employed, my colleague Phillip Inman reports. Asked about the issue, Hancock said. \u201cIt is vital that the same approach applies to all workers,\u201d But the situation was not an easy one to resolve and talks were ongoing he added. Yesterday, prime minister Boris Johnson said sick pay would be paid from day one -- but that won\u2019t benefit the self-employed, gig economy workers, or some on low pay. Earlier, the CBI said the government should extend Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) to all workers (e.g. agency staff and others on flexible or zero-hours contracts) who self-isolate themselves in accordance with public health guidance. Among its demands were: Clarifying in law that being unable to work because you\u2019re self-isolating to comply with public health guidance - even if you are otherwise healthy - entitles a worker to statutory sick pay Clarifying that workers who are following public health advice on Coronavirus are entitled to SSP even if they don\u2019t have a GP\u2019s \u2018fit note\u2019 Removing the need to earn over \u00a3118 a week to qualify for SSP, which is unfair to part-time employees. The Government proposed this in a 2019 consultation - which the CBI supported - and these plans should now accelerate Introducing emergency relief for business \u2013 especially small businesses \u2013 if the total cost of sick pay becomes unsustainable. Small businesses may be particularly susceptible to cash-flow problems meaning that prompt reimbursement will be key to their ability to continue supporting staff. The Advertising Standards Authority has also also been clamping down on \u201calarmist\u201d and \u201cscaremongering\u201d marketing for face masks, which could exploit people\u2019s fears over the coronavirus outbreak. Our science editor Ian Sample explained yesterday: In rulings published on Wednesday, the regulator found that online ads from two companies breached its code and were misleading, irresponsible and \u201clikely to cause fear without reasonable justification\u201d. One advertiser, Novads OU, based in Tallinn, Estonia, ran display ads and webpages for an Oxybreath Pro face mask, which highlighted the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak and referred to a \u201cgrowing sense of panic\u201d before touting the mask\u2019s \u201cunparallelled [sic] protection.\u201d Here\u2019s an example of why the CMA are clamping down on coronavirus-related products: Just in: Britain\u2019s competitions watchdog has warned retailers not to hike prices, or make misleading claims, to exploit customers during the coronavirus outbreak. The Competition and Markets Authority says companies who charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment may be breaking the law. We will take \u201cdirect enforcement action\u201d where necessary, the CMA adds menacingly, as it tries to prevent price-gouging, with many healthcare and cleaning products in short supply. The CMA is also assessing whether it should advise Government to consider taking direct action to regulate prices. CMA Chairman Lord Tyrie says anyone trying to rip off customers should stop: \u201cWe will do whatever we can to act against rip-offs and misleading claims, using any or all of our tools; and where we can\u2019t act, we\u2019ll advise government on further steps they could take, if necessary.\u201d The warning also applies to online shopping -- including anyone offering, say, hand sanitisers or face masks on Amazon (where prices of some items have soared several hundred percent). CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli explains: \u201cWe urge retailers to behave responsibly throughout the coronavirus outbreak and not to make misleading claims or charge vastly inflated prices. We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about HSBC\u2019s Covid-19 infection: Business leaders then quizzed Matt Hancock about the government\u2019s plans to protect the economy from the coronavirus. One pointed out that venues, such as Newmarket racecourse, will suffer -- how will restaurants, for example, recover lost business? After all.... There\u2019s nothing so valueless as a ticket to yesterday\u2019s race. The health secretary replies that protecting the economy is a \u201cvery important consideration\u201d, although the top priority is to keep people safe. There are a \u201crange of options\u201d to support businesses and supply chains if needed. Hancock insists the government is following the advice from scientists,. The UK didn\u2019t ban flights from China because the experts said it would not be effective. The only country that ignored that advice was Italy, Hancock says pointedly. So on large events, the current scientific advice is that there is no material, epidemiological benefit to cancelling events, as long as people obey the medical advice to wash hands, and catch a sneeze in a tissue. And ultimately, Hancock adds: We are a herd. You can\u2019t get away from the fact that we as a community, as a country, and indeed globally, we are all we are affected by this virus because others are affected. UK health secretary Matt Hancock is speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce\u2019s annual meeting in London now. Hancock tells the assembled business people that the weeks ahead will be tough, as there is unlikely to be a vaccine available in the next few months. He explains the government has been trying to contain Covid-19, by detecting people infected and tracking down those they have spent time with. But it may not be able to contain the virus forever, especially if cases continue to rise in Europe. When that happens, Britain will move to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of its plans. There are now 85 confirmed cases in the UK, so shutting down all the schools and universities would not bring clinical benefits but would have major social and economic costs, Hancock adds. Across the country, readers are evaluating the impact Flybe\u2019s collapse will have on regional travel, both for work or to visit family, my colleague Jessica Murray reports. Mike Green, 29, was due to fly from Aberdeen with Flybe this morning and is now facing a six-and-a-half hour train journey back to Manchester. Green, a manager at an oil and gas company, regularly travels with the airline to more remote areas of the UK including Aberdeen, Inverness, south Wales and Southampton where FlyBe is the leading carrier. With the airline now gone, he doesn\u2019t know if this will be able to continue. Green says: \u201cTo be honest, I think the situation is going to be either that the travel doesn\u2019t happen, so we work out some other way around it, or there\u2019s going to be an expectation of traveling at the weekend because I know my employer is going to be fuming that six-and-a-half hours of my day today is going to be spent on a train,\u201d. \u201cI was supposed to fly into Manchester and go to a set of meetings, but that\u2019s not going to happen now.\u201d He added the decentralised nature of the oil and gas industry means communication could be tricky without the reliability of Flybe\u2019s service. \u201cThere\u2019s still a premium placed on face-to-face meetings as opposed to talking over the phone, so I spend a lot of time in airports and train stations.\u201d For Hayley Anderton, 46, in Leicester, Flybe\u2019s collapse means she may no longer be able to visit elderly father who lives in Shetland, or her father-in-law in Inverness, as often. She would fly from Birmingham up to Aberdeen or Inverness around four times a year to visit her relatives. \u201cI don\u2019t like taking short-haul flights but on a limited income and without a car it\u2019s been the only feasible option to get to northern Scotland,\u201d Anderton said. \u201cFlybe has been a lifeline service for keeping the UK connected, they\u2019ve been good to fly with, and I\u2019m really going to miss them.\u201d She is now looking at trains which are three times the cost of the previous flights and take much longer - a train from Birmingham to Inverness takes eight or nine hours. \u201cIt makes getting somewhere like Shetland from the Midlands a 24-hour journey. I guess it\u2019s the same for a lot of regional airports around the UK that people who relied on those flights are going to struggle perhaps for work and definitely for seeing family. Anderton added that she actually considered moving up to Inverness with her partner last year, but when Flybe first ran into trouble in January she reconsidered. \u201cOne of the things that made it attractive was that it was reasonably well-connected with the rest of the UK by Flybe.\u201d The incident at HSBC comes as City firms prepare to let more staff work from home. They already have contingency plans for an epidemic -- including splitting teams up so that everyone doesn\u2019t catch the virus at the same time. They\u2019re also getting ready for an explosion in remote working, although the Financial Times reports that there are concerns: While most banks have ample capacity for staff to access internal networks remotely, senior bank executives are concerned about broadband capacity at their employees\u2019 homes, which is not as fast as at the banks and could be slowed down even further if their children are also off school watching streaming services such as Netflix. HSBC has evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office after an employee was feared to have caught coronavirus. The bank has ordered a deep clean of the area, which houses its research department, a source said. It has so far not affected HSBC\u2019s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions.The evacuation was first reported by Financial News. Newsflash: Pioneering low-cost airline Southwest has just issued a warning about coronavirus. Southwest, which basically created the budget airline model in the early 1970s, says customers demand has declined. It fears the crisis will wipe $200m-$300m off its operating revenues this quarter. Aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst also told MPs that the government \u201cstands ready\u201d to support the regional airports that will be hit by Flybe\u2019s collapse. \u201cWe recognise the impact that this will have on UK airports particularly those which have large-scale Flybe operations. Government stands ready to support this sector.\u201d \u201cWe are urgently working with industry to identify opportunities to fill routes. Tolhurst does have one piece of good news - Scotland\u2019s Loganair has committed to keep 16 Flybe routes running. In parliament, transport minister Kelly Tolhurst is giving a statement on Flybe\u2019s collapse. She says the government has been working \u201ctirelessly\u201d with Flybe\u2019s owners since January (when the firm nearly collapsed). Ministers are reviewing Air Passenger Duty, to see how it can support the government\u2019s \u2018levelling up\u2019 agenda, Tolhurst adds. She explains that existing problems at Flybe have been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak, which had a \u201csignifiant impact on demand\u2019. As such, the directors decided it did not have a viable future. Tolhurst explains: Unfortunately, in a competitive market, companies do fail, and it is not the role of government to prop them up. Tolhurst says there is sufficient capacity on other airlines to bring Flybe passengers home, and is pleased to see some airlines such as easyJet are offering rescue fares Flybe passengers should not got to the airport, she continues - they should look at the Civil Aviation Authorities website instead. And she expresses \u201csincere sympathy to those who have lost their jobs\u201d, including cabin crew and ground staff. It is a worrying time for them and their families. Finally, Tolhurst reveals she will hold a meeting with the airline industry to discuss coronavirus\u2019s impact next week. European stock markets have fallen sharply this morning, as fears of a global downturn rise again. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by over 1.5%, wiping out Wednesday\u2019s recovery, as shares continue to whip-saw around. Investors appear to jumping between pessimism about a global recession, and optimism that policymakers will announce stimulus measures to avert it. Yesterday the Dow Jones industrial average surged by 4.5%, or 1173 points, but pessimism now has the upper hand: Financial data firm MSCI fear Wall Street could tumble by another 10% in the short term, warning: The global spread of coronavirus is already affecting global growth. We\u2019ve conducted a what-if scenario analysis that assumes a short-term drop in growth of 2 percentage points and a risk-premium increase of 2 percentage points. Our model indicates that, in such a scenario, there\u2019s room for further short-term losses: U.S. equities \u2014 already down 11% from Feb. 19 through March 3 \u2014 could drop a further 11%, while a hypothetical 60/40 global multi-asset-class portfolio could lose another 7%. In other travel news, the British Chambers of Commerce has called on the government should press ahead with Heathrow expansion. Speaking at the BCC\u2019s annual conference in London, director general Adam Marshall said a third runway should be a broad agenda of infrastructure spending. It must also pump more money into trade support \u201cto give a leg up to the many thousands of companies whose overseas efforts will make global Britain a reality,\u201d Marshall added. At Manchester Airport, Flybe customers are also coming to terms with the airline\u2019s collapse. Patrick Greenford, 77, retired, from Leeds, tells my colleague Gregory Robinson: I think it\u2019s very sad that it\u2019s gone bust and I feel very sorry for the people who were meant to be flying with them today. It\u2019s very sad for the people who don\u2019t have work anymore too. Margaret Shepherd (75) and Stuart Shepherd (69) from Bradford, had been planning to fly to Knock, on the west coast of Ireland, for Margaret\u2019s birthday. Now they\u2019ll have to fly to Dublin and hire a car instead. It\u2019s really sad especially after Thomas Cook, they say, pointing out that there isn\u2019t another airline which serves the UK\u2019s regional airports. Student Lauren Rose, 20, was flying home to Jersey - and says many people will miss Flybe. I use their services to take me to and from Jersey. I\u2019m used to flying from home to here in Manchester but I know there were a lot more locations they provided services which will probably affect so many people. Practically everyone I know back home has used them at some point. Niamh Kennedy, 66, a retired teacher from Manchester, adds: I\u2019ve never flown with FlyBe but my sister always used to. She always used to visit Knock in Ireland. I have no idea how she\u2019ll get there now... French contract worker Sebastien Cressent is also stranded at Birmingham Airport by Flybe\u2019s collapse. Cressent, who doesn\u2019t speak English, works at a local car plant. He returned his hire car to fly back home to Paris for a few days off and discovered what had happened. He\u2019s been told the 2pm flight to Paris is full, so he might need to go to Manchester to get an evening flight to the French capital. The 10 Flybe check-in desks at Birmingham airport are deserted, following the airline\u2019s collapse in the early hours of this morning, my colleague Joanna Partridge reports. Several people in hi-vis vests from the Civil Aviation Authority, a government surge response team and from the airport are on hand to help any passengers who have travelled to the airport, unaware of Flybe\u2019s demise. An airport spokesperson said as many as 30 passengers had arrived at the terminal during the morning, hoping to depart for a range of domestic destinations such as Belfast, Aberdeen, Isle of Man and Jersey, as well as continental Europe. Departure screens in the terminal listing the cancelled flights inform Flybe passengers to \u201cseek alternative arrangements\u201d. One of those disappointed was Carole Lewis, due to fly to Inverness to visit family. She\u2019d taken an early train to the airport from her home in Shrewsbury and hadn\u2019t heard the news. Lewis tells us: \u201cI\u2019ve never flown there before, I was quite looking forward to it,\u201d. She was hoping to be able to book a seat on a coach, but was expecting the journey to take a long time. An airport spokesperson said there have been \u201cvery positive discussions\u201d with other airlines interested in taking on some of Flybe\u2019s routes. Back outside Exeter Airport, Michelle Fegan, who sells pasties, sandwiches and snacks says she is devastated by Flybe\u2019s collapse. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge blow for Exeter. It\u2019s going to affect the whole city and the region. I feel so sorry for the staff.\u201d IATA are urging governments to help airlines \u2018stay afloat\u2019 - an admission that others could follow Flybe into administration. Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s director general, says: \u201cThe turn of events as a result of Covid-19 is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry\u2019s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. \u201cMany airlines are cutting capacity and taking emergency measures to reduce costs. Governments must take note. Airlines are doing their best to stay afloat as they perform the vital task of linking the world\u2019s economies. As governments look to stimulus measures, the airline industry will need consideration for relief on taxes, charges and slot allocation. These are extraordinary times.\u201d If IATA\u2019s worst-case scenario comes to pass, then the airline industry is going to be in serious trouble. Here\u2019s some reaction: NEWSFLASH: The global coronavirus outbreak could be as severe a blow to the airline industry as the global financial crisis a decade ago. That\u2019s according to IATA, which represents the airline industry. In a new report, it warns that Covid-19 is set to cost the airline industry at least $63bn of lost revenue -- or $113bn if the virus spreads \u2018extensively\u2019 across more countries. IATA had previously expected a $30bn hit -- but has dramatically raised its forecast as the crisis escalates. Its worst-case scenario now shows a fifth of revenues being wiped out, with heavy losses in Asia, Europe and the US. That would be a severe blow to the airline sector. In new analysis, IATA sees 2020 global revenue losses for the passenger business of between $63bn (in a scenario where COVID-19 is contained in current markets with over 100 cases as of 2 March) and $113bn (in a scenario with a broader spreading of COVID-19). IATA says the situation has deteriorated fast in the last fortnight. IATA\u2019s previous analysis (issued on 20 February 2020) put lost revenues at $29.3 billion based on a scenario that would see the impact of COVID-19 largely confined to markets associated with China. Since that time, the virus has spread to over 80 countries and forward bookings have been severely impacted on routes beyond China. Financial markets have reacted strongly. Airline share prices have fallen nearly 25% since the outbreak began, some 21 percentage points greater than the decline that occurred at a similar point during the SARS crisis of 2003. To a large extent, this fall already prices in a shock to industry revenues much greater than our previous analysis. IATA\u2019s \u201climited\u201d scenario is based on counties with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases (as of Monday) experiencing a sharp downturn followed by a V-shaped recovery profile. This would wipe out $63bn of revenues this year. IATA\u2019s \u201cextensive spread\u201d scenario uses a similar methodology but to all markets that currently have 10 or more confirmed COVID-19 cases. The outcome is a 19% loss in worldwide passenger revenues, which equates to $113bn. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has warned that the coronavirus will push the UK economy to the \u2018brink of recession\u2019. In a new research note, Goldman say Britain faces \u201ca substantial hit to growth in coming months. The UK is highly exposed to global activity (which we expect to contract in Q1), tourism exports are significant and the virus is spreading steadily within the UK. It now expects the UK economy will stagnate in January-March, and contract by 0.2% in April-June. Deutsche Bank are also anxious -- they\u2019ve halved their forecast for British economic growth this year to just 0.5% this morning. Other travel companies are stepping in to help Flybe customers who have been stranded. London North Eastern Railway (LNER) is offering free travel for stranded staff and customers on its East Coast line today. EasyJet is offering to fly customers home free today and tomorrow, or for a small fee until the end of May: John Cullen, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, says the coronavirus outbreak made a bad situation worse at Flybe: \u201cIt had been reported that Flybe only had sufficient financial resources to last until the end of this month, but the dip in seat sales due to the coronavirus has piled on additional pressure, forcing the company into insolvency with the loss of over 2,000 jobs. \u201cLast month it seemed that the loss-making airline might be successful in securing a state loan, due to its important role in facilitating regional connectivity. However, the terms of the loan could not be agreed. \u201cIt is clear that this Government has no intention of being free and easy with taxpayers\u2019 money. Its prospective loan to Flybe had always carried significant risk, but the coronavirus situation has made matters worse.\u201d Michael Mulligan, insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, fears more companies will follow: \u201cFlybe\u2019s collapse is the fourth significant UK airline failure since 2017. Whilst the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was only partly to blame for its collapse, it is clear that the industry is going to take a savage hit in the coming weeks and months. The end of the line for another troubled European operator, Alitalia, is rumoured. \u201cIt is still early days, but the unprecedented impact of Coronavirus is already causing massive challenges to people, business and supply chains. The virus could be the tipping point for those businesses already facing financial difficulties or with tight margins. James Goodall, Transport &amp; Leisure analyst at Redburn, agrees: \u201cFlybe\u2019s failure this morning will likely be the first of many in 2020. The company was already in financial strain before any impact from coronavirus. That being said, we expect that the demand destruction caused by Covid-19 accelerated its demise and we believe further airline bankruptcies should be expected in the coming months. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, whose constituency contains Exeter Airport, has blamed the government for not reforming Air Passenger Duty in time to help Flybe: Flybe had hoped to persuade the government to halve APD (\u00a326 per passenger) on domestic flights in next week\u2019s budget. They\u2019d been promised a review, but clearly this wasn\u2019t enough... The FT explains: Flybe became increasingly concerned that any cuts to APD might not kick in until 2021, which would be too late. These are the routes which will be lost now Flybe has collapsed: Some of these places will have been hoping to benefit from the UK government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda... so this is a blow to them too. Other Flybe staff, such as pilot Sarah Nicol, are also coming to terms with the airline\u2019s collapse: The coronavirus crisis means it\u2019s a really difficult time to be finding a new job -- several airlines are putting staff on leave. But her uncle, former Scotland rugby union player Andy Nicol, is doing his bit: Katherine Densham, who had worked for Flybe for 13 years as cabin crew, heard in the early hours that the company had collapsed. She was due to fly from Exeter to London City and came to the airport \u2013 in her uniform \u2013 to check what was happening. She broke down in tears and said: \u201cI feel really sad. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do now. I heard in the early hours of the morning. I thought we\u2019d be saved. I\u2019ve no idea what I\u2019ll do next \u2013 try and find some work to pay the bills.\u201d A few passengers arrived at Exeter airport this morning, having not got the message not to turn up \u2013 or simply not knowing what else to do. Among them was a man who was hoping to fly to Paris for a birthday party. Disappointed, he turned around and went home. Three young women, Abbey Fletcher, Jessica Canha and Robyn Kent, who work for a recruitment company and have been training in Bristol, were trying to get home to Jersey. Fletcher said: \u201cWe heard last night that flights might be cancelled but we just got up at 4.30am and turned up anyway. We didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d They were among the fortunate ones. The airline Blue Islands has stepped in to put on a free flight to the Channel Islands this afternoon. Canha tells us: \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for that and take a nap in the meantime,\u201d Only one other flight is expected into Exeter today \u2013 a plane that left for Lanzarote this morning and is due back this afternoon. Flybe\u2019s collapse could cost 1,400 jobs at companies which worked with the airline, as well as the 2,000+ staff directly employed, says the GMB union. Nadine Houghton, GMB National Officer says in a statement: \u201cThe collapse of Flybe is a tragedy for the company\u2019s loyal workforce. \u201cA domino effect now puts 1,400 jobs in the wider supply chain at immediate risk and threatens the future of vital regional airports. \u201cThe last thing regions crying out for investment need is to see infrastructure that maintains good jobs ripped away. \u201cWe need the Government to urgently step in and save jobs wherever possible. The damage to already fragile local economies must be minimised.\u201d Newsflash: John Lewis\u2019s staff are getting the smallest annual bonus since 1953, as the retailer reports a 23% slump in underlying profits for last year. Its staff, or partners, will get just 2% of their basic pay -- down from 3% last year . New chair Sharon White has warned that \u201cthese are the most challenging but exciting times in retail for a generation\u201d... More here. ITV is forecasting a slump of at least 10% in advertising revenues in April as companies in the travel sector pull spend in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus. ITV\u2019s acts as a bellwether for the wider UK TV ad market and its plummeting forecast paints a grim picture for other broadcasters. The company is already feeling the impact of the spread of the virus, with total advertising revenue in the first quarter growing significantly slower than analysts forecast. ITV said total advertising revenue is set to grow 2% in the first quarter. Analysts at Citi had expected growth of 3.3%, indicating a significant pull back by advertisers as the crisis has gathered pace. Announcing its full year results on Thursday, ITV says: \u201cIn March and April, we have seen an impact from travel advertising deferments relating to the coronavirus, \u201cEarly indications suggest total advertising revenue will be down 10% in April.\u201d Flybe certainly isn\u2019t alone. Saga, the insurance and travel company for the over-50s, said this morning that it had seen an increase in holiday cancellations and a sharp drop in bookings in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Passenger bookings at its tour operations had been down 20% from a year earlier, but have slumped even more in recent weeks, it told shareholders. There are a range of actions the group can take to mitigate against weaker trading in the travel business, such as the cost efficiency actions already underway.\u201d Flybe\u2019s collapse is a blow to Northern Ireland\u2019s economy -- at a time when Brexit uncertainty is also high. Brian Ambrose, chief executive of Belfast City Airport, hopes that rival airlines will step in to replace Flybe\u2019s services. In a statement, he says: The airline was a significant economic driver for the region, carrying 1.6 million passengers to and from Belfast in 2019. \u201cI am confident that these well-established routes, coupled with our city centre location and recent \u00a315m investment in terminal facilities, will prove an attractive option to airlines. \u201cNegotiations with a number of carriers are already underway. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, describes Flybe\u2019s demise as \u201csimply devastating news for Northern Ireland\u201d, adding it will hurt its tourism sector. \u201cThe regional connectivity that Flybe offered was vitally important to tourism and our wider hospitality sector here, without it there will be a huge impact on visitor access. \u201cThe knock-on effect of fewer visitors and tourists means that this sounds alarm for our pubs, restaurants and hotels at a time when coronavirus is compounding the sector\u2019s problems. The scene at Exeter Airport, Flybe\u2019s base, is bleak this morning: We reported yesterday that London City Airport (one of Flybe\u2019s destinations) was worryingly quiet, as the coronavirus scared customers away. My colleague Joanna Partridge spotted that there were as many (or as few) check-in staff as passengers: \u201cThe plane was half-empty,\u201d said Andrew Ross, who works in construction in the Netherlands and flies from Amsterdam to London a few times each year. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected it \u2013 it\u2019s usually busier. But it was nice and quiet.\u201d Just landed from Frankfurt, Kim Vaughan said there were fewer than 30 passengers on her flight. \u201cIt was a bigger plane, and it was almost completely empty,\u201d Vaughan said. Jilles Visser, a Dutch electrician on a work trip from Rotterdam, thought his BA-operated flight was \u201cvery empty\u201d. Other airlines are suffering from the same problems as Flybe, points out our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham: For now, the effects of Covid-19 on airlines echo the pattern among the human population: standstill in China, tolerated by the stronger carriers abroad, but potentially fatal to those less robust. And Flybe\u2019s pre-existing conditions included an unusually onerous tax burden of air passenger duty affecting domestic flights, dampened demand alongside Brexit, and increased fuel and leasing costs from a falling pound. Its investors \u2013 a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic swooped in last year \u2013 had sensed a final opportunity after its share price had tanked; but by January they were begging the government, in vain, for assistance to stay alive. But other airlines \u2013 including Virgin itself \u2013 are more directly exposed than Flybe to the crisis, first cancelling major Chinese routes and then seeing the drop in demand \u201crippling through\u201d the global networks, as the International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned this week. On Wednesday, Virgin announced emergency measures, including cutting executive pay, and urging other staff to take unpaid leave, after bookings halved in recent days. Ryanair and EasyJet have cancelled hundreds of flights to Italy, and other destinations, while IAG and BA have even cut transatlantic services. No airline, it appears, is immune \u2013 underlined by the sight of US airline executives meeting Donald Trump this week to discuss the impact in a country where domestic aviation is far bigger than international travel Associated Press points out that Brexit has also been a factor: Flybe has struggled with a series of issues, including the weakening of the pound in light of Britain\u2019s pending departure from the European Union. The weaker pound hurts airlines like Flybe that have significant costs in dollars but take in revenue in pounds. The airline also was struggling to pay its airline passenger duty, a tax on flights that many airline groups have long complained restricts growth. There are two ways in which coronavirus scuppered Flybe\u2019s prospects. 1) Scores of UK companies have been telling staff to work from home, or to cancel non-essential meetings. That undermines demand for Flybe\u2019s routes to business centres such as London, Manchester, Paris, Hannover or Geneva. 2) Rising anxiety about catching Covid-19 is hurting holiday traffic. Flybe offered flights to Milan and Verona, for example -- but demand has slumped as Italy closes its schools for two months and bans crowds from football matches. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has said the government tried its best to save Flybe, but the impact of Covid-19 on its business was too great: \u201cWe really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year but unfortunately though, with the situation that\u2019s developed with coronavirus, an already weak company just hasn\u2019t been able to survive.\u201d Alan Hudson of accountancy firm EY, who took control of Flybe overnight, says coronavirus put \u201cadded pressures\u201d on the airline. But he also points to the other problems which dragged Flybe down -- including currency volatility (a weak pound pushes up fuel costs), and general economic uncertainty: \u201cDespite an agreement with the Government to provide assistance to the Company, added pressures on the travel industry in the last few weeks have further deepened the severity of its financial situation. \u201cFlybe had already been impacted by rising fuel costs, currency volatility, and market uncertainty.\u201d The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) blamed Flybe\u2019s owners and the government- not coronavirus - for Flybe\u2019s failure. Flybe was owned by Connect Airways \u2013 a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and hedge fund Cyrus Capital. General secretary Brian Strutton blasted them, saying: \u201cA year ago Flybe was taken over by new owners with promises of funding for a bright future. \u201cSix weeks ago, when the ownership consortium lost confidence, the government promised a rescue package, apparently at that time recognising the value of Flybe to the regional economy of the UK. \u201cThroughout, pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have done their jobs brilliantly, while behind the scenes the owners and, sadly, government connived to walk away. Flybe staff will feel disgusted at this betrayal and these broken promises.\u201d Passengers booked with Flybe are being urged not to go to the airport this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest regional airline, has collapsed into administration this morning as the economic damage caused by the ongoing coronavirus crisis escalated. The airline ceased trading in the early hours, as administrators took control of the Exeter-based group -- which operated services to regional airports across the country. Last-ditch crisis talks failed to secure a rescue package, in a devastating hit to the company\u2019s 2,000 staff. It\u2019s also a real blow to the passengers who relied on the company\u2019s services -- leaving some stranded today -- and a stark illustration of the consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak. One source at the airline told the PA news agency that a drop in demand caused by the coronavirus \u201cmade a difficult situation worse\u201d for Flybe. Flybe was already in trouble, of course. Back in January, it came extremely close to collapse before a rescue deal was announced. But it wasn\u2019t able to secure a \u00a3100m government loan, forcing its demise. Flybe CEO Mark Anderson has told staff that the coronavirus has put additional pressure on the company, as it slipped over the brink into administration overnight: \u201cIt\u2019s with enormous sadness and a deep feeling of sorrow that I share the upsetting news that Flybe is shortly being put into Administration. Despite every effort, we now have no alternative \u2013 having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading.... Anderson said Flybe\u2019s management tried to secure support from the government and key suppliers, but without success, adding: The coronavirus has impacted both our shareholders and ourselves and has put additional pressure on an already difficult situation. I am very sorry that we have not been able to secure the funding needed to continue to deliver our turnaround plan. Flybe\u2019s collapse will send a shiver through the travel sector. Passenger numbers are down sharply on some routes, particularly to Italy where over 100 people have died of the coronavirus. We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to Flybe\u2019s collapse, and other economic consequences of the coronavirus, through the day.

However, many of the tactics remain the same in both phases, such as identifying carriers and tracing people they have been in contact with, he continued.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat pushes the disease further from the winter pressure period, further out from the period when people have upper respiratory tract infections, and it buys us time to better understand the virus and start the research into vaccines and things like that,\u201d Whitty said.<br></p> \n  <p>Ministers will decide when the campaign to tackle the virus moves officially from \u201ccontain\u201d to \u201cdelay\u201d, Whitty added. The latter phase is deemed appropriate when health officials and ministers decide the virus is circulating so widely in the community that containment is no longer the right response.</p> \n  <p><br>The delay phase could involve some of the measures set out in the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan on Tuesday, such as shutting schools, encouraging much greater homeworking and banning large gatherings such as sports and music events.

Most of us use \u2018what other people do\u2019 as a mental shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are unsure. It\u2019s a simple decision mechanism called \u2018social proof heuristic\u2019, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For instance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, because it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are also more likely to reuse their towels if told that \u2018the majority of guests reuse their towels\u2019. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet paper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help decide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/even-as-behavioural-researchers-we-couldnt-resist-the-urge-to-buy-toilet-paper\">Even as behavioural researchers we couldn\u2019t resist the urge to buy toilet paper | Liam Smith and Celine Klemm</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-05T04:50:36.071Z\">at 4.50am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e607cc28f085f0b8d942660\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-smee\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-05T04:20:22.754Z\">4.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>An Australian newspaper has printed extra pages for people to use as toilet paper. </strong></p> \n  <p>Coronavirus-fulled panic buying has led to shortages of loo roll across the country in recent days. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655039ae3e1f2502ddc3d6c66c57a4934349ff3c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655039ae3e1f2502ddc3d6c66c57a4934349ff3c/103_110_1966_1179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of the NT News, newspaper, Thursday 5 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of the NT News, newspaper, Thursday 5 March 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: supplied</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It\u2019s the panic that keeps on giving.</p> \n  <p>#ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it has been dubbed on Twitter, has already rolled out hundreds of memes, witty asides as well as documented the madness of people stockpiling the toilet essential.</p> \n  <p>In the real world it has led to Australian toilet paper manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand from people fearful of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>One newspaper has gone one step further by printing extra pages in its editions to help out those who have been \u2026 caught short.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday the NT News, the Darwin-based newspaper with a national reputation for its headlines and antics, printed a special eight-page insert that can be cut into toilet paper.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/05/australian-newspaper-prints-extra-pages-to-help-out-in-toilet-paper-shortage\">Coronavirus: Australian newspaper prints extra pages to help out in toilet paper shortage</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e607b558f087df56e4c27df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-05T04:09:24.665Z\">4.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>We have a bit more information about the latest cases from South Australia, from a press conference given at the Royal Adelaide hospital a short time ago.</p> \n  <p>Two people, a baby and a 58-year-old man, tested positive to Covid-19 on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in South Australia to seven.</p> \n  <p>The public health physician, Dr Nicola Spurrier, said the baby girl was the daughter of a 40-year-old woman who was hospitalised in Adelaide\u2019s Flinders Medical Center on Wednesday after testing positive for the virus.

A woman in her 70s was confirmed as the first coronavirus death in the UK on Thursday as Downing Street warned that it was now highly likely that the virus would spread in \u201ca significant way\u201d. Seven new cases of coronavirus detected in Ireland include the first confirmed case of community transmission, since the patient had not travelled to an infected area. The number of confirmed covid-19 cases in Australia has climbed past 50, and include a baby diagnosed in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory. There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship, off the west coast of the US, and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus. It has emerged that California\u2019s first fatality from the illness allegedly disembarked from the Grand Princess in Mexico last month. Britons returning from anywhere in Italy advised to self-isolate if unwell. Previously, the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded. The European parliament has cancelled its planned session in Strasbourg next week after being told that that the health risks to MEPs and staff would be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d if it took place as planned And here\u2019s our glanceable summary of developments today: A coronavirus test developed by a US diagnostics company will be available for healthcare providers to order later today. The US government is ramping up efforts to increase its ability to identify the coronavirus and an ongoing struggle to expand local testing has led to criticism. Health officials said earlier today they expect to deliver enough coronavirus tests to public laboratories this week to test about 400,000 people. Officials expect to ship additional test kits to cover up to 1.7m people by the end of next week, US health and human services secretary Alex Azar said. The news of Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (LabCorp) tests comes as Quest Diagnostics and OPKO Health also said they would be able to begin testing for the virus from next week. The FDA has said it will allow some laboratories to immediately use the tests they have developed and validated while they await emergency-use authorisation from the US health regulator. Co-Diagnostics Inc said it was seeing a surge in demand for its coronavirus test kits following the FDA policy change. Previously, only testing kits developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many of which were found to be faulty, could be used in public health labs, Reuters reported. Analysts at Evercore ISI expect the lab tests developed by Quest and LabCorp to be priced around $45 to $50, similar to a flu test. Religious groups have issued guidance for worshippers on practices including hand-shaking, sharing hymn books and taking communion wine as the spread of coronavirus intensifies across the UK, PA Media report. Varying levels of precaution have been taken by different faiths in a bid to protect congregations from catching the illness. Quakers have been urged not to shake hands as they would normally at the end of their meetings, while Catholics in some dioceses are being advised not to offer their hands for the sign of peace. Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said: Like many organisations that hold regular meetings, we have given advice on taking sensible precautions without raising anxiety. Quakers usually shake hands at the end of their meetings for worship, as an expression of unity. But the act of shaking hands itself is not a core part of Quaker faith and there are many other ways Quakers can share this greeting. We have advised meetings that they shouldn\u2019t shake hands in the current situation. A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of England and Wales said dioceses across the country would soon be moving into \u201cstage two\u201d of precautionary measures. This would include suspending the physical sign of peace \u2013 a handshake \u2013 removal of holy water stoups and shared hymn books, as well as advising elderly parishioners to stay at home. Catering at large parish gatherings where multiple people touch mugs and utensils would also be suspended, as would the passing round of collection plates during mass. The spokesman added that the decision might be taken by bishops in \u201cremote parts of England\u201d to not advance precautions in their dioceses. \u201cNo one size fits all and we are between stages, but my sense is that we are probably fast moving towards stage two,\u201d he said. Guidance issued by the Church of England asked \u201canyone with cold or flu symptoms to refrain from taking communion [wine] from the chalice\u201d, but said there was currently no need for the practice to stop. It added that no pastoral visits should be undertaken to people who are self-isolating but that \u201cphone support\u201d should still be provided. A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said that much of the NHS advice and an emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene was \u201cin line with Islamic tradition\u201d. In a statement, the MCB said \u201cmosques, madrassas and Muslim community centres should already be following best hygiene practices\u201d. The seven new cases of coronavirus detected in Ireland include the first confirmed case of community transmission, since the patient had not travelled to an infected area. The case of community transmission is a man in Cork with an underlying medical condition. He had not travelled to Italy or been in contact with other confirmed cases. He is being treated at Cork University Hospital, which announced it was cancelling outpatient appointments on Friday. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the country remains in the containment phase, but warned it is a \u201crapidly evolving situation\u201d and urged a \u201cnational effort\u201d to stymie potential spread. Ireland remains in containment phase with just one case of community transmission. Public health doctors are working hard to ensure our containment measures are operating effectively. Most people who become infected with covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some. However, this will need a national effort. Every individual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others. The Health Service Executive said in a statement on Thursday night it was working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients may have had to prevent further spread. One of the cases confirmed on Wednesday \u2013 a member of a family of four in the west of Ireland \u2013 is a health professional, it has emerged. Four of the latest cases are travel related from northern Italy, involving four males from the east of the country. Two are associated with close contact with a confirmed case and involve two females in the west of the country. The seventh case is a male, who the Department of Health have described as being \u201cassociated with Cork University Hospital\u201d and that is the first case of community transmission. A risk assessment is under way at the hospital. There are now 13 confirmed covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland, as well as three in Northern Ireland - bringing the total number of cases on the island to 16. There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship, off the coast of California, and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus. The cruise operator said groups of guests and crew were being tested after a passenger on an earlier voyage died and at least one other became infected. It confirmed that 142 UK nationals - made up of 121 passengers and 21 crew - were on board the Grand Princess, which was carrying a total of 3,533 people. There had so far been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board, and that fewer than 100 people had been identified for testing, according to the operator. \u201cPublic health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all results have been received,\u201d it said. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, all guests who have been identified for testing have been asked to remain in their staterooms.\u201d Japanese authorities said last week that a British tourist who had been on board another of the company\u2019s cruise ships, the Diamond Princess - which was quarantined in Japan - had died after contracting coronavirus. Meanwhile, it has emerged that three passengers on the Grand Princess\u2019 previous voyage have been confirmed to have the new virus, and one of them reportedly became California\u2019s first fatality from the illness yesterday, after it disembarked hundreds at four Mexican ports last month. US health officials are working to track down other passengers who have returned home, but when Mexican health officials have not yet been notified by their counterparts, the Associated Press reported. Liverpool council has tweeted that two more cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in Liverpool, bringing the total to three. \u201cOne is a known contact of an existing patient and the other has recently returned from Italy,\u201d it said. \u201cThe patients are receiving specialist treatment.\u201d Seven new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland today, bringing the total number of cases to 13, according to Irish media. A further three cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland. People who have returned to the UK from any part of Italy in the past fortnight are being advised to self-isolate if they begin to feel unwell. Previously, the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded, but the government has now announced that the guidance is being extended to cover the whole country. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said the move was needed because of the evolving situation in Italy. He told a press conference earlier this evening: The situation in Italy means that we have decided it is prudent at this point to move from a geographical area of north Italy... to a geographical situation for all of Italy. The pattern of what people do is exactly the same as before. It\u2019s about people from those areas, except for the cities which the Italian government specifies in lockdown, all other areas, only people who have got symptoms need to self-isolate. The number of confirmed covid-19 cases in Australia has climbed past 50, and include a baby diagnosed in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory. In New South Wales, Epping Boys high school in Sydney\u2019s north will be closed on Friday after a student tested positive, and 61 staff at Sydney\u2019s Ryde Hospital have been placed in self-isolation after 56 patients were identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case. At Liverpool hospital, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. Elsewhere, in Brisbane and Sydney, nursing home staff have been forced into isolation after coming into contact with the virus. The federal government announced new travel control measures affecting South Korea, and New South Wales authorities have said they were trying to contact 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with a man diagnosed with the virus. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was \u201cmillions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. However, he said the country\u2019s public health systems were well prepared if widespread outbreaks occurred. Two major sponsors of Crufts, believed to be the world\u2019s biggest dog show, have told staff not to attend the event \u2013 which began today. Pet food firms Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved asked employees to avoid the four-day event \u201cunless it is business critical\u201d, according to the BBC. Crufts, which takes place at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, has 20,000 competitors and their pets coming from all over the world. Last year, 27,000 dogs attended the event, with 21,000 competing, including 3,611 from overseas, 413 of which were from Italy. A spokesman from Mars Petcare, the parent company of Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved, said: As a global business, we have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our associates, as well as to do our part to prevent the spread of covid-19. As such, we\u2019ve decided to restrict international travel and not participate in large events until March 31. The Association of Pet Dog Trainers said: Following an emergency committee discussion regarding ongoing concerns about the APDT\u2019s attendance at Crufts, we have made the difficult decision not to attend this year given the unprecedented and unpredictable situation. The safety of our members remains our priority, and we hope that all our members, student members and attendees will understand. Crufts\u2019 organisers The Kennel Club said the event in Birmingham would still go ahead, with \u201cenhanced measures\u201d to protect visitors. Precautions would include hand sanitiser stations at entrances, toilets and catering areas, as well as additional signage. In a statement on its website, the club said Defra had not advised them to cancel the event. The European parliament has cancelled its planned session in Strasbourg next week after being told that that the health risks to MEPs and staff would be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d if it took place as planned The parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, did not mention the coronavirus outbreak. He said: On the basis of this evaluation, due to force majeure, I decided that the necessary security conditions are not in place for the usual transfer of the European parliament to Strasbourg for the plenary session next week. I have informed the French authorities and have thanked them for their collaboration in the past days. The plenary session will exceptionally be held in Brussels. Parliament undertakes to reschedule a plenary session in Strasbourg in accordance with the treaties. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has tweeted his condolences to the family of the first person to die in the UK with coronavirus. Has the coronavirus mutated into a more deadly strain? Here\u2019s a myth buster by Hannah Devlin, the Guardian science correspondent, which also examines the protective value of face masks and whether it\u2019s easy to catch the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has indicated that the huge effort to limit the spread and impact of Covid-19 will soon move from trying to contain it, the first of the four phases of the response, to seeking to delay its transmission and thus limit the number of people who contract it. \u201cWe are moving from a primarily contain model to a primarily delay model,\u201d he said. However, many of the tactics remain the same in both phases, such as identifying carriers and tracing people they have been in contact with, he continued. \u201cThat pushes the disease further from the winter pressure period, further out from the period when people have upper respiratory tract infections, and it buys us time to better understand the virus and start the research into vaccines and things like that,\u201d Whitty said. Ministers will decide when the campaign to tackle the virus moves officially from \u201ccontain\u201d to \u201cdelay\u201d, Whitty added. The latter phase is deemed appropriate when health officials and ministers decide the virus is circulating so widely in the community that containment is no longer the right response. The delay phase could involve some of the measures set out in the government\u2019s coronavirus action plan on Tuesday, such as shutting schools, encouraging much greater homeworking and banning large gatherings such as sports and music events. However, Whitty told MPs on Thursday morning that closing schools may only have \u201ca marginal effect\u201d on the spread of Covid-19, because children are not badly affected by it. No details have been given about the unnamed woman who has died but it is understood that she was in her 70s and had recently spent time in and out of the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading for long-term health conditions. She died early on Thursday morning. Starbucks branches in the UK will be \u201cpausing the use of personal cups\u201d as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, PA media reports. The company announced it would \u201ccontinue to honour existing discounts\u201d for anyone who brought reusable tumblers but that its drinks would be served in paper cups. It added that the 5p charge for disposable cups will be temporarily suspended. Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK so far, it remains unknown how 10 of them came to be infected, including seven of the 25 who were diagnosed in the last 24 hours. However, tracing the contacts of people whose illness is initially a mystery should reduce that number, officials said. Global health experts have said the first death in the UK from the coronavirus is not unexpected and fits in with the pattern seen elsewhere. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cThis unfortunate death is not unexpected given the number of cases and given we know that older people with underlying health conditions are most at risk. It changes nothing about the spread of Covid-19 in the UK.\u201d Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cThe first UK death is sad to note, but fits in with the pattern we have seen elsewhere, namely that the patient was older in age with existing health difficulties. \u201cWe can expect to see a small number of further deaths in the UK in the coming weeks, as case numbers increase and vulnerable populations become exposed. Infection control and public health measures are particularly important in institutional populations, such as the elderly in care homes.\u201d In a major change of policy, some people who are confirmed to have contracted the virus, but display only mild symptoms are now being treated at home rather than in hospital. Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK since the outbreak began in late January, 18 have recovered, 52 are still being cared for in hospital and 45 are being treated at home, said Dr Susan Hopkins, the deputy director of Public Health England\u2019s national infection service. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved to a situation where people have minimal symptoms and they can self-isolate. It\u2019s safer for them to self-isolate in their own homes, with support,\u201d said Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England and the government\u2019s chief medical adviser for the UK. Prof Steve Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said: \u201cIf the symptoms are mild then it\u2019s appropriate for people to be in a home setting rather than a hospital setting.\u201d Asked how the authorities are ensuring that infected patients are staying indoors, she said that all 45 people are displaying very responsible behaviour. \u201cMany are isolating in their bedroom and only coming out of their room to get food and go back in. They are being very responsible.\u201d Public Health England has said travellers returning from all parts of Italy, not just north, are now being advised to self-isolate if they have symptoms. The change in advice is understood to have been prompted by the recent surge in cases of people who recently come back from Italy, where the outbreak has escalated across the country in recent days. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York state has doubled to 22, governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed today. Cuomo said: \u201cWe are trying to contain as much as possible the spread of each case we find \u2013 but we expect more cases.\u201d As of Thursday, there are 3,296 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy, 590 more than on Wednesday, according to the country\u2019s head of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, adding that 148 people had died. There are 1,777 people infected in Lombardy, 658 in Emilia Romagna, 380 in Veneto, 106 in Piedmont, and 120 in Marche. The virus has now spread to all the 20 regions, including Val d\u2019Aosta. The Italian government has announced it is making \u20ac7.5bn available to help families and companies, as parents struggle to cope with the nationwide closure of all schools until 15 March. Rome is set to ask the European commission to allow \u20ac6.3bn deviation from its budget deficit target, the equivalent of about 0.35% of Italy\u2019s GDP. The cabinet also asked the justice minister, Alfonso Bonafede, to postpone trialsowing to the outbreak, Ansa had reported. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has confirmed the death of an older patient who had contracted the virus in the UK. The patient, who was in and out of hospital for non-coronavirus reasons, is the first person to die from the outbreak in the UK. Whitty said: I am very sorry to report a patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their request for privacy is respected. The patient, who was being treated at the Royal Berkshire hospital, was an older patient who had underlying health conditions. We believe they contracted the virus in the UK and contact tracing is already underway. The Royal Berkshire NHS Trust has confirmed an older patient is the first to die from the coronavirus in the UK. The trust said in a statement: Sadly, we can confirm that an older patient with underlying health conditions has died. The patient has previously been in and out of hospital for non-coronavirus reasons, but on this occasion was admitted and last night tested positive for coronavirus. The family has been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. We will not be commenting further and ask that everybody respects the family\u2019s privacy.\u201d The rise of the staycation is a perennial story. In the past five years, heatwaves, Brexit, the weak pound, overseas terrorist attacks and, more recently, the climate crisis have all boosted UK holiday bookings. This year, coronavirus looks likely to do the same as British travellers swap holidays abroad for a break closer to home. Figures released on 4 March by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) showed that January had the lowest monthly increase in global airline passengers since 2010, when the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud led to massive airspace closures and flight cancellations. Demand for flights increased by just 2.4% compared with January 2019, where year-on-year growth had been 4.6%. \u201cJanuary was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January. Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade,\u201d said Iata\u2019s chief executive, Alexandre de Juniac. Global travel companies are already feeling the negative impact of coronavirus: Booking Holdings (which owns booking.com, priceline.com, kayak.com, cheapflights and momondo.com, among others), is predicting a 15% decline in total bookings in 2020. But UK tourism businesses are reporting a rise of up to 40% in traffic to their websites. \u201cFor the period 1 January to 24 February 2020, we are, on average, 40% up on web visitors compared with the same period in the previous year,\u201d said Steve Jarvis, owner of Independent Cottages. \u201cInitial analysis of the most recent enquiries is that they appear to all be domestic \u2013 overseas enquiries have reduced significantly.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson has warned that the coronavirus was likely to spread significantly. The British prime minister was updated on the coronavirus by the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser as he opened an official Cobra meeting. The PM\u2019s official spokesman said: We will continue to try to contain this virus. However, it\u2019s now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way. Officials will therefore accelerate work on preparations for the delay phase of the government\u2019s plan focusing on steps we can take to seek to delay the spread of the virus. This will include detailed work on the optimum time to introduce further measures. The Italian government has announced it is making \u20ac7.5bn available to help families and companies, as parents struggle to cope with the decision to close all schools nationwide until 15 March. Italy has been grappling to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus, which so far has claimed 107 lives. On Thursday, Rome revealed that is evaluating the possibility of providing support to families, including reimbursements for babysitter costs and unpaid leaves of absence from work. \u201cWe should not assume that people are home using up holiday pay or paid leave,\u201d Elena Bonetti, minister of family affairs, told Radio Capital. The Department of Health has released a breakdown of where the coronavirus cases are in England. A healthcare professional in the west of Ireland is among the latest group of people to test positive for the coronavirus, the Irish Time reports. The person worked a shift in a hospital emergency department in Clare after returning from northern Italy. The healthcare professional was one of four people from the same family who tested positive for the disease on Wednesday evening. The chief medical officers from the different regions within the UK have responded to the latest figures on the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: As of 9:00am this morning 25 further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19. Seventeen were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. Eight patients were identified in the UK where it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 105. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases is 115. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, confirmed that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. He said: I can confirm that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. I can also confirm that like the first case in Wales, this patient had travelled back to Wales from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents. Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public. The Scottish government has not raised the country\u2019s coronavirus alert status from contain to delay, unlike health chiefs in England and Wales, because the number and type of Covid-19 cases are not yet significant enough. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Thursday morning the number of confirmed cases in Scotland had doubled overnight to six after three people came into contact with the three previous Covid-19 patients. By 2pm on Thursday, there had been 1,250 negative tests according to the first bulletin in a series which ministers in Edinburgh said will be published at 2pm every day. Scottish government officials said there was not yet evidence in Scotland of community transmission involving patients not in direct contact with known carriers or a sufficiently high infection rate to raise the alert from its lowest status, containment, up a step to delay. The delay phase is focused on slowing the virus\u2019s spread through the wider community, and could involve banning or delaying large scale public events, to buy time for medical supplies to be built up and reduce the risks of the coronavirus coinciding with the peak occurrence of routine winter illnesses. Officials said they expected that to change a matter of hours or days. \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that it\u2019s only a matter of a short period of time before we move it to \u2018delay\u2019,\u201d said a government spokeswoman. The Department of Health confirmed that as of 9am on 5 March 2020, 18,083 people have been tested in the UK, of whom the tests came back negative for 17,968. Police in Northern Ireland may face 12-hour shifts and cancelled rest days if coronavirus has a serious impact on staffing levels, PA media reports. The chief constable of Police Service of Northern Ireland, Simon Byrne, said the potential impact of Covid-19 was very much unknown at this stage, but added that there were contingency plans in place if high numbers of his officers were struck down by the disease. \u201cAt the moment we are not complacent, and we can use a lot of experience from operating at pace at different times, whether it is dealing with complex investigations or serious disorder to keep officers and staff available to work,\u201d he said. There are currently three cases in Northern Ireland. \u201cThe disease, whilst the dots on the map are increasing, hasn\u2019t yet exploded into the country,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cWe are following the advice about personal hygiene, clearly what I need to do with senior colleagues is make sure our preparedness is at its optimum, so we are looking at a range of scenario planning in terms of how we protect officers and staff.\u201d The Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March as it tries to tackle Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus. More than 3,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus in Italy, of whom 107 have died Teachers and lecturers have turned to online classes to continue providing lessons to their students. The Associated Press has this photo of a teacher at the Polytechnic University of Milan, the largest Italian technical university with 45,000 students, giving online lessons. Birmingham city council has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus The Department of Health will shortly be providing its daily update on the total number of UK cases. Donald Trump has said that, as a result of a hunch, he didn\u2019t believe the World Health Organization\u2019s assessment of the global death rate from coronavirus of 3.4%. \u201cI think the 3.4% is really a false number,\u201d he told Sean Hannity, one of his favourite conservative Fox News hosts, in a phone interview broadcast live. \u201cNow, this is just my hunch,\u201d Trump began, before continuing: \u201cBased on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it\u2019s very mild \u2013 they\u2019ll get better very rapidly, they don\u2019t even see a doctor, they don\u2019t even call a doctor.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou never hear about those people, so you can\u2019t put them down in the category of the overall population, in terms of this corona flu, and/or virus. So you just can\u2019t do that.\u201d In London, there was some concern earlier that two patients at King\u2019s College hospital in London may have contracted it while in the hospital. However, the Guardian understands that both people were exposed to the virus before they reached the hospital. One of them is now being cared for in an isolation unit in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in central London where a number of other infected people are being cared for. Staff at a British government department have received an unfortunately worded email offering help with planning their \u201cdemise\u201d, the Daily Mirror reports. The message was sent to staff at the Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (BEIS). The Mirror reports that the email was sent by a representative of ISS, an outsourcing company, and reads that it is monitoring the situation in relation to the coronavirus. \u201cShould, as part of your preparations need us to consider something more specific to your demise, ISS are happy to do so,\u201d the email adds. In England, the University of Sussex has told students that it has been informed by health authorities that a person associated with the university has tested positive for the virus, following travel overseas. The university added: \u201cHowever, as this person has not visited Brighton or our campus since travelling, Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed there is no need for any special measures and that campus activities should continue as normal. \u201cThere are no confirmed cases of coronavirus on the University of Sussex campus.\u201d Over the next few weeks, the Guardian will be be releasing extra episodes of Science Weekly exploring questions people may have about coronavirus and would like to put to experts on the frontline. In today\u2019s episode, Ian Sample investigates where the virus infects us when it enters our bodies, and what difference this makes to disease severity and transmissibility. Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, has accused CNN of \u201cdistorting reality\u2019\u2019 after it published a map of worldwide cases of the coronavirus linked to the country. According to the Italian authorities, the map, featuring a big red arrows sprouting from Italy to other parts of the world, does not highlight other areas struggling with the emergency such as China, Iran, South Korea and Japan. \u201cCNN has shown a map in which it looks as though Italy is the origin of the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d Di Maio posted on Facebook. \u201cThis is a distorted vision of reality. CNN is not the issue though, as this is just an example because other international media organisations are portraying Italy the wrong way too. The disinformation of some organs does not clash with opinions but with facts. \u201cItaly is the nation that is addressing with most rigour this emergency which, as we know, developed in China\u201d. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the Netherlands have more than doubled to 82, according to Dutch health authorities. There\u2019s more now on that report earlier about a confirmed coronavirus case among employees at HSBC offices in London. The company has evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office after an employee was confirmed to have been infected. The bank has sent 100 people home and ordered a deep clean of the 10th floor, which houses its research department. This has so far not affected HSBC\u2019s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions. The evacuation was first reported by Financial News. South Africa\u2019s health minister has said that the country\u2019s health system would be \u201ctested\u201d by the coronavirus, after it earlier confirmed its first case. Zweli Mkhize said South African citizens quarantined in China would be returning home in the next few days. Addressing lawmakers in Cape Town, he added that South Africa was working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other institutions to help diagnose Coiv-19 across Africa. \u201cI think we need to be upfront about it ... Our system will be tested by the impact of coronavirus,\u201d Mkhize said. Iran will begin putting up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and has urged people to reduce their use of banknotes as authorities try to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, which has caused at least 107 deaths and infected more than 3,500 people across the country. The Iranian health minister, Saeed Namaki, announced the drastic new measures during a televised press conference on Thursday, adding that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March. Namaki told people to stay in their vehicles at petrol stations and allow attendants to fill their tanks to avoid the spread of the virus. Iran and Italy have the world\u2019s highest death tolls outside China, where the outbreak began at the end of last year. So far, there has been 95,000 confirmed cases worldwide and more than 3,200 deaths. There is more here in this wrap up about the situation in different countries. Europe is experiencing delays in supplies of medicines and face masks because of coronavirus disruptions, according to EU and industry officials, compounding already acute shortages of drugs on the continent. The European Union is assessing the delays in drug shipments from Asia, a senior official from the EU commission told Reuters, as France warned it was overdependent on China with about 40% of the country\u2019s drug ingredients imported from there. The European concerns come as India, which is the world\u2019s main supplier of generic medicines and also relies on Chinese ingredients, decided to restrict some drug exports. \u201cMany active pharmaceutical ingredients are produced in China and the virus outbreak is affecting the manufacturing capacity and stability of the supply of these ingredients,\u201d the European Medicines Agency told Reuters. The total number of the new coronavirus cases in Greece has risen to 31, after 21 more people who came in contact with the country\u2019s ninth confirmed case tested positive, ekathimerini.com reports. The figures were revealed in a press briefing from Greek health ministry spokesman Dimitris Tsiodras. The country is moving into \u201cphase 2\u201d of the ministry\u2019s health risk containment strategy, meaning that official measures will focus on containing the virus from spreading from western Greece. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog again. Egypt has declared its first coronavirus infection of an Egyptian national. The country\u2019s Ministry of Health and Population said the 44-year-old display symptoms after returning from Serbia via 12-hour transit in France. The man has now been quarantined, as Egyptian officials say they have stepped up efforts to limited then spread of the virus, including screenings at airports. Egypt previously declared two foreign nationals had Covid-19. A Chinese national who tested positive in mid-February later recovered, while a 54-year old Canadian national was quarantined last Monday. As recently as last weekend, the Egyptian prime minister and health ministry repeatedly said that Egypt was free of the virus, despite raising suspicions after multiple foreign nationals dreturned from trips to Egypt displaying symptoms. \u201cOne trip to Egypt was the source of 11 cases out of 20 people,\u201d in the French town of La Balme-de-Sillingy according to Le Monde. The Egyptian health minister, Hala Zayed, travelled to China this week to discuss the outbreak. She told a press conference that Egypt had tested 1,443 people for the virus, with only one testing positive. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority has warned businesses not to take advantage of people by exploiting the coronavirus outbreak. The CMA said it would take enforcement action against companies that charged excessive prices or made misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment. The CMA chairman, Lord Tyrie, said: \u201cWe will do whatever we can to act against ripoffs and misleading claims, using any or all of our tools; and where we can\u2019t act, we\u2019ll advise government on further steps they could take, if necessary.\u201d Its chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: \u201cWe urge retailers to behave responsibly throughout the coronavirus outbreak and not to make misleading claims or charge vastly inflated prices. We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest summary of today\u2019s events. South Africa has confirmed its first case of coronavirus. The person is a man, 38, who travelled to Italy with his wife in a group of 10 people who arrived back in South Africa on 1 March. At least 349 people are infected in Germany, the German government has confirmed, a rise of 109 cases within 24 hours. On Monday there were just 38 confirmed cases. All mosques and churches have been closed in Bethlehem. The Palestinian health ministry declared a medical state of emergency in the West Bank city after a suspected case of coronavirus at a hotel. No cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Palestinian territories. Iran has reported 3,515 coronavirus cases and 107 deaths. The figures from the country\u2019s health ministry come as the Iranian authorities impose checkpoints to limit travel between major cities. Iran is now one of the centres of the outbreak. Starbucks has said it will only use disposable cups at its North American outlets. The company also said it was \u201cpausing the use of personal cups and \u2018for here\u2019 ware\u201d in its stores. A 33-year-old German man may be the first European to have contracted Covid-19 and to have transmitted it. According to the German doctors, the \u201cotherwise healthy\u201d businessman, known as patient 1, became ill with a sore throat, chills and myalgias (muscle pain) on 24 January. The following day, he developed a fever of 39.1C (102.4F) and a wet cough. However, he started feeling better during the evening of the next day and went back to work on 27 January. In the UK people who are elderly or have pre-existing conditions could be advised to stay away from crowds as the outbreak progresses. The remarks came from the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, during evidence to MPs. The federation of German industries, has warned the coronavirus is likely to send Europe\u2019s biggest economy into recession. The BDI said economic growth was likely to \u201cfall prey\u201d to the virus. \u201cEconomic growth threatens to come to a halt,\u201d it said in its first quarterly report for 2020. England\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy on 14 March in Rome has been postponed. Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland have increased from three to six. Catherine Calderwood, the country\u2019s chief medical officer, said the new cases were in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde and Grampian NHS areas, and were all linked to the three previous cases. The death toll in the US has climbed to 11. California reported its first fatality and declared a state of emergency. The person who died was an elderly man with underlying health issues. Greece has reported its 10th case. The latest person to be confirmed as having the virus is related to an individual who recently travelled to Israel and Egypt, health authorities have said. India\u2019s health ministry has issued a statement that there were 29 positive cases in the country by 4 March. Citizens have been advised not to travel to any country that is affected by the virus. Hello, It\u2019s Aamna taking over the blog from Ben so he can have lunch. The British government will release geographic information on coronavirus cases on a daily basis. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: : \u201cI think the prime minister and the chief medical officer have both said this morning we will provide geographic information on cases - it will be at 2pm, it will be with a 24-hour delay to make sure that all of the details are correct.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed the UK would not be asking for an extension to the Brexit transition period because of the outbreak. The spokesman said: \u201cThat work has been continuing throughout and I expect it to carry on as planned - no change.\u201d The first confirmed case of the coronavirus has been identified in South Africa. The person is a man, 38, who travelled to Italy with his wife in a group of 10 people who arrived back in South Africa on 1 March. The man attended a GP surgery two days later with symptoms including fever, headache, a sore throat and a cough. A team that will attempt to trace contacts has been sent to Kwazulu-Natal with epidemiologists and doctors. A school in the city of Osnabr\u00fcck in north-west Germany has sent a convoy of buses and ambulances to pick up a group of 55 pupils and teachers from a skiing holiday in South Tyrol, German media has reported. Two doctors and other medical staff, as well as parents, are part of the group sent to bring the children back, two of whom have suspected coronavirus symptoms. A child with a fever has already been picked up by her father and is being tested. The children are to be separated into two groups: suspected cases with medical staff will travel in one bus, with those considered healthy in the other. The convoy is expected back in Osnabr\u00fcck on Friday. Are you someone who has had the coronavirus and has recovered?

French plans to move at some point from \u2018stage 2\u2019 of its response to the coronavirus to \u2018stage 3\u2019 are to be discussed today at a meeting of advisors convened by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron. Le Monde has details of the discussions in anticipation of stage 3, when the outbreak spreads to the entire country and schools and other institutions may close. David and Sally Abel, a British couple who contracted coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, are resigned to being kept in quarantine in a Japanese hospital for at least two more weeks. In a video update from the hospital room, David said both he and his wife still have coronavirus, more than two weeks after first being diagnosed on the ship as it was docked off Yokohama. Sally was tested negative last week, but has since tested positive again. David said he \u201ccurled up into a ball\u201d and felt close to death after the virus led to pneumonia but both he and Sally were now recovering and gaining \u201cmore energy\u201d every day. Asked by YouTube viewers when he would return to the UK, he said: \u201cUntil we get a run of negative tests that isn\u2019t even open for negotiation. We have to be given a certificate to say we are absolutely clear of the virus. My gut feeling is probably two to three weeks.\u201d David suspects his room is being monitored by CCTV camera, but he said his Japanese carers had been \u201cso gracious\u201d. And he added that the couple accepted they were being closely monitored \u201cfor our own good\u201d. An employee in HSBC\u2019s research department in London has tested positive for coronavirus, three sources have told Reuters. The employee informed the bank at the weekend and staff who came into contact with him have been told to work from home, a source familiar with the matter said. Deep cleaning is taking place of affected areas, the source added. A spokesman for the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, says the government will not need to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit transition period due to the coronavirus. DeepMind, Google\u2019s London-based AI research unit, has published predictions of the structure of proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes the disease Covid-19], in the hope that they help scientists understand how the new coronavirus functions, and allow for more precise investigation into potential treatments. The company used its AlphaFold system, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate the physical structure of proteins, to generate the predictions, which it has published without the normal, time consuming, review or verification process for such work. \u201cKnowing a protein\u2019s structure provides an important resource for understanding how it functions, but experiments to determine the structure can take months or longer, and some prove to be intractable,\u201d the researchers wrote in a post accompanying the publication. \u201cFor this reason, researchers have been developing computational methods to predict protein structure from the amino acid sequence.\u201d A \u201clong-term commercial niche\u201d for vaccines to counter the new coronavirus will be opened up, according to the head of a global NGO which acts as an umbrella for drugs researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer plausible that containment will be a success and the new coronavirus disease knocked out,\u201d says Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), in a Financial Times piece on the race to find a vaccine. It adds though that, for now, any commercial gain from involvement in creating a successful vaccine is a secondary concern to the drive to find a treatment. Full Fact, the UK fact-checking charity, has released some pieces of work countering misleading claims about the outbreak. They include: Claim: Scientists believe that coronavirus may have come from bats in a Chinese research facility. Full Fact conclusion: Two Chinese scientists have published an article suggesting that the 2019 coronavirus outbreak could have originated from bats in a laboratory in Wuhan. However, apart from maps showing the proximity of laboratories, they offer no evidence to prove this. Claim: Scientists knew about the new coronavirus long ago and called it \u201cDisease X\u201d. Full Fact conclusion: They didn\u2019t. This is a misunderstanding about the phrase \u201cDisease X\u201d, which the World Health Organization used to denote an unknown serious new disease that might cause a pandemic. The German government\u2019s main body for safeguarding public health has announced this morning that 349 people are officially infected with the coronavirus in Germany, a rise of 109 cases within 24 hours. On Monday the figure from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) was just 38. The real figure will be still higher \u201cbecause of the fluidity of the situation\u201d, a spokesman said, with the RKI never able to be fully on top of the new numbers as health authorities continue to report new incidents through the day. Meanwhile the government has given pharmacies permission to mix their own disinfectant solutions with industrial alcohol, in an attempt to keep up with the unprecedented demand. Following a suspected case of coronavirus at a hotel in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has closed all mosques and churches in the area. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian Authority news service, a medical state of emergency had been declared in the holy city, home to the Church of Nativity, a popular pilgrimage site revered as the birthplace of Jesus. While no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Palestinian territories, authorities also cancelled all sports events in the city and shut schools. It had also asked tourists to cancel hotel reservations, the Wafa report said. Some 3,513 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Iran, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. There have been 107 deaths, said officials. Multiple sporting events have been postponed, moved or cancelled, with others now cast into doubt. They include: Euro 2020 The Europe-wide, travel-heavy Uefa showpiece is due to take place at 12 venues, starting in Rome on 12 June. The semi-finals and final will be at Wembley. Uefa say the situation is \u201cunder constant scrutiny \u2026 we are monitoring it country by country, and football will follow orders of the individual countries\u201d. England\u2019s warm-up against Italy is scheduled for Wembley on 27 March. The FA is following developments. Premier League and domestic football Widespread disruption already, with multiple Serie A games called off and concerns over completing the Italian domestic season. The Swiss league, Japan\u2019s J-League, South Korea\u2019s K-League and China\u2019s Super League are all on hold, with pre-season International Champions Cup fixtures set for Asia also called off. Olympics and Paralympics Tokyo 2020 officials are sounding defiant but options are being discussed. The events start on 24 July and 25 August respectively; IOC member Dick Pound says a final decision could be made as late as the end of May, with cancellation, rather than postponement or relocation, the most likely outcome. The athletics world indoor championships, scheduled to take place in China next month, are already off. Iranian authorities are to begin manning checkpoints to limit travel between major cities due to the coronavirus in a country which is now one of the centres of the outbreak. The country has also moved to close schools and universities until the end of the Iranian calendar year on 20 March because of coronavirus. Health minister Saeed Namaki made the announcement Thursday at a televised news conference. Starbucks has said it will only use disposable cups at its North American outlets. The company also said in a statement that it was \u201cpausing the use of personal cups and \u2018for here\u2019 ware\u201d in its stores. Translation: there won\u2019t be any more drinks in washable mugs or customer-owned cups. Other measures include its move as a corporate body to restrict all business-related air travel. \u201cAlthough the situation remains fluid, our US and international markets have gleaned learnings from our leadership team and partners in China who were first faced with this epidemic,\u201d the company said. Dubai has asked sports events organisers to postpone all sports related activities until the end of the month, according to a government circular seen by Reuters. The circular, issued by Dubai Sports Council, said the request was a precautionary measure to ensure public health. A 33-year-old German man may be the first European to have contracted Covid-19 and to have transmitted it, Italian daily newspaper il Corriere della Sera has reported, citing a letter of German experts published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. According to the German doctors, \u201ca 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, chills, and myalgias on 24 January 2020. The following day, a fever of 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the evening of the next day, he started feeling better and went back to work on 27 January.\u201d On 20 and 21 January, before the onset of symptoms, the man had attended a series of meetings with a Chinese business partner at his company near Munich. The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between 19 and 22 January. \u201cDuring her stay, she had been well with no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China, where she tested positive for 2019-nCoV on 26 January,\u201d write the doctors. The woman had immediately informed the company about her illness. Contact tracing was started and the 33-year-old German man was sent to the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Munich for further assessment. On 28 January, three additional employees at the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV and so far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness. \u201cThis case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia,\u201d write the experts. \u201cHowever, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific.\u201d People who are elderly or have pre-existing conditions could be advised to stay away from crowds as the outbreak progresses, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty has told MPs. He added that parliament was no more risky than any other environment, following reports the Palace of Westminster could be closed down as a result of the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is encouraging countries who want to know how much of their population is sick with the virus to start testing people with symptoms. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme technical lead, made the comments in a briefing earlier. The Federation of German industries, the BDI, has warned this morning that the effects of the coronavirus on businesses is likely to send Europe\u2019s biggest economy into recession. Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute said that by Wednesday afternoon there were 262 confirmed cases in Germany, with all but one of the country\u2019s 16 states affected. The BDI said economic growth was likely to \u201cfall prey\u201d to the coronavirus. \u201cEconomic growth threatens to come to a halt,\u201d the federation said in its first quarter report for 2020. It added that if the coronavirus was not brought under control in countries affected by it, by the second economic quarter it expected a much bigger impact. Germany\u2019s economic growth had already been slower than expected before the virus hit, due largely to the slowdown in China. While we reported earlier that North Korea\u2019s leader has sent a letter to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, offering his condolences for South Korean victims of the coronavirus, observers have expressed fears that the north could be suppressing information about infections. Given that countries with advanced health services are struggling to contain the outbreak, a significant number of infections in North Korea would place intolerable strain on its weak medical infrastructure. \u201cUnfortunately, the international community has no idea if the coronavirus is spreading inside North Korea,\u201d said a recent report by Jessica Lee, an East Asia expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a thinktank in Washington. \u201cThe fact that we know nothing about the level of infection or deaths within North Korea is extremely problematic and, left unchanged, could have serious public health implications.\u201d While continuing to declare itself virus-free, North Korea has banned foreign tourists, placed people who have traveled abroad in quarantine and closed its 900-mile border with China - a move that overseas monitors with contacts inside the country say has caused shortages of food, cooking oil and gasoline. As the number of cases south of the border dividing the Korean peninsula continues to grow, pressure is mounting on the North to allow international experts to assess the situation there. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, has urged North Korea to \u201callow full and unimpeded access to medical experts and humanitarian actors, and relax restrictions on access to information. Further isolation of the country is not the answer\u201d. In addition, the US state department has said it would \u201csupport and encourage\u201d international efforts to help North Korea fight the disease, despite stringent sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear weapons programme. A 74-year-old woman in western Switzerland has died after contracting the coronavirus, the country\u2019s first death from the rapidly spreading disease, Reuters reports. The woman had been hospitalised at Lausanne\u2019s University hospital in the canton of Vaud since Tuesday, police said. She was a high-risk patient suffering from chronic disease, authorities added. England\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy on 14 March in Rome has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Press Associatino news agency has reported. Tournament organisers faced the option of playing the game behind closed doors at the Stadio Olimpico or delaying it until later in the year and have chosen the latter option. Official confirmation of the decision is expected from Six Nations later today. The UK response to coronavirus was already moving into its second \u201cdelay\u201d phase, rather than seeking to simply \u201ccontain\u201d the disease, Prof Whitty told British MPs. \u201cWe have moved from a situation where we are mainly in contain, with some delay built in, to we are now mainly delay,\u201d said Britain\u2019s chief medical officer, although elements of the contain process would remain in place. British health authorities \u201cmay have had a communications fumble\u201d when they announced on Wednesday that they would not be providing daily updates on new coronavirus cases, the UK government\u2019s chief medical officer has told MPs. They are intending in the medium term to provide more detailed updates with what Chris Whitty described as \u201ca proper dashboard\u201d but they would be having a delay of 24 hours to make sure details were correct. Three more cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Scotland among people who have had contact with the previous patients, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to six. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, said the new cases were found in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde and Grampian NHS areas, and were all linked to the three previous cases. \u201cWith all these cases, our thoughts are with those diagnosed and their families. Scotland is well equipped to deal with this kind of infection and we are doing everything we can to contain the virus at this stage and minimise the risk to the public,\u201d she said. \u201cClinicians are now conducting contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with.\u201d Calderwood has echoed warnings from elsewhere in the UK that there is likely to be a significant surge in coronavirus cases, peaking in two to three months time. Following Scotland\u2019s first case at the weekend, two further cases were announced yesterday, after more than 850 negative tests for the virus. She said earlier this week that in a worst-case scenario between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected during the course of the epidemic, with 4% of those needing hospitalisation. There are now several cases in the UK where healthcare officials cannot see where coronavirus infection has come from clearly, whether it is from having been abroad or having been in contact with someone who has, Whitty adds. \u201cThat makes it highly likely that there is some level of community transmission in the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we should work on the assumption that it is here at very low levels and we should work on that assumption going forward.\u201d Although the total number of coronavirus cases in the world are still dominated by China, its numbers are coming down quickly, British MPs have been told by Professor Chris Whitty, the UK\u2019s chief medical adviser. He adds, however, that it won\u2019t be known if there will be a rebound until restrictions are lifted. Whitty is appearing along with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, in front of parliament\u2019s health committee. Chances of containing the outbreak globally are \u201cslim to zero\u201d, he said. British hospitals may currently not have enough respiratory resources to deal with absolutely everyone who would need to be treated in hospital, according to a senior executive. The health service was coping well at the moment, said Neil Dixon, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, whose members provide services to the National Health Service. \u201cOf course there may come a point where the level of infection becomes so great that the NHS and doctors and so on will have to make quite difficult choices about who to treat and when to treat them. \u201cIf you take something like intensive care, people make those choices at the moment. The answer is that there will be more of those kinds of choices going forward. Things like intensive care, we have got 4,000 beds, but we will be able to flex that, there will be more, and it\u2019s mostly about giving respiratory support to people. \u201cWe can put in many more beds like that, which are sort of intensive care beds, to treat larger and larger numbers of people, but there may come a point where you say: \u2018well I am not going to move somebody because, a, the movement itself might be more difficult, we may not have enough respiratory stuff to deal with absolutely everybody, but none of us know.\u201d It was, Dixon added, about getting a balance right in terms of reassuring people, and Britain \u201cprobably\u201d had one of the best health systems in the world. The British government has hinted it may reverse a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus. Heath minister Edward Argar acknowledged public concerns about the news that the government would not be releasing information about the location of new cases until a weekly round-up each Friday. Speaking to BBC Breakfast he admitted the government was \u201clearning every day\u201d and was looking at a \u201ctech solution\u201d to allow it to keep the public informed about the spread of disease. On Wednesday, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer said the government would stop providing daily updates on the location of patients who had tested positive \u201cdue to the number cases\u201d. The decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would led to the spread of fake news. Argar said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely right, that we give out as much information as we can.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is whether we can find a tech solution that will enable us to do that to keep people informed [which] is hugely important. But to do it in an efficient way that it\u2019s easy to administer and easy to get the information out.\u201d His remarks suggest the government is considering the example of South Korea where phone alerts are available to signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data. Argar said: \u201cMy boss, the health secretary, is clear that we will report on geographical spread and geographical locations, but there\u2019s a little bit of a lag time because of that big increase.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue with that geographical information because I think in anything of this sort, and it\u2019s a new disease, we\u2019re learning every day, how it works. Understandably, people will have concerns and questions. It\u2019s important that we share as much information as we can with the public to reassure and to keep people informed. So I think there is a positive from this in terms of public engagement.\u201d Fresh figures are expected in an hour on the state of the virus in Iran, which has reported 92 deaths among its more than 2,900 cases. In the meantime, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour tweets this graphic of how the Iranian ministry of health think the virus has spread across the country: Some 322 new coronavirus cases have been reported in South Korea, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), an official body. South Korea has been carrying out a mass testing initiative of tens of thousands of people since the end of January. Earlier, the total number of cases stood at 5,766, with 35 deaths. The US death toll from coronavirus has climbed to 11 as California reported its first fatality and declared a state of emergency over the virus. The death in California was of an elderly man with underlying health issues, who tested positive for the virus on Tuesday and was probably exposed while traveling on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico in February, public health officials said. It was the first death from the outbreak in the US outside of Washington state. The man lived in Placer county, an area north-east of Sacramento, near Tahoe national forest, and was kept in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville. It was the second confirmed case of coronavirus in the county. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the virus on Wednesday. In a statement, Newsom said he extended \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to those affected by the death in Placer county and that \u201cCalifornia is working around the clock to keep our communities safe, healthy and informed\u201d. As concern about coronavirus leads to Australian shoppers emptying shelves of toilet paper, one newspaper has decided to....er... do its bit to help alleviate shortages North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he hopes that neighbouring South Korea will overcome a coronavirus outbreak, President Moon Jae-in\u2019s office said on Thursday. In a letter to Moon delivered on Wednesday, Kim also voiced concern over Moon\u2019s health, and discussed his view of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Yoon Do-han, Moon\u2019s senior press secretary, told a briefing. South Korea is battling the biggest epidemic outside China and reported 438 new infections on Thursday for a total of 5,766. North Korea has meanwhile quarantined hundreds of foreigners in an attempt to stop the virus from breaking out, although other states have expressed concerns about that secrecy and the authoritarian nature of the country mean that it\u2019s unclear how the situation is developing there. Greece has reported its 10th case of coronavirus, a person related to an individual who recently travelled to Israel and Egypt, health authorities have said. On Wednesday the government ordered the closure of schools and banned public gatherings in three districts in the west of the country as a precaution after a person from the region tested positive for coronavirus, authorities said. That person had recently returned from a religious pilgrimage to Israel and Egypt. The ban was in effect for 48 hours and subject to review, authorities said. The cases come as Greek authorities react to a developing crisis as thousands of people arrive at the country\u2019s border with Turkey. About 12,500 people are estimated to be waiting on the Turkish side of the Greek border after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said on Saturday he would open his country\u2019s borders for refugees fleeing the nine-year war in Syria to cross into Europe. In India, where citizens have been advised not to travel to any country that is affected by the virus, the health ministry has issued a statement recording that there were 29 positive cases in the country by 4 March. It makes a range of other points including flagging up concerns around Indian pilgrims and students stranded in Tehran and Quam, Iran, which it describes as \u201cepicentres of the Iran Covid-19 outbreak\u201d. Funerals of coronavirus victims in Britain could be transmitted to mourners over the internet to prevent the spread of the disease if it becomes a pandemic, the Daily Telegraph reports. The paper says bereaved relatives who have come into close contact with victims would be at greater risk of contracting the illness themselves, resulting in the government seeking to discourage them from holding large funerals. It also cites official government pandemic planning documents which raise the prospect of crematoria being open 24 hours a day, and all week, to cope with up to 50,000 extra deaths per week in the worst case scenario. Chinese President Xi Jinping has postponed his state visit to Japan in April due to the coronavirus outbreak, Japan\u2019s government said Thursday. Xi was to have been the first Chinese president to visit Japan since Hu Jintao in May 2008. Xi was scheduled to meet Japan\u2019s emperor, Naruhito, attend a banquet at the imperial palace and hold talks with Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The leaders had hoped the visit would underline recent improvements in bilateral ties after years of tension over rival territorial claims to the Senkakus, a group of islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu. Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the two countries had agreed that their immediate focus should be on containing the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus continues to dominate the morning newspapers across Europe, including in the UK, where news of the collapse of Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest regional airline made it into later editions. The Guardian leads with our story on the UK government being accused of withholding information about the spread of coronavirus after a 70% increase in confirmed cases prompted health officials to stop providing daily updates on the location of new infections. In other titles, the Times leads with concerns that Britain\u2019s parliament could be suspended for months to prevents MPs spreading the virus. Others, including the Telegraph, and the Daily Mail lead on yesterday\u2019s news about the trebling of new cases of coronavirus, while the announcement that the new James Bond will will be postponed makes the front page of others such as the Mirror. Facebook has confirmed that a contractor at a Seattle office has been diagnosed with the coronavirus and the social media giant said it would close that location until March 9. \u201cA contractor based in our Stadium East office has been diagnosed with the COVID-19,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Facebook said it has notified employees, adding that workers in all Seattle locations were being encouraged to work from home until the end of the month. Seattle in Washington state has the largest concentration of coronavirus cases confirmed to date in the United States.

You can flag up news tips by emailing me at ben.quinn@theguardian.com or tweet me at @BenQuinn75 The Vietnamese government has released an educational coronavirus pop song \u2013 and it\u2019s a hit. In Australia, the ABC\u2019s Angelique Lu tweeted that the song had gone \u201cminor viral\u201din several countries. New infections, panic buying and schools closing continued worldwide, but Japan says the Olympics will go ahead in July. The death toll in mainland China passed 3,000, with a further 31 deaths on Wednesday taking the total toll to 3,012. All of the deaths were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. Confirmed cases in China rose by 139 to reach 80,409, and reversing two days of decreasing counts. South Korea\u2019s number of confirmed cases neared 6,000 on Thursday. So far 36 countries and regions have imposed a blanket entry ban on people who have recently been in the country\u2019s South, according to the foreign ministry in Seoul. California\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency after the announcement of the first virus-related death there. The state now has 53 confirmed cases. Italy closed all schools and universities until 15 March and ordered that all major sporting events be played behind closed doors. The virus has killed 107 people there, and spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions. Japan\u2019s Olympics minister said the Games would go ahead in July as planned, saying that cancelling \u201cwould be unacceptable for the athletes\u201d. The country has 1,036 cases and 12 people have died, its health ministry has said. Australia introduced a travel ban for South Korea and brought in enhanced screening for those arriving from Italy. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has said the government is \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. Germany\u2019s health minister has labelled the outbreak a pandemic, something the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,\u201d Spahn told German politicians. Panic buying continued around the world. Masks and toilet paper, in particular, remain in demand. And here\u2019s today\u2019s Coronavirus Latest \u2013 At a Glance, by Graham Russell: Italy\u2019s government is likely to increase the value of measures to help the economy withstand the coronavirus outbreak to to 5 billion euros (US$5.57 billion). Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said on Thursday. \u201cIt is likely that the government will reach (5 billion euros)\u201c Castelli said in an interview with daily Il Messaggero, adding that she thought it was \u201cnecessary to raise the bar as much as possible\u201d. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has promised tax breaks and other measures for the affected sectors worth 3.6 billion euros. A government source told Reuters on Wednesday this may be raised to 4.5 billion, or 0.25% of GDP. Apple Inc and Netflix Inc say they are pulling out of the South by Southwest music and tech festival to be held later this month, amid the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. death toll from coronavirus infections rose to 11 on Wednesday and California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency amid the nation\u2019s largest outbreak. Facebook Inc had said earlier this week it would not participate in the festival. Organisers of the South by Southwest music and tech festival, set to be held in Austin, Texas, had said last month the event would proceed as planned despite \u201ca handful\u201d of cancellations related to the virus. Shelves are being stripped bare of toilet rolls, hand sanitiser and surgical masks everywhere from Japan to France to the United States as panic buying criss-crosses the globe with the coronavirus, defying repeated calls for calm and disrupting supply chains, the AFP reports. Australia\u2019s biggest supermarket this week began rationing sales of toilet paper after police had to be called to a shop in Sydney when a knife was drawn in a scuffle over the scarce commodity. On Saturday Japan\u2019s prime minister took to Twitter to calm fears of a national shortage, while social media photos from the US show toilet paper shelves lying bare. Last month ten thousand people queued outside a Hong Kong shop that had secured a shipment of single-use surgical masks, and days later masks were voted the most desireable gifts to receive for Valentine\u2019s Day. In London, masks are now going for more than 100 times their normal retail price, while French authorities said they will requisition all face mask stocks and production. This is despite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying it did not \u201crecommend the use of facemasks\u201d to help combat the outbreak. Thailand has reported four new coronavirus cases. The latest cases bring the total to 47 since January, Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoen, director-general of the Department of Disease Control said in a news conference on Thursday. Correction: We reported earlier that the new Thai coronavirus cases involved people who had travelled from Iran, Italy and China. This was an error \u2013 they had travelled from Iran and Italy, with one case being a Chinese student who tested positive after being screened at Bangkok airport on his way from Iran to China, Reuters reports. A Turkish Airlines aircraft was flown back to Istanbul without any passengers on Thursday on orders from authorities in Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane on Tuesday tested positive for coronavirus. Singapore\u2019s aviation regulator said that the three pilots and 11 other crew of flight TK54 that had arrived on Tuesday were on the return flight to Istanbul, where they would be placed in quarantine. \u201cThe crew had come into close contact with a passenger on flight TK54 who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the Turkish Embassy, which has confirmed that the crew will be quarantined upon arrival at Istanbul,\u201d CAAS said. Singapore\u2019s transport ministry said in a statement on its website that authorities had begun tracing passengers on flight TK54 that may have had contact with the infected person. Here\u2019s a wrap on the latest coronavirus news from Helen Davidson and Justin McCurry. China\u2019s death toll passed 3,000, as Germany\u2019s health minister labelled the outbreak a pandemic and modelling in Australia predicted a worst-case scenario where millions could be infected with Covid-19. The developments came as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world. South Korea\u2019s number of confirmed cases neared 6,000 on Thursday and Italy ordered the closure of all schools after the virus spread to all but one of its 20 regions, killing 107 people. The UK has been warned an epidemic is likely. A further 31 virus deaths in China took the number of fatalities beyond 3,000 on Wednesday. All of the deaths were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases \u2013 a rise on the previous day\u2019s total. In the US, California declared a state of emergency over its 53 confirmed cases, and a cruise ship linked to the state\u2019s first virus death was being held off the coast of San Francisco. The Australian state of Western Australia has recorded its third case of coronavirus. The woman in her 30s returned to the state this week after travelling to Iceland and London and flying home via Dubai. State health minister Roger Cook, said the state had not yet recorded any cases of apparent on-soil transmission. \u201cWestern Australia remains coronavirus free in terms of internally contracted or transmitted cases,\u201d Cook told reporters in Perth on Thursday. \u201cAll the cases which have occurred in Western Australia have been those that have contracted the disease outside the state, so our ongoing campaign to constrain and isolate in relation to the coronavirus epidemic is still being highly successful.\u201d Dr Andy Robertson, Western Australia deputy chief health officer, said authorities were tracing the woman\u2019s movements. Robertson said she was not symptomatic on the plane and self-isolated when she became sick. The woman remains in home isolation. The other two cases in the state were a couple in their 70s who contracted the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and were transferred to Western Australia, where the 78-year-old man died. Cook said coronavirus clinics would be operational in the state from Tuesday and the state had spent $2.3m to purchase 50 new ventilators for hospitals. Just an update on what Australia\u2019s new travel restrictions involves. The government on Thursday banned the arrival of foreigners from South Korea It extended existing bans on foreigners arriving from mainland China and Iran and said there would be tougher screening processes for people arriving from Italy. New travel restrictions mean that any foreign traveller who has been in China, Iran and South Korea within two weeks of arriving in Australia will be turned away. The bans, which include anyone who has transited through those countries, will be reviewed on a weekly basis. Australian nationals and residents are exempt from the bans, but are required to self-isolate for two weeks on their return to Australia. Travellers from Italy will be given temperature checks and required to completed a detailed health questionnaire before they are cleared for entry. Most of the staff at a Sydney aged care home at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak did not turn up to work on Wednesday night because they were concerned about endangering their own family members, the union representing aged care workers has said. BaptistCare, which runs the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, refused to comment when asked if a number of staff had failed to turn up to their shift after news broke of a Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. But the Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes said the union had been told by staff at the facility that \u201cmost\u201d of the workers rostered to work on Wednesday night had called in sick and the shift was covered by a work hire agency. Residents at the aged care centre have been confined to their rooms and employees have been told to stay home and self-isolate if they show any symptoms, as health authorities struggle to contain the virus. Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt has told the ABC that a \u201cremote Indigenous community in the [A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ] has chosen to self-quarantine to prevent anyone coming in with coronavirus,\u201d ABC journalist Anna Henderson has said on Twitter. Australian officials have not been able to visit a citizen locked up in China because of coronavirus, and there are concerns for another person jailed in Iran, AAP reports. The global outbreak of coronavirus has prevented Australian consular officials from visiting a citizen locked up in a Chinese prison. There are also concerns for another Australian detained in Iran, where the virus has spread among prisoners. Australian writer and pro-democracy advocate Yang Hengjun has been detained in China since January last year. Dr Yang is granted one half-hour consular visit each month. However, Foreign Affairs official Andrew Todd said his February visit was cancelled by Chinese authorities due to COVID-19 control measures in place. \u201cThese same measures apply across all prisons in China,\u201d he told a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday. \u201cWe are seeking through our embassy in Beijing with Chinese authorities alternative ways of making contact with Dr Yang, either through a telephone call or through written correspondence.\u201d South Australian senator Rex Patrick asked whether the coronavirus posed any risk to Dr Yang. \u201cNot that we\u2019re aware of at this stage,\u201d Mr Todd said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that we\u2019re monitoring very closely with all Australian citizens detained across the world, but particularly in countries where there are current outbreaks of COVID-19.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s extra edition of the Science Weekly podcast looks at where exactly in the body Covid-19 infects us. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be releasing extra episodes of the podcast exploring some of those questions with experts on the frontline. In today\u2019s episode, Ian Sample investigates where the virus infects us when it enters our bodies, and what difference this makes to disease severity and transmissibility. The death toll in mainland China has passed 3,000, with a further 31 deaths on Wednesday taking the total toll to 3,012. Confirmed cases there rose by 139 to reach 80,409. California\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency after the announcement of the first virus-related death there. The state now has 53 confirmed cases. The victim, a 71-year-old man, travelled on the Grand Princess cruise ship last month, and the vessel is now being held off the coast of San Francisco while tests are conducted. Twenty one people on board have reported flu-like symptoms. Italy has closed all schools and universities until 15 March and ordered that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors. The virus has killed 107 people there, and spread to all but one of Italy\u2019s 20 regions Japan\u2019s Olympics minister has said cancelling or delaying the Games in July \u201cwould be unacceptable for the athletes\u201d. The country has 1,036 cases and 12 people have died, it\u2019s health ministry has said. Australia introduced a travel ban for South Korea and brought in enhanced screening for those arriving from Italy. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has said the government is \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. The health minister for New South Wales has said containment of the virus is now \u201cunlikely\u201d. Germany\u2019s health minister has labelled the outbreak a pandemic, something the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,\u201d Spahn told German politicians. The UK has seen the biggest daily increase to date, with cases jumping by more than 60% to 87 cases. India is restricting the export of several drugs, including paracetamol and antibiotics, leading to fears of a global shortage of essential medicines. The IMF has torn up its growth forecasts. The fund has warned this year\u2019s growth will be lower than last year\u2019s. Concerts, conferences and sporting events are being cancelled in countries around the world. MGM Universal has also announced the postponement of the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die. The Australian government has published guidelines for Australians who need to self-isolate either because they have been diagnosed with the virus, or because they\u2019ve been deemed at risk of acquiring it. As well as advising people to stay at home or in their hotel, including not going to public places, in particular work, school, childcare or university, the government has also issued advice on how to alleviate boredom while in isolation \u2013 including doing craft. \u201cKeep in touch with family members and friends via telephone, email or social media,\u201d the advice says. \u201cExercise regularly. Options could include exercise DVDs, dancing, floor exercises, yoga, walking around the backyard or using home exercise equipment, such as a stationary bicycle, if you have it. Exercise is a proven treatment for stress and depression. \u201cDon\u2019t rely too heavily on the television and technology. Treat quarantine as an opportunity to do some of those things you never usually have time for, such as board games, craft, drawing and reading.\u201d The selloff on world stock markets has been stemmed for now with decent gains across Asia Pacific on Thursday, but the issue of the virus is still front and centre in the minds of investors. Damien Klassen at Nucleus Wealth in Melbourne has been tracking the data and has posted some charts and thoughts on the firm\u2019s website. It\u2019s well worth a look, especially in light of what Australia\u2019s chief medical officer was saying earlier about the modelling scenarios about how it could infect millions in the worst case. Klassen makes the point that we should use data from South Korea, Singapore and the Diamond Princess to extrapolate how it might spread because figures from countries such as China , Italy and Iran come with question marks. For example, he questions how reliable Chinese data can be when South Korea now has more recorded cases than any Chinese province except Hubei. Also he looks at whether climate is a factor since there has been no significant outbreak so far in a tropical country. Japan\u2019s Olympics minister said the country is committed to hosting the summer games as planned from July even as the coronavirus outbreak spread to new parts of the country. \u201cCancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes,\u201d Seiko Hashimoto said in parliament on Thursday. The minister had caused controversy earlier this week by saying the contract for the games \u201ccould be interpreted as allowing a postponement\u201d within calendar 2020. Confirmed coronavirus infections rose to 1,036 nationwide as of Thursday morning, 36 more than the previous day, according to national broadcaster NHK. It was the biggest one-day increase to date, with new cases in locations ranging from Kumamoto prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north. The Australian toilet paper-buying urge is strong even for two Australian behavioural scientists Liam Smith and Celine Klemm write, \u201cHumans are finely attuned to monitoring what everybody else is doing (even subconsciously). Most of us use \u2018what other people do\u2019 as a mental shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are unsure. It\u2019s a simple decision mechanism called \u2018social proof heuristic\u2019, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For instance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, because it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are also more likely to reuse their towels if told that \u2018the majority of guests reuse their towels\u2019. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet paper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help decide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.\u201d An Australian newspaper has printed extra pages for people to use as toilet paper. Coronavirus-fulled panic buying has led to shortages of loo roll across the country in recent days. It\u2019s the panic that keeps on giving. #ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it has been dubbed on Twitter, has already rolled out hundreds of memes, witty asides as well as documented the madness of people stockpiling the toilet essential. In the real world it has led to Australian toilet paper manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand from people fearful of coronavirus. One newspaper has gone one step further by printing extra pages in its editions to help out those who have been \u2026 caught short. On Thursday the NT News, the Darwin-based newspaper with a national reputation for its headlines and antics, printed a special eight-page insert that can be cut into toilet paper. We have a bit more information about the latest cases from South Australia, from a press conference given at the Royal Adelaide hospital a short time ago. Two people, a baby and a 58-year-old man, tested positive to Covid-19 on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in South Australia to seven. The public health physician, Dr Nicola Spurrier, said the baby girl was the daughter of a 40-year-old woman who was hospitalised in Adelaide\u2019s Flinders Medical Center on Wednesday after testing positive for the virus. The woman arrived in Adelaide from Iran via Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. \u201cThe little bub, the child of the mother that is currently in Flinders Medical Centre has tested positive but I am very pleased to report that the child is well and both mother and baby are doing well in that facility,\u201d Spurrier said. The 58-year-old man, from Taiwan, arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday and was taken to the Royal Adelaide hospital to be isolated on Thursday. Spurrier said authorities were also tracing any possible contacts that a 24-year-old South Australian woman, who returned from Europe on Sunday and had travelled through Italy, may have made since returning to Adelaide. That woman tested positive on Wednesday. \u201cThere are a number of places that that young woman visited before she had the test results and we are all following through on those potential places,\u201d Spurrier said. Italian tourists have been caught trying to evade virus containment in Mauritania A group of Italian tourists tried to escape coronavirus confinement in Mauritania but were caught and sent back to their home country, the West African country said Wednesday. The 15 tourists arrived in the capital Nouakchott on Saturday planning to travel to the northern tourist hub of Atar, health ministry spokesman Abdelkader Ould Ahmed told AFP. But Mauritania has imposed a confinement period on travellers from countries considered to be a high coronavirus risk \u2013 including Italy, which has Europe\u2019s most cases with more than 3,000 as well as 107 deaths. Italy\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed that the tourists had since all returned home, \u201cassisted by our diplomatic network\u201d. The Mauritanian spokesman said the confinement rules applied to \u201call travellers from risk areas, without distinction\u201d. He added that this \u201crigour has paid off\u201d as the country has yet to register a case of coronavirus. Hong Kong has warned residents not to kiss pets after a dog contracted coronavirus Hong Kong authorities have warned people to avoid kissing their pets, but also to not panic and abandon them after a dog repeatedly tested \u201cweak positive\u201d for coronavirus. The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said experts unanimously agreed the results suggested the dog had \u201ca low-level of infection and it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission\u201d. The Pomeranian\u2019s owner was infected with Covid-19 but the dog itself was not showing symptoms, authorities said. Coronavirus has spread to almost all of Iran\u2019s provinces President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that while the virus has spread to almost all of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces, the country will get through the outbreak with a \u201cminimum\u201d number of deaths, Reuters reports. \u201cThis disease is a widespread disease,\u201d he said during a Cabinet meeting, according to the official presidency website. The health ministry said on Tuesday that 92 people had died so far from coronavirus, one of the highest death tolls outside China where the epidemic originated late last year. It said 2,922 people had been infected with the disease. Among those infected is first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri, the IranWire news site reported, citing an \u201cinformed source\u201d. There was no immediate confirmation from officials. Several Iranian officials have come down with coronavirus and one senior official died from an infection on Monday. The Islamic Republic has cancelled Friday prayers in all provincial capitals this week because of the coronavirus outbreak, state television reported on Wednesday. In the US, all NASA employees will be working from home on Friday, POLITICO reports. The measure is partly in order to \u201cstress test\u201d their remote work technologies in case an extended period of remote work. A cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California is being held off the coast of San Francisco, with 21 people on board reporting possible symptoms. Seven in 10 people worldwide would support sealing off entire cities or towns affected by coronavirus to slow the spread of infection, according to a poll of citizens in 10 countries, Reuters reports. As health authorities battle to stop a worldwide pandemic, a clear majority backed lockdowns to prevent anyone entering or leaving urban areas that have seen large numbers of coronavirus cases, found the survey by polling firm Ipsos. \u201cEven in Italy, where this is already happening, 60% support the total quarantine of affected towns and cities,\u201d Darrell Bricker, head of Ipsos Public Affairs said. Europe\u2019s largest regional airline collapses, Coronavirus last straw Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest regional airline, has collapsed into administration less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal. The impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline, which operates almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial \u00a3100m loan. Stronger airlines are likely to follow. In Australia, the Guardian has confirmed that a baby has been diagnosed with Covid-19 in South Australia. The baby\u2019s mother was diagnosed yesterday, after returning to the country from Iran on Sunday. Both the mother and child diagnosed with Covid-19 in South Australia are at Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide. Trump has attempted to blame Obama for coronavirus test kit shortage Donald Trump sought to shift blame on to the Obama administration for a nationwide coronavirus test kit shortage. The president on Wednesday blamed a federal agency decision during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, which Trump said made it harder to quickly roll out testing for the virus. \u201cThe Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we\u2019re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,\u201d he told reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, whom he had called to discuss the economic effects of the outbreak. \u201cThat was a decision we disagreed with,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.\u201d Virus is \u2018once in 100 years catastrophe\u2019 \u2013 hedge fund boss Ray Dalio, one of Wall Street\u2019s highest profile hedge fund bosses, has described the coronavirus as \u201cone of those once in 100 years catastrophic events\u201d that will hit companies with large debt levels the hardest and potentially lead to a significant economic downturn. The founder of Bridgewater Associates, a fund with $160bn in assets, said the crisis could be broken into three parts: 1) the virus, 2) the economic impact of reactions to the virus, and 3) the market action. The market website Livewire has posted excerpts from his comments on Linkedin. Dalio says that the US Fed\u2019s rate cuts \u2013 and similar actions by other central banks from Australia to Canada \u2013 won\u2019t do much to boost demand, although they might \u201cgoose risky asset prices a bit\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s true in the US. In Europe and Japan, monetary policy is virtually out of gas so it\u2019s difficult to imagine how pure monetary policy will work. In Europe, it will be interesting to see if fiscal policy stimulations can pick up in this political environment.\u201d Chinese social media censors blocked neutral information about the coronavirus outbreak when they targeted references to the outbreak on WeChat and other platforms, a report has found. Hundreds of keywords and keyword combinations, including \u201cWuhan seafood market\u201d and \u201cSars variation\u201d were censored in late December, as doctors sought to warn about the new virus. Here is the full story on that press conference with Australia\u2019s New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard regarding the on-soil spread of coronavirus in the state. In China, a 36-year-old man who had been confirmed to have the virus and was discharged from a hospital in Wuhan on 26 February has died, according to the Chinese publication the Paper, who cited his wife. The man suddenly became ill on 2 March and died after going to the hospital. The cause of death was respiratory failure caused by Covid-19. China has been noting daily increases in the number of people \u201ccured\u201d or discharged from hospitals after being confirmed to have the virus. But, after several cases of released patients testing positive again, authorities in Hubei ordered that released patients be quarantined for another 14 days. Beijing Ditan Hospital in Beijing has meanwhile found that a patient who tested positive for Covid-19 has suffered viral encephalitis caused by the virus, adding to evidence the infections can cause damage to patients\u2019 nervous systems. Hong Kong residents who had been stuck in Hubei province, the source of the outbreak, have returned on flights chartered by the Hong Kong government. There were 244 passengers. Another 200 are expected to be brought back today. Anyone showing symptoms or a high temperature has not been allowed to board, and all will undergo quarantine for two weeks, the Hong Kong government said. Among the group are 14 pregnant women and 22 people in need of medical care, including cancer patients. South Korea\u2019s total number of novel coronavirus cases \u2013 the largest outside China \u2013 approached 6,000 on Thursday as authorities reported 145 new infections. The total stood at 5,766, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, with 35 deaths. So far 36 countries and regions have imposed a blanket entry ban on people who have recently been in the South, according to the foreign ministry in Seoul. Nearly 90 percent of the national total occurred in the southern city of Daegu and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province. Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison says there is \u201cno suggestions that there should be no mass gatherings\u201d in the country, as he said the outbreak in Australia was significantly less challenging than those in other countries \u2013 in response to what the significance might be for Australia\u2019s economy. He urged any Australians experiencing symptoms to \u201cdo the right thing by their fellow Australians\u201d and \u201cprevent the spread of the virus\u201d. Still in Australia for now, the Guardian\u2019s Katharine Murphy has asked Scott Morrison to elaborate on the travel travel ban regarding South Korea. Part of the reason, Morrison responded, was the number of travellers arriving in Australia from South Korea. \u201cThe volume of travellers coming out of the Republic of Korea was more than five times what it is out of Italy,\u201d he said. It \u201cmay well be possible within a matter of days or weeks to be able to ensure that we can deal with that,\u201d he said, but for now the travel ban was \u201cthe way to go\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Martin has asked Morrison and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy about what they know about the likely spread of transmission in Australia. Murphy said the government is \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks.\u201d Scott Morrison then jumped in to say the government had \u201cbeen careful not to be speculative about this in the public domain. What we have done all the way through this global health crisis, I think, is to be very candid and up front and we will continue to do that but what we won\u2019t do is be speculative, because we\u2019re not in the position of creating unnecessary anxiety.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has addressed Australia\u2019s toilet paper hoarding behaviour as he urged the public to behave as they usually would. \u201cAt the moment, there is no reason to put a mask on when you are walking around the shops, there is no reason to stop going to football matches or community activities, there is no reason to dilute the shelves of lavatory paper in the supermarkets. We should continue a normal activity, we should watch the development of this and, we will focus on any outbreaks and control.\u201d Australia\u2019s federal chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has said the government is \u201cvery worried about Iran.\u201d Australia\u2019s National Security Committee is reviewing the progress of its preparations for a potential pandemic, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said. \u201cThat has gone from everything from availability of surgical masks and in particular, to working with the health sector,\u201d he said. He added that work was ongoing in particular with regard to Indigenous communities and aged care. \u201cWe have always gone about business with common sense and that is what we are known for so let\u2019s do that,\u201d he added. More on Australia\u2019s travel measures regarding South Korea from Prime Minister Scott Morrison: \u201cIn relation to the Republic of Korea, we will also be upgrading the travel advice to level three, which is to reconsider the need to travel to the Republic of Korea, and it will be at level four which is do not travel to the province of Daegu.\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is speaking now, and has announced that the current travel bans regarding mainland China and Iran will continue. A new travel ban has been put in place for the Republic of Korea, and enhanced screening measures are being introduced at airports for travellers arriving from Italy. Hong Kong authorities have confirmed the 105th case of Covid-19, in a 69-year-old Happy Valley woman who recently returned from India. The woman had an underlying illness, and fell sick in India on 23 February, the day before she returned home to Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific flight CX694 from New Delhi. Four days later she developed a fever and consulted a Chinese medical practitioner twice, before visiting an out-patient clinic on 3 March. After testing positive for Covid-19 the woman was admitted to Ruttonjee hospital on Wednesday, and is in a stable condition. The woman\u2019s husband and the domestic helper who lives with them are asymptomatic and will be quarantined, the government said. Passengers onboard the 24 February flight are urged to contact 2125 1122 if they are concerned. Authorities in New South Wales, Australia are assessing a group of children from a childcare centre who visited a Sydney aged care home last month, before four people at the centre were diagnosed with Covid-19. Four people at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home in Macquarie Park, including a 95-year-old woman who has since died and an aged care worker, have been diagnosed with the virus. The centre has been placed into isolation. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said young children were \u201coften super spreaders\u201d of respiratory illnesses and that he was recommending visits by childcare centres to aged care homes be discontinued. Meanwhile, authorities are also trying to contact 77 doctors and primary care officials who were at a radiology conference on 18 February that the 53-year-old doctor from Ryde Hospital, who tested positive to the virus, and another registrar from Liverpool hospital, who also has the virus, both attended. In New Zealand, the third person infected with coronavirus is a man 40s lives in Auckland. Close family members of his have recently returned from Iran. \u201cThis third case of COVID-19 is classified as what we suspect is a case of family transmission. There is what appears to be a clear link with travel to Iran by a close family member,\u201d the Ministry of Health said. The man is now at home in self-isolation as he doesn\u2019t require hospital care, nor does anyone else in the family home, who are self-isolating with him. A medical centre where the man sought advice has been notified, and two schools where the man\u2019s family members attended have sent children home for self-isolation. No other children are showing symptoms at this stage. In Australia, New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard has said there is an \u201cevolution\u201d happening in the spread of coronavirus around the world. While there had been \u201cno substantial change\u201d overnight in New South Wales, seven of the state\u2019s infections appeared to have been \u201con-soil,\u201d he said. There are currently 22 infections in the state. \u201cNew South Wales health is doing everything they can to try to still contain it, but we do know that containment is likely to be an unlikely outcome,\u201d he said. Japan\u2019s infections pass 1,000 Japan\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections rose above 1,000 on Wednesday, most of them from a quarantined cruise liner, as Olympics organisers dismissed speculation that the Tokyo Summer Games could be cancelled. Twelve people have died in Japan, six from the cruise chip, the health ministry said. The president of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics said the option of cancelling the Games was not on the table, responding to deepening speculation of a delay or cancellation. \u201cI am totally not considering this,\u201d Yoshiro Mori told reporters at a briefing when asked about a possible cancellation. Asked when the organisers could decide on changes to the Olympics, Mori, a former prime minister, said: \u201cI\u2019m not God, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mainland China had 139 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said on Thursday, up from 119 cases a day earlier, and 125 cases on March 2. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 80,409. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 3,012 as of the end of Wednesday, up by 31 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, accounted for all of the new deaths. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 23 people died. California governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus in the state, which now has has 53 confirmed cases. Earlier on Wednesday, health officials announced the first California death from the virus, an elderly person with underlying health conditions. It was the first coronavirus fatality in the United States outside of Washington state, where 10 have died. A M\u0101ori tribe in New Zealand\u2019s capital city has banned the traditional hongi at gatherings this week as more cases of coronavirus emerge. A hongi is a traditional form of greeting in which two people press their noses to each other and inhale one another\u2019s breath. In Wellington, local iwi (tribe) said a temporary ban would be placed on hongi between members at gatherings this week. On Wednesday night a third case was confirmed and the ministry of health asked for calm after sufferers and their families were criticised on social media. In Australia, health officials in the Northern Territory are yet to determine if any residents of small and remote Indigenous communities have been exposed to Covid-19 after the first diagnosis. A 52-year-old tourist tested positive to the disease and is now in isolation at Royal Darwin Hospital. The man flew to Darwin from Sydney on flight QF840 on Tuesday. NT Chief medical officer Dianne Stephens said it is unclear if any remote community-based Aboriginal people were on the plane, and it is impossible to determine how many people may have come into contact with the man. Stephens also said it was unclear how long it would take for a test undertaken in a remote community to reach the state\u2019s only available Covid-19 testing laboratory in Darwin, meaning diagnosis could be delayed if a case were to occur in remote NT. She said a Remote Health Pandemic Plan will be released by Monday. The government\u2019s current advice says that anyone who may have come into contact with the virus should seek accommodation within three hours of major municipalities in the state, and not visit or return to a remote community, even if they live there. Germany\u2019s health minister, Jens Spahn, said Wednesday the coronavirus outbreak has become a pandemic \u2013 defined as an epidemic that spreads throughout the world through local transmission, AFP reports. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak in China has become a global pandemic,\u201d Jens Spahn told German lawmakers. The World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring a pandemic, though has said the world must prepare for the possibility. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,\u201d Jens Spahn told German lawmakers. The virus has reached 81 countries and territories around the world, with South Korea, Iran and Italy emerging as hotspots outside China. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus. More than 100 people have now died in Italy. As the virus spreads further across Europe, schools and universities are closing, large events are being cancelled, and the economic outlook continues to be grim. The Italian government has ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March, as 28 more people die in 24 hours. The UK has seen the biggest daily increase recorded to date, with the number of coronavirus cases jumping by more than 60% to 87 case. India is restricting the export of several drugs, including paracetamol and antibiotics, leading to fears of a global shortage of essential medicines. The IMF has torn up its growth forecasts. The fund has warned this year\u2019s growth will be lower than last year\u2019s. Concerts, conferences and sporting events are being cancelled in countries around the world. MGM Universal has also announced the postponement of the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die.
