These are instances that occur when a patient is seriously harmed in spite of all the protocols and protective measures to prevent this happening. \u201cNever events\u201d are such serious, manmade disasters that most clinicians involved in them will bear the burden of such tragic events for the rest of their careers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You are not fit to lecture us any more about what we need in our NHS hospitals</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Like many junior doctors who have worked in overwhelmed and understaffed A&amp;E departments, I\u2019ve seen things happen as a result of the overstretched conditions that I believe should be classed as \u201cnever events\u201d.

Just stop for a moment \u2013 please \u2013 and think of the human consequences of your NHS underfunding. The NHS everywhere is desperately underfunded and understaffed \u2013 and this is on you and your party of government.
