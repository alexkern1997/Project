      "bodyText": "Australia is yet to gain permission from the Chinese government to evacuate hundreds of citizens trapped in the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan, despite the US and other countries having already been granted access to the region. As some people on Christmas Island express fears of becoming a \u201cleper colony\u201d after the government said it would be used to quarantine evacuees, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, confirmed on Thursday morning that officials were still to win the \u201cagreement of Chinese authorities for this process\u201d. \u201cThis is a process we are undertaking with Chinese authorities and as both the prime minister and I indicated yesterday it requires the seeking of formal approval,\u201d she told ABC Radio. \u201cThose discussions are under way through the ministry of foreign affairs and also through our temporary consular team in Wuhan.\u201d Asked why Australia was still in negotiations while other nations had already begun the evacuation process, Payne said the government did not have a consular presence in Wuhan, meaning it was forced to relocate officials from Shanghai. Globally there are now more than 6,000 confirmed cases of the respiratory illness, including more than 130 deaths, mainly in Wuhan, while seven cases have been diagnosed in Australia. Two Australian citizens now in China have contracted coronavirus. The Australian government has said Australian citizens who are in China but who are already sick with a confirmed or suspected case of coronavirus will not be flown out. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said he had been advised that two Australians had contracted the virus in Guangdong province. It was unclear if they had previously been in Hubei. \u201cThey have been treated and the advice that I have \u2013 and I would want to be cautious on this \u2013 is that they have been released and are not seeking consular assistance at this stage.\u201d Payne said the government would prioritise isolated vulnerable people in the area. More than 600 citizens have registered as being in Hubei province. In response to the crisis, Scott Morrison announced on Wednesday that evacuees would be quarantined on Christmas Island for 14 days, a decision that has angered some locals. The Christmas Island shire president, Gordon Thomson, told Guardian Australia the decision to use the territory reflected \u201cregressive colonialist treatment\u201d. Already a critic of the government\u2019s use of the island to detain asylum seekers, Thomson said he had learned of the plan by seeing it on the news and was worried that \u201cnow we\u2019ll be a leper colony\u201d. Peter Dutton defended the plan on Thursday, saying it was designed to keep the broader population safe. \u201cI can\u2019t clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 people,\u201d the home affairs minister told the Nine Network on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a facility otherwise that can take this number of people. I want to make sure that we keep Australians safe.\u201d Dutton said the plan had been hatched in consultation with Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, who receives frequent advice from the World Health Organization. Given the concerns from Christmas Island residents, Dutton later told reporters that evacuees would be kept in an isolation area until they received medical clearance. \u201cMy clear message to people on Christmas Island is we won\u2019t be using the medical centre or the health facilities on Christmas Island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be utilising other areas, common areas, on Christmas Island.\u201d Dutton also dismissed Thomson\u2019s criticism, describing him as a \u201cmember of the Labor party\u201d. He said the government had tried to contact him on Wednesday before the decision was announced. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was unclear whether the decision to use the remote territory was \u201cmotivated by a genuine belief that\u2019s the only option or embarrassment the government opened Christmas Island\u201d. Qantas has offered its aircraft for use in the evacuation, which is a joint operation with New Zealand. But the design of the island\u2019s runaway means that it cannot land with a full passenger load. The airline is reportedly looking at landing a passenger plane on the mainland, before transferring the evacuees to Christmas Island using a smaller aircraft. It is also still considering whether to halt flights to China after British Airways took that step this week. Dutton said on Thursday that was a decision for Qantas. The airline was contacted for comment. Also on Thursday, the New Zealand foreign minister, Winston Peters, cast doubt on a mooted plan to coordinate its own evacuation efforts with Australia. Peters said officials from both countries would continue discussions in Wuhan on Thursday, but added that the New Zealanders would be quarantined in their home country and not on Christmas Island. The Australian government has confirmed that those evacuated will have to contribute financially to the trip.",

Known as the Bileola family after the Queensland town where they had built a life, Priya, Nadesalingam and their children, Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, were sent to Christmas Island in August after the federal court granted an injunction to halt their deportation. The family are the sole inhabitants of the island\u2019s detention centre, which was controversially re-opened by the Morrison government in March and has so far cost taxpayers $26.8m. Freelance journalist Rebekah Holt said the family was in the dark about Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement that the island would be used as a quarantine area until she contacted them. \u201cThey hadn\u2019t been informed of any of the government\u2019s plans to use the centre as an evacuation centre for the Wuhan people. \u201cIt was rough, [Priya] burst into tears,\u201d Holt added. At a press conference on Thursday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton said that the area where the family is staying was a \u201ccompletely separate area\u201d from the isolation zone the government intends to establish. \u201cPeople stay within the centre until we get medical clearance for them to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy clear message to people on Christmas Island is we won\u2019t be using the medical centre or the health facilities on Christmas Island. \u201cPeople who have come from China from this province will be restricted to the isolation area and there is a decision that\u2019s made under the Biosecurity Act to declare that zone.\u201d But Holt said she has spent her phone call with Priya \u201ctrying to reassure her because she was very upset\u201d. \u201cShe was just in shock at the idea that people who are that sick were being bought to the island,\u201d Holt said. Those concerns compound the difficulties the family is already facing on the island. Both children have experienced health issues while in detention. More recently, Kopika has just started school, but Holt said she has been experiencing an allergic reaction believed to be related to mosquitos.

      "bodyText": "New Zealand is launching an independent rescue mission to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, chartering an Air New Zealand plane a day after saying it was working on a joint operation with Australia. The foreign minister, Winston Peters, said the government has agreed with the national carrier to arrange a plane that can carry 300 people from Wuhan to New Zealand. There are currently 82 New Zealanders registered on Safetravel as being in Wuhan, and 57 of those have sought consular assistance. Any additional seats on the Air New Zealand flight would be allocated to Pacific Islanders and Australians \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d, Peters said. The announcement comes a day after Australia announced that its evacuated citizens would be quarantined on Christmas Island. New Zealand quickly confirmed any of its citizens evacuated from Wuhan would not be sent to Christmas Island \u2013 which was formerly one of Australia\u2019s most prominent asylum processing centres \u2013 but would instead be quarantined somewhere in New Zealand. New Zealand consular officials joined an Australian consular team in Wuhan on Thursday to work through the details of the evacuation plan, the ministry of foreign affairs said, but it appears the two governments are no longer collaborating on a joint rescue mission. \u201cThis is a complex operation as we work through all the necessary requirements but we are working to have the aircraft depart as soon as possible,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage all New Zealanders in the Hubei region to register on Safetravel and ensure all their details are accurate and up to date. This will give us a better understanding of the level of demand for this flight.\u201d Passengers on the Air New Zealand would be asked to pay a nominal fee for their rescue flight, although the New Zealand government would be footing most of the bill. It is unclear whether other governments have asked their citizens to help pay for the cost of their travel. Consular teams are working with health officials to ensure that the risks of transmission of the coronavirus to New Zealand are carefully managed throughout the evacuation process, Peters said, and officials are working on procedures for pre-departure health screenings, infection control inflight, and isolation of all passengers arriving in New Zealand for up to two weeks. It was not yet known where the Wuhan evacuees would be quarantined once they arrive in New Zealand, though the country\u2019s director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said teams were already preparing for their arrival. Peters said it was not clear yet whether New Zealand consular staff would be evacuated from China but all options were being looked at and the situation on the ground was \u201cof major concern\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overreact until we know what we\u2019re reacting too, and against,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Australia and New Zealand agreed to a joint rescue mission to bring their citizens home, and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said more than 400 Australians would be flown to Christmas Island to be screened and quarantined. Qantas has offered a plane for the mission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the whole world must be on alert to deal with the spread of coronavirus, and urged countries to prepare. WHO will reconvene its expert committee on Thursday to decide whether to declare the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Total deaths now stand at 170, all in China, with 7,183 confirmed cases. Just 68 cases have been confirmed outside China, in 15 countries, but in three countries, Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there is evidence of human-to-human transmission, raising fears over the spread of the disease. There have been no cases of the virus detected in New Zealand, but flights arriving from China are being met by public health officials in Auckland and Christchurch, and anyone feeling unwell has been asked to self-quarantine.",

UK factories produced 1.3m cars during 2019, a decline of more than 14% on 2018, according to data published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It represented the third consecutive annual decline in production since 2016, the year of the EU referendum, amid a freeze in investment and shutdowns from major manufacturers preparing for multiple Brexit deadlines that never actually arrived.

However, borrowing for the first nine months of the 2019 financial year stood at \u00a354.6bn, about 8% higher than it was for the same period in 2018.

According to the accountancy firm Deloitte\u2019s survey of company finance bosses, one of the first early warning indicators since the election, which is closely watched by the Bank and the Treasury, found that 53% of respondents were more optimistic than three months earlier about the outlook. This was up from only 9% in the last survey conducted in October. Uncertainty over Brexit and the election had led many companies to pause their investment plan. While there are hopes of a bounce in economic activity at the start of the year, analysts warn the improvement could be short-lived if the country appears to be heading for a disruptive no-deal scenario at the end of 2020. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/brexit-dashboard-auto\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/07/brexit-dashboard-enhancer-v2\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Better than forecast Public borrowing falls despite corporate tax slump The government borrowed less than expected in December despite a signal that the economy\u2019s weakness at the end of last year hit corporate tax receipts. The ONS said the budget deficit \u2013 which measures the shortfall between public spending and tax income \u2013 stood at \u00a34.8bn in December, down slightly from the same month a year ago. City economists had forecast borrowing of \u00a35.3bn. However, borrowing for the first nine months of the 2019 financial year stood at \u00a354.6bn, about 8% higher than it was for the same period in 2018. Corporate tax receipts for the year to date were down by 3.4%, the sharpest annual drop since 2012-13, in a signal that weaker economic growth has dragged down tax receipts. Better than forecast Political clarity boosts housing market Britain\u2019s housing market showed signs of recovering in December, as agreed home sales rose for the first time since May and expectations of future sales jumped after the election. The gauge from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 which shows the difference between its members reporting price rises and falls \u2013 picked up to -2 in December from -11 a month earlier, beating the forecasts of City economists. Growth in UK house prices has eased since the Brexit vote, with prices falling on an annual basis in London and some surrounding areas. Prices have continued to rise in the Midlands and the north of England. Separate figures showed the number of mortgages approved by high street banks jumped to the highest level for almost five years in December. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Business optimism rebounds after Johnson landslide The unequivocal election result in December prompted the highest surge in confidence for 11 years, as hopes rise in the City that Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpectedly decisive victory could lift some of the intense political uncertainty holding back the British economy. According to the accountancy firm Deloitte\u2019s survey of company finance bosses, one of the first early warning indicators since the election, which is closely watched by the Bank and the Treasury, found that 53% of respondents were more optimistic than three months earlier about the outlook. This was up from only 9% in the last survey conducted in October. Uncertainty over Brexit and the election had led many companies to pause their investment plan. While there are hopes of a bounce in economic activity at the start of the year, analysts warn the improvement could be short-lived if the country appears to be heading for a disruptive no-deal scenario at the end of 2020.",

Speculation has been rising that the Bank of England will cut interest rates on Thursday to reboot growth on the eve of leaving the EU.</p> \n<p>However, there are also early shoots of recovery from a surge in business confidence since Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpected decisive election victory, which could tempt the Bank to leave borrowing costs on hold at Mark Carney\u2019s final rate-setting meeting in charge at Threadneedle Street. Carney will stand down in March to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">replaced by Andrew Bailey</a>.</p> \n<p>To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian has been monitoring eight economic indicators over the past three years, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100.</p> \n<p>City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before the data was released, and in six cases over the past month the outcome was better than expected, raising hopes that Britain can rebound from a period of lacklustre growth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5dd78891-e3db-4501-9452-9c2dbfa77686\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Does 31 January change anything?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration.</p>\n    <p>Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty that comes into force. It carries sanctions for any \u201cbacksliding or half measures\u201d, as Michel Barnier\u2019s adviser Stefaan de Rynck has pointed out.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> has been restricted.

The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who will be negotiating for the UK?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada\u2019s new deal with the EU.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What about Northern Ireland?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said in January that the EU and the UK would have to be \u201cvery disciplined\u201d if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.</p>\n    <p>Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson\u2019s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/revealed-complex-post-brexit-checks-for-northern-irish-traders\">some of these will be mandatory</a>.</p>\n    <p>Helen McEntee, Ireland\u2019s minister for European affairs has contradicted him directly, telling Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge: \u201cThere will be no checks&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up a working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As the country prepares to embark on a period of intense trade negotiations with Brussels that will define the economic landscape for years to come, the gloomiest of forecasts made ahead of the Brexit vote have not come to pass. Joblessness is at the lowest level since the mid 1970s, while wage growth has accelerated to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/uk-wages-rise-at-fastest-rate-for-a-decade-despite-brexit-risks\">highest levels in a decade</a>.</p> \n<p>However, it comes after an initial shock to the economy caused by the pound falling to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">lowest point in 31 years</a> straight after the June 2016 Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of importing goods to Britain.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is close to a turning point as the country prepares to formally leave the EU after almost half a century of membership, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. More than three and a half years after voting to leave, the UK will formally depart on Friday with the economy close to stalling point following repeated cliff-edge deadlines and intense political uncertainty over the country\u2019s future trading relationships with the EU and other countries. In the Guardian\u2019s final Brexit watch before the exit date, warning lights are flashing with zero growth forecast for the final three months of 2019 amid intense political uncertainty, rounding off the worst year for growth outside of a recession since the second world war. Speculation has been rising that the Bank of England will cut interest rates on Thursday to reboot growth on the eve of leaving the EU. However, there are also early shoots of recovery from a surge in business confidence since Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpected decisive election victory, which could tempt the Bank to leave borrowing costs on hold at Mark Carney\u2019s final rate-setting meeting in charge at Threadneedle Street. Carney will stand down in March to be replaced by Andrew Bailey. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian has been monitoring eight economic indicators over the past three years, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before the data was released, and in six cases over the past month the outcome was better than expected, raising hopes that Britain can rebound from a period of lacklustre growth. As the country prepares to embark on a period of intense trade negotiations with Brussels that will define the economic landscape for years to come, the gloomiest of forecasts made ahead of the Brexit vote have not come to pass. Joblessness is at the lowest level since the mid 1970s, while wage growth has accelerated to the highest levels in a decade. However, it comes after an initial shock to the economy caused by the pound falling to the lowest point in 31 years straight after the June 2016 Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of importing goods to Britain. Inflation surged, squeezing living standards to leave the average family at least \u00a31,500 worseoff than under a remain outcome, according to the Resolution Foundation. Growth in the UK economy has gone from the fastest in the G7 to among the weakest, with business investment flatlining as companies put their investment plans on hold to await greater clarity over Brexit. Repeated cliff-edge Brexit deadlines triggered booms in stockpiling as firms feared disruption at the borders and higher costs of trade with the EU, distorting quarterly growth and leading to boom and bust in the economy. In the past month, figures show consumers reined in their spending over the key Christmas shopping period, in a blow for struggling retailers, while the world economy faces fresh risks from the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. Financial markets have been rocked in the past week as fears spread over the impact on trade. Analysts fear there could be knock-on effects for UK firms, at a delicate moment after years of disruption to the UK and world economy from the US-China trade war. However, the bright spots on the dashboard from a resilient jobs market and rising business confidence suggest Britain could be reaching a turning point. According to the consultancy Capital Economics, annual growth is set to accelerate from 1% this year to 1.8% in 2021 as the country turns a corner. However, two former members of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) warned that the tight timescale for reaching a deal with the EU that Boris Johnson has imposed could derail the recovery. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, who is now a senior adviser to the consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, said: \u201cEven if economic growth does recover somewhat in the next couple of quarters, the progress of the UK economy is likely to remain sluggish in 2020.\u201d With inflation significantly below the Bank\u2019s 2% target rate set by the government, David Blanchflower, another former member of the MPC, called on the Bank to cut rates to reboot the economy. Writing in the Guardian, he said: \u201cIf CPI was above the target by a similar amount, at 2.7% the MPC would almost surely raise rates. But the target is meant to be symmetric. Doing nothing is worse than doing something and there may well be lots of bad data ahead. It is hard to see how a cut could possibly hurt. It is always best to get your retaliation in first.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Britons on continent still worried Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray here to straighten out a few things before the day gets started. The European parliament has ratified the withdrawal agreement with its Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, twice gave its blood to liberate Europe.\u201d Emotions ran high, with MEPs breaking into a rendition of Auld Lang Syne after the parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, announced the result of the vote \u2013 621 in favour, 49 against and 13 abstentions. The debate turned raucous at one point when Nigel Farage took the floor. \u201cOnce we have left we are never coming back and the rest is detail.\u201d At the end of his speech Farage and his Brexit party MEPs were asked to leave, and obliged, after brandishing miniature union jacks. Sassoli concluded the session by quoting the murdered British MP Jo Cox, who was killed during the 2016 referendum campaign: \u201cWe have a lot more in common than divides us.\u201d British citizens living in the EU remain confused and worried about their post-Brexit healthcare and pension entitlements, despite the fact that both issues were settled in the withdrawal agreement, a Guardian callout suggests. But with 80% of the estimated 1.3 million Britons on the continent of working age or younger, the withdrawal agreement\u2019s failure to guarantee continued rights to free movement, cross-border working and recognition of professional qualifications for Britons remains of real concern, says Laura Shields, spokesperson for the lobby group British in Europe. \u201cThe settlement for healthcare provision and state pensions is actually quite satisfactory.\u201d * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 A British flight to bring about 200 nationals back to the UK has been unable to take off by this morning as planned. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking urgently\u201d to organise a flight to the UK \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese government have been reported. The death toll in China from the coronavirus has climbed to 170 \u2013 follow updates at our live blog. * * * Car output driven down \u2013 British car manufacturing has slumped for a third consecutive year, with UK factories producing 1.3m cars in 2019, a decline of more than 14% on 2018 and the lowest level since 2010. One bright spot: Arrival, the UK maker of electric vans, has secured a \u20ac400m (\u00a3339m) order for 10,000 vehicles from the delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS). The Guardian\u2019s final Brexit watch snapshot before Britain\u2019s EU departure shows that warning lights are flashing with zero growth forecast for the final three months of 2019. But the last instalment of our three-year project shows there are also early shoots of recovery from a surge in business confidence since Boris Johnson\u2019s decisive election victory. * * * Javid on board HS2 \u2013 Sajid Javid is expected to throw his weight behind the controversial HS2 rail project at a key meeting today, after the Treasury concluded it will still deliver economic benefits despite spiralling costs. The chancellor is expected to demand tighter budget controls after the National Audit Office said the final cost is \u201cimpossible to estimate with certainty\u201d. A final decision is unlikely to be made until next week. Boris Johnson has faced enthusiastic lobbying in favour of the rail link from northern mayors but opposition from a group of new Conservative MPs in \u201cblue wall\u201d northern seats who want it scrapped in favour of smaller-scale infrastructure projects in the Midlands and the north. * * * Heated dispute over gas power \u2013 The government is being sued for approving the biggest gas power station in Europe, overruling the climate change objections of its own planning authority. The 3.6GW plant, being developed by Drax in north Yorkshire, could produce 75% of the UK\u2019s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who have brought a judicial review.

The striking images reveal a surprising level of structure hidden within the churning plasma exterior, bringing a previously hazy impression of the sun\u2019s patchwork surface sharply into focus for the first time. \u201cThese are the highest resolution images of the solar surface ever taken,\u201d said Thomas Rimmele, the director of the Inouye solar telescope project. \u201cWhat we previously thought looked like a bright point \u2013 one structure \u2013 is now breaking down into many smaller structures.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Race to contain coronavirus Health editor Sarah Boseley tells Rachel Humphreys that the coronavirus outbreak that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan is serious but not yet a global crisis. Plus Louisa Egbunike looks back at the legacy of the Biafran war in west Africa, 50 years on. Lunchtime read: Why Trump deal is no deal US policy for the Middle East cannot work because it requires the Palestinians to accept they are a defeated people, argues Rashid Khalidi.

      "bodyText": "Christmas Island is ill-prepared to receive a planeload of Australians from the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan, with its medical facilities inadequate if somebody falls seriously ill, Australia\u2019s peak medical body says. Head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said Australia was ranked among the most capable countries in the world at containing the spread of infectious diseases, but that Christmas Island, chosen for its remoteness and because it has a detention centre, was ill-conceived as a health quarantine location. He said the Australian citizens who will be evacuated from Wuhan city and the broader Hubei province, will be \u201cunder a lot of stress and fear and concern\u201d. \u201cWe feel that the repatriation to Christmas Island, to a place which has been previously the focus of populations under enormous mental and physical trauma and anguish, is not a really appropriate solution. We\u2019ll be calling on the PM and the relevant ministers to find a much more humane solution to dealing with a group of very vulnerable and concerned Australians.\u201d Bartone told Channel Nine that while the AMA has been in regular and close discussions with the government\u2019s chief medical officer over the coronavirus outbreak, it was not consulted on the evacuation to Christmas Island. \u201cThe government has at its disposal a number of facilities, everything from you know, defence sites or other sites, quarantine facilities, which it could ramp up to meet this demand. \u201cRemember, Australian Medical Assistance Teams (Ausmat) are going into Christmas Island to provide the necessary solutions. It\u2019s not like Christmas Island has got the solution. They\u2019re ramping up their facilities and their resources with the teams coming in.

The teams also include firefighters working on logistics, and are designed to be self-sufficient wherever they go. The teams are sent into disaster zones to provide life-saving treatment and support local health. Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton defended the Christmas Island evacuation plan, saying it was designed to keep the broader population safe. \u201cI can\u2019t clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 people. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a facility otherwise that can take this number of people. I want to make sure that we keep Australians safe.\u201d The government has said the Christmas Island hospital will not be used, nor any public space or facilities on the island. While medical facilities inside the detention centre were expanded when the centre was re-opened last year, those facilities will not be sufficient to treat critical cases of coronavirus. There is no intensive care unit, and other critical medical care could only be provided on a mainland hospital. Chinese state-run media Xinhua reported the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, as saying the UN\u2019s peak health body \u201cdoes not recommend the evacuation of [foreign] nationals\u201d, during a visit to Beijing earlier this week. However, already, the US has flown some of its citizens, mainly diplomatic staff, out of the lockdown zone. Japan has flown a planeload of its citizens to Tokyo. Other countries, including the UK, France, and Indonesia, have also publicly announced plans to extricate their citizens from within the locked-down zone. Bartone said that while the AMA supported the principle of evacuating Australians from the coronavirus outbreak epicentre, \u201cwe can find a better set of facilities to deal with that, to manage that staged return to the community\u201d. \u201cWe can protect the Australian community and also be much more humane to those Australians who, as I said, through no fault of their own, find themselves the focus of this epicentre.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if, and when, Australia will be able to extricate its citizens from Wuhan. It plans to charter a Qantas jet, but it has not yet received permission from Chinese authorities to land a plane or take anyone from inside the militarily-enforced lockdown. The Guardian understands negotiations with Chinese authorities are continuing, with a focus on the practicalities of choosing Australians to extricate and getting them to the airport and out of the country. There are also political sensitivities around Chinese authorities allowing foreigners to flee the virus epicentre while keeping its own citizens quarantined. Concerns over Christmas Island\u2019s runway \u2013 a fully-laden large passenger jet cannot land \u2013 are not considered a major concern. Passengers could be transferred to smaller planes, while remaining isolated, at mainland defence force bases. Christmas Island shire president, Gordon Thomson, told the Guardian the decision to use the territory reflected \u201cregressive colonialist treatment\u201d. \u201cChristmas Island remains a colony and is yet again getting the old regressive colonialist treatment from the great colonial power.

The federal government massively ramped up the healthcare facilities available on Christmas Island last year when it re-established Christmas Island as an immigration detention centre. Since then, it has housed just four people, the Murugappan family \u2013 a Sri Lankan-born Tamil couple and their Australian-born daughters who had previously been living in Biloela \u2013 at a cost of $26m.

      "bodyText": "An Australian man currently under lockdown in Wuhan says the government\u2019s proposal to quarantine Australians in the Christmas Island detention centre is \u201coutrageous\u201d and would probably prevent many people from travelling back to Australia. Rui Severino, a racehorse trainer from Melbourne, who has lived in China for the last four years, also criticised the Australian government for charging Australians to be transported to Christmas Island, saying he didn\u2019t think it was a \u201cfair move\u201d. Severino received a call from Australian embassy officials offering him transport home, but declined, saying he intended to remain in Wuhan, where he says he feels relatively safe and has a responsibility to his team of horse trainers and horses. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t leave my team behind, these horses and these people, they put their trust in me every day, I could not turn my back on them,\u201d he said over the phone from Wuhan. Severino said he was in favour of the Australian government quarantining people and taking steps to protect others from the outbreak but said putting people \u201cbehind bars\u201d in the detention facility at Christmas Island was not acceptable. \u201cThese are families with mothers, children, and they\u2019re going to a detention centre to be behind bars, to be behind barbed wire? That\u2019s not really nice, I don\u2019t think.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they could find somewhere else to put these people,\u201d he said. Christmas Island, located 2,600km from the Australian mainland in the Indian Ocean, is the site of a notorious immigration detention facility that currently houses a single family: a Tamil couple and their two Australian-born children who are currently fighting their deportation from Australia. Those who are evacuated on a charter flight from Wuhan will be quarantined in the detention centre for up to 14 days, the internationally recognised incubation period for the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s just outrageous really. It\u2019s not a matter of being outrageous, you wouldn\u2019t even think about it, no country would have even thought about it. Other countries are going to put people in hospitals and proper medical centres and proper medical set-ups.\u201d Severino only knows one other Australian in Wuhan. She was also contacted by Australian officials about travelling home, but told Severino she was \u201cdefinitely not going under that situation\u201d, something he suspected would be true for many Australians, who would prefer to remain under lockdown in Wuhan than spend up to 14 days on Christmas Island. However, Severino said that if he really feared his life was in danger, he would make the trip. \u201cIf you feared for your life you\u2019d go anywhere, wouldn\u2019t you? I would,\u201d he said. Severino was also critical of reports that the Australian government was charging people $1,000 to fly to Christmas Island, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair move at all. If you\u2019re talking about repatriation, if the government decides for whatever reason to evacuate people, whether it\u2019s from a war, from a natural calamity, whatever it is, I don\u2019t think costs should be mentioned, that\u2019s my personal opinion.\u201d Severino, who lives in a residential area about 15 minutes from the centre of Wuhan, also described the impact of the outbreak on his daily life in the city. After leaving his building compound each day, he has his temperature checked and has to declare where he is travelling to. Upon arrival at the training centre where he works, just a five-minute drive away, Severino undergoes another temperature check and is placed in an ultraviolet room for disinfection. He said the sight of deserted streets was \u201csurreal\u201d, given how busy Wuhan, which has a population of roughly 11 million people, normally is. \u201cYesterday I went to the centre of the little town where I live and it\u2019s always full, it\u2019s always packed out of people and I was the only one person walking down the street at 5:30 in the afternoon, it was quite surreal,\u201d he said. He estimated that 90% of shops had not reopened since lunar new year and those shops that were open had been cleared out of food. \u201cYesterday I attempted to [go shopping] and there was only one shop open, of course everybody obviously goes to that shop, so there weren\u2019t many things left, but I managed to buy some vegetables,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been some small supermarkets and small stores open but at the moment everyone is on pretty much rice, dumplings and vegetables.\u201d Severino spends his days at work and his nights shut inside at home, watching TV, cooking and video-calling his sons who live in Australia.

China death toll jumps amid scramble to evacuate foreigners China has reported it biggest single-day leap in coronavirus deaths since the start of the outbreak, with the toll now at 170, up from 132 on Wednesday. The World Health Organisation is convening an expert committee on Thursday to decide whether to declare a global health emergency, warning \u201cthe whole world needs to be on alert now,\u201d as other nations scramble to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began. Wildlife markets. A prominent Chinese environmental campaigner has told the Guardian a temporary ban on China\u2019s wildlife markets ought to be made permanent to prevent the spread of other similar diseases in future. Sporting events. The World Indoor Athletics Championships, due to be held in Nanjing in March, has been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, while the Chinese Grand Prix, set to take place in Shanghai in April, is also in doubt. Republican moderates facing pressure over witness vote The likelihood that the senate will hear from witnesses in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial appears to be diminishing, as moderate Republicans such as Mitt Romney and Susan Collins come under increasing pressure from both sides over the impending vote on the matter. The eighth day of the trial on Wednesday saw the opposing legal teams lock horns for the first time, during an interrogation period in which they fielded written questions from senators. Friday vote. If senators decide on Friday not to call witnesses including the former national security adviser John Bolton, then the president may be acquitted before the weekend. Iowa race. In the final days before the Iowa caucuses, several Democratic presidential candidates are stuck in Washington at the impeachment trial, potentially leaving the field open to their rivals. Lauren Gambino reports from Des Moines. Politics blog. As the election looms, we are bringing forward the launch time for our US politics blog to 6am ET. You can read today\u2019s blog here. Will Trump\u2019s Middle East \u2018peace\u2019 plan create more conflict? Trump hailed his new plan for the Middle East as a \u201crealistic two-state solution\u201d, but others including the UN have expressed concerns about its viability and Israel\u2019s imminent annexation of illegal West Bank settlements. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called the policy \u201cabsolutely unacceptable,\u201d while Palestinians have outright rejected a plan that they had no hand in crafting. The US proposals will only create more conflict, writes Rashid Khalidi, because they require the Palestinians to accept defeat. Abu Dis. Trump wants the small town of Abu Dis, divided from nearby Jersualem by an Israeli wall, to be the capital of a new Palestinian state. But residents \u2013 and the town\u2019s mayor \u2013 poured scorn on the very idea. British MEPs mourn at their final EU debate on eve of Brexit There were emotional scenes at the European parliament in Brussels on Wednesday, as its members voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Immediately after the agreement was ratified, the chamber broke into a chorus of Auld Lang Syne. Some British MEPs, attending their final debate before the UK\u2019s official departure from the bloc on Friday, were moved to tears as they addressed the parliament for the last time. Nigel Farage. By contrast, the Brexit party leader, who did more than anyone to secure the UK\u2019s departure, left the chamber after being reprimanded for waving a union jack and talking of his \u201chate\u201d for the EU. The Guardian bans fossil fuel advertising The Guardian has announced it will no longer accept ads from oil and gas companies, making it the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from the fossil fuel industry. The move is part of efforts to reduce the Guardian\u2019s carbon footprint as we continue to report on the climate emergency. Read more about the decision here. Cheat sheet A section of Trump\u2019s coveted US-Mexico border wall was reportedly blown over by high winds on Wednesday, between the Californian town of Calexico and Mexicali in Mexico. California lawmakers have failed to pass ambitious new legislation that would have eliminated certain zoning restrictions and enabled the construction of more high-density housing, thereby alleviating the state\u2019s crippling housing crisis. Shares in Facebook fell 7% on Wednesday, despite the firm\u2019s bigger-than-projected fourth quarter earnings, suggesting rolling scandals and regulatory roadblocks may at last be catching up with Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social media giant. A guest on the latest edition of the US Antiques Roadshow, filmed in North Dakota, appeared to collapse after learning that a Rolex watch he purchased in 1974 for less than $350 was now worth more than $400,000. Must-reads Kelis on music, men and her missing money It\u2019s 20 years since Kelis broke out with her debut, Kaleidoscope. Now living a quieter life, writing cookbooks and living with her family on a farm outside LA, she tells Hadley Freeman she is still proud of that first LP: \u201cthe femaleness of the album, of the freaking outspokenness of it, the blackness of it, the alternativeness of it.\u201d Can Brad Parscale cast his spell on Trump voters again?

To Angelenos, learns Andrew Gumbel, Kobe was more than a mere sportsman; he was \u201ca pillar of the community\u201d. Why food service changes how much we eat Three-course meals \u2013 starter, main, dessert \u2013 are a relatively modern idea, invented by Russian aristocrats and simplified for the contemporary table.

      "body": "<p>Conventional wisdom has it that audiences flock to escapism in troubled times, but an unexpected new entry on the <a href=\"https://itopchart.com/gb/en/movies/\" title=\"\">UK iTunes movie rental chart </a>suggests otherwise. Nestling among the current hits is a film made nine years ago that paints a more terrifying picture of humanity than Joker and Downton Abbey combined. As the coronavirus scythes outwards from China, there have been enough rentals of Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 2011 thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/contagion-film-review\" title=\"\">Contagion</a> to propel the movie into the Top 10. (At the time of writing, it\u2019s at No 13.) The picture, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and concerns a deadly virus with the potential to decimate the global population, has, in a very real sense, gone viral.</p> <p>Twitter users have been posting variations on the theme of: \u201cIs it just me or did Contagion predict the coronavirus?\u201d I missed Soderbergh\u2019s film when it was released, and I happen also to be frightened of dying from viral pneumonia, so I killed two birds with one download and watched the movie this week. It\u2019s true that the similarities are striking enough to suggest a case of life imitating \u2026 well, if not art exactly, then a top-of-the-line B-movie. In both fictional and real-life cases, the outbreak originates in China and in each instance bats are implicated. As a doctor (played by Jennifer Ehle) at the Centers for Disease Control explains: \u201cSomewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.\u201d Worst Tinder date ever.</p> <p>One Twitter user, mariow08, identified another possible culprit: \u201cAs with many things,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariow08/status/1220708961634025472\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>, \u201cit\u2019s probably Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s fault.\u201d This is not an allusion to the fact that the first reports of the coronavirus reached the World Health Organization less than a month before Paltrow\u2019s healing-and-wellness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/24/the-goop-lab-review-gwyneth-paltrow-netflix-vagina\" title=\"\">documentary series The Goop Lab came to Netflix</a>. In the case of the virus in Contagion, it really does seem to have been Paltrow\u2019s fault \u2013 sort of. The virus goes from bat to pig to a chef who touches her without washing his hands. She hops on a plane home to her husband, played by Matt Damon, after cheating on him with an old flame, so in conventional movie morality terms she deserves what she gets when she expires shortly after; the monogamous Damon, on the other hand, miraculously survives. Fidelity to one\u2019s partner is in many cases to be recommended, though viewers should not infer from Contagion that this will provide immunity to coronavirus.</p> <p>There is no word yet on how the growing audience for Contagion is divided among countries or continents, but it must be the case that viewers have been watching it as a sort of \u201chow to\u201d guide in the event of a catastrophe in their vicinity. Or at least a \u201cwhat to\u201d \u2013 what to expect when you\u2019re expecting an epidemic.</p> <p>With streaming being a recent phenomenon, it is hard to say whether there was a direct precedent for the spike in rentals of old movies during similarly unforeseen events. Perhaps in the 90s, there would have been a stampede down to Blockbuster to fight over the five VHS copies of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114069/\" title=\"\">Outbreak</a>, a schlocky but efficient example of the genre in which Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Spacey battle a killer virus. Strange to think that in the midst of the #MeToo era, many people consider Hoffman and Spacey to be at least as disagreeable a prospect as any deadly epidemic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5povsMKfT4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y5povsMKfT4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The closest analogy to the Contagion effect would be the death of a celebrity, which always reignites interest in their back catalogue. Rarer are those instances when movies make an accidental prediction or inadvertently nurture some conspiracy theory of the future.

      "bodyText": "Conventional wisdom has it that audiences flock to escapism in troubled times, but an unexpected new entry on the UK iTunes movie rental chart suggests otherwise. Nestling among the current hits is a film made nine years ago that paints a more terrifying picture of humanity than Joker and Downton Abbey combined. As the coronavirus scythes outwards from China, there have been enough rentals of Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 2011 thriller Contagion to propel the movie into the Top 10. (At the time of writing, it\u2019s at No 13.) The picture, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and concerns a deadly virus with the potential to decimate the global population, has, in a very real sense, gone viral. Twitter users have been posting variations on the theme of: \u201cIs it just me or did Contagion predict the coronavirus?\u201d I missed Soderbergh\u2019s film when it was released, and I happen also to be frightened of dying from viral pneumonia, so I killed two birds with one download and watched the movie this week. It\u2019s true that the similarities are striking enough to suggest a case of life imitating \u2026 well, if not art exactly, then a top-of-the-line B-movie. In both fictional and real-life cases, the outbreak originates in China and in each instance bats are implicated. As a doctor (played by Jennifer Ehle) at the Centers for Disease Control explains: \u201cSomewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.\u201d Worst Tinder date ever. One Twitter user, mariow08, identified another possible culprit: \u201cAs with many things,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cit\u2019s probably Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s fault.\u201d This is not an allusion to the fact that the first reports of the coronavirus reached the World Health Organization less than a month before Paltrow\u2019s healing-and-wellness documentary series The Goop Lab came to Netflix. In the case of the virus in Contagion, it really does seem to have been Paltrow\u2019s fault \u2013 sort of. The virus goes from bat to pig to a chef who touches her without washing his hands. She hops on a plane home to her husband, played by Matt Damon, after cheating on him with an old flame, so in conventional movie morality terms she deserves what she gets when she expires shortly after; the monogamous Damon, on the other hand, miraculously survives. Fidelity to one\u2019s partner is in many cases to be recommended, though viewers should not infer from Contagion that this will provide immunity to coronavirus. There is no word yet on how the growing audience for Contagion is divided among countries or continents, but it must be the case that viewers have been watching it as a sort of \u201chow to\u201d guide in the event of a catastrophe in their vicinity. Or at least a \u201cwhat to\u201d \u2013 what to expect when you\u2019re expecting an epidemic. With streaming being a recent phenomenon, it is hard to say whether there was a direct precedent for the spike in rentals of old movies during similarly unforeseen events. Perhaps in the 90s, there would have been a stampede down to Blockbuster to fight over the five VHS copies of Outbreak, a schlocky but efficient example of the genre in which Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Spacey battle a killer virus. Strange to think that in the midst of the #MeToo era, many people consider Hoffman and Spacey to be at least as disagreeable a prospect as any deadly epidemic. The closest analogy to the Contagion effect would be the death of a celebrity, which always reignites interest in their back catalogue. Rarer are those instances when movies make an accidental prediction or inadvertently nurture some conspiracy theory of the future. The villains in The Long Kiss Goodnight, one of the best films of the 90s, turn out to be US defence officials who plan to stage a terrorist incident and to \u201cblame the Muslims\u201d in an attempt to win a budget increase. (They even mention the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.) And Edward Zwick\u2019s 1998 terrorism thriller, The Siege, felt so close to home after 9/11 that the Pentagon held a three-day conference with Hollywood screenwriters and producers in which they brainstormed potential worst-case scenarios to get the jump on future atrocities. It is more often the case that cinema capitalises on a pre-existing fear or neurosis. The nuclear meltdown depicted in the 1978 thriller The China Syndrome, starring Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, drew on flaws in operations at the Dresden generating station in Illinois in the early 70s, but also had the good fortune to be released in cinemas just days before the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. Money can\u2019t buy that kind of PR. Perhaps that\u2019s the only silver lining here.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Unable to get out of quarantine, his father posted messages asking for help on the social media platform Weibo.

The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Avoid direct, unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals when visiting live markets in affected areas Avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products and exercise care when handling raw meat, milk or animal organs to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection of the airborne disease. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces \u2013 23 times an hour, according to one study. Dr David Carrington, of St George\u2019s, University of London, told BBC News that \u201croutine surgical masks for the public are not an effective protection against viruses or bacteria carried in the air\u201d, because they were too loose, had no air filter and left the eyes exposed. Masks could, however, help lower the risk of contracting a virus through the \u201csplash\u201d from a sneeze or a cough and offer some protection against hand-to-mouth transmissions, he said. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit \u2013 but not eliminate \u2013 the risks, provided they are used correctly. That means securing them over the mouth, chin and nose, using the bendable metal strip at the top to keep it snug against the contours of the nose. Experts say the best way to avoid germs, with coronavirus and other airborne illnesses, is to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently, try not to touch your face or eyes and avoid contact with people displaying symptoms. WHO experts advise against wearing gloves on the basis that hand-washing is more important and people wearing gloves are less likely to wash their hands. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 February 2020 to make it clear that China\u2019s National Health Commission figures related to China.",

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 has ended another bad day deep in the red. The blue-chip index shed 101 points, or 1.36%, to end at 7,381. Coronavirus worries were a key factor, while the stronger pound hurt exporters. Greg Daco of Oxford Economics has spotted that a sharp slide in US imports actually flattered today\u2019s growth figures: Time for a summary: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold, at Mark Carney\u2019s final meeting as governor. Only two policymakers voted for a cut, surprising the City which expected a closer results. The Bank also cut its growth forecasts, and downgraded its expectations for productivity growth, in a sign that the UK economy has suffered from Brexit uncertainty. Carney, who said he had no regrets about his time at the Bank, told reporters that Britain faces a decade of perhaps profound change. He also said the Bank was watching the coronavirus crisis slowly, given its possible impact on the global economy. Fabrice Montagne, chief UK economist at Barclays says Carney may have left his successor, Andrew Bailey, a conundrum: \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that falling oil prices push inflation below 1% and the new governor will then have to explain why the BoE is missing its inflation target. Against that backdrop, a rate cut today would have made it easier for incoming governor Bailey to ease into office.\u201d In other news... The US economy has fallen short of Donald Trump\u2019s promises, again. US GDP only expanded by 2.3% during 2019, below the White House\u2019s goal of 3%. In the fourth quarter alone, the US grew by 2.1% with consumer spending slowing and business investment dropping again. Global stock markets have been hit by renewed worries about the coronavirus, as firms continue to shutter shops and factories. In the last few minutes, BMW has announced its factories will stay closed until 8 February. Carnival, the cruise operator, fell 8% at one stage following reports that two passengers are in isolation on a ship on the coast of Italy - leaving 6,000 people trapped on board. The US stock market has opened in the red, following the losses in Europe already today. The latest jump in the death toll from coronavirus is alarming investors, as it could mean the global economy is more badly affected (quite apart from the human suffering). The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 0.2%, with the broader S&amp;P 500 down 0.4%. Facebook is among the big fallers, down almost 6% after posting slowing revenue growth last night. Eurpoe is taking a bigger hit than Wall Street, with the FTSE 100 down almost one hundred points (-1.3%), Germany\u2019s DAX down 1% and France\u2019s CAC losing 1.3%. Chris Towner, director at risk management firm JCRA, says the crisis is dampening hopes for an economic revival this year: \u201cThe acceleration in the spread of the virus across the globe along with the increase in the number of deaths, continues to alarm financial markets. Stock markets continue to trade under pressure and so is the Chinese renminbi. The offshore traded Chinese currency has weakened to test the psychological \u2018seven\u2019 level against the US dollar. To put this into perspective, since the coronavirus hit just ten days ago the Chinese currency has weakened just over 2%. Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, fears that America\u2019s economy will keep slowing in 2020, having only managed 2.3% growth in 2019. Economists are a little disappointed that America\u2019s growth rate slowed last year - here\u2019s some snap reaction: Newsflash: America\u2019s economy has posted its weakest growth since Donald Trump became president. US GDP only grew by 2.3% during 2019, the Commerce Department says, shy of the 3% growth which Trump targeted. That\u2019s down from 2.9% in 2018. Such a lacklustre performance grates when you remember Trump\u2019s bragging at Davos last week, about America enjoying \u201can economic boom - the likes of which the world has never see before\u201d. The figures also show that in the fourth-quarter, US GDP only expanded by an annualised rate of 2.1%. Business investment fell during the quarter (by -1.5%), while consumer spending growth slowed to +1.8% (from 3.2%) Mark Carney\u2019s final press conference didn\u2019t contain many fireworks. Instead, today will be remembered for the uncertainty and trepidation in the City about whether the Bank would cut rates or not. That\u2019s not the sign of a smooth-running central bank -- policymakers shouldn\u2019t create such confusion ahead of a monetary policy meeting, especially one the day before Brexit. Its no way to shake off Carney\u2019s reputation as an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019. As Nick Wall, co-manager of the Merian Strategic Absolute Return Bond Fund at Merian Global Investors, puts it: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney brought an end to his reign by holding interest rates at 0.75% after business surveys picked up post-election. To his critics, he proved unreliable to the end, but in our view this seems like the correct decision, particularly with the upcoming spending review. \u201cHistorians perusing the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE\u2019s) base rate during Carney\u2019s tenure as governor may conclude it was a dull affair. His Monetary Policy Committee tweaked interest rates three times over the course of 69 meetings. Traditional measures of central bank activity, however, as Carney acknowledged in his final speech this month, have fallen by the wayside as conventional policy tools find it harder to boost inflation than to contain it. Mark Carney then wraps up his final press conference as Bank of England governor, saying the economics press pack that he\u2019s \u201cappreciated your challenge and insights\u201d over the years (he\u2019s hidden that appreciation well at times...) He tells the reporters they have a tough job, in a 24-hour news cycle, without unlimited budgets (true, that....) You come here, we lock you in our vault, we give you bacon sandwiches of uncertain vintage... ...No you don\u2019t! the press mutter, pointing out that they might get biscuits on a good day. But putting the butties aside, Carney seems genuinely sincere about the challenge of covering complicated economic issues for the UK audience. And with that, he\u2019s off. Q: What impact have your new climate stress tests had? Carney says that the feedback is ongoing, and that major banks and insurers are \u201cvery engaged\u201d with these new stress tests. The tests aren\u2019t meant to catch firms out, he adds, they\u2019re meant to help set strategy to a low-carbon economy. Q: When you say it\u2019s \u2018so far, good enough\u2019, do you mean that any weak data could prompt a rate cut? That\u2019s a question for the March meeting of the MPC, Carney replies -- when he\u2019ll have left. The MPC will also look at Sajid Javid\u2019s budget, and any progress on Brexit negotiations, when setting interest rates. Also on Brexit, Carney warns that European companies and pension funds would face higher costs if UK-based financial companies lose their equivalence status with the EU. In other words, Europe could suffer if there is too much divergence between London\u2019s financial centre and the EU after Brexit. Q: What impact will Brexit have on UK productivity? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says the Bank now doesn\u2019t expect much of a pick-up in productivity growth - it\u2019s now forecast to rise by just 0.5% per year (compared to 1.5% to 2% in the past). Q: What has been your biggest regret, or monetary policy mistake, of your time at the Bank, asks my colleague Larry Elliott? Carney has a think.... and concludes he doesn\u2019t have any regrets on monetary policy. Q: Is the coronavirus the biggest risk to the global economy? Mark Carney replies that the virus is affecting a number of people. We should acknowledge the difficulties and the pain of those directly affected, and the anxiety of hundreds of millions of people whose lives are disrupted, he points out. The crisis is taking place in the world\u2019s largest economy, and spreading beyond it. But it\u2019s very early days, the governor continues: We, like others, are monitoring this quite closely, as you\u2019d expect.\u201d Carney won\u2019t speculate on the possible impact on the economy, but adds that the Bank is looking \u201cvery closely\u201d at this \u201cfast-moving issue\u201d. Q: When you arrived in 2013, bank rate was 0.5%. It\u2019s now only 0.75%... &lt;50% higher, Carney mutters proudly&gt;... ...if you\u2019d been told that at the time, would you be surprised? Carney says he wouldn\u2019t have expected equilibrium rates to be so low today. Britain\u2019s r* rate (short-term interest rate which should occur when the economy is at equilibrium with inflation low and employment high) is lower than the global average, he adds. Carney then suggests there could be new fiscal measures in the March budget. That could lift equilibrium rates, as could a drop in Brexit uncertainty. Q: What do you think of chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s comments about raising UK growth rates, given you have cut your forecasts? Carney says he welcomes Javid\u2019s focus on the issue (!) given the concerns over Britain\u2019s growth potential. Large structural changes may be needed to get Britain\u2019s supply growth up, he adds. But it can\u2019t happen overnight, it needs substantial investments and policy changes. It\u2019s a common issue. We\u2019re just calling it as we see it at present. The government and chancellor\u2019s efforts to raise the speed limit of the UK economy should be judged on long-term basis, not a two or three-year cycle, Carney adds. Q: Why have you dropped your guidance of \u201climited and gradual\u201d rises in interest rates in favour of \u201csome modest tightening\u201d being needed, as your forecast suggest inflation only hits target if you cut rates? Carney replies that a rate cut would push inflation over target -- so not consistent with the Bank\u2019s goals. But \u2018limited and gradual\u2019 implied multiple rate rises, and that\u2019s not expected, Carney add. Q: Markets were convinced that today\u2019s meeting would see rates cut - but actually you\u2019re talking about tightening policy. Given that, would you recommend that your successor uses forward guidance on interest rates? Carney insists that forward guidance (pledging not to move interest rates until certain conditions are met) are a key part of the armory. \u201cThe jury is in\u201d that they work, he insists. [The problem, though, is that the Bank kept promising to raise interest rates in a steady, gradual way, but has barely lifted borrowing costs since the financial crisis]. Carney then denies that the City were misled or confused -- 50% of participants may have expected a cut, but 50% didn\u2019t. That\u2019s now markets work, he explains.... Q: The Bank has lowered its assessment of the UK\u2019s growth potential, so what\u2019s gone wrong and is it partly the Bank\u2019s fault? The answer to the second part is \u201cno\u201d, Carney replies smoothly (do central bankers ever admit mistakes?!). Deputy governor Ben Broadbent explains that the Bank has lowered its expectations for labour supply, and for productivity. Carney adds that the Bank\u2019s forecasts assume an orderly move to a new free-trade agreement with the European Union, with divergence between the UK and EU happening over time. Q: The Bank of England has cut its assessment of Britain\u2019s supply growth today, so does that mean the economy is weaker since the Brexit vote? Mark Carney says there are three factors: 1) The Bank has been disappointed by the persistent failure of productivity to increase over several years, so has adjusted its forecasts accordingly 2) Business investment has been very weak since the Brexit vote -- spending less on new equipment and processes. Instead of expanding their businesses, they\u2019ve been focused on contingency planning to survive various Brexit cliff-edges. There\u2019s now \u201csome payback\u201d from that in the Bank\u2019s new forecasts, Carney says. 3) The Bank\u2019s forecasts now factor in Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal - and assume an \u201cimmediate move\u201d to a deep free-trade deal with the EU in a year\u2019s time [rather than a slower transition]. Looking ahead, Mark Carney warns that the UK is entering a decade of \u201cpotentially profound structural change\u201d. New trading relationships will be struck, new immigration rules will be set, major initiatives on infrastructure and regional development will be introduced.... plus there\u2019s the shift to a low-carbon economy. The discovery of a new strain of coronavirus in China is a reminder of the need to remain vigilant, Mark Carney continues. (Yesterday, US central bank chief Jerome Powell predicted that coronavirus would have an impact on the global economy, as well as China\u2019s) Indicators of uncertainty in the UK have fallen, Mark Carney continues, citing surveys showing that firms are less worried about Brexit. The latest hard data, covering the time before December, shows the economy is weak. But the more timely (but softer) survey data measuring activity after the election have improved \u201csharply\u201d. So with the global economy also appearing to recover, the Bank was persuaded to leave interest rate on hold. But Carney strikes a cautious note. This isn\u2019t a case of \u201cso far so good\u201d, but actually \u201cSo far, good enough.\u201d The hard economic data needs to back up the surveys. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference at the central bank now. He warns that the UK economy probably stagnated in the final quarter of 2019, while core inflation has also slowed. So the question facing the MPC is whether the new decade will start with a bang. Politics is certainly delivering - with Brexit taking place tomorrow night. But the economic outlook is more modest, Carney warns. Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank\u2019s decision: The Bank suggests that the pick-up in manufacturing and service sector growth this month, and the easing of US-China trade tensions, both played a factor in today\u2019s decision. The minutes of the meeting say: Since the December meeting, international developments had been positive and the most recent UK data supported the forecast of a near-term recovery in growth. The Committee would monitor closely the extent to which these early indications of an improved outlook were sustained and followed through to the hard data on domestic activity in coming months. That was enough to persuade governor Mark Carney, deputy governors Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, and Dave Ramsden, chief economist Andrew Haldane, and external members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe to vote to leave rates at 0.75%. For the third month running, Saunders and Haskel disagreed -- pointing to downside risks from Brexit uncertainties and a weaker world outlook. The pound has rallied against the US dollar following the Bank\u2019s decision. Sterling has gained almost half a cent to $1.3064. City traders are concluding that the BoE is less likely to cut interest rates in the coming months, as only two policymakers voted to cut rates today. Some economists had expected a closer vote, perhaps 6-3 or even a 5-4 nail biter. There were even forecasts of a rate cut. It appears that the Bank has taken heart from signs that activity is picking up this month, rather than fretting about data showing a slowdown at the end of 2019 [I outlined the various reasons for cutting or not cutting here] The Bank of England is helpfully tweeting the key points from today\u2019s Monetary Policy report (its quarterly healthcheck on the UK economy): You can see the Bank\u2019s latest Monetary Report here. It explains that interest rates may need to be cut if growth doesn\u2019t improve. But rates could rise \u201cmodestly\u201d in future if the economy recovers and inflation picks up, the BoE adds. The Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts for the UK economy. It now expects GDP will only rise by 0.8% this year, down from 1.2% previously. Growth in 2021 has been revised down too, to 1.4% from 1.8%. And in 2022, the Bank only predicts growth of 1.7%, down from 2.0%. The Bank says that Brexit uncertainty hurt the UK economy last year - it is hoping that the global economy can help lift growth. In 2019, the UK economy slowed because firms\u2019 uncertainties about Brexit reduced their spending, and growth in the world economy slowed. UK inflation fell back below our 2% target. The latest data suggest that the uncertainty facing businesses has fallen, and that global growth has stabilised. We expect uncertainty to fall further and global growth to pick up. If that happens, it should help to support growth here in the UK. If that does not happen, then we may need to lower interest rates to support UK growth and ensure that we return inflation to our 2% target sustainably BoE policymakers Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel continued to demand a cut to interest rates, but couldn\u2019t persuade any of their other seven colleagues to join them. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold. Britain\u2019s central bank has decided to leave Bank Rate at 0.75%, despite recent weak economic data. The decision was not unanimous \u2014 2 members of the monetary policy committee voted to cut rates, and 7 voted to leave them unchanged. More to follow. David Madden of CMC Markets says today\u2019s Bank of England decision (in four minutes) is pretty exciting: At previous meetings, policymakers Michael Saunders plus Jonathan Haskel voted for lowering rates. Gertjan Vlieghe has recently indicated he would be open to the idea of lowering rates too, so this meeting will be one of the more interesting ones in a while. The meeting has the added excitement of being the last one for Mark Carney, the head of the BoE. The central banker has a reputation of behaving like an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019, so he might try and shake off the image by voting to keep rates on hold \u2013 previously he has been content to keep the current policy. It would seem odd to cut rate ahead of the Budget, not to mention the Brexit situation. Tension is building in the City, with just 15 minutes until the Bank of England sets UK interest rates. Will policymakers cut borrowing costs to prop up the economy, or will they be heartened by recent signs that confidence and activity are picking up? It\u2019s a deliciously close call...and a gripping way for Mark Carney to end his time as governor. Shares in Carnival, the international cruise operator, have slumped by 7% this morning following a report that a couple from Hong Kong are in solitary confinement on one of its ships docked off the Italian coast. ANSA, the Italian news service, reports that the wife has a fever and is being tested by the authorities for coronavirus, and are mored at Civitavecchia. The 6,000 passengers on board the Costa Smeralda (one of the world\u2019s biggest cruise ships) are currently unable to get off. According to ANSA, the couple had arrived from Hong Kong at Milan Malpensa airport on Saturday 25 January and then headed to Savona (in Northern Italy) where they boarded the ship for the cruise. The mayor of Civitavecchia, Ernesto Tedesco, has said the situation is under \u201ccareful control\u201d, and that all the necessary protocols are being followed. Here\u2019s the story: My colleague Matt Weaver is tracking all the developments here: Michael Mulligan, insolvency and restructuring partner at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau, is alarmed that UK personal insolvencies have spiked to their highest since 2010. He believes it should temper optimism about a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, and suggests the UK economy is still struggling -- something for the Bank of England to bear in mind. Mulligan says: In reality, growth continues to stagnate, and business and individuals are feeling the effects. There are thousands of zombie companies hanging on across a number of vulnerable sectors. \u201cBrexit uncertainty and trade wars have dominated the economic landscape, sapping opportunities for growth and pushing those who are struggling further under water. For bricks and mortar retail in particular, which is already threatened by rising online sales, the knives are out and the fight for customer spending continues. \u201cIndividual insolvencies have risen to highest annual level since 2010, with the UK retaining its status as the country with the highest level of personal insolvency in the world. The total number of County Court Judgments (CCJs) issued against individuals in debt reached 1.15 million in 2019 \u2013 the highest on record. \u201cThe availability of seemingly \u2018cheap\u2019 debt and short-term loans continues to be an issue and people are still being caught out by the temptation of accessible borrowing. January figures from the Bank of England show that UK households owe \u00a372.5 billion on credit cards, a total increase of \u00a3400 million in November 2019 alone Worryingly, the number of personal insolvencies in the UK has hit its highest level since 2010, after the financial crisis. The Insolvency Service has reported there were 122,181 personal insolvencies in 2019, an increase of 6% on 2018, and the highest annual total since 2010. Alex Collinson of the TUC has tweeted the key points: Duncan Swift, President of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, says the rise in insolvencies is due to \u201ca tough year for personal finances\u201d. \u201cIndividuals have benefited from low inflation, real wage increases, and record employment levels, but this has been counter-balanced by rising consumer debt and the fact that not all employment is secure. For the most financially vulnerable, the problems with the benefits system have been well-publicised. \u201cFinances are stretched for many, and financial resilience is low. It doesn\u2019t take much of a shock \u2013 a missed benefit payment, an unexpected bill, or a reduction in hours \u2013 to cause financial problems. Real wages are rising, but having fallen for so long before that it\u2019s a bit too late for some, while wage increases will not be evenly distributed. \u201cBanks and other lenders have continued to tighten their credit standards in response to the Bank of England\u2019s concerns around consumer over-indebtedness, which means many people have lost a fall-back option they may have used in the past. Christopher Dembik, Head of Macro Analysis at Saxo Bank, predicts that Mark Carney will leave interest rates on hold -- as the latest economic data has been encouraging. Dembik writes: We believe the BoE is data-dependent and will wait for more post-election data to come in before cutting interest rates. The latest data tend to confirm that the UK economy is rebounding in early 2020. January flash Purchasing Managers\u2019 index readings were above consensus. Flash Service PMI was out at 52.9, flash Manufacturing PMI at 49.8 and flash Composite PMI at 52.4. Credit conditions have also improved significantly with availability of secured credit for households reaching the highest level since 2015. We still consider that the UK economy will need more stimulus in the coming months to offset the prolonged contraction in credit push and the five consecutive quarters of contraction in private investment but, as of now, the BoE is in no hurry to step in. Another argument for postponing the rate cut is that it is the last meeting chaired by Governor Carney before Andrew Bailey takes over in March. It is likely that Carney will let Bailey make the call once more data will be available regarding the state of the UK economy in the post-Brexit era. Consumer goods giant Unilever is in hot water this morning after putting its tea operations on the market. CEO Alan Jope announced a \u201cstrategic review of our global tea business\u201d this morning, as part of a drive to improve performance. Unilver also reported a 33% drop in pre-tax profits for 2019, amid a slowdown in South Asia and weaker trading in China. Selling Unilever\u2019s \u2018black tea\u2019 business may make sense - given the move among younger consumers towards fruit teas and more glamorous coffees. But... Unilever denied that it was considering selling the tea business just two months ago, after our friends at the Telegraph reported it. Looks like Hannah Uttley was on the money. No wonder they\u2019re, ahem, stewing this morning.... On balance, the City expects the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold today with a 6-3 split on its monetary policy committee, Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward reports: Traders see about a 52% chance of a cut on Thursday, the most divided they\u2019ve ever been this close to a decision under Carney. Bets climbed as high as 70% in the weeks before the announcement, before paring back in the last few days. A Bloomberg survey of economists predicts five different results for the vote split among the nine policy makers. They lean toward a 6-3 vote to hold, with Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel repeating their calls for lower rates, and Gertjan Vlieghe joining the dissent. Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Morgan Stanley are among the banks calling for no change, while Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Natwest predict a cut. Rabobank, the Dutch financial services group, predicts the Bank of England will cut interest rates at noon today... BT shares are also under the cosh this morning after reporting a 3% drop in revenues in the last quarter, and a 4% decline in core profits. Traders are concerned that BT has predicted a \u00a3500m bill for replacing Huawei kit in its networks, to comply with the UK government\u2019s new restrictions on the Chinese operator. My colleague Mark Sweney has the details: BT, which saw its share price fall 4% in early trading after reporting slightly worse than expected third quarter results, said that the \u00a3500m projection included assumptions on the costs getting equipment from alternate providers such as Nokia and Ericsson will be when deals are done. \u201cThe way it works at the moment is when you put a 5G box on a mast it has to on top of a 4G box from the same supplier,\u201d said Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT. \u201cMore than 35% of [our] 4G boxes are Huawei. We are going to have to take out some of Huawei 4G boxes and not use them again. That is probably the single biggest cost. In order to make 5G work we are going to have to use other manufacturers\u2019 equipment.\u201d Profits have halved at Royal Dutch Shell after the energy giant was hit by sliding oil and gas prices. The news has sent its shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard in early trading, to a two and a half-year low. The Anglo-Dutch oil giant has posted profits of just $2.9bn for the final quarter of 2019, compared with $5.7bn a year before. Profits for 2019 as a whole dropped to $16.5bn, down 23% from 2018, after a disappointing end to the year. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: The company blamed weaker oil and gas prices, which drifted down last year due to a well stocked global market and concerns over global economic growth which dampened demand for fossil fuels. Ben Van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said the company faced \u201cchallenging macroeconomic conditions\u201d in its petroleum refining and chemicals business, \u201cas well as lower oil and gas prices\u201d last year. Shares in Shell are down 4% this morning at \u00a320.44, their lowest since July 2017. European stock markets have all fallen into the red in early trading, as the escalating coronavirus crisis hits stocks. France\u2019s CAC and Germany\u2019s DAX have both fallen by over 1%, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 currently 0.6% lower. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With the coronavirus death toll leaping 29% overnight, the European markets reverted back to panic mode, quickly unravelling the rebound managed in the last couple of sessions. The market\u2019s fears weren\u2019t helped by the Fed on Wednesday evening. As the central bank kept rates unchanged, while re-upping its commitment to 2% inflation, Jerome Powell refused to speculate on the full impact of the coronavirus, though he did acknowledge the potential for any economic disruption in China to spill over to the US. Here\u2019s our news blog on the latest developments: The pound is looking a little jittery this morning, dropping below $1.30 as traders await the BoE decision at noon. There are several reasons why Bank of England policymakers may vote for an interest rate cut today for the first time since the Brexit vote. For example: The UK economy shrank by 0.3% in November, according to the latest GDP figures Retail sales slumped in December, and have not risen for five months The coronavirus outbreak is already denting confidence, and will hurt UK businesses exposed to China Economic uncertainty may rise in the coming months as Britain tries to reach free trade deals with the EU and US by the end of 2020 But it\u2019s not a clear call, as the most recent data paints a better picture: British manufacturing and services companies returned to growth in January, according to a \u2018flash PMI\u2019 survey released last Friday UK business confidence has surged a 14-month high, according to a survey from Lloyds Bank released this morning Here\u2019s a nice recap of Mark Carney\u2019s time at the Bank of England, from CNBC: Today\u2019s Bank of England decision is on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d, says Neil Wilson of Market.com: Recent comments from several policy makers at the Bank, some softer inflation data and GDP numbers, and persistent risks to the global outlook suggest the MPC may choose to act now to cut. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After more than six years at the Bank of England, Mark Carney will today announce his final decision on interest rates. And it\u2019s possibly the trickiest judgement faced by the governor yet. Carney, and his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee, must weigh up whether to slash borrowing costs to give the economy a lift, or sit tight and see whether there\u2019s really a \u201cBoris Bounce\u201d after last month\u2019s election. The odds of a rate cut have been volatile in recent weeks -- hitting over 60% at one stage, after weak growth figures suggested the economy was flatlining. But they have dropped back to 50% in recent days, after survey data suggested the private sector is growing again. It\u2019s a devilish decision. With Brexit due tomorrow night, the Bank might be tempted to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.5% to shore up confidence. But with new governor Andrew Bailey taking over in March, they might like to leave him some ammunition too. Back in December, the Bank voted 7-2 to leave borrowing costs unchanged, with policymakers Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel calling for a cut. But since then, two more external members - Silvana Tenreyo and Jan Vlieghe - have both hinted that they could vote for a cut. So it\u2019s going to be terribly exciting at noon today, when the decision hits the wires. Central banks take pride in their ability to guide the markets through judicious communication, but today\u2019s decision really could go either way. James Smith, economist at ING, predicts the Bank will hold rates.... just. It\u2019s not clear that the remaining five \u2018internal\u2019 members of the committee will back calls for easing right now. Admittedly, we don\u2019t have that much to go on in terms of communication, but as we noted at the time, our sense from Governor Mark Carney\u2019s recent speech was that he hadn\u2019t been fully convinced of the merits of cutting interest rates this month. While his comments were perhaps the most candid he has been on the idea of easing, he noted the better news on politics, and pushed back on the idea that the Bank was running out of ammunition. Also coming up today Fears over the coronavirus are intensifying today, as the death toll rises to 170 overnight. Asian stock markets are deep in the red, with Hong Kong losing another 2.8%. Yesterday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the outbreak would have an impact on the Chinese economy, and the wider global economy, adding: Of course we are very carefully monitoring the situation. European stocks are expected to suffer, as countries around the globe close their Chinese stores and factories. The FTSE 100 has just dropped by 71 points at the open to 7412, back towards Monday\u2019s lows. We find out how America\u2019s economy fared in the last quarter of 2019. Economists predict growth remained around 2.1% per year -- not exactly sizzling. And it\u2019s a busy day in the City, with oil company Shell reporting a halving of its profits, Unilever reviewing its global tea business, and BT warning that the UK\u2019s curbs on Huawei will cost it \u00a3500m.

I\u2019m going to leave you with an afternoon summary: The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has indicated that chlorinated chicken will be part of the trade deal demanded by the US. Asked directly about the issue, he told LBC: \u201cThere will be real contentious issues around agriculture ...We need to make sure we don\u2019t use food safety as a ruse to try and protect a particular industry.\u201d The Communication Workers Union has endorsed Rebecca Long-Bailey as the next Labour leader. Long-Bailey had already received the endorsement of Unite and the Fire Brigades Union. The CWU also endorsed Angela Rayner as deputy leader but its general secretary, Kevin Ward, admitted the contest had not caught the imagination of the public and urged candidates to deliver \u201cmore dynamic and innovative campaigns\u201d. Preparations are underway for tomorrow\u2019s Brexit Day, when the UK will leave the EU at 11pm GMT. Union flags have been hung in Parliament Square. A small number of demonstrators have been demonstrating in the square about the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. I reported earlier that the Communication Workers Union has endorsed Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner for Labour party leader and deputy leader respectively. But the union\u2019s general secretary Dave Ward has been critical of the campaigning so far. He said: I am proud of the democratic process our union has conducted and it is clear to me that Rebecca Long-Bailey is the outstanding candidate for leader. It is also clear that the ability and experience of Angela Rayner make her the best candidate for deputy leader. What is also true is the contest so far has not caught the imagination of Labour members or the wider public. We call on all candidates to deliver more dynamic and innovative campaigns in the coming weeks and months. We\u2019ve had a glimpse into the preparations to mark Brexit in the UK. Here\u2019s a peek into what our European friends are doing: The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has been speaking to Iain Dale on LBC about post-Brexit trade talks and indicated that chlorinated chicken would be part of the deal demanded by the US. Asked by Dale directly about chlorinated chicken, he replied: There will be real contentious issues around agriculture ... I\u2019m sure the Ag[riculture] issues will be difficult. Our ask will be as it has been in the other negotiations. We need to be open and honest about competitiveness. We need to make sure we don\u2019t use food safety as a ruse to try and protect a particular industry. And then we need to have hard conversations about the places we have opportunities to give and take and then deliver on outcomes that benefit the agricultural sector - and most importantly consumers who are going to be the net beneficiaries of these really good deals. The new speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, has indicated that he would be happy for women MPs to breastfeed in the chamber, , the Independent reports. It says he was asked at a Westminster lunch whether he would allow feeding to take place in the Commons chamber and committee rooms and replied: My view is, it is up to the woman. I think it would be wrong for me as a man to dictate on that policy. If it happens, it happens. I wouldn\u2019t be upset by it. Female MPs have in the past demanded that new mothers be allowed to breastfeed in the House of Commons chamber to help get more women into parliament. The former speaker, Betty Boothroyd, said it would be allowed when workers at Tesco were allowed to do so. The Edinburgh West MP, Christine Jardine is to formally announce that she is standing for the Liberal Democrat leadership, the New Statesman reports. Jardine, the party\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, has represented her constituency since 2017. No one has formally announced their candidature yet but the frontrunners for the post are considered to be acting leader Ed Davey and Layla Moran. Other possible contenders include the Bath MP, Wera Hobhouse, and new MP Daisy Cooper, who took St Albans from the Conservatives at the general election. Union flags have been raised in Parliament Square ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Brexit celebrations. Not everyone is in the mood for celebrating though ... Want to own a piece of history? Nigel Farage has revealed one lucky connoisseur will have the chance to purchase the Mr Brexit portrait, he unveiled, with the help of comedy dinosaur, Jim Davidson, this afternoon (see 2.45pm update). From PA Media: The work created by artist Dan Llywelyn Hall was revealed at L\u2019Escargot Restaurant in London, less than 36 hours before the UK is set to leave the European Union. Mr Farage told the PA news agency: \u201cI will miss the drama. I will miss being the pantomime villain who gets up and 500 people boo. \u201cI won\u2019t miss Brussels because it\u2019s a dump. But I will miss Strasbourg which has got lots of family-run restaurants and yeah, of course, I am going to miss that. \u201cI suppose my level of notoriety is relatively high at the moment and I am hoping we can auction this off for a magnificent charity.\u201d The money raised by the painting will go towards veteran support charity Care After Combat. Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey has received the endorsement of the Communication Workers Union today. She had already secured her place on the ballot paper after endorsements from Unite and the Fire Brigades Union. Responding to the CWU\u2019s declaration of support, Long-Bailey said: I am honoured to be endorsed by one of the leading workplace trade unions in the UK, which has been solidly behind the Labour Party\u2019s transformative agenda. As leader of the Labour Party I will stand shoulder to shoulder with trade unions in disputes, and full solidarity to the CWU in their current dispute with Royal Mail. The decision was made by a forum of over 500 workplace representatives from the CWU, who backed Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The Times Scotland\u2019s political editor has been tweeting out results of their new YouGov polling, which shows a lead for Scottish independence of 51%. The majority in favour of independence will boost the SNP as Nicola Sturgeon prepares to set out her next steps towards another referendum tomorrow, after Boris Johnson refused her request for the powers to hold a legal referendum earlier this month. While the poll shows 2014 no voters and 2016 Remain voters converting to the \u2018yes\u2019 cause, interestingly there is not a majority in favour of a second referendum this year, which Sturgeon is still pushing for. Indeed, yesterday the Scottish parliament\u2019s pro-independence majority of SNP and Greens voted through Sturgeon\u2019s motion in favour of a 2020 referendum. Finally, the challenge for a future yes campaign is the same as always: the economy. According to this poll, 42% of Scots think the country would be worse off economically with independence, and 35% think it would be better off. It is still less than 33 hours till Brexit but the celebrations have already begun. For younger readers who may be unfamiliar with Jim Davidson, a list of his most controversial moments by the Telegraph includes creating Chalky White, a stereotype of West Indians, as part of his stand-up routine and his single, White Christmas, performed in a Jamaican accent. Here is video of the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, saying the US intends to put Britain \u201cat the front of the line\u201d for a trade deal post-Brexit. Here are the morning\u2019s main developments: The government has refused to confirm or deny that Boris Johnson is planning to give the go ahead for HS2, after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, gave the controversial high speed rail project is backing. A spokesperson for the PM refused to preempt the decision while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said an announcement would be made next month. Javid, Johnson and Shapps are meeting today to discuss HS2 amid opposition from some backbenchers. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has reiterated that the UK will be \u201cat the front of the line\u201d when it comes to negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal. At a Policy Exchange event with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, both Raab and Pompeo insisted a full trade deal could be finalised prior to November\u2019s US presidential election. They generally presented a united front, glossing over disagreements on Iran, Huawei and the Harry Dunn case. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that a charter flight to evacuate Britons from areas affected by the coronavirus will depart Wuhan at 5am tomorrow. Earlier, he said the foreign office had been working flat out to arrange their safe transport. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.75%. It took the decision amid early signs of a rebound in the economy following Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory and despite warning that Brexit would hold back growth in the long run. The acting Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, has used a speech in Manchester to call for unity among progressives, including on fighting against a no-deal Brexit. He said there should be an end to discord between remain and leave voters but that progressives needed to band together to fight inequality under Boris Johnson\u2019s government and deliver a soft Brexit. Self-harm in prisons has hit a new high, with more than 60,000 incidents in the 12 months to September 2019, Ministry of Justice figures released today show. The number of inmates self-harming increased by 2% in the latest 12 months, to the highest recorded figure of 12,740 individuals. The number of self-harm incidents per individual rose by 14% from 4.2 to 4.8. Here are some more opinions from Westminster on HS2 - against and for respectively: Dominic Raab said during the Policy Exchange event that hopefully British citizens would be evacuated \u201clater this evening\u201d. However, in a statement, he has just confirmed that the flight will be tomorrow morning: We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 5am local time on Friday 31 January. The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need. That was a display from Dominic Raab and Mike Pompeo of US-UK unity ahead of Brexit, with disagreements over Huawei, Iran and the Harry Dunn depicted as blips that could be overcome. Instead, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reiterated that the UK would be \u201cat the front of the line\u201d when it comes to a trade deal, with both parties concurring that this was achievable before November\u2019s presidential election in November. Pompeo said it could deliver \u201cenormous benefits\u201d for both the US and the UK now that the latter was not constrained by the EU. There is a follow up question on Harry Dunn from CBS. Raab says he had a \u201cgood conversation with Mike\u201d about it. What changes to the special relationship can be expected post-Brexit, someone else asks. t Pompeo says he is optimistic because there were things the UK were required to do as being part of the EU which they no longer have to do. That is fantastic for the US and UK, says the secretary of state. He says there will be \u201cenormous benefits\u201d that accrue to both organisations. Lucy Fisher from the Times says a full trade deal is unlikely before the November US election. Will a sectorial deal be struck instead and if so will it be for the financial sector? Raab says a deal can be done and we should have a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude. Pompeo simply says \u201cI concur\u201d. Jason Groves from the Mail asks if there could be a barter - Prince Andrew for Anne Sacoolas. Pompeo says both situations will be resolved. Raab says there is no barter. And that\u2019s the conclusion of the event. James Landale from the BBC asks Pompeo if the US will make good on its pledge to restrict intelligence-sharing in response to the Huawei decision. Pompeo says the security relationship is deep and will remain but the US will not permit its citizens information to go across a network it is unhappy about. Landale also asked how the special relationship fits in with the case of Harry Dunn and the refusal to extradite Anne Saccolas, who fled the country after being involved in the incident which killed the teenager. Pompeo offers some platitudes and says they are working to resolve the situation. Landale also asks Raab about getting UK citizens out of Wuhan, China. Raab says ideally citizens will be evacuated tonight and insists the UK government is doing its best. On Huawei, Pompeo says permitting a Chinese company tied to the Chinese communist party to access private information creates risk. He says Chinese companies have obligations to the party and party members are investors in Huawei. This is about a model that the Chinese communist party has ...it\u2019s not about a technical back door, they have the front door. He says he is confident the UK and US will find a way to resolve the situation and be able to work together. Raab says the decision protects security and the relationship with security allies, \u201cthe five eyes\u201d. Both Raab and Pompeo say there need to be more players in 5G. Breaking away briefly from the Raab-Pompeo show, the Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at 0.75% (seven members to two voted to maintain the status quo). It slashed its slashed its growth forecasts to 0.8% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in 2022. You can read more on our business blog. Pompeo says the UK should have a close relationship with the EU and Nato, although there will inevitably be disagreements with the EU, which brings a smile to Raab\u2019s face. The special relationship means shared values and being a force for good around the world, says the US secretary of state. Talking about trade arrangements with the US, Raab says he doesn\u2019t want to pre-empt negotiations. Pompeo says it is about reducing friction between the countries, creating ease of travel, ease of each others citizens attending each others schools, ease of travel of capital. On Iran, Pompeo says pressure on Iran\u2019s economy has reduced its capability. Raab says there is scope for rapprochement with Iran but it must be prepared to take the necessary steps. Asked about the Trump deal on Iran, Raab says: I don\u2019t think there is a huge difference between Europeans and Americans ...the question is whether there is political will in Iran. Pompeo says you can only have conversations/disagreements about the likes of Huawei with countries you have a \u201cdeep relationship\u201d with, so it won\u2019t fracture the friendship. Raab concurs: Good friends don\u2019t always agree on everything. He says there is a sea of things the countries agree on. Pompeo says there is a \u201ctremendous value\u201d to the US from the relationship with the UK. He says: The Chinese communist party represents the central threat of our times. The US secretary of state talks about the importance of western democratic values, which he contrasts to those of the Chinese government. The Pompeo-Raab conversation has begun (refresh the page to see the livestream embedded at the top of the page). The US secretary of state says he wanted to be here on the date that Brexit takes place but Raab said Brexit day would be \u201chectic\u201d so he\u2019s here the day before. Raab says Brexit was about pursuing the UK self-interest and self-belief and it\u2019s great to have the US recognising and supporting that. Having the US say it\u2019s all fine by us ...it\u2019s great. Pompeo says: We intend to put the UK at the front of the line [for a trade deal]. He contrasts this with the Obama administration which he says would have put the UK at the back of the queue. The government has said it is working \u201curgently\u201d with Chinese authorities to ensure citizens in Wuhan can return on a flight \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: We are doing everything we can to get British people in Wuhan safely back to the UK. A number of countries\u2019 flights have been unable to take off as planned including the British repatriation from Wuhan. We are working urgently with the Chinese authorities to ensure that the flight can take off as soon as possible. The flight is planned to touch down at a military base in the UK before passengers are taken to an NHS facility to be quarantined. But the plane has been prevented from leaving China because \u201cwe haven\u2019t got the necessary clearances and we are working with the Chinese authorities on securing those\u201d, the spokesman said. Number 10 is not giving away any more than Grant Shapps did in transport questions this morning regarding whether HS2 will go ahead, despite the chancellor\u2019s backing for the high speed rail project. Coming up shortly (scheduled for 11.30am) is the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in conversation with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in a Policy Exchange event. We will be embedding a livestream at the top of the blog and I will also be listening in. Here are a couple of HS2-themed clips from transport questions in the House of Commons this morning. The Lib Dems\u2019 acting leader, Ed Davey, has been making a speech in Manchester this morning. He called for the end of the discord between remain voters and leave voters and for unity among progressives (an olive branch to Labour depending on who is elected leader?) to tackle inequality. He said that the campaign to stop Brexit is over but the Lid Dems will always be a pro-European, internationalist party. He said: Through pain comes wisdom, and the immense pain we feel tomorrow should at least remind us of one important truth: That which unites us is far greater than that which divides us. That is true whether \u201cus\u201d is the United Kingdom, Europe or humankind. And it is also true of \u2018us\u2019 as progressives. We cannot let small disagreements or tribal labels stand in the way of our common values: compassion, fairness, equality. internationalism. He added: We must no longer be a country that is divided by leave and remain, but that means we must heal our country\u2019s other divisions too. For if Brexit has taught us anything, it is that there are many serious divisions to fix. The UK is divided by inequality. Inequality of opportunity, of wealth, of power. Inequality of hope. And the forces of English and Scottish nationalism unleashed by these divisions, cannot bring our fractured country together: by their very nature they seek to divide our family of nations even further. Only progressive parties like the Liberal Democrats will fight to disperse power and wealth across our country, and to create opportunity for every child, in every community. He promised to fight the Conservatives every step of the way. When it comes to tough choices on taxation and spending, this Conservative prime minister looks to protect the wealthy than the vulnerable. Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of reforming democracy is to attack the courts and make it more difficult for people to vote. Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of uniting the country has been to tell half of the country to give up their beliefs. Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of a new role for Britain in the world, is to ring Donald Trump for his orders. We cannot leave Britain\u2019s future in the hands of a Prime Minister who only cares about himself, and has never once put the national interest ahead of his own career. We must stand together as progressives against these forces that have done so much harm, to prevent them doing even more. He said that the fight for a progressive Britain would begin with the campaign to prevent a no-deal Brexit at the end of the year. Moving away from HS2 for a minute, the Mirror had a story in today\u2019s paper about a confidential internal Labour report which found: The party lost 2.6m voters between the 2017 and 2019 general elections. Around 750,000 former supporters switched to the Lib Dems and a similar number went to pro-Brexit parties, primarily the Tories. A further 1.2m Labour voters from 2017 decided not to cast a vote. Of the 20 constituencies where Labour had the most \u201ccontacts\u201d with voters, it only gained one - Putney. Labour lost most support to the Tories among low-income older voters and less well-off families,. Toby Perkins, Labour MP for Chesterfield, urged Grant Shapps to commit to HS2 and \u201cget control\u201d of some MPs \u201cconstantly undermining\u201d it. Shapps said that MPs were quite entitled to debate the merits of the project under a democracy, adding: It is the case that this is the biggest infrastructure decision this country has ever made, the biggest in Europe, and it\u2019s quite right that it\u2019s properly and carefully considered ...the good news is he won\u2019t have to wait too long. Here is PA Media on the prison violence statistics, published this morning: Incidents of self-harm in prison have reached a record high, official figures show. There were 61,461 incidents in the 12 months to September, up 16% from the previous period, according to data released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). But the number of deaths behind bars have fallen by 8% in the 12 months to December, down to 300 from 325 in the previous period. Of these, 84 were self-inflicted, a 9% drop from 92 in the previous period. The number of assaults has also fallen slightly, down 2% in the year to September with 33,222. Attacks on staff remained at the same level as the previous period, with 10,059 assaults recorded, according to the data. Philip Davies called HS2 \u201ca catastrophic waste of money\u201d at transport questions in the House of Commons. He urged the government to prioritise \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d rail, increasing connections between northern cities, including those in his West Yorkshire constituency. In response, transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris said that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail \u201care not either or, they are additional investments.\u201d Seven minutes into transport questions, the first question on HS2 was posed to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. Eddie Hughes, Conservative MP for Walsall North, asked him whether he would join the chancellor in backing HS2 ahead of their meeting with the prime minister today. Shapps wasn\u2019t prepared to give anything away. He replied: He [Hughes] won\u2019t have to wait very long and we will have an announcement on this next month. Greg Smith, the newly elected Conservative MP for Buckingham, warned this morning that he will vote against HS2 in parliament if the government presses ahead with the project. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I was very clear in the general election campaign that I am opposed to HS2. It is absolutely wrong for my constituency and I believe it to be wrong for the country as well. I made very clear commitments in the general election that, come what may, I will oppose HS2. Smith said his view was shared by many other MPs, including newly-elected Tories in northern constituencies. We are not against infrastructure. We are just saying that HS2 is the wrong project, it goes along the wrong route at a cost that, frankly, the nation can\u2019t afford. What the HS2 review group - which has many new northern Conservative MPs on it - is saying is that, instead of HS2, we can do great things that will really improve people\u2019s lives - local commuter routes in our Midlands and northern towns and cities - big improvements to those. Good morning. This is Haroon Siddique standing in for Andrew Sparrow. It\u2019s a big day for the HS2 rail project today as the chancellor, Sajid Javid, is expected to give his backing to the controversial scheme despite concerns about its spiralling costs, environmental impact and opposition from many Tory MPs, not to mention Dominic Cummings. A final decision is not expected to be made until next week but Javid will meet Boris Johnson and the transport secretary, Grant Sharps, to discuss HS2 today. Given, he holds the purse strings, the chancellor\u2019s support is key and most papers report this morning that it paves the way for the project to be completed. Also coming up today: 9.30am - Shapps faces an hour of transport questions in parliament, where HS2 is likely to dominate. 9.30am - Statistics on prison violence and youth justice will be published by the ministry of justice at 9:30 a.m. 11.30am - The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo will be in conversation with the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab at Policy Exchange event. 12pm - The Bank of England will announce whether interest rates are to be cut for the first time since 2016, ahead of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union tomorrow. The government will announce that minimum funding levels for schools are to be enshrined in law. Every secondary school in England will receive at least \u00a35,000 per pupil next year, while primary schools will receive \u00a33,750 per pupil. After he planned airlift of UK nationals out of parts of China affected by coronavirus was cancelled at the last minute, the government is likely to face pressure about the effectiveness of its response. Stay tuned for all the political developments today. If you want to catch my attention, the best way is via Twitter @Haroon_Siddique.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

      "bodyText": "China has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths, as countries struggled to evacuate citizens still trapped in the city where the outbreak began and Russia closed its long border with its southern neighbour. The death toll rose to 170 on Thursday \u2013 up from 132 the previous day, a rise of 29%. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,736, up from 5,974 a day ago. The actual death rate has not risen, and is now at 2.2%. The number of global cases is 7,818. It is understood that 162 of the deaths \u2013 or 95% \u2013 are in Hubei province where Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began, is located. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province and one in the south-western province of Sichuan. The health chief of Huanggang city, which has reported 500 cases, second only to Wuhan, was summarily sacked by the Chinese government following public anger over her inability to answer questions about the outbreak on state television. Tang Zhihong floundered under questioning from a central government inspection team together with a reporter. Asked how many sick people there were in one of the hospitals, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m unclear. I only know how many beds there are. Don\u2019t ask me how many people are being treated.\u201d Her TV appearance generated more than half a million comments on the Weibo account of state television\u2019s news channel, most of them in a very angry tone. A few hours after the programme aired, the city\u2019s health department said in a terse and brief statement that Tang had been removed. It gave no other details. The World Health Organization\u2019s emergency committee is meeting on Thursday to decide whether to declare a global health emergency. On Wednesday it warned all governments to be \u201con alert\u201d. The WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has praised China for its efforts to contain the virus but said that the few cases of human to human transmission outside of China, in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam were cause for real concern. In Moscow, the Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin issued a decree ordering the temporary closure of the country\u2019s border with China, which extends for 2,600 miles (4,200 kms). The border had been de facto closed because of the lunar new year holiday, but authorities said the closure would be extended until 1 March. In addition, all train traffic between the two countries, except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, was stopped on Thursday. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was previously diagnosed with the virus. The US and Japan have started evacuating citizens, and other countries are poised to send chartered flights to Wuhan, amid reports that some evacuations had been held up by delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese authorities. The first British flight to evacuate citizens will carry about 150 British nationals and 50 others, mainly from the EU. A Spanish chartered flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan at 5am local time on Friday for RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. From there it is understood that the British passengers will be taken to a former NHS facility in the north-west of England. Australia is yet to gain permission from the Chinese government to evacuate hundreds of its citizens, and New Zealand has launched a separate rescue mission, though a timeline remains unclear. France, South Korea and other countries are also pulling out their citizens or making plans to do so. About 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans are scheduled to be flown out of Wuhan onboard two French planes this week. In Italy a cruise ship\u2019s 6,000 passengers were kept on board while tests were held on two Chinese travellers. Businesses are beginning to feel the impact of the outbreak.

The Chinese Football Association has postponed all domestic games. In Huahe, a town in Hubei province, authorities were investigating the case of a 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who died after his father, who cared for him, was taken into quarantine for five days. Almost 200 US citizens evacuated from Wuhan on Wednesday were undergoing three days of testing and monitoring at a southern California military base to ensure they did not show signs of the virus. In Japan, three of the 206 people repatriated on Wednesday had tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the country to 11. A second group of 210 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo on Thursday morning. Officials defended the decision not to forcibly quarantine all Japanese nationals arriving from Wuhan, in contrast to Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand, which will quarantine all evacuees for at least two weeks regardless of whether they show symptoms.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 31 January.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency</strong> but has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-live-updates-china-death-toll-wuhan-evacuation-foreign-nationals-citizens-latest-news\">stressed its confidence in China\u2019s handling of the crisis</a>. Thursday saw the single biggest increase in the death toll \u2013 up 29% to 170 \u2013 with more than 7,700 reported cases. Ninety-five per cent of the deaths have occurred in the Hubei province in central China, but health officials in Chicago have confirmed a first case of person-to-person transmission inside the US. In Italy 6,000 holidaymakers remain in lockdown on board a cruise ship after concerns passengers could be carrying the virus, while a 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy from Hubei <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/disabled-teenager-in-china-dies-at-home-alone-after-relatives-quarantined\">has died after his carers were quarantined</a> and unable to assist him.</p> \n<p><strong>The watchdog for Australia\u2019s disability services is receiving up to 100 allegations of neglect or abuse weekly</strong>, with figures from just three months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/ndis-watchdog-is-fielding-nearly-100-allegations-of-abuse-or-neglect-a-week\">showing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/ndis-watchdog-is-fielding-nearly-100-allegations-of-abuse-or-neglect-a-week\">more than 6,000 instances of people being physically restrained</a> without their consent. There were 1,236 reports of abuse or neglect filed during the quarter, with Jeff Smith, the chief executive of People with Disability Australia, saying it was \u201chorrifying that people with disability are being subjected to this level of violence\u201d. </p> \n<p><strong>At least 12 sport grant applications seeking funding for female change rooms were ignored</strong>, despite the federal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/sports-grants-coalition-rejected-12-grant-applications-for-female-change-rooms-at-local-sport-grounds\">defending the program on the basis of its focus on female participation</a> in community sports.

Top stories The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency but has stressed its confidence in China\u2019s handling of the crisis. Thursday saw the single biggest increase in the death toll \u2013 up 29% to 170 \u2013 with more than 7,700 reported cases. Ninety-five per cent of the deaths have occurred in the Hubei province in central China, but health officials in Chicago have confirmed a first case of person-to-person transmission inside the US. In Italy 6,000 holidaymakers remain in lockdown on board a cruise ship after concerns passengers could be carrying the virus, while a 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy from Hubei has died after his carers were quarantined and unable to assist him. The watchdog for Australia\u2019s disability services is receiving up to 100 allegations of neglect or abuse weekly, with figures from just three months showing more than 6,000 instances of people being physically restrained without their consent. There were 1,236 reports of abuse or neglect filed during the quarter, with Jeff Smith, the chief executive of People with Disability Australia, saying it was \u201chorrifying that people with disability are being subjected to this level of violence\u201d. At least 12 sport grant applications seeking funding for female change rooms were ignored, despite the federal government defending the program on the basis of its focus on female participation in community sports. One of the rejected applications, Cherry Gardens Ironbank Recreation Ground, came highly recommended by Sport Australia with a score of 94 out of 100, but was overlooked by the then sport minister, Brigid McKenzie. A rugby club in the Coalition-held seat of Sturt did receive $500,000 for women\u2019s change rooms, despite fielding no women\u2019s teams after allegations of sexism. It was rated by Sport Australia at 60.5 out of 100. Australia Scientists are calling on Australians to document how the nation\u2019s habitats and wildlife are recovering from the unprecedented bushfire crisis. With 11m hectares badly burnt, a new citizen data project could deliver essential information to aid recovery efforts. The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for a cap on the fuel rebate system, with the $4.5bn annual saving to be redirected to rural and regional renewal. Under the proposal, small landholders would not be adversely disadvantaged courtesy of an annual cap of $20,000, with the bulk of savings coming from the mining sector. The world High winds have blown over sections of Donald Trump\u2019s US-Mexico border wall, with construction crews rushed in to fix nine-metre steel panels that had begun to lean at sharp angles. Islamic State has started to reassert itself in its Middle East heartlands, the UN has warned, with a UN security council report warning that the group is conducting increasingly brazen insurgent attacks inside Syria and Iraq. Nearly 10m trees planted in Turkey as part of National Forestation Day have reportedly died, just months after Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared the initiative. A lack of water is understood to have been the cause. The Screen Actors Guild has released new guidelines to oversee the filming of sex scenes, in an effort to eradicate sexual misconduct in the film and television industry.

But with the historic referendum non-binding, will Papua New Guinea obstruct the move to freedom? On this episode of Full Story, Leanne Jorari looks at the long and often violent journey to this historic moment for Bougainville. Sport A groin injury may have made Roger Federer\u2019s Australian Open exit to Novak Djokovic a likely outcome but the Swiss remains hopeful of adding to his men\u2019s record 20 grand slams, writes Simon Cambers, despite going down 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 to the Serbian.

Media roundup South Australia\u2019s Liberal premier, Steven Marshall, has vowed to put his \u201cfoot to the floor\u201d in accelerating the state\u2019s move towards a zero-emissions economy, writes the Australian, with the premier saying climate change had \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d exacerbated bushfires. An \u201cincreasingly erratic\u201d Tony Mokbel has threatened the life of a senior Victorian police officer who worked on the taskforce that eventually arrested the underworld boss, the Age reports. And, Tasmanian farmers might become big winners out of Brexit, claims the Mercury, which suggests that Australia could sign a trade deal with the UK by year\u2019s end that would dramatically boast the state\u2019s food exports. Coming up The Productivity Commission is releasing an annual report on primary and community health, ambulance services, public hospitals and mental health management. The CSIRO will hold a media conference on its work on the coronavirus at 10am.

About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Raab said: \u201cWe are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January.

      "bodyText": "Around 120 Britons will fly from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak overnight and land in the UK on Friday morning where they will be taken to Wirral for a fortnight\u2019s quarantine. It news came shortly before the risk level from the virus in the UK was raised from low to moderate and the World Health Organization declared it a global health emergency. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, announced that the emergency flight, which was delayed by 24 hours, would be taking off from Wuhan and was due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire at around 9am. Military doctors will be onboard the chartered plane in case immediate treatment is necessary, although any passengers displaying symptoms of the virus \u2013 which can include a sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties \u2013 will be barred from boarding. It is understood there will be a quarantine area in the plane in case somebody falls ill during the flight. The returnees will be bussed to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral where they will be monitored and treated if any symptoms develop. They will be staying in an accommodation block usually designated for NHS staff. Margaret Greenwood, the Labour MP for Wirral West, said she had spoken to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who told her that experts believed it was unlikely that those quarantined had the virus. Passengers were asked to sign contracts agreeing to the 14-day quarantine as a condition of getting the flight home. A further 50 EU nationals will also be on the chartered flight, which will fly on to Spain where it will complete its journey. Raab said: \u201cWe are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January. The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need.\u201d Some Britons with family members who hold a Chinese passport have decided to remain in Wuhan because they faced being separated if they had chosen to travel.

He emphasised that the move was no reflection on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, adding that the country\u2019s response had saved the world from many more cases and deaths.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-deaths-leap-in-china-as-countries-struggle-to-evacuate-citizens\">Coronavirus deaths leap in China as countries struggle to evacuate citizens</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of the 9,320 confirmed cases so far, only 98 have been outside China, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo far we have not seen any deaths outside China, for which we must be grateful,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cAlthough these numbers are relatively small compared to the number of cases in China, we must act together now to limit further spread.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill prepared to deal with it,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cThe decision is not a vote of no confidence in China.\u201d</p> \n<p>The emergencies committee, which advises the director-general, made a series of recommendations. Tedros said the first of these was that \u201cthere is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.\u201d It also said that it was important to combat the rumours and misinformation circulating about the outbreak.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cChina is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact that is is having on China.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the UK, the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responded by increasing their risk assessment from low to moderate. \u201cThis does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities,\u201d they said in a statement.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs we have previously said, it is likely there will be individual cases and we are confident in the ability of the NHS and HSC in Northern Ireland to manage these in a way that protects the public and provides high-quality care.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of health foundation Wellcome, said the WHO had made the right call. \u201cCountries, public health teams and researchers worldwide have been acting on this with the very highest level of concern for the last few weeks. But this virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cDeclaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen governments\u2019 focus on protecting citizens. But we must also step up as an international community to make sure no one is left behind \u2013 with all interventions, including public health measures, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines available to everyone. This will challenge the best-resourced countries but will have disproportionate impact on fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most people who have fallen sick in other countries have travelled from China\u2019s Hubei province. So far there has been only a very small number of cases in these countries of transmission from person to person \u2013 the development that health experts most fear.</p> \n<p>The United States <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-us-first-case-person-to-person-transmission\">reported human-to-human transmission on Thursday.</a> The man who became unwell in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who became sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan. There has also been human-to-human transmission in Vietnam, Japan and Germany.</p> \n<p>In China, the health chief of Huanggang city, which has reported 500 cases \u2013 second only to Wuhan \u2013 was sacked by the Chinese government following public anger over her inability to answer questions about the outbreak on state television.</p> \n<p>Tang Zhihong floundered when questioned by a central government inspection team and a reporter. Asked how many sick people there were in one of the hospitals, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m unclear. I only know how many beds there are. Don\u2019t ask me how many people are being treated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her TV appearance generated more than half-a-million comments on the Weibo account of state television\u2019s news channel, most of them angry. A few hours after the programme aired, the city\u2019s health department said in a terse and brief statement that Tang had been removed. It gave no other details.</p> \n<p>The US and Japan have started evacuating citizens, while other countries are poised to send chartered flights to Wuhan city \u2013 the centre of the outbreak in Hubei \u2013 amid reports that some evacuations had been held up by delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese authorities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-hundreds-stranded-wuhan-uk-evacuation-flight-delayed\">Coronavirus: Britons to be quarantined in Wirral after arriving from Wuhan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The first British flight to evacuate citizens will carry about 150 British nationals and 50 other people, mainly from the EU.

      "bodyText": "The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared, but he warned governments not to impose travel or trade restrictions on China. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization decided to declare an emergency, which gives WHO greater powers to direct the response, because of the danger that coronavirus could be devastating if it spreads to countries with weak public health systems. He emphasised that the move was no reflection on China, adding that the country\u2019s response had saved the world from many more cases and deaths. Of the 9,320 confirmed cases so far, only 98 have been outside China, he said. \u201cSo far we have not seen any deaths outside China, for which we must be grateful,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cAlthough these numbers are relatively small compared to the number of cases in China, we must act together now to limit further spread.\u201d \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill prepared to deal with it,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cThe decision is not a vote of no confidence in China.\u201d The emergencies committee, which advises the director-general, made a series of recommendations. Tedros said the first of these was that \u201cthere is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.\u201d It also said that it was important to combat the rumours and misinformation circulating about the outbreak. \u201cIn the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cChina is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact that is is having on China.\u201d In the UK, the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responded by increasing their risk assessment from low to moderate. \u201cThis does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs we have previously said, it is likely there will be individual cases and we are confident in the ability of the NHS and HSC in Northern Ireland to manage these in a way that protects the public and provides high-quality care.\u201d Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of health foundation Wellcome, said the WHO had made the right call. \u201cCountries, public health teams and researchers worldwide have been acting on this with the very highest level of concern for the last few weeks. But this virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cDeclaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen governments\u2019 focus on protecting citizens. But we must also step up as an international community to make sure no one is left behind \u2013 with all interventions, including public health measures, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines available to everyone. This will challenge the best-resourced countries but will have disproportionate impact on fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries.\u201d Most people who have fallen sick in other countries have travelled from China\u2019s Hubei province. So far there has been only a very small number of cases in these countries of transmission from person to person \u2013 the development that health experts most fear. The United States reported human-to-human transmission on Thursday. The man who became unwell in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who became sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan. There has also been human-to-human transmission in Vietnam, Japan and Germany. In China, the health chief of Huanggang city, which has reported 500 cases \u2013 second only to Wuhan \u2013 was sacked by the Chinese government following public anger over her inability to answer questions about the outbreak on state television. Tang Zhihong floundered when questioned by a central government inspection team and a reporter. Asked how many sick people there were in one of the hospitals, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m unclear. I only know how many beds there are. Don\u2019t ask me how many people are being treated.\u201d Her TV appearance generated more than half-a-million comments on the Weibo account of state television\u2019s news channel, most of them angry. A few hours after the programme aired, the city\u2019s health department said in a terse and brief statement that Tang had been removed. It gave no other details. The US and Japan have started evacuating citizens, while other countries are poised to send chartered flights to Wuhan city \u2013 the centre of the outbreak in Hubei \u2013 amid reports that some evacuations had been held up by delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese authorities. The first British flight to evacuate citizens will carry about 150 British nationals and 50 other people, mainly from the EU. The flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan at 5am local time on Friday for RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. It is understood that the British passengers will be taken to a former NHS facility in the Wirral and quarantined for 14 days. Australia is yet to receive permission from the Chinese government to evacuate hundreds of its citizens, and New Zealand has launched a separate rescue mission, though a timeline remains unclear. France, South Korea and other countries are also removing their citizens or making plans to do so. About 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans are scheduled to be flown out of Wuhan on two French planes this week. In Italy, a cruise ship\u2019s 6,000 passengers were kept onboard while tests were conducted on two Chinese travellers. In Moscow, the Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin issued a decree ordering the temporary closure of the country\u2019s border with China, which extends for 2,600 miles (4,200km). The border had been de facto closed because of the lunar new-year holiday, but authorities said the closure would be extended until 1 March. All train traffic between the two countries, except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, was stopped on Thursday.",
