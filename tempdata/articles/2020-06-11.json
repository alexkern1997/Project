Gambling academics and city planners have all expressed concern over the future of Crown\u2019s Sydney casino at Barangaroo as a result of the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism\u2019s warning to Chinese residents \u201cto enhance their safety awareness and do not travel to Australia\u201d issued last week, citing a spike in racism during the coronavirus pandemic. Senior gaming industry advisers told the Guardian the Chinese government had previously been successful in directing where Chinese citizens gamble, noting Macau, and while most Australian casinos will suffer from last week\u2019s travel warning, it appears to impact Crown\u2019s planned Sydney casino most directly. Crown \u2013 whose ownership and allegations of high-roller junkets and money laundering are the subject of a NSW parliamentary inquiry and other planned inquiries \u2013 has attracted controversy over plans to target VIP players at the 75-floor tower that will also include 82 luxury apartments and a six-star hotel, due to open in December, ahead of the casino\u2019s opening in early 2021. However, the future revenue stream of the skyline-dominating building, which was controversially approved for the city\u2019s second casino license in 2013 without going to tender, has been thrown into question after a drop in high rollers in recent years, related to a series of events that include Crown employees being arrested in China in 2016 for promoting gambling, and efforts from Beijing to limit gambling spend outside of the country. This has prompted industry observers to question the viability of the Crown Sydney project relying solely on foreign high rollers, and while Crown has not applied for poker machines \u2013 considered a reliable income source for casinos \u2013 its future rival Star City recently secured a 21-year exclusivity deal with the New South Wales government to be the only Sydney casino with poker machines.

There is no evidence to suggest Crown has made any attempts to secure poker machines for its Sydney casino and it has ruled out doing so in the past. Crown has previously noted it has \u201ca comprehensive anti-money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing program\u201d in place which is subject to Austrac supervision, and defended its dealings with Chinese junket operators as being registered with their local authorities. Mike Harris, an academic in urban architecture at the University of New South Wales who has researched the Barangaroo project, said the casino will \u201cbecome a white elephant\u201d if they are forced to rely on the high-roller customer base from China given Beijing\u2019s travel warning. \u201cIf that high-end Chinese market wasn\u2019t available maybe the Barangaroo casino wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead in the first place,\u201d Harris said. He told the Guardian the approval process for the casino and \u201ca lack of transparency around planning amendments\u201d had damaged \u201cfaith in the NSW planning system\u201d.

Advocacy groups also said the technology could disproportionately negatively impact non-white people.<br></p> \n  <p>An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime. It disproportionately misidentified Congress members who are not white. <br></p> \n  <p>In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it.

      "bodyText": "The US coronavirus case count is approaching 2m. The official case count is 1,999,313, per the Johns Hopkins tracker. Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, testified before the House judiciary committee. Floyd told lawmakers that his brother, who was killed in police custody late last month, \u201cdidn\u2019t deserve to die over 20 dollars\u201d. He later said that the killing of his brother was \u201ca modern-day lynching in broad daylight\u201d. Thomas Lane, one of the officers involved in Floyd\u2019s killing, has been released after posting bond. Lane was charged with aiding and abetting in Floyd\u2019s death, and bail was set at $1m. Trump will hold a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday, marking his first rally since the coronavirus crisis closed down states. The event could spark public health concerns, considering coronavirus infections are on the rise in 12 states. The rally will also take place on Juneteenth, in the city where a 1921 massacre of Black people occurred. Trump said he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming military bases named after Confederate generals. The president\u2019s comment came two days after the Pentagon signaled it was open to a discussion on changing the base names, which have attracted more criticism as Black Lives Matter protests spread across the country. The Minneapolis police chief said he was immediately ending contract negotiations with the city\u2019s police union. Medaria Arradondo, the police chief, said the contract with the police union needed to be restructured to allow for meaningful reform after the police killing of Floyd. A former federal judge said the criminal charges against Michael Flynn should not be dismissed. Former US district judge John Gleeson, who was appointed to review the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss Flynn\u2019s charges, argued in a new court filing that the motion should be denied because there is \u201cclear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power\u201d. It seems the Trump campaign is aware of the significance of the president holding his first rally since coronavirus shut states down in Tulsa, on 19 June. Responding to a Bloomberg reporter, a Trump campaign advisor wrote that \u201cRepublicans are proud of the history of Juneteenth\u201d. Campaign advisor Katrina Pierson\u2069 also said that Trump \u201cbuilt a record of success for Black Americans, including unprecedented low unemployment\u201d. In fact, although unemployment among Black Americans reached a record low during the Trump administration prior to the pandemic, most of the progress came when Barack Obama was president. Moreover, median household income for African Americans was lower in 2018 than during a peak in 2000. Pierson also said that \u201cJoe Biden spent last Juneteenth raising money at a private fundraiser.\u201d On the eve of Juneteenth, Biden invoked southern segregationist senators and fondly recalled the \u201ccivility\u201d of the Senate in the 1970s and 1980s at a fundraiser at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City. His comments drew widespread criticism at the time. Jon Ossoff, the 33-year-old Georgia media executive, has won the state\u2019s Democratic primary for a Senate seat. AP projected Ossoff\u2019s victory a day after the state\u2019s elections descended into chaos, with poll workers reporting long lines and issues with voting machines. Ossoff, who earned an endorsement from the civil rights leader and Georgia representative John Lewis, rose to prominence after breaking fundraising records during a 2017 special election for a US House seat. Ossoff lost the House seat to Republican Karen Handel back then. (And then Handel lost the next year to Lucy McBath, a Democrat). Ossoff will now face off against Republican David Perdue, an ally of Donald Trump. Democrats hope that they can flip the seat in a competitive race in November. Here\u2019s a few of the protest in Atlanta today: The thoroughfare was named after civil rights leader and US representative John Lewis in 2018. Coronavirus cases in the US are nearing 2m. Johns Hopkins has just added new cases to its tally for the US, with 1,999,313 currently confirmed. Follow the Guardian\u2019s live global coverage: Here are some of the most striking images of protest from today. Washington DC Boston New York LeBron James is launching a voting rights organization, the New York Times reports. The basketball star has partnered with a group of other prominent Black athletes and entertainers to start an organization called More Than a Vote. The effort will focus on fighting voter suppression, while also encouraging African Americans ro register to vote and cast ballots. Because of everything that\u2019s going on, people are finally starting to listen to us \u2014 we feel like we\u2019re finally getting a foot in the door,\u201d James told the Times. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference.\u201d From Guardian staff and agencies: Nine California counties are reporting a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalizations of confirmed cases, raising fears that authorities may have to reimpose or tighten public health restrictions aimed at slowing the virus\u2019s spread. New diagnoses in the heavily populated Los Angeles area are going up in part because testing is more widely available. But officials say infections and hospitalizations in most other parts of the state are being driven by factors tied directly to the loosening of restrictions or overt flouting of public health rules. It is too soon to see whether cases will also spike after protests over the death of George Floyd swept the state. In Sacramento county, which had 33 hospitalizations of Covid-19 patients and 14 in its intensive care units as of Tuesday, health officials said the rise in infections is tied to recent gatherings, including birthday parties and a funeral. \u201cMany of the cases that are showing up in hospitals are linked to gatherings that are taking place in homes \u2013 birthday parties and funerals,\u201d said Olivia Kasirye, public health director of Sacramento county. Nearly three months after Breonna Taylor was killed in her own home, the Louisville police released an incident report that lists injures as \u201cnone\u201d. A copy of the report was obtained by the Courier Journal. It described a \u201cdeath investigation\u201d and lists Taylor as the victim and three officers as offenders. But the four-page report says there was no forced entry \u2014 even though officers forcefully entered Taylor\u2019s home with a battering ram. The report also lists her injuries as \u201cnone,\u201d even though she was shot at least eight times according to her family\u2019s attorneys. The report was released after the Courier-Journal brought a legal challenge against the Louisville police department. \u201cI read this report and have to ask the mayor, the police chief and the city\u2019s lawyers: Are you kidding?\u201d Richard Green, the paper\u2019s editor told a reporter for the Courier Journal. \u201cThis is what you consider being transparent to taxpayers and the public?\u201d Hallie Golden reports for The Guardian: Governor Jay Inslee of Washington has ordered a new investigation into the death of Manuel Ellis, an African American man who died more than three months ago in police custody, following questions over the independence of the investigation. The move comes one day after a lawyer for the Ellis family released footage from the night of his death, which shows him screaming, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe sir. I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d followed by what sounds like an officer saying, \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d Inslee said in a statement on Wednesday that his decision came after the county prosecutor informed the state that the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department, which was leading the investigation, had officers at the scene of Ellis\u2019s arrest on 3 March. \u201cThe state will ensure an independent investigation and independent prosecutorial review into the death of Manuel Ellis,\u201d said Inslee, adding that his office was working to determine which agency would conduct it. \u201cWe will ensure that the work is done free of conflicts of interest.\u201d Ellis\u2019s death, which has been ruled a homicide, has become part of the protests over police brutality and racism that have spread across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man killed when a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. Lane was released after posting bond. His bail was set for $1m. Lane was one of the officers \u2013 including Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng \u2013 who stopped George Floyd while responding to a call about the alleged use of a counterfeit $20 bill. While Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, Lane and the other officers have been charged with aiding and abetting Chavin. As Trump rallies in Tulsa, a number of cities have planned protests and marches against police brutality and systematic racism. On 19 June, marches are planned in New York and New Jersey. In Wisconsin, the Legislative Black Caucus has asked governor Tony Evers on to call a special session on Juneteenth to take up measures overhauling the policing system. It\u2019s unclear if the Trump campaign\u2019s choice to hold his first rally since coronavirus shut down states on Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery, was intentional. The president has acknowledged the date before. In 2017, Trump released a statement, saying: \u201cMelania and I send our warmest greetings to all those celebrating Juneteenth, a historic day recognizing the end of slavery.\u201d That year, Trump also delivered a rambling speech during Black History month, calling the late Frederick Douglass \u201can example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d A statue of Christopher Columbus has fallen outside the Minnesota state capital in St Paul. This appears to be the latest depiction of the colonizer to be torn down. Yesterday, protestors in Richmond, Virginia, tore down a Columbus statue, set it on fire, and threw it in a lake. And in Boston, a Columbus statue was beheaded. The Guardian\u2019s technology reporter Kari Paul writes: Amazon is implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of its artificial intelligence software Rekognition amid growing backlash over the tech company\u2019s ties to policing. The company has posted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, which advocates for police reform, but sells its facial recognition software to police forces. Amazon has not said how many police forces use the technology, or how it is used but Amazon marketing materials promoted Rekognition being used in conjunction with police body cameras in real time. When it was first released, Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software was criticized by human rights groups as \u201ca powerful surveillance system\u201d that is available to \u201cviolate rights and target communities of color\u201d. Advocacy groups also said the technology could disproportionately negatively impact non-white people. An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime. It disproportionately misidentified Congress members who are not white. In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it. The move follows IBM putting a permanent end to its development of facial recognition technology. \u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\u201d Nancy Pelosi has requested that Confederate monuments be removed from display at the US capital. In a letter to the leaders of the Joint Committee on the Library, Pelosi wrote: \u201cThe statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation. Monuments to men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to achieve such a plainly racist end are a grotesque affront to these ideals.\u201d Pelosi and other Democrats in Congress tried to pass legislation to have Confederate statues removed from the capital in 2017, in the wake of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer. In another emotional moment in an already emotional, hours-long hearing, Georgia congresswoman Lucy McBath told Philonise Floyd: \u201cI know your pain.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say I can only imagine,\u201d she said, her voice shaking with emotion. \u201cI know what you are going through.\u201d McBath\u2019s son Jordan Davis, who was black, was 17 when he was murdered by a white man at a gas station in Florida after he refused to turn down the volume of his rap music. \u201cWe have come to this hearing today as a result of a deep and morally painful wound and events that happen in this country again and again and again,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing black while being in your own community,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel the pain experienced by too many families every single day and every single day it happens it\u2019s like a sucker punch in my heart and my gut because when is it going to stop?\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s decision to hold his first campaign rally since coronavirus closed down the country in Tulsa on Juneteenth brings to mind Ronald Reagan\u2019s choice to launch his 1980 campaign with a speech lauding \u201cstates rights\u201d near the site of the notorious \u201cMississippi burning\u201d murder of civil rights workers. In 1964, three civil rights workers were abducted and killed by the Ku Klux Klan, just southwest of Philadelphia, Mississippi, and surreptitiously buried in a dam. Reagan delivered a campaign speech within walking distance of the dam, proclaiming \u201cI believe in state\u2019s rights.\u201d His language echoed that of white Southerners who used the phrase states rights to justify segregation. Hi there it\u2019s Maanvi \u2014 writing from the West Coast. First up, Nascar has just announced it will be banning confederate flags at races. \u201cThe presence of the confederate flag at Nascar events runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry,\u201d Nascar said in a statement. The move is significant, considering the sport\u2019s popularity in the south. Fans have been displaying Confederate flags and symbols at racing events despite Nascar asking them not to do so five years ago. The outright ban today The announcement is sure to be controversial with a number of NASCAR fans, some of whom display Confederate flags and symbols at racing events even five years after NASCAR asked fans not to do so. The outright ban today comes after Bubba Wallace, the circuit\u2019s only Black full-time driver, told CNN on Monday, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of angry people that carry those flags proudly, but it\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cWe have to change that, and I encourage NASCAR\u2014 we will have those conversations to remove those flags,\u201d he said. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, testified before the House judiciary committee. Floyd told lawmakers that his brother, who was killed in police custody late last month, \u201cdidn\u2019t deserve to die over twenty dollars.\u201d He later said that the killing of his brother was \u201ca modern-day lynching in broad daylight.\u201d Trump said he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming military bases named after Confederate generals. The president\u2019s comment came two days after the Pentagon signaled it was open to a discussion on changing the base names, which have attracted more criticism as Black Lives Matter protests spread across the country. The Minneapolis police chief said he was immediately ending contract negotiations with the city\u2019s police union. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said the contract with the police union needed to be restructured to allow for meaningful reform after the police killing of Floyd. A former federal judge said the criminal charges against Michael Flynn should not be dismissed. Former US district judge John Gleeson, who was appointed to review the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss Flynn\u2019s charges, argued in a new court filing that the motion should be denied because there is \u201cclear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power.\u201d Trump will hold a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday, marking his first rally since the start of the US coronavirus crisis. The event could spark public health concerns, considering coronavirus infections are on the rise in 12 states. The rally will also take place on Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in America, and it comes as the president has voiced criticism of Black Lives Matter protesters. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. An astute reader of the blog just pointed out that the president\u2019s first campaign rally in more than three months will take place on Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in America. The rally will also be held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a 1921 race massacre resulted in the destruction of black businesses and residences at the hands of angry, white mobs. The massacre has been described as \u201cthe single worst incident of racial violence in American history.\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement of the event comes as the president has criticized the George Floyd protests and referred to those demonstrating against police brutality as \u201cthugs.\u201d Trump said his first rally since the start of the US coronavirus crisis would be held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday. The June 19 rally will likely rattle some public health experts, considering coronavirus infections are on the rise in about a dozen states. But the president has clearly been itching to resume his campaign rallies, where he has been known to go on extended tangents boasting about his successes since taking office, which frequently require fact-checking. After last week\u2019s jobs report showed US unemployment had slightly dropped to 13.3%, Trump held a celebratory event in the Rose Garden that had the feel of a campaign rally. The president appeared to improvise many lines and refused to take questions from the White House reporters who attended the event. Trump has just told the White House press pool that his next campaign rally, the first since states started shutting down in response to the coronavirus crisis, will likely be held in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The president made the comment during a roundtable discussion with African-American leaders from media and community activism, which did not appear on his original White House schedule. The president said he would first hold a rally in Oklahoma before moving on to other states like Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, where the Republican national convention was originally supposed to be held. Coronavirus hospitalizations are currently on the rise in Arizona and North Carolina, which could intensify public health concerns about resuming the campaign rallies. The Trump campaign released a video teasing the imminent restarting of campaign rallies, which the president has said he may resume as soon as next week. The video includes footage from previous campaign rallies, which have become a defining aspect of Trump\u2019s campaigning style. The rallies will restart \u201cthis month,\u201d according to the video, which closes with the words \u201cComing soon!\u201d The campaign has not yet released details on where the first rally will be held or when exactly it will occur. The rallies will likely spark public health concerns, considering coronavirus infections are on the rise in many states, but some of the president\u2019s allies have argued the recent George Floyd protests, which have attracted thousands of people, could shield the rallies from potential criticism. Testifying before the House judiciary committee for a hearing on police brutality, Philonise Floyd said the police killing of his brother, George Floyd, was a \u201cmodern-day lynching.\u201d \u201cThey lynched my brother. That was a modern-day lynching in broad daylight,\u201d Floyd said of the officers who have been charged with murdering his brother. \u201cPeople was out there pleading, \u2018Please, please, get off, he can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 People were video-recording it. Nobody cared, nobody,\u201d Floyd said. Floyd called on police departments to \u201cstop hiring corrupted police officers.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to serve, and you\u2019re supposed to protect,\u201d Floyd said of the officers involved in the killing of his brother. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anybody protecting and serving that day.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has just concluded her briefing, which ended with her criticizing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Returning to the topic of renaming military bases named after Confederate military leaders, McEnany reminded reporters of Biden\u2019s past work with segregationist senators and his opposition to busing to end school segregation. \u201cShould we then rename the Biden Welcome Center?\u201d McEnany asked, referring to the Delaware tourism center named after the Democratic candidate. But those in favor of changing the base names have specifically argued that it\u2019s offensive to have military sites named after the very generals who fought against the US Army in a conflict that killed more than 600,000 people. A CQ Roll Call reporter asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany whether the president would veto any legislation that included a provision to rename military bases named after Confederate military leaders. The reporter specifically asked if Trump would veto the defense authorization act if it included a provision to rename Army forts for \u201ca general who won the Civil War.\u201d McEnany replied that the president would veto any proposal to rename American forts, arguing it was a \u201ccomplete disrespect\u201d to soldiers who trained at those forts to suggest the names are \u201csomehow inherently racist.\u201d Of course, one could make the argument that the service members who left those Army bases and never returned home were fighting for American ideals and democratic principles, not for the right to name military sites after Confederate generals. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that diminishing qualified immunity for police officers was a \u201cnonstarter\u201d for the president. In their sweeping police reform bill, congressional Democrats proposed ending qualified immunity, which provides police officers protection from civil lawsuits. Criminal justice activists have long called for ending qualified immunity, arguing the legal doctrine makes it much more difficult to hold police officers accountable. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump did not regret sending a tweet suggesting a 75-year-old protester who was shoved to the ground by police was actually an Antifa plant. \u201cThe president does not regret standing up for law enforcement,\u201d McEnany said. She later added, \u201cHe has a right to ask those questions.\u201d McEnany claimed Trump had facts before he sent the tweet, but the tweet did not include any evidence of the claim, and McEnany did not elaborate on what facts the president had. The press secretary argued that the country had become \u201creflexively anti-police officer,\u201d which is \u201cunacceptable to the president.\u201d She also chastized reporters for making a judgment about the Buffalo incident based on a \u201cbrief snippet of a video.\u201d The video clearly shows the man, Martin Gugino, being shoved to the ground by two police officers, with blood quickly pooling beneath his head. Gugino remains hospitalized, and the two officers have been charged with assault. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is now holding her briefing, where reporters are asking her about the president\u2019s recent tweets on the George Floyd protests. Just before McEnany took the podium, White House staffers passed out a printed copy of Trump\u2019s new tweets expressing opposition to renaming military bases named after Confederate military leaders. Trump said he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming military bases that are named after Confederate military leaders, even though the Pentagon has indicated it is open to the idea. \u201cThese Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a ... history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom,\u201d Trump wrote in a new tweet thread. \u201cThe United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations ... Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\u201d The tweet comes two days after an Army spokesperson said defense secretary Mark Esper and army secretary Ryan McCarthy \u201care open to a bi-partisan discussion on the topic,\u201d reversing decades of Pentagon opposition to the idea. Philonise Floyd broke down moments ago discussing the police killing of his brother, George Floyd, during the House judiciary committee hearing on police brutality. Floyd said that watching the video of a police officer with his knee on his brother\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds \u201cfelt like eight hours and 46 minutes.\u201d \u201cI just think about that video over and over again,\u201d Floyd said, getting choked up. \u201cThat\u2019s all people talk about. ... Kids have to watch the video. His kids have to watch the video.\u201d Through tears, Floyd said, \u201cMy family, they just cry, and cry every day.\u201d Floyd directly addressed the officers who have been charged with murdering his brother, saying, \u201cJustice has to be served. Those officers, they have to be convicted. Anybody with a heart, they know that\u2019s wrong. You don\u2019t do that to a human being, you don\u2019t even do that to an animal.\u201d He finished by saying, \u201cI wish I could get him back. Those officers, they get to live.\u201d The police officer who kneeled on George Floyd\u2019s neck was in talks with the local prosecutor to strike a plea deal before his arrest, according to a new report. Derek Chauvin, who was fired on May 26, the day after Floyd was killed, was arrested three days later and, initially, charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter by the Hennepin county attorney Mike Freeman. Chauvin\u2019s legal team had been in negotiations with that office and with the federal prosecutor, Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for Freeman, told NBC earlier. However, those negotiations failed. Eric Nelson, a defense lawyer for Chauvin, declined comment to NBC News today, the TV network reports. The following week, the state of Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, took over the investigation from the county team. Shortly afterwards, the charge against Chauvin was increased to second-degree murder. And the three other now-former officers who were also involved in the arrest and restraint of Floyd were charged with aiding and abetting murder. All four cops remain behind bars, following initial court appearances in Minneapolis, as protests have spread across the country and internationally, calling for an end to systemic racism, especially in policing, and comprehensive reform. Senior White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he does not believe there is systemic racism in America, despite the recent police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Kudlow said he did not consider African Americans\u2019 heightened levels of unemployment in comparison to white Americans to be a sign of institutional discrimination. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is systemic racism,\u201d Kudlow told reporters gathered on the White House driveway, blaming the recent police killings on some \u201cbad apples\u201d within departments. The Trump campaign is demanding that CNN retract a recent poll showing the president 14 points down against Joe Biden, CNN is now reporting. According to CNN, the president\u2019s reelection campaign sent a cease and desist letter to CNN president Jeff Zucker demanding that the network retract and apologize for the poll. CNN immediately rejected the campaign\u2019s request. \u201cWe stand by our poll,\u201d said Matt Dornic, a CNN spokesman. The poll showed Biden attracting the support of 55% of registered voters, in comparison to Trump\u2019s 41%. The results also found Trump\u2019s approval rating to be at 38%, his worst showing since January 2019. The president said earlier this week that he was hiring an outside firm to review CNN\u2019s poll and other recent surveys showing him losing to Biden, an announcement that was quickly met with mockery on social media. The independent State Department watchdog fired by Donald Trump says top department officials tried to bully him and dissuade his office from conducting a review of a multibillion-dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Former Inspector General Steve Linick told Congress last week that two senior officials sought to block an inquiry into the arms deal, according to a transcript of the interview made public Wednesday by Democrats leading an investigation into his dismissal, The Associated Press reports today. Linick, who had been inspector general since 2013, also said he was looking into previously reported allegations that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife may have misused government staff to run personal errands and several other matters. Trump abruptly fired him late on May 15 with what Linick said was no warning or cited cause. \u201cI was in a state of shock because I had no advance notice of anything like that,\u201d Linick said, recalling his reaction when he was informed of Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cI had no indication whatsoever.\u201d Shortly after the transcript was released, Pompeo called Linick a \u201cbad actor\u201d who had been acting inappropriately and not in the best interests of the State Department. Pompeo did not address the allegations of attempted bullying. He stood by his recommendation that Trump fire Linick, one of several inspectors general whom the president has recently dismissed. Linick said he had opened a review of last year\u2019s $8 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia at the request of lawmakers who claimed Pompeo had inappropriately circumvented Congress to approve the deal. Linick said the State Department\u2019s top management officer, Brian Bulatao, and legal adviser Marik String tried to stop him. Bulatao \u201csaid that we shouldn\u2019t be doing the work because it was a policy matter not within the IG\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d Linick said, adding that both Bulatao and String \u201cwere of the same mind\u201d on the matter. Linick said in the interview that he believed the Saudi review, which is continuing, was appropriate. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: George Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, testified before the House judiciary committee. In his opening statement for the panel\u2019s hearing on police brutality, Floyd told the lawmakers that his brother \u201cdidn\u2019t deserve to die over twenty dollars.\u201d \u201cIt is on you to make sure his death isn\u2019t in vain,\u201d Floyd said. The Minneapolis police chief said he was immediately ending contract negotiations with the city\u2019s police union. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said the contract with the police union needed to be restructured to allow for meaningful reform after the police killing of Floyd. A former federal judge said the criminal charges against Michael Flynn should not be dismissed. Former US district judge John Gleeson, who was appointed to review the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss Flynn\u2019s charges, argued in a new court filing that the motion should be denied because there is \u201cclear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A former federal judge appointed to review the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss criminal charges against Michael Flynn has concluded that the move represented an abuse of power. Former US district judge John Gleeson argued in a new court filing that the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss should be denied because there is \u201cclear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power.\u201d Gleeson, who was appointed by US district judge Emmet Sullivan to review the unusual request, accused the justice department of engaging in \u201chighly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President.\u201d Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 about his contact with the former Russian ambassador to the US. Flynn was waiting to be sentenced by Sullivan when the justice department announced it was moving to drog the charges against him. The situation has put Sullivan in a unique and difficult position, and the judge will now have to determine whether to grant the justice dpeartment\u2019s request. If Sullivan moves forward with sentencing, Flynn\u2019s team will almost certainly appeal the decision, so this legal saga is likely to continue. More than 1,200 former employees of the justice department are calling for an investigation into attorney general William Barr\u2019s role in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters from near the White House last week. In a letter to the justice department inspector general Michael Horowitz, the former staffers said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the Department\u2019s actions, and those of Attorney General William Barr himself, in response to the nationwide lawful gatherings to protest the systemic racism that has plagued this country throughout its history, recently exemplified by the brutal killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by sworn law enforcement officers acting under the color of law.\u201d The letter noted that those who have signed on to the request have worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The former staffers said they had severe concerns about Barr\u2019s role in the decision to use tear gas against protesters in order to allow Trump to stage a photo op at a nearby church. The former staffers said they were also concerned about the decision to deploy federal law enforcement officers to Washington, DC, in response to the protests. \u201cFor all of these reasons, we are asking you to immediately open and conduct an investigation of the full scope of the Attorney General\u2019s and the DOJ\u2019s role in these events,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIf the Attorney General or any other DOJ employee has directly participated in actions that have deprived Americans of their constitutional rights or that physically injured Americans lawfully exercising their rights, that would be misconduct of the utmost seriousness, the details of which must be shared with the American people.\u201d Trump is expected to travel to Dallas, Texas, tomorrow for a discussion on race relations and policing, in response to the police killing of George Floyd. According to the Dallas Morning News, the president will announce a plan for \u201cholistic revitalization and recovery.\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere shared the Dallas Morning News article on the upcoming trip. The event is scheduled to occur before a high-dollar fundraising dinner in Dallas, which is expected to bring in $10m for the president\u2019s reelection campaign. The discussion comes as Trump has faced calls to deliver a national address on police brutality in recent weeks, as protests in response to Floyd\u2019s death have spread across the nation. But the president\u2019s aides have brushed off questions about a potential speech, which would likely be ill-received considering Trump\u2019s controversial comments about the protests. Most recently, the president suggested (without evidence) that a 75-year-old protester who was shoved to the ground by two Buffalo police officers was actually an Antifa plant. The barriers near the White House, which were erected in response to the George Floyd protests, are starting to come down, nearly two weeks after demonstrators first took to Washington\u2019s streets to condemn police brutality. The National Park Service said yesterday that Lafayette Square would soon reopen, but the agency noted some parts would \u201cremain closed to allow the park to address damages and safety hazards.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer sent Trump a letter earlier this week calling on him to remove the barriers, but the White House claimed it was decision for NPS and the Secret Service. In the days since the barriers went up, the temporary fencing has become somewhat of a monument to Floyd, who was killed in police custody late last month. Protesters had taken to putting their signs, which include Floyd\u2019s name and \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d on the fencing. When NPS announced the fencing would be removed, people started removing the signs to preserve them. and the Smithsonian has said it will collect some of the signs to commemorate the protests. In his press conference, Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo sharply condemned the actions of the officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. Arradondo refused to even say the name of Derek Chauvin, who kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes and has now been charged with second-degree murder. A reporter noted that this misconduct may not have come to light if a civilian had not recorded Floyd\u2019s last moments. Arradondo responded by encouraging civilians to record and report such police misconduct to superiors, saying he was \u201cthankful\u201d the incident had been recorded so that Floyd and his family can get justice. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo declined to provide further details about the 911 call that brought police officers to George Floyd. But Arradondo emphasized that the call could not possibly justify the killing of Floyd. \u201cThere is nothing in that call that should have resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death,\u201d Arradondo said. Police officers were called to a Minneapolis convenience store because Floyd allegedly tried to pay using a counterfeit $20 bill. This morning, Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, testified before the House judiciary committee and said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to die over $20. I am asking you, is that what a black man\u2019s life is worth? $20? This is 2020. Enough is enough.\u201d Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said the contract with the police union needed to be restructured to allow for meaningful reform after the police killing of George Floyd. Arradondo expressed frustration with being unable to terminate officers after violent incidents because they are protected by a third-party mechanism. \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that we have to evolve,\u201d Arradondo said, describing the protocol for contract negotiations as \u201cantiquated\u201d and insufficent for meeting the needs of all stakeholders. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said he is immediately withdrawing from contract negotiations with the city\u2019s police union. Arradondo said he would restart an effort to use early warning signs to identify troubled officers. Arradondo\u2019s announcement come as many call for the resignation of Bob Kroll, the leader of the Minneapolis police union who described George Floyd as a \u201cviolent criminal.\u201d Among the witnesses called by Republicans was Angela Underwood Jacobs, the sister of Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer with the federal protective service who was fatally shot while on duty during a protest in Oakland over the police killing of George Floyd. In her remarks, Jacobs, the first African-American woman elected to the city council in Lancaster, California, said she could relate to the pain and anguish felt by the Floyd family. But she forcefully disagreed with some of the solutions being proposed by activists demanding policing reforms, and said such changes could leave law enforcement officers more vulnerable. \u201cPolice brutality of any kind must not be condoned; however it is blatantly wrong to create an excuse out of discrimination and disparity to loot and burn our communities, to kill our officers of the law,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a ridiculous solution to proclaim that defunding police departments is a solution to police brutality and discrimination because it is not a solution. It gets us nowhere as a nation and removes a safety net of protection that every citizen deserves.\u201d Trump applauded Republican congressman Jim Jordan\u2019s opening statement during the House judiciary committee hearing on police brutality. In his remarks, Jordan criticized Democrats over the movement to defund the police, even though that idea is not incorporated into congressional Democrats\u2019 police reform bill. \u201cGreat statement to Congress by @Jim_Jordan concerning Defunding (not!) our great Police,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cThis Radical Left agenda is not going to happen. Sleepy Joe Biden will be (already is) pulled all the way Left. Many, like Minneapolis, want to close their Police Departments. Crazy!\u201d In fact, Joe Biden wrote a USA Today op-ed specifically stating he is opposed to defunding the police, echoing a statement released by his campaign earlier this week. Trump also expressed frustration with Fox News for moving away from live coverage of the hearing before the witnesses called by Republicans delivered their opening statements. \u201cIncredible! @FoxNews just took Congressional Hearing off the air just prior to important witness statements. More like CNN!!! Fox is lost!!!\u201d Trump tweeted. In his opening remarks to the House judiciary committee, Philonise Floyd noted that the police were originally called against George Floyd because he allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill. \u201cGeorge wasn\u2019t hurting anyone that day,\u201d Floyd said of his brother. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to die over twenty dollars. I am asking you, is that what a black man\u2019s life is worth? Twenty dollars? This is 2020. Enough is enough.\u201d Floyd went on to tell the lawmakers, \u201cBe the leaders that this country, this world, needs. Do the right thing.\u201d Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, is now delivering his opening remarks to the House judiciary commitee for the hearing on police brutality. Floyd described the pain of watching the video of his brother\u2019s murder, which showed a police officer kneelng on George Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine mintues. \u201cHe was our gentle giant. I was reminded of that when I watched the video of his murder,\u201d Floyd said of his brother. \u201cHe was mild mannered; he didn\u2019t fight back. He listened to the officers. He called them \u2018sir.\u2019 The men who took his life, who suffocated him for eight minutes and 46 seconds. He still called them \u2018sir\u2019 as he begged for his life. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the kind of pain you feel when you watch something like that. When you watch your big brother, who you\u2019ve looked up to your whole life, die. Die begging for your mom.\u201d Floyd implored the lawmakers to make sure that his brother\u2019s death sparked meaningful change. \u201cI\u2019m here today to ask you to make it stop. Stop the pain. Stop us from being tired,\u201d Floyd said. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler offered his condolences to Philonise Floyd at the end of his opening remarks for the hearing on police brutality. The Democratic chairman said it was important to remember that George Floyd, who was killed in police cusotdy late last month, is \u201cnot just a cause.\u201d \u201cHe was a man. He had a family,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cHe had a rich life that was taken away from him far too early.\u201d The top Republican on the panel, Jim Jordan, also offered his condolences, saying of Floyd\u2019s murder, \u201cIt\u2019s as wrong as wrong can be, and your brother\u2019s killers will face justice.\u201d Jordan then turned to Angela Underwood Jacobs, whose brother, federal protective services officer David Underwood, was shot and killed during the recent protests in Oakland, California. Clearly trying to draw a direct comparison between the killings of Floyd and Underwood, Jordan repeated his earlier words, \u201cIt\u2019s as wrong as wrong can be, and your brother\u2019s killers will face justice.\u201d George Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, will soon deliver his opening remarks at the House judiciary committee hearing on police brutality. According to a copy of Floyd\u2019s prepared remarks, he will call on lawmakers to make sure that the killing of his brother sparks meaningful change to prevent similar deaths in the future. \u201cGeorge\u2019s name means something,\u201d Floyd will tell the House members. \u201cIf his death ends up changing the world for the better. And I think it will. I think it has. Then he died as he lived. It is on you to make sure his death isn\u2019t in vain.\u201d Floyd will also deliver a more personal message for his brother, who he called Perry. \u201cPerry, look at what you did, big brother. You\u2019re changing the world,\u201d Floyd will say. \u201cThank you for everything. For taking care of us when you were on Earth, and for taking care of all of us now. I hope you found mama and can rest in peace and power.\u201d The House judiciary committee hearing on police brutality has now started, with Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler delivering opening remarks. The New York Democrat said the US legacy of slavery \u201ccontinues to haunt our nation,\u201d citing statistics on discrimination against African Americans. Nadler said the hearing would focus on how to prevent \u201cracist acts of violence by police officers.\u201d The chairman emphasized the hearing was \u201cnot an indictment of all police officers,\u201d but he said too many officers abuse their power. \u201cThis is a systemic problem that requires a comprehensive solution,\u201d Nadler said, going on to endorse the Justice in Policing Act that congressional Democrats introduced earlier this week. Joe Biden wrote a USA Today op-ed about the need to address the country\u2019s systemic racism, in response to the police killing of George Floyd. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee wrote: We know the nation we want to be. Now we have to deliver on this moment to achieve fundamental changes that address racial inequalities and white supremacy in our country. President Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country, but just fixing the way the president talks won\u2019t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism across our laws and institutions, and we need to make sure black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. But Biden once again made clear that he did not support the movement to defund the police, as his campaign said in a statement earlier this week: If state and local governments fail to make necessary changes, the Department of Justice must have subpoena power for pattern or practice investigations into systemic misconduct by police departments and force these departments to reform. While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments that are violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police. The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms. The president\u2019s reelection campaign has repeatedly tried to directly tie Biden to the defund the police movement, in an effort to paint the Democratic candidate as a liberal radical, but Biden\u2019s opposition to the proposal has complicated that strategy. George Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify before the House judiciary committee this morning. Floyd will participate in a congressional hearing on police brutality, the first such hearing since George Floyd was killed after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Asked by a congressional reporter how he prepared for today\u2019s hearing, Floyd simply said, \u201cI\u2019m here for my brother. I\u2019m here to get justice for George.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has offered a defense of Trump\u2019s widely criticized tweet about a protester in Buffalo, New York, who was shoved to the ground by two police officers. McEnany said the president\u2019s tweet about Martin Gugino, which claimed without evidence that the protester was actually an Antifa plant, was just \u201craising questions based on a report he saw.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re questions that need to be asked,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThis individual had some questionable tweets, some profanity-laden tweets about police.\u201d She added, \u201cNo one condones any sort of violence.\u201d Republican senators dodged questions yesterday about the president\u2019s tweet, which was based on a thinly sourced report from the far-right One America News Network. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has called on Trump to apologize to Gugino, who remains hospitalized but in stable condition. \u201cHow reckless, how irresponsible, how mean, how crude,\u201d Cuomo said of the tweet. \u201cI mean, if there was ever a reprehensible, dumb comment \u2014 and from the president of the United States.\u201d This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was on Fox News this morning, discussing the president\u2019s thoughts on police reform in response to the killing of George Floyd. McEnany would not offer specifics on Trump\u2019s plans, only saying, \u201cThere has been tremendous work done on this and a lot of progress.\u201d Congressional Democrats unveiled their own police reform bill, which would nationally ban chokeholds and create a national police misconduct registry, earlier this week, but Trump is unlikely to support that. Tim Scott has also been tapped by Mitch McConnell to lead a working group of Senate Republicans on crafting their own police reform bill. Given how difficult it was to vote, it isn\u2019t a surprise that the Associated Press are saying that the Democratic Senate primary in Georgia still has no firm result yet - although Jon Ossoff has a strong lead. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund posted a few hours ago illustrating just how late into the night voting had to continue in the state. As it stands at the moment, Ossoff has approximately 49% of the counted vote. He leads Teresa Tomlinson and Sarah Riggs Amico who have around 15% and 13% respectively. Ossoff needs 50% to avoid a run-off. I mentioned earlier that last night a Christopher Columbus statue in Richmond, Virginia had been toppled and thrown into the lake in William Byrd Park. Another statue of Columbus was also vandalised overnight, this time on Boston\u2019s Atlantic Avenue in Massachusetts. The statue was beheaded. It had previously been spray-painted in 2015 with the #BlackLivesMatter slogan. And somebody has already updated its Wikipedia entry. Police are investigating the damage to the statue. Since nine members of Minneapolis city council have vowed to dismantle the city\u2019s police department there\u2019s been a lot of interest in the last couple of days in how Camden in New Jersey reformed its police department in 2013. My colleague Oliver Milman noted on Monday that the county had made a shift to community-based policing in 2013. Complaints over excessive police force in Camden have dropped 95% since 2014. Scottie Andrew at CNN has this morning published a look at what happened next after Camden made the move. Nyeema Watson, a resident, told him \u201cWe can\u2019t police our way out of social issues, unemployment, disproportionate health issues, economic challenges - these are things that drive crime\u201d But the situation on the ground in Camden seems much more positive. In part because of the way that new officers are inducted into the force. Local official Louis Cappelli says that on their first day, new officers have to go round the neighbourhood they will be patrolling knocking on doors and introducing themselves. You can read the report here - which includes an analysis of why it is an approach that might be much harder to roll out in a larger urban area like Minneapolis: CNN - This city disbanded its police department 7 years ago. Here\u2019s what happened next Georgia was one of five states holding primary elections yesterday, in the middle of the wave of #BlackLivesMatter protests and a coronavirus pandemic - and it did not go well. Bill Barrow of Associated Press has been reporting on the chaotic scenes - and the potential implications it has for later in the year: It raised the spectre of a worst-case November scenario: a decisive state, like Florida and its \u2018hanging chads\u2019 and \u2018butterfly ballots\u2019 in 2000, remaining in dispute long after polls close. Meanwhile, Trump, Biden and their supporters could offer competing claims of victory or question the election\u2019s legitimacy, inflaming an already boiling electorate. Barrow goes on to quote Rachana Desai Martin, a Biden campaign attorney, saying \u201cWe only have a few months left until voters around the nation head to the polls again, and efforts should begin immediately to ensure that every Georgian \u2014 and every American \u2014 is able to safely exercise their right to vote.\u201d The state is to have an investigation into what went wrong yesterday - with Fulton and DeKalb counties in particular experiencing difficulties. One of the keys to whether the death of George Floyd will make a long-lasting change to policing in the US will be getting at least some elements of the Republican party on board to get legislation passed - both at state and federal levels. There\u2019s an interesting piece from The Hill this morning looking at just whether that is going to happen. Yesterday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said: \u201cNone of us have had the experience of being an African American in this country and dealing with this discrimination, which persists here some 50 years after the 1964 civil rights bill and the 1965 civil rights bill. We\u2019re still wrestling with America\u2019s original sin. We try to get better but every now and then it\u2019s perfectly clear we\u2019re a long way from the finish line.\u201d But it is clear that a lot of Republicans think law enforcement should remain determined at a local level, and despite some words warming to the possibility, McConnell has not given any commitment to police reform legislation. Read it here: The Hill - Senate GOP shifts on police reform Keisha N Blain and Tom Zoellner have written for us today about how every time Black people challenge the established power structure they are characterized as criminals or radicals. They look back to how contemporaries wrote about the Haitian revolution and Sam Sharpe\u2019s revolt in Jamaica, as well as Donald Trump description of the recent protests as \u201crioting\u201d by an \u201cangry mob\u201d. These words are often used to delegitimize and dismiss Black movements \u2013 to make them appear too far removed from civil society to be taken seriously. While many politicians and pundits have attempted to dismiss the current uprisings as \u201criots\u201d \u2013 intimating that they are mere free-for-alls that lack purpose \u2013 that could not be further from the truth. Many of the uprisings that white Americans and Europeans have historically termed \u201criots\u201d were, in fact, concentrated efforts to overturn systems of oppression in the United States and across the globe. You can read the piece in full here: \u2018Riots\u2019, \u2018mobs\u2019, \u2018chaos\u2019: the establishment always frames change as dangerous The Rev Al Sharpton gave an emotional eulogy at George Floyd\u2019s funeral yesterday - and in it he echoed some of the same sentiment that Barack Obama expressed last week, that the current wave of protests feels more multi-ethnic than any previous civil rights protests in the US. As Sharpton put it: \u201cAll over the world I\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave master statues\u201d. It is well worth watching. If you missed it last night, Philadelphia\u2019s street protested involved painting the names of victims of police brutality and racism in the road, alongside the message \u201cend racism now\u201d. It was organised by John T. Brice, pastor of St. James United Methodist Church. One of those joining in was Capt. William Fisher of the 26th District of the Philadelphia police. People prayed and \u201ctook the knee\u201d after the painting was complete. Statues around the world are coming down, with protesters in Bristol, England throwing one slaver statue into the dock, and Belgium removing a vandalised statue of colonial King Leopold II in Antwerp. Last night a statue of Christopher Columbus was pulled down in Richmond\u2019s Byrd Park, Virginia. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the statue dates from 1927, and was the first figure of Columbus to be erected in the south of the US. Activist Chelsea Higgs Wise tweeted from the protest that \u201cKKKolumbus is down\u201d, and a sign saying \u201cRacism you will not be missed\u201d was placed by the edge of the lake where the statue was thrown. Virginia\u2019s governor has pledged to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from Richmond, but this has been temporarily halted by a judge. The burial of George Floyd on Tuesday may have given his family some closure, but the wave of protests sparked by his killing at the hands of the police will continue today. At 10am, the House Judiciary Committee will be holding an oversight hearing on policing practices and law enforcement accountability. Philonise Floyd, George Floyd\u2019s brother, is among the witnesses called. Controversy continues over the handling by the NYPD of the people arrested in protests in New York. In other US politics expected today, Joe Biden will attend a Biden finance event and then attend a virtual NAACP town hall on systemic racism. He spoke at George Floyd\u2019s memorial yesterday, saying \u201cNow is the time for racial justice.\u201d The White House diary has the president\u2019s intelligence briefing in the morning, and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will be holding a briefing at 2pm. Maybe there will be some further questions about why Donald Trump made his baseless claim that a 75-year-old pushed over by the police might be an \u201can antifa provocateur\u201d. We can also expect further reaction to the cancellations of shows and the pulling of films from streaming services as companies re-examine them in the light of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign.

      "body": "<p>For Americans, coronavirus went from being a mysterious affliction that occurred in far-off lands to 1m confirmed cases on US soil within 14 weeks. Now, just six weeks later, the US has broken through the grim milestone of 2m positive tests for Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</p> <p>The anguish of life lost, of a severely wounded economy and wrenching political turmoil have taken a harrowing toll upon a fatigued American public. But further, perhaps far greater pain is yet to come, pandemic experts have warned, even as authorities wave people back into reopened shops and offices and the US president\u2019s political rhetoric on an epochal crisis dwindles away to near silence.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has just looked at the first 100 yards of this marathon,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone has just looked at the first 100 yards of this marathon</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Osterholm</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Osterholm said a society usually becomes resilient to a virus once at least 60% of the population has been infected, either naturally or via a vaccine, and develops antibodies. This is still a far-off point for the US, with no firm guarantee a working vaccine will ever be developed.</p> <p>\u201cAt most, perhaps 5% of people have been infected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all that pain, suffering and economic destruction got us to 5%, what will it take to get us to 60%? That\u2019s a sobering thought. All of that suffering and death is just getting started. People haven\u2019t quite got that yet.\u201d</p> <p>The true figure of infection in the US is almost certainly \u201cmultiples more\u201d than the 2m confirmed cases, said Irwin Redlener, the director&nbsp;of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, but is obscured by the lack of testing.</p> <p>Problems in developing and rolling out an effective test dogged the initial US response to the pandemic and although testing has now ramped up, only about 6% of the population has received one.</p> <p>People with Covid-19 most likely experience either no noticeable symptoms or only minor symptoms such as a dry cough and mild fever.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very much seeing only the proverbial tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Redlener. \u201cWe are hampered by the lack of sufficient testing, especially as businesses are reopening across all 50 states.\u201d</p> <p>Deficiencies in the stockpile of testing kits, swabs, ventilators and protective equipment for medical staff marked the opening stanza of the pandemic in the US.

      "bodyText": "For Americans, coronavirus went from being a mysterious affliction that occurred in far-off lands to 1m confirmed cases on US soil within 14 weeks. Now, just six weeks later, the US has broken through the grim milestone of 2m positive tests for Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The anguish of life lost, of a severely wounded economy and wrenching political turmoil have taken a harrowing toll upon a fatigued American public. But further, perhaps far greater pain is yet to come, pandemic experts have warned, even as authorities wave people back into reopened shops and offices and the US president\u2019s political rhetoric on an epochal crisis dwindles away to near silence. \u201cEveryone has just looked at the first 100 yards of this marathon,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm said a society usually becomes resilient to a virus once at least 60% of the population has been infected, either naturally or via a vaccine, and develops antibodies. This is still a far-off point for the US, with no firm guarantee a working vaccine will ever be developed. \u201cAt most, perhaps 5% of people have been infected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all that pain, suffering and economic destruction got us to 5%, what will it take to get us to 60%? That\u2019s a sobering thought. All of that suffering and death is just getting started. People haven\u2019t quite got that yet.\u201d The true figure of infection in the US is almost certainly \u201cmultiples more\u201d than the 2m confirmed cases, said Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, but is obscured by the lack of testing. Problems in developing and rolling out an effective test dogged the initial US response to the pandemic and although testing has now ramped up, only about 6% of the population has received one. People with Covid-19 most likely experience either no noticeable symptoms or only minor symptoms such as a dry cough and mild fever. \u201cWe are very much seeing only the proverbial tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Redlener. \u201cWe are hampered by the lack of sufficient testing, especially as businesses are reopening across all 50 states.\u201d Deficiencies in the stockpile of testing kits, swabs, ventilators and protective equipment for medical staff marked the opening stanza of the pandemic in the US. It was a muddled and sometimes astonishing response embodied by Donald Trump, who predicted the virus would vanish in the April sunshine, squabbled with state governors and pondered the merits of injecting bleach or taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven anti-malarial drug. \u201cFrom the beginning there have been misrepresentations and fabrications from the White House,\u201d said Redlener. \u201cWhatever the opposite of \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 is, that\u2019s what this is. It\u2019s essentially been an American fiasco.\u201d Yet even as the US has surged past 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, about a quarter of the entire global total, the crisis has faded from the political agenda. Trump, preoccupied with sending in the military to crush roiling anti-racism protests over the death of George Floyd, has stopped daily press conferences on the pandemic. Reopenings have been left down to the states, conducted in a somewhat haphazard way with at least a dozen states still experiencing rising rates of infections. Dr Anthony Fauci, the administration\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has admitted not seeing the president in weeks despite the ongoing public health crisis. \u201cWhere is it going to end? We\u2019re still at the beginning of it,\u201d Fauci said this week. A disconcerting element of the crisis for epidemiologists is that so much about Covid-19 is still unknown. The World Health Organization had to clarify it still doesn\u2019t know how often asymptomatic people pass on the virus, after previously saying it was very rare.

They\u2019re the words people say in private \u2013 or don\u2019t say \u2013 when they\u2019re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Over the past few days I\u2019ve wondered, why&nbsp;now? Why,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>after all we\u2019ve known about police brutality against black people,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there\u2019s not a lot else for young people to do.&nbsp;The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions<strong> </strong>that stop people from turning out have gone.&nbsp;It\u2019s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,&nbsp;for most white people there\u2019s always been a get-out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that [those words again] \u2026 he was maybe being too aggressive \u2026 maybe the officers thought they were under threat \u2026 it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\u201d It\u2019s allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he\u2019d face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd\u2019s rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.</p> <p>No white person&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Though &nbsp;many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they\u2019re starting to notice.&nbsp;This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?<br></p> <p>Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But&nbsp;what a glorious moment. It\u2019s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>When I saw&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement swept across the US in 2014.&nbsp;Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we\u2019re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won\u2019t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That\u2019s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won\u2019t be just by rooting out \u201cbad apples\u201d: a system that allows them&nbsp;in unchecked&nbsp;in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won\u2019t simply be by giving all officers \u201cdiversity training\u201d: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they\u2019re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day&nbsp;of&nbsp;the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,&nbsp;the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,&nbsp;was giving evidence to the London assembly.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 double the rate for white people.</p> <p>This, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It\u2019s just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police.&nbsp;And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \u201cWe\u2019ve said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\u201d<br><br>So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,&nbsp;that affect&nbsp;thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067\">Barack Obama&nbsp;has&nbsp;set out an intelligent long-term plan</a> \u2013 \u201cHow to make this moment the turning point for real change\u201d \u2013 which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK we have to be equally thoughtful \u2013 so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias.

His comments will intensify pressure further on Boris Johnson and his team to explain why they waited to introduce tougher restrictions. Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-20000-lives-boris-johnson-neil-ferguson\">told the Commons science committee</a>: \u201cHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier we\u2019d have reduced the final death toll by at least half.\u201d He said tougher restrictions were warranted \u201cgiven what we knew about the virus then\u201d and could have meant \u201cmany fewer deaths\u201d. The PM later declined to express regret over not acting sooner, saying the data was not yet available to make a full assessment. \u201cFrankly, I think a lot of these questions are premature,\u201d Johnson insisted.</p> \n<p>Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, struck a sombre tone at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, indicating that any changes to government policy must take place slowly and might need to be reversed. However, he did offer a hint that the two-metre advice for social distancing could be relaxed:&nbsp;\u201cIt is not a scientific rule \u2013 it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces \u2026 It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two&nbsp;metres or nothing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The mayors of London, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool have warned local authorities could go bust due to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/11/covid-19-crisis-means-englands-local-authorities-could-go-bust-warn-mayors\">economic fallout from Covid-19,</a> and have called on the government to take immediate action. Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, said support was needed now to stop the \u201c2020s being as bad as the 1980s\u201d.</p> \n<p>Businesses have dramatically scaled back investment plans for the rest of the year in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/uk-firms-say-dramatically-scaled-back-investment-plans-covid-19\">uncertainty surrounding&nbsp;the future of the UK economy</a>, according to a leading business survey.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018We\u2019d have reduced the final death toll by at least half\u2019 Hello and welcome to this Thursday briefing, with me, Alison Rourke. The UK could have saved 20,000 lives if it introduced the lockdown a week earlier, according to damning testimony from Prof Neil Ferguson, who was one of the government\u2019s key advisers in the early stages of the pandemic. His comments will intensify pressure further on Boris Johnson and his team to explain why they waited to introduce tougher restrictions. Ferguson told the Commons science committee: \u201cHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier we\u2019d have reduced the final death toll by at least half.\u201d He said tougher restrictions were warranted \u201cgiven what we knew about the virus then\u201d and could have meant \u201cmany fewer deaths\u201d. The PM later declined to express regret over not acting sooner, saying the data was not yet available to make a full assessment. \u201cFrankly, I think a lot of these questions are premature,\u201d Johnson insisted. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, struck a sombre tone at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, indicating that any changes to government policy must take place slowly and might need to be reversed. However, he did offer a hint that the two-metre advice for social distancing could be relaxed: \u201cIt is not a scientific rule \u2013 it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces \u2026 It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing.\u201d The mayors of London, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool have warned local authorities could go bust due to the economic fallout from Covid-19, and have called on the government to take immediate action. Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, said support was needed now to stop the \u201c2020s being as bad as the 1980s\u201d. Businesses have dramatically scaled back investment plans for the rest of the year in response to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK economy, according to a leading business survey. The Institute of Directors said its confidence tracker revealed the Covid-19 crisis had driven down investment intentions among its members for the next 12 months by 11 percentage points to a record low of -43%. About 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England, the PM revealed. The guidelines will apply from midnight on Saturday, meaning some grandparents will be able to hug their grandchildren for the first time and some couples can be reunited. The coronavirus pandemic will hit Coronation Street on 24 July when newly filmed episodes featuring the crisis (recorded under strict restrictions) go on air. Filming resumed on Monday under physical distancing measures, including no kissing and actors over the age of 70 barred, appearing in storylines via Zoom calls. Stay on top of coronavirus developments at our global live blog, including the US passing 2 million infections, Latin America deaths passing 70,000 and Mexico recording its biggest daily rise in cases. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * JK Rowling: \u2018a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor\u2019 \u2013 The author revealed her experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault for the first time, in a lengthy and highly personal essay written in response to criticism of her public comments on transgender issues. She said she was \u201ca domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor\u201d, citing this alongside her belief in freedom of speech and experience as a teacher as reasons behind her position. \u201cI\u2019m mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who\u2019ve been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces,\u201d she wrote. * * * \u2018Make it stop\u2019 \u2013 George Floyd\u2019s brother has called on Congress to act over police violence. In an impassioned plea hours after his brother was laid to rest in Houston, Philonise Floyd told a House hearing in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of the pain I\u2019m feeling now, and I\u2019m tired of the pain I feel every time another Black person is killed for no reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask you to make it stop.\u201d Donald Trump meanwhile said he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming US military bases that are named after Confederate military leaders and announced he would hold his first election rally of the pandemic next Friday, in Tulsa, Oklahoma \u2013 a city with a history of deadly racial violence. * * * Churchill statue clashes concern \u2013 Busloads of far-right demonstrators are feared to be planning to travel hundreds of miles to \u201cdefend\u201d memorials at the weekend, campaigners have said. There are concerns that hundreds are mobilising to attend a \u201cpatriotic unity\u201d event at Winston Churchill\u2019s statue in Westminster on Saturday morning, in response to the Black Lives Matter protests. The far-right activist Tommy Robinson and political group Britain First are among those supporting a \u201cdefend our memorials\u201d event, which is being publicised with pictures of \u201cChurchill is a racist\u201d graffiti that was daubed on the statue last Sunday. Last weekend\u2019s dumping of Edward Colston\u2019s statue into Bristol Harbour was a win for the multiracial, radical city \u2013 and the whole of the UK \u2013 writes David Olusoga. But, he says, now Britain must face up to its shameful role in the slave trade. * * * \u2018Sincerely sorry\u2019 \u2013 TV duo Ant and Dec have apologised for a segment of Saturday Night Takeaway in which they impersonated people of other ethnicities using blackface and said they would not make such sketches today. The presenters darkened their skin and wore prosthetics during a segment in which they pranked famous faces while in disguise. In a statement released on social media, the pair said: \u201cWe realise that this was wrong and want to say that we are sincerely sorry to everyone that we offended.\u201d They said they had requested ITV, which broadcasts the show, to remove the offending sketches from 2003 and 2004 from its streaming catch-up service. Coronavirus extra In March the PM proclaimed he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d Britain could \u201cturn the tide\u201d on Covid-19 in 12 weeks. Today that time is up, and the Guardian\u2019s Robert Booth, Heather Stewart and Richard Partington ask, with concerns over testing and tracing, a battered economy, and one of the highest excess death rates in the world \u2013 was he right? Meanwhile, Marmite supplies have been hit by the Covid-19 beer brewing slowdown. In a tweet, the company said: \u201cDue to brewers yeast being in short supply (one of the main ingredients in Marmite) Supplies of Marmite have been affected.\u201d As a temporary measure the company has stopped producing all sizes apart from its 250g jar. Today in Focus podcast: Britain\u2019s reckoning with its racist past UK Black Lives Matter protests have been taking place across the country. They have not just been about solidarity with the US or the systemic racism in Britain today, but also about the need to address Britain\u2019s past and the impact that legacy still has today. Lunchtime read: Dreams of Italy With international travel almost entirely on hold, Guardian readers have been sharing their fondest memories of Italy, including a perfect Tuscan hill town (Lucignano), trekking in the Dolomites, and la dolce vita in Calabria. Sport Premier League clubs should be braced for a collective \u00a3500m loss of revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic, Deloitte has warned. Rory McIlroy hopes golf can play its part in delivering a more multicultural society as it returns to tournament action days after the funeral of George Floyd. West Indies captain Jason Holder has said he would first discuss with his team whether they would make a protest on their tour of England. Nikita Parris has apologised to Eni Aluko for the moment in September 2017 when she led her team-mates in a controversial race to embrace the former England women\u2019s manager Mark Sampson. Nascar has banned the Confederate flag from its races and properties, while US Soccer\u2019s board of directors has voted to repeal a 2017 policy that required national team players to stand during the national anthem. Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, Britain\u2019s world heavyweight champions, are \u201cmaking great progress\u201d towards signing for a two-fight unification deal, according to Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn. Lewis Hamilton successfully returned to driving after completing a test at Silverstone on Wednesday, with the British driver saying it had been \u201cjust great to get back in the car\u201d. And organisers of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have again come under fire after an Amnesty International investigation found that around 100 migrant workers at one of the tournament\u2019s \u201ccrown jewel\u201d stadiums had not been paid for up to seven months. Business Ocado plans to raise more than \u00a31bn from investors as the grocery delivery company looks to cash in on the boom in online deliveries sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. The company said it aims to raise \u00a3657m in an equity share placing with institutional and retail investors, as well as borrowing \u00a3350m via a convertible bond issue. Meanwhile, Morrisons chief executive David Potts tells the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler that his company has positioned itself well for this new world via alliances with Amazon and Ocado to access the fast-growing online market. And in housing news, the market remains depressed despite a pick-up in inquiries from people looking to buy, but estate agents are expecting a sharp increase in demand for homes with gardens over the next two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pound is buying \u20ac1.117 and $1.266.

But the financial future of the game remains uncertain and in the apparent absence of a lucrative deal, private equity has emerged as the last great hope for rugby to remain a major sport in Australia. Significantly, the value of the interim broadcast deal has not been officially released, although it will eventually leak out. It is almost certain it is not anywhere near the $57m a year RA had been receiving under the previous agreement. There is speculation Fox Sports initially wanted RA to pay for the broadcast of the domestic Super Rugby competition themselves, but then relented and offered a much reduced deal, which RA had no choice but to accept. It is understood RA has assured the Super Rugby clubs they will be economically viable for the rest of this year, but what about next year and the year after that? Whatever deal has been done to enable the game to survive 2020 and the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, it is only the entr\u00e9e before the main course, which is the next broadcast deal from 2021 to 2025. Fox Sports may offer RA a long-term but very low deal, emphasising the new harsh reality that the days of sports over-reliance on blockbuster TV deals are over. Fox Sports indicated some time ago they would focus primarily on the two major football competitions in Australia \u2013 the AFL and the NRL \u2013 and that seems to be the way it is unfolding. Relations between Fox Sports and RA became strained when former RA chief executive Raelene Castle took broadcast rights to the open market earlier in the year. It is understood there is no longer any ill feeling between the parties, but the money that has sustained professional rugby in Australia for the last 25 years is just no longer there, with Fox Sports struggling financially themselves. In this scary scenario, RA will desperately need to secure private equity to make up the shortfall and maintain rugby\u2019s place as a major sport in Australia. Unlike overseas sport, Australian sport in general and rugby in particular does not have a particularly long and deep involvement with private equity or private ownership. Several years ago RA, which has always closely guarded its control of the game, opened the Super Rugby franchises to private equity investment, but there were few, or no, takers. When the Melbourne Rebels were established in 2011 they were meant to create a new model of private ownership of Super Rugby franchises, but the team\u2019s two owners, firstly Harold Mitchell and then Andrew Cox did not last long. The financial problems at the Rebels contributed largely to RA\u2019s economic woes and led indirectly to the axing of the Force in 2017 when RA could no longer be the lender of last resort when teams got into trouble. Ironically, the only Australian team with significant private backing is the Force, who are supported by mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest. It is believed Raelene Castle was about to meet with major private equity investor CVC, which has significant investments in European rugby, just before the coronavirus pandemic hit. That was the end of that exercise. Now, American private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) is reportedly in preliminary discussions with RA \u201cin collaboration\u201d with the Rebels about making an investment in the game worth hundreds of millions of dollars. KKR are certainly a major player in the private equity field and would have the funds to invest in Australian rugby, assuming they were genuinely interested. It is unlikely KKR, or anyone else, would be interested in buying an individual Super Rugby club, which would be seen as a potentially bad bet, but rather buy the commercial rights to a competition such as CVC\u2019s investment in the Six Nations and other European competitions. Whatever deal RA \u2013 or even Sanzaar \u2013 can strike with private equity, it needs to be done in a hurry, but it may already be too late. RA\u2019s deal with RUPA for players to take, on average, a 60% pay cut because of the coronavirus pandemic ends at the end of September. RA is currently in discussions with RUPA to amend this deal, which is expected to result in a 10% pay increase, following the signing of the interim broadcast deal and the resumption of play. But players will demand a lot more than that come the end of September. If RA cannot convince Australia\u2019s leading players it will be able to generate sufficient income to restore something close to their previous multi-million dollar salaries, it risks a mass exodus overseas. Without an injection of significant capital from private equity, Australian rugby will revert to relying on dwindling broadcast monies and sponsorship for revenue to keep the best players at home. The next three months is not just about a resumption of play for Australia\u2019s Super Rugby teams, but ensuring rugby remains a major sport in this country.",

      "body": "<p>Over the weekend, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/07/uk-coronavirus-live-matt-hancock-health-chiefs-debate-lockdown-easing-covid-19-latest-updates\">no new deaths</a> from coronavirus in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Slowly, the number of hospitalisations and deaths is falling across the UK. Rather than celebrating these early signs that the worst of the pandemic could be behind us, however,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/05/uk-experts-call-for-coronavirus-inquiry-to-prevent-deadly-second-wave\">some scientists are warning</a>&nbsp;of a second wave of infections \u2013 an increase in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks or months, which could occur even after a sustained fall&nbsp;in the number of cases.&nbsp;</p> <p>These warnings often refer back to the 1918 flu pandemic. That outbreak killed tens of millions of people&nbsp;when it returned the following winter <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/spanish-flu-second-wave-resurgence\">in a deadlier form</a>&nbsp;after the first outbreak had been controlled.&nbsp;But there\u2019s a confusing lack of consensus from scientists about whether we\u2019ll see a second wave of coronavirus cases.&nbsp;Although the future is uncertain, we can imagine four scenarios for what might come next.&nbsp;</p> <p>One&nbsp;hypothesis, <a href=\"https://elemental.medium.com/could-the-coronavirus-be-weakening-as-it-spreads-928f2ad33f89\">floated by doctors in Italy</a>, is that coronavirus could grow weaker as it spreads.

      "bodyText": "Over the weekend, there were no new deaths from coronavirus in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Slowly, the number of hospitalisations and deaths is falling across the UK. Rather than celebrating these early signs that the worst of the pandemic could be behind us, however, some scientists are warning of a second wave of infections \u2013 an increase in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks or months, which could occur even after a sustained fall in the number of cases. These warnings often refer back to the 1918 flu pandemic. That outbreak killed tens of millions of people when it returned the following winter in a deadlier form after the first outbreak had been controlled. But there\u2019s a confusing lack of consensus from scientists about whether we\u2019ll see a second wave of coronavirus cases. Although the future is uncertain, we can imagine four scenarios for what might come next. One hypothesis, floated by doctors in Italy, is that coronavirus could grow weaker as it spreads. Through viral mutation, Sars-Cov-2 could lose its potency and become milder or less infectious. But coronaviruses have proven a remarkably stable type of virus. There is no evidence to support this kind of mutation occurring in a matter of years, let alone weeks. Rather than viral mutations, improvements in survival rates in Italy are probably related to better clinical management of Covid-19, as doctors learn how to treat patients in hospital more effectively. Another view is that the number of people susceptible to this virus is smaller than estimated, either because a large section of the population has already been exposed to it, or because they\u2019ve developed cross-immunity from other similar viruses. This scenario also seems unlikely. Early serology tests estimated that only 17% of Londoners and 5% of the UK population had been exposed to the virus in late May. This means that there is still a large percentage of the population who have not yet had the chance to build immunity, a picture that corresponds with serology studies from France, Spain and Sweden, which had similar results. But the picture might be more complex. A recent study reported that individuals who had never been exposed to Sars-Cov-2 still had T-cells reacting to the virus, another key component of the body\u2019s immune response. The authors of the study suggested that having previous exposure to common cold coronaviruses could mean the body is able to detect the proteins in the Sars-Cov-2 virus. While this finding could be promising, there is still no evidence that either antibodies or T-cell reactivity would result in someone developing immunity to Sars-Cov-2. A third approach, which has been deliberately adopted in Sweden, is to let the virus run its course and spread through the population. This treats Covid-19 much like the influenza virus; until a vaccine becomes available or enough of the population is exposed that herd immunity develops, the virus will be unstoppable. But the cost of allowing the virus to spread through the population until it develops herd immunity is that many people will become ill or die as a result of catching Covid-19. And with no confirmation on how long immunity would even last, this approach offers no certainty about whether people could become reinfected after a couple of months or years \u2013 leading to a second wave of infections. My own view is that we can avoid a second wave if governments aggressively contain the virus through testing, tracing and isolating carriers, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as hand-washing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it\u2019s needed. The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination. Think of this as a series of constantly emerging small fires that need to be extinguished quickly before they turn into an uncontrollable blaze. South Korea and Germany have effectively run with this approach, rolling out mass testing and tracing strategies, isolating carriers of the virus and implementing monitoring systems to map its spread. But the focus on deaths from a second wave may miss the real toll of the virus: the long-term damage it can cause to the lungs, heart, kidneys, brain and even blood vessels among those who recover. This is emerging as one of the horrors of Covid-19. It is often forgotten that Covid-19 is a new virus, completely different to the flu, and that it might have longer-term health impacts that will only be identified in months or years. If coronavirus is our generation\u2019s polio, we might look towards the approach taken by governments in the Pacific. New Zealand has eliminated coronavirus, and Australia is inching closer to this goal. With border checks in place, people living in these countries can return to normal life. Sports matches are taking place in New Zealand, schools have reopened, weddings are being booked and people can safely see relatives.

Wayne Daniel is running in to bowl and Botham backs away to prod the pitch and ask me, \u201cWho are you backing in this one?\u201d I told him, politely, to get on with it and he smacks the \ufb01rst one for six and blocks the next one, just to ramp up the theatre! He then dispatched the \ufb01nal ball for six. As he ran off he patted me on the backside with his bat and said, \u201cYou stick with me pal, I\u2019ll make you famous.\u201d\u2019 2. \u2018It reminded me I should not go quietly\u2019: readers\u2019 favourite UK No 1s \u2018Some churches banned Imagine because it says \u201cno religion\u201d. I think you need to ask why it was being sung in churches in the first place. It\u2019s because it\u2019s more than a pop song \u2013 it\u2019s a contemporary hymn, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 3. Donald Trump\u2019s Tory cheerleaders have brought lasting shame on Britain \u2018None outdid Michael Gove, comparing Trump to George Washington. The first president had also been misunderstood by Britain, Gove wrote in an unctuous interview with the 45th. He cast Trump as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who did not merit the \u201cscorn and condescension\u201d of his UK critics. To compensate for his countrymen\u2019s discourtesy, Gove posed with his subject, grinning and giving the thumbs-up.\u2019 4. JK Rowling says she is survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault \u2018In a 3,600-word statement published on her website on Wednesday, Rowling described in more detail than ever how she became involved in an increasingly bitter and polarised debate around the concept of gender identity.\u2019 5. Miss Aluminium by Susanna Moore review \u2013 Hollywood gossip and trauma \u2018The book bursts with brilliantly gossipy titbits, recounted with wry understatement, from James Stewart\u2019s use of a toupee to the story spread by the mistress of Alfred Bloomingdale \u2013 he of the department store \u2013 that he \u201cliked to sit ina custom-made high chair in baby clothes and a bib while she threw cold pablum [baby porridge] at him\u201d.\u2019 6. Rapper Wretch 32 shares video of police shooting his father with a stun gun \u2018The rapper Wretch 32 has shared a video of his 62-year-old father being shot by police with a stun gun at his home in north London. The footage shows Millard Scott tumbling downstairs after an officer is heard to warn: \u201cPolice officer with a Taser. Stay where you are.\u201d\u2019 7. Has Ivanka Trump finally been cancelled? \u2018I hate to break it to Ivanka, but not giving a commencement speech does not mean you are a victim of \u201ccancel culture\u201d. Indeed, it is remarkable that, despite standing by her father during endless atrocities, she has not been definitively cancelled by her circle of \u201cliberal\u201d high-society friends.\u2019 8. Former INLA prisoner Malachy McAllister to be deported from US \u2018McAllister served seven years in prison in Northern Ireland for attacks on police during the 1981 hunger strikes. After loyalists attacked his home in Belfast in 1988 he moved to the US. He set up a construction business in New Jersey, supported the peace process and became prominent in Irish American circles. 9. My dad was in prison throughout my childhood. I navigated a white world alone \u2018As a biracial person \u2013 half black, half white \u2013 growing up in a mostly white city, I experienced a lot of passive racism in school. Not that I knew it at the time. At home, I never had my dad to turn to in these moments. My white mother never talked to me or my siblings about race, and that probably comes from the fact that her parents never talked to her about race. They didn\u2019t feel they had to. They are all white.\u2019 10. After Colston, figures such as Drake and Peel could be next \u2018With petitions and social media campaigns proliferating, activists put together a website, Topple the Racists, compiling more than 60 of the proposed removals. They range from acknowledged slave traders such as Elihu Yale to more controversial inclusions such as Robert Peel, viewed as the founder of modern policing in Britain.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

West Papua is a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum. An existing movement agitating for independence from Dutch rule has refocused its energies on the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region. At the far east of Indonesia, West Papua remains physically and ideologically separate from the rest of the country. Indigenous Papuans make up about half of the population. Locals claim racism is rife among the police and the military, and there have been allegations of human rights abuses and exploitation against the local population. In August 2019, protests erupted in the region over alleged police abuse against ethnic Papuan students. It was the biggest protest since 1998. A spokesman for the military declined to comment on allegations of racism and abuse by his troops. Papua police spokesman Ahmad Mustofa Kamal says \u201cthere is no racism\u201d in his force. Rico Tude, speaking for the Indonesian People\u2019s Front for West Papua (FRI-WP), says the Black Lives Matter movement \u201cgives a new understanding to the Indonesian public to be more concerned to address racism against West Papuans\u201d. Elvira Rumbaku, a lecturer at Cenderawasih University, agreed, adding that social media had played an essential role in bringing the issue to the fore. \u201cIt prompted Indonesians outside West Papua to understand how racist the Indonesian government is. West Papuans are always stigmatised as separatist and committed to violence; therefore, they always used security approaches and sent more troops,\u201d she says. Rumbaku is optimistic that more Indonesians will recognise the issue. \u201cHopefully this is not just a moment, but we can keep it on,\u201d she adds. Students at the University of Indonesia are using the attention to demand justice for Cenderawasih student executive board member Ferry Gombo, who was arrested by the Indonesian government after organising a rally against racist abuse towards Papuan students in Surabaya in August last year. Gombo, one of four students being detained in Balikpapan prison, is facing a 10-year sentence if found guilty. Despite the outpouring of support for West Papuans, protesters still face a backlash. Another student board member at the University of Indonesia, Fajar Adi Nugroho, received anonymous threats on Saturday after organising an online debate on police violence.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump will hold a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday \u2013 his first since since states began shutting down in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 110,000 lives in the US. The 19 June rally will likely rattle some public health experts, as coronavirus infections rise in about a dozen states. On Wednesday, the US approached nearly 2 million confirmed cases. Trump\u2019s signature rallies often draw tens of thousands of people, but they have been on hiatus since 2 March because of the coronavirus. The president\u2019s campaign has been eager to resume them as it tries to move past the pandemic, even as cases continue to rise in some parts of the country. A Trump campaign spokesperson tweeted a movie-trailer style video earlier Wednesday that advertised: \u201cThis month we\u2019re back.\u201d \u201cA beautiful new venue, brand new. We\u2019re looking forward to it,\u201d Trump said during a White House event. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a great job with Covid, as you know, the state of Oklahoma.\u201d The announcement, which comes amid sweeping protests against racism and police brutality in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, also raised eyebrows for its date \u2013 a day known as Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery \u2013 as well as its location in Tulsa, a city with a troubling history of racial violence. Tulsa\u2019s 1921 race massacre saw the destruction of black businesses and residences at the hands of angry, white mobs, and is considered one of the worst single incidents of racial violence in American history. Trump\u2019s announcement comes as the president has criticized the Floyd protests and referred to those demonstrating against police brutality as \u201cthugs\u201d. Oklahoma, a reliably Republican state which Trump won in 2016, was among the earliest states to begin loosening coronavirus restrictions, with salons, spas and barber shops reopening in late April. The Republican governor Kevin Stitt\u2019s most recent reopening phase places no limits on group gathering sizes as of 1 June, and leaves the decision about how closely to adhere to social distancing guidelines up to business owners and local officials. According to Johns Hopkins data, the overall death toll in Oklahoma stands at 356. The president said he would first hold a rally in Oklahoma before moving on to other states like Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, where the Republican national convention was originally supposed to be held. Coronavirus hospitalizations are currently on the rise in Arizona and North Carolina, which could intensify public health concerns about resuming the campaign rallies. While the rallies will likely spark public health concerns, some of the president\u2019s allies have argued the recent protests, which have attracted thousands of people, could shield the rallies from potential criticism. Some on Twitter compared Trump\u2019s decision to hold the rally in Tulsa on Juneteenth to Ronald Reagan\u2019s choice to launch his 1980 campaign with a speech lauding \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d near the site of the notorious \u201cMississippi burning\u201d murder of civil rights workers. In 1964, three civil rights workers were abducted and killed by the Ku Klux Klan, just south-west of Philadelphia, Mississippi, and surreptitiously buried in a dam. Reagan delivered a campaign speech within walking distance of the dam, proclaiming \u201cI believe in state\u2019s rights.\u201d His language echoed that of white Southerners who used the phrase to justify segregation. It remained unclear if the campaign\u2019s choice to hold the rally on Juneteenth was intentional. The Trump campaign appeared aware of the significance of the president holding the rally on Juneteenth. Responding to a Bloomberg reporter, a Trump campaign adviser wrote that \u201cRepublicans are proud of the history of Juneteenth\u201d. The president has acknowledged the date before. In 2017, Trump released a statement, saying: \u201cMelania and I send our warmest greetings to all those celebrating Juneteenth, a historic day recognizing the end of slavery.\u201d That year, Trump also delivered a rambling speech during Black History month, calling the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass \u201can example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Coalition MPs have called for more taxpayer support for hard-hit industries including tourism but are split about whether to continue the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September or replace it with new programs. On Thursday, the release of Treasury data on the areas most reliant on jobkeeper prompted Liberal MP Warren Entsch to call for the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy to be extended. But Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey told Guardian Australia that while jobkeeper was \u201cright for March, [it] may not be right for September\u201d because \u201cin some cases it is paying people to do nothing\u201d. The Treasury data shows the five areas most reliant on jobkeeper are the Sydney CBD, Melbourne CBD, Liverpool in Sydney\u2019s south-west, Hoppers Crossing in Melbourne\u2019s west, and Cairns. Entsch, the member for Leichhardt which covers Cairns, told reporters in Canberra there was a \u201cvery strong argument and the figures that were released today just shows you how important it is that we continue to have this support within our community\u201d. Entsch said international tourism was \u201cone of the first [sectors] to fall off the cliff\u201d and would be one of the last to recover. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure March next year will be sufficient time [for it to recover], but I think it\u2019s a no-brainer we have to do this extension.\u201d Entsch said he was \u201cconfident\u201d further support would be extended to the tourism sector, citing consultation with the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Entsch told the Guardian that support for other sectors should be decided on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d depending on a Treasury review that would show \u201cif businesses have recovered, or if they\u2019re so called zombie businesses that will only survive if the payment keeps going\u201d. Ramsey, who represents Grey, an electorate with a loss of 8.6% of jobs, according to the Grattan Institute, said it was \u201cpretty apparent that regional electorates are more affected than urban ones\u201d during the coronavirus crisis. Ramsey said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to make decisions about whether to extend jobkeeper beyond September because \u201cso much of what we do for tomorrow is decided by what happens today\u201d in terms of improved health and economic results. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable whether jobkeeper is the answer. Jobkeeper is a great program, it was the right thing at the right time but in some cases it is paying people to do nothing \u2013 quite a lot of cases, actually.\u201d Ramsey said the government\u2019s $25,000 homebuilder building subsidy \u201cis paying people to do something\u201d and leveraging private investment. \u201cPaying someone to work is far better for their mental health and the health of the economy than paying people not to work. \u201cCome September, we might think that there are far better programs. What was right for March [jobkeeper] may not be right for September.\u201d On Thursday morning, Morrison reiterated that he had \u201calready said\u201d that jobkeeper will remain until September, despite a treasury review in June and the decision to remove the payment from the childcare sector. Morrison told 2GB Radio the review \u201cis about how you\u2019re implementing the program ... and that\u2019s a lot of administrative issues\u201d. Frydenberg has ruled out wholesale changes to the program but left the door open to \u201cfurther support\u201d to the hardest hit industries, such as tourism. However, the government could trim back the scheme by lowering payments for workers who ordinarily earn less than $1,500 a fortnight, and require businesses to show they had the necessary revenue downturn each and every month to qualify. Ramsey said there was \u201cnot much point\u201d having the review if the process was \u201cincapable of making changes\u201d. \u201cIf an industry or business is fully recovered \u2026 there is an argument about whether to keep putting public dollars into it.\u201d Liberal MP Llew O\u2019Brien said he would be \u201cclosely monitoring my electorate\u2019s progress through and out the other side of the Covid crisis\u201d before deciding whether to call for jobkeeper to be extended. O\u2019Brien said he believed some sectors, including the $1.5bn tourism industry in Noosa, would require more \u201ctailored assistance\u201d. \u201cIf my [job] numbers are showing we need further help for jobkeepers and jobseekers, I\u2019ll be pushing to extend them past September.\u201d Liberal MP Andrew Wallace said \u201cas a matter of principle\u201d he did not support extending jobkeeper beyond September because \u201cwe can\u2019t keep putting that level of stimulus out\u201d, citing its $70bn price tag.

On Thursday the Australian Institute of Company Directors released a survey of 2,371 of its members about the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. It found 44% nominated jobkeeper as the biggest support to business during Covid-19, with small and medium enterprises (47%) and not-for-profits (51%) particularly enamoured with the wage subsidy. Company directors were overwhelmingly (81%) in favour of \u201ca cautious phasing out of government policies, such as the jobkeeper subsidy scheme and coronavirus supplement\u201d, even at the cost of increased government deficits and debt. The remaining 19% of respondents said they would prefer \u201ca rapid wind-down of government policies in order to start to rebuild public finances and restore the economy to normal operation\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the survey \u201crevealed widespread concern about the Morrison government\u2019s \u2018snapback\u2019 strategy and its lack of a plan for the recovery\u201d. \u201cThe less done to protect jobs and support vulnerable workers, business and communities in the coming months, the harder and longer the recovery will be,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving introduced support for the economy too narrowly and too slowly, Australians can\u2019t afford for the government to withdraw that support too quickly or too bluntly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BHP has said it will not damage 40 Aboriginal heritage sites which it received ministerial permission to destroy without \u201cfurther extensive consultation\u201d with traditional owners, after Guardian Australia revealed that traditional owners had been legally prevented from speaking publicly about the sites. It comes amid a mounting shareholder backlash against mining companies for their destruction of Aboriginal heritage, which began with Rio Tinto\u2019s destruction of a 46,000-year-old heritage site at Juukan Gorge last month and has been compared by shareholder groups to widespread bad conduct in the financial services sector before the banking royal commission. On Thursday BHP said it was clarifying earlier statements by promising not to destroy any of the 40 sites in the central Pilbara to expand its $4.5bn South Flank iron ore mining operation, without further consultation with the Banjima traditional owners. It received a ministerial consent order to destroy them under WA\u2019s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws on 29 March. \u201cWe will not disturb the sites identified without further extensive consultation with the Banjima people,\u201d a BHP spokesman said. \u201cThat consultation will be based on our commitment to understanding the cultural significance of the region and on the deep respect we have for the Banjima people and their heritage. \u201cThis will include further scientific study and discussion on mitigation and preservation.\u201d The company said its relationship with the traditional owners was \u201cof fundamental importance to our organisation\u201d. In the Juukan Gorge case, it emerged on Wednesday that representatives of the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama Pinikura native title group, met the Western Australia Aboriginal affairs department five days before the site was destroyed and expressed their concerns. The department contacted Rio Tinto after the meeting to let them know of the PKKP\u2019s concerns. Rio Tinto iron ore chief executive, Chris Salisbury previously said the company believed it had reached an understanding with the PKKP about the site, until concerns were raised that week . But the department did not contact its minister, Ben Wyatt, who has repeatedly said he did not learn of the risk to the cave until after it was destroyed. In state parliament on Wednesday, Wyatt said the department met advisers from the PKKP, but not traditional owners, on 19 May and at the end of the meeting the advisers \u201csought confirmation of their understanding of the section 18 consent order issued for the Brockman mine in 2013, and sought confirmation that such consents cannot be revoked\u201d. \u201cDepartment officers confirmed this was the case,\u201d he said. \u201cSubsequent to the meeting, the department contacted Rio Tinto to ensure they were aware of the meeting with PKKP advisors.\u201d The PKKP did not learn of the imminent destruction of the site until 15 May, when they visited it to plan an upcoming Naidoc week celebration that had been approved by the mining company. Western Australian senator Pat Dodson said Rio Tinto had shown a lack of leadership. \u201cFor all their good works, and good intentions, the Rio people \u2026 I think that leadership is lacking here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the best practice, I don\u2019t think is clearly demonstrated in the way they\u2019ve gone about their work.\u201d Executives from Rio Tinto are holding meetings in London this week after being called in to explain themselves to major hareholders. Rio Tinto was also stripped of its partner status with Reconciliation Australia. Reconciliation Australia has written to all its partner organisations, including BHP, \u201cregarding our expectations on the standards we expect of them as partners and what constitutes respectful relationships, including organisations who operate under WA heritage laws\u201d. Brynn O\u2019Brien, the executive officer of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said Rio Tinto had been \u201csurprised\u201d by the backlash, because it had acted in accordance with longstanding laws and industry practice in the Pilbara. O\u2019Brien said she had been contacted by investors concerned about BHP\u2019s Aboriginal heritage track record even before Guardian Australia revealed it had received permission to destroy the heritage sites in the expansion of its South Flank mine. \u201cBHP would be very, very unwise to ignore this backlash,\u201d she said. O\u2019Brien said the behaviour of mining companies in overriding Aboriginal heritage concerns was \u201cthe kind of behaviour that was seen amongst the financial services sector that resulted in the royal commission\u201d. \u201cThe destruction of Indigenous heritage is a part of the mining industry in WA, but it\u2019s something that community views have finally caught up with and I think investor views have caught up with it as well,\u201d she said. On Thursday the Senate agreed to a federal inquiry into the destruction of the site at the Juukan Gorge, west of Karijini national park, the operation of the Western Australian Aboriginal heritage laws and the ability of federal heritage laws to intervene. The inquiry would be told to table its final report by September. Dodson said the WA government should put a moratorium on granting section 18 approvals \u201cuntil the minister has actually redrafted his act\u201d. \u201cI think this should be an absolute moratorium,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cThey should stop approving section 18 now. Stop that now.\u201d Wyatt campaigned in opposition against the Aboriginal heritage laws and began consultation to change them in 2018, but that process has been delayed by coronavirus restrictions. He has not refused to grant a single section 18 application for a mining lease that was put before him by the Aboriginal cultural materials committee since entering ministerial office in 2017. Dodson said it is unlikely Wyatt would get a new bill finalised and through parliament before the state election next March. \u201cIn the meantime, you just cannot have the status quo position prevail,\u201d he said.",

Her contribution to Where We Are was recorded on her iPhone. The film was co-created by the producer-director Anthoula Syndica-Drummond and Royal Ballet dancer Alexander Campbell, who also appears alongside Clemmie Sveaas&nbsp;and Jeffrey Cirio. With the five dancers filming themselves at home, one of the major challenges was matching the lighting and frame sizes, says Campbell, who has known Rudd since they were at the Royal Ballet school.

      "bodyText": "She has become one of the UK\u2019s best known ballerinas thanks to her roles with the Royal Ballet and as Victoria the white kitten in Tom Hooper\u2019s Cats movie. But Francesca Hayward\u2019s new performance, filmed in lockdown, is about how it has felt to not perform at all during the Covid-19 pandemic. Hayward is one of five dancers in a new short film, Where We Are, choreographed by and co-starring Rambert\u2019s Hannah Rudd. The stylish black-and-white piece, released online on Thursday morning, \u201ccaptures our thoughts and feelings at being unable to perform, unable to create\u201d, says Hayward. \u201cBut also going deeper, for me, it allowed me to express my fears and concerns for my family and their health.\u201d Hayward has already shared a number of short dance videos during lockdown in which she duets with her partner, Cesar Corrales \u2013 a first soloist at the Royal Ballet \u2013 so she is used to self-filming. Her contribution to Where We Are was recorded on her iPhone. The film was co-created by the producer-director Anthoula Syndica-Drummond and Royal Ballet dancer Alexander Campbell, who also appears alongside Clemmie Sveaas and Jeffrey Cirio. With the five dancers filming themselves at home, one of the major challenges was matching the lighting and frame sizes, says Campbell, who has known Rudd since they were at the Royal Ballet school. To match Rudd\u2019s choreography, which he says has a \u201cwonderful honesty and humanity\u201d, an original music score was commissioned from composer Sophie Cotton and played by violinist Naomi Burrell.

While venues are closed, he hopes that the many online dance films \u2013 such as Matthew Bourne\u2019s mini version of The Red Shoes \u2013 will bring the artform to a new audience.

I\u2019m never going to have the big numbers and the big-paying owners that you need, unfortunately.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is not as though she has quit the game for some more tempting opportunity. Asked what she\u2019ll do next, Normile responds: \u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, everybody\u2019s been asking that and I genuinely have no idea.

You try and make do and some owners have been amazingly supportive but the industry we\u2019re in, yes, it\u2019s our business, but it\u2019s a leisure pursuit for a lot of people. And unless the economy picks up and flies again, there\u2019s a lot of people who are not going to have the leisure money to be spending on racing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of small trainers that have been struggling along for years and this, unfortunately, might be the final nail in the coffin. Which is pants, really.\u201d</p> \n<p>Normile leaves, she insists, with no bitterness or regret. \u201cNone at all. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my time. I\u2019m immensely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved with horses that others would have turned down. We have needed those horses, we\u2019ve won races with them. I\u2019ve loved it but it\u2019s hard work and it doesn\u2019t get easier when you get older. Racing\u2019s been very good to me for a long, long time.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky, having had some brilliant staff. The highs outweigh the lows and we made a point of making sure we acknowledged all the winners because we knew they weren\u2019t 10 a penny. We made sure to celebrate them and, as Arthur Stephenson once said, the little fish are sweetest. It\u2019s the satisfaction of a job well done that\u2019s probably best.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Racing returns to Newbury with a good card, albeit limited to six races, which seems a novel idea at a time when other tracks seem to be racing from dawn to dusk. I thought <strong>Tenfold (3.40)</strong> might be a backable price in one of the maidens because there are two debutants from big-name Newmarket yards and I\u2019ve got my wish as he\u2019s sliding out to 15-2. Martyn Meade\u2019s runner has an experience edge over Worthily, whose breeding suggests time and distance.</p> \n<p><strong>Rasheeq (2.10)</strong> has shortened to 9-2, possibly because his yard won Wednesday\u2019s closer at Yarmouth. He beat big fields here and at Nottingham last year and still looks fairly treated.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"acb13b48-430e-4870-b24c-3c8cd47494d5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Beverley 12.45</b> Brazen Belle <b>1.15 </b>Dapper Man <b>1.45&nbsp;</b>George Cornelius <b>2.20</b> Birdie Bowers <b>2.50</b>&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Harbour <b>3.20</b> Dawaaween (nb) <b>3.50</b> Mickey <b>4.20</b> Talking About You <b>4.50</b> Awesomedude&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newbury&nbsp;2.10</b> Rasheeq <b>2.40</b> Tambourine&nbsp;Girl <b>3.10</b>&nbsp;Quickstep Lady <b>3.40 </b>Tenfold (nap) <b>4.10&nbsp;</b>Gold&nbsp;Wand <b>4.45</b> Involved&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield 4.35</b> Risque <b>5.10 </b>Krazy Paving <b>5.40</b> Gleeds Girl <b>6.10</b> Thegreyvtrain <b>6.45 </b>Absolute Altitude <b>7.15</b> Raajin <b>7.45</b> Recuerdame <b>8.15 </b>Golden Cygnet <b>8.45</b> Janus&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Yarmouth</b>&nbsp;<b>5.00</b> On Guard <b>5.30 </b>You Owe Me <b>6.00</b>&nbsp;Yazaman<b> 6.30 </b>Craigburn <b>7.00</b> Gigi\u2019s Beach <b>7.30</b>&nbsp;Hawafez 8.00 Topkapi Star <b>8.30 </b>Jeanette May</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Roger Charlton is among those trainers going well and his 9-2 shot <strong>Tambourine Girl (2.40)</strong> seems likely to find some improvement on this handicap debut. <strong>Quickstep Lady (3.10)</strong> appeals at 11-2 in a novice race and this half-sister to a Stewards\u2019 Cup winner could have a good year.</p>",

Alas, he was one of just four horses Normile had to run in Flat races this summer, prompting her to call time. \u201cRealistically, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d she reflected on Wednesday. \u201cYou can keep papering over the cracks for a little bit longer here and there but at the end of the day I\u2019ve got kids and you just have to go, hang on a minute, we need to be realistic. I\u2019m never going to have the big numbers and the big-paying owners that you need, unfortunately.\u201d It is not as though she has quit the game for some more tempting opportunity. Asked what she\u2019ll do next, Normile responds: \u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, everybody\u2019s been asking that and I genuinely have no idea. There\u2019s till horses here, mares and foals and youngsters, but realistically I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Racing folk have tried to focus on the positives since the sport was allowed to return last week but there is a widespread feeling that some business may not recover, which Normile shares. \u201cI think it\u2019ll get worse. You try and make do and some owners have been amazingly supportive but the industry we\u2019re in, yes, it\u2019s our business, but it\u2019s a leisure pursuit for a lot of people. And unless the economy picks up and flies again, there\u2019s a lot of people who are not going to have the leisure money to be spending on racing. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of small trainers that have been struggling along for years and this, unfortunately, might be the final nail in the coffin. Which is pants, really.\u201d Normile leaves, she insists, with no bitterness or regret. \u201cNone at all. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my time. I\u2019m immensely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved with horses that others would have turned down. We have needed those horses, we\u2019ve won races with them. I\u2019ve loved it but it\u2019s hard work and it doesn\u2019t get easier when you get older. Racing\u2019s been very good to me for a long, long time. \u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky, having had some brilliant staff. The highs outweigh the lows and we made a point of making sure we acknowledged all the winners because we knew they weren\u2019t 10 a penny. We made sure to celebrate them and, as Arthur Stephenson once said, the little fish are sweetest. It\u2019s the satisfaction of a job well done that\u2019s probably best.\u201d Thursday\u2019s best bets Racing returns to Newbury with a good card, albeit limited to six races, which seems a novel idea at a time when other tracks seem to be racing from dawn to dusk. I thought Tenfold (3.40) might be a backable price in one of the maidens because there are two debutants from big-name Newmarket yards and I\u2019ve got my wish as he\u2019s sliding out to 15-2. Martyn Meade\u2019s runner has an experience edge over Worthily, whose breeding suggests time and distance. Rasheeq (2.10) has shortened to 9-2, possibly because his yard won Wednesday\u2019s closer at Yarmouth. He beat big fields here and at Nottingham last year and still looks fairly treated. Roger Charlton is among those trainers going well and his 9-2 shot Tambourine Girl (2.40) seems likely to find some improvement on this handicap debut. Quickstep Lady (3.10) appeals at 11-2 in a novice race and this half-sister to a Stewards\u2019 Cup winner could have a good year.",

The stark claim by Prof Neil Ferguson that thousands of lives could have been saved intensified the pressure on the government over its handling of the outbreak, leaving Boris Johnson facing repeated questions at the daily Downing Street press conference. The prime minister insisted it was \u201cpremature\u201d to make judgments about the government\u2019s approach, and said he had taken the steps \u201cthat we thought were right for this country\u201d, on the basis of scientific advice. But this position came under further scrutiny when the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, was asked about his regrets about the handling of the crisis so far. \u201cI think there\u2019s a long list of things that we need to look at very seriously,\u201d he said.

Ferguson subsequently resigned, after breaking lockdown rules to meet with a lover. Earlier, during tense exchanges in the Commons, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, confronted the prime minister over his claim that he was \u201cproud\u201d of the government\u2019s response. Citing the official death toll, as well as the Office for National Statistics estimate of 63,000 excess deaths during the pandemic, Starmer said: \u201cThose are among the highest numbers anywhere in the world. Last week the prime minister said he was proud of the government\u2019s record, but there is no pride in those figures, is there?\u201d Johnson said international comparisons should wait until the outbreak is over: though he later favourably compared the UK\u2019s approach to returning children to school, to that taken in other countries. The row came on the eve of Johnson\u2019s self-imposed deadline for getting on top of the pandemic. On 19 March he said that it would take 12 weeks to \u201cturn the tide\u201d. But he is now facing mounting disquiet over his handling of the crisis, with backbench MPs increasingly vocal, including over the government\u2019s quarantine plans, and its failure to open schools to more pupils. The prime minister promised a \u201ccatch-up\u201d programme for pupils over the summer: and conceded that he had not been able to open schools more rapidly because the infection is not yet sufficiently under control. While Johnson nevertheless highlighted the opening of zoos, and the creation of \u201csupport bubbles\u201d to tackle loneliness, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, struck a sombre tone at the press conference. \u201cThe epidemic is shrinking, but not fast,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers are coming down, but they\u2019re not yet very low. And the vast majority of the population remains susceptible to that infection.\u201d He said that meant changes must take place slowly and might need to be reversed. However, he did offer a hint that the government\u2019s 2-metre advice for social distancing could be relaxed. Vallance told the briefing: \u201cIt is not a scientific rule \u2013 it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces \u2026 It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing.\u201d Whitty also warned that some restrictions may need to be reimposed if there is a resurgence in cases later in the year, for example. \u201cThere is a reasonable chance that in the winter, this virus will have some advantages it doesn\u2019t have in the rest of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something which transmits more easily indoors, for example.

But it was the realisation that the size of the epidemic was doubling every four days and greater clarity over the severity of the illness that prompted Sage to recommend lockdown. According to Ferguson, it was around nine days after that modelling, which was only one stream of information ministers were reviewing, that lockdown was announced. Before March, scientists believed the UK had far fewer infections than it actually had. But it later became clear that between 1,500 and 2,000 cases arrived from Italy and Spain in the first two weeks of that month. At the time, the modellers assumed about two-thirds of infected people coming into the UK were not being identified, but Ferguson said a more accurate figure was about 90%. The Sage committee recommended that travellers should be tested when arriving from countries that had been identified as having active transmission, but the scale of the risks from Italy and Spain were not appreciated at the time. \u201cWe frankly underestimated how far into the epidemic the country was,\u201d Ferguson said.",

<strong>Samantha Armytage</strong> and commentator <strong>Prue MacSween</strong> face a racial vilification lawsuit over a controversial segment on Indigenous adoption aired on Channel Seven.<br></p> \n  <p>The potential federal court action comes after settlement negotiations collapsed in a group racial discrimination complaint filed in the Australian Human Rights Commission.<br></p> \n  <p>During a March 2018 broadcast, Armytage and panellists on the breakfast TV show discussed Aboriginal adoption.</p> \n  <p>MacSween said: \u201cJust like the first stolen generation, where a lot of children were taken because it was for their wellbeing, we need to do it again.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>The federal court action is being led by Aboriginal elder Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grovenor, the group\u2019s lawyers said in a statement on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>They said the eight Aboriginal complainants were forced to take the action after the commission negotiations broke down.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSunrise platformed wealthy white women calling for a stolen generations 2.0 as a means of salvation for our young people,\u201d Dixon-Grovenor said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThis shameful, profoundly hurtful and devastating display of racism was broadcast by a commercial television station into homes right across Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe dignity of all Aboriginal people and children was violated in our very own homes and lounge rooms around Australia.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A Seven spokeswoman said the network was not aware of any actual claim being filed at this stage so could not comment on the case.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cSeven settled the original matter in late 2019 in the federal court with the Yirrkala community and the Yolngu families and offered an unreserved apology on-air shortly after,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>After negotiations broke down the group had 60 days to file a case in the federal court. </p> \n  <p>AAP understands law firm <strong>Susan Moriarty</strong> will file proceedings on their behalf once they receive a certificate stating the initial negotiations were unresolvable.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time

Most others \u2013 including the Coalition, Labor and the Greens \u2013 united against the attempt to suspend standing orders.</p> \n  <p>But it\u2019s worth noting that the conservative Liberal party senator <strong>Jim Molan</strong> stepped out of the chamber immediately before the division on Hanson\u2019s motion and returned straight after the result was read out, 51 votes to 2.

The government, the Greens, Labor, minor parties ensured that never did go to a vote. Why did you all work together on that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells:</strong></p> \n  <p>I have to say I\u2019m on leave at the moment, so I haven\u2019t been in the chamber. So I\u2019m not fully across what\u2019s happened this afternoon in relation to that. <strong>In relation to this, can I just say all lives matter.</strong> And therefore as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have to say that the activities that we\u2019ve seen, particularly of some of the protesters at a time when we are in these very difficult circumstances, I think has demonstrated a degree of irresponsibility.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas:</strong> That\u2019s the language of senator Hanson\u2019s motion that all lives matter. The reason the movement is called Black Lives Matter is black people around the world and in the US are disproportionately represented in these kinds of cases, with the police and the justice system. That\u2019s why the movement exists because there is a different treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, can I just say I respect the right of people to express their point of view and to protest. The point being at this point in time, given what we are going through, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate thing to do. I appreciate events in the US. Can I also say in relation to the events in the US, I think we do need to distinguish what\u2019s happening in the US and what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world. I do respect this issue but at this particular point in time I would have liked to have seen a lot more responsibility on the part of Australians and I know this is an issue that a lot of Australians are very upset about. There are people who weren\u2019t able to go to weddings and mourn their families.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>I\u2019m talking about the substantive issue: black lives matter. That\u2019s because black people are not treated the same in the justice system. Do you agree with that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, I think as myself being a lawyer; I think the justice system has served us well in Australia. As I have said, I think in the end what is really important is that all Australians have the opportunity to be their best. And that includes most especially having a job and so therefore the focus of our government has been on ensuring jobs, jobs, jobs. That means jobs for all Australians.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>You say the justice system as the served our nation well. Do you think it has served Indigenous Australians well?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>I think it has served Australia well. There are concerns and there have been concerns in relation to deaths in custody. But I think in the end when you do look at the reasons why young people go off the rails or things happen, it\u2019s because ultimately there has been a breakdown issue in their family circumstances or their economic circumstances. And as somebody who worked with Father <strong>Chris Riley</strong>, there are many things that contribute to young people or people going off the rails. So ultimately, stability and a very important component of that is work. So it is vitally important for us to have a strong economy and part of that strong economy is to ensure that as many people are in jobs as is possible.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:47:13.860Z\">at 7.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d06b8f08beee219d96ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:35:52.620Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>then says \u201cAll lives matter\u201d when asked about Pauline Hanson\u2019s motion.</p> \n  <p>SIGGGGGHHHHH.</p> \n  <p>If I have to explain to anyone, again, why all lives matter is an offensive and completely tone-deaf response to Black Lives matter, please send an email to doyourresearchandthentakealookinthemirror@gmail.com</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:37:18.315Z\">at 7.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1cfee8f08beee219d96c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:34:10.802Z\">7.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Liberal senator <strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>who crossed the floor to support a crossbench motion for a Senate inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China, tells the ABC she doesn\u2019t believe it is smart for Australia to have so much trade with one country:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point is it is not a good business model to put a third of your trade eggs in one basket.

Once again, the member is putting forward completely untruthful statements and he has a habit of making untruthful allegations, Mr Speaker.</p> \n  <p>The assertion that the member made regarding myself and the assertion against my character is completely rejected.

Now the name of this program is the SME rxport hubs and that\u2019s probably an indication of how it operates because it is a hub which means that it services an entire region. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo the assertion that the member is making clearly just demonstrates a very limited understanding of the program. So the SME export hubs don\u2019t just help those businesses located just next door to them; they actually assist a number of businesses across wide regions. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNow a clear example that I\u2019d like to actually put to the House, and this might also assist the member with his understanding, is that in South Australia we have Food South Australia. They received a grant to establish a hub in round one. They are explicitly offering to assist all businesses across South Australia. Now, let\u2019s be clear, it is based in a location but it provides support right across South Australia. So I would also like to take the opportunity to point out, Mr Speaker, that this is a competitive grant program. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll applicants provided evidence of how they met the criteria through a two-stage application process. They were independently assessed. Now, Mr Speaker, I will just finish on this point, and that is for both funding rounds I, as the minister, accepted advice of the committee and their recommendations without change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T05:20:45.000Z\">at 6.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1bbb38f0860ca20faa1a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T05:07:10.194Z\">6.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bill Shorten </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Does the government agree that it owes all Australians, including Centrelink recipients, a duty of care to behave lawfully?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you, Mr Speaker.

Cancer-suffering grandfather <strong>Raymond Murphy</strong> had to sell his house and move to his shed to afford medical treatment. He said debt collectors ripped him to shreds over a $2,300 robodebt while he was in hospital. Why won\u2019t the government apologise to Mr Murphy and thousands of other Australians ... with their unlawful robodebt scheme?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I\u2019ll ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. The business of raising and recovering debts on behalf of taxpayers is a difficult job and it deals with Australians in many very sensitive circumstances. </p> \n  <p>Of course I would deeply regret \u2013deeply regret \u2013 any hardship that has been caused to people in the conduct of that activity. The government has many difficult jobs that it has to do dealing with Australians in very sensitive circumstances and that is true particularly at this time. </p> \n  <p>It is our instruction that we would hope that all agents of the government when pursuing the debt recovery option that they would be sensitive to people\u2019s circumstances. </p> \n  <p>And in relation to the particular gentleman that you referred to, that is a very distressing situation that you have raised. <strong>I would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations.</strong> </p> \n  <p>But the issue is one of ensuring how the government can best do this. Where there are lessons to be learned here they will be learned. That is what the minister for government services is employing now. I will ask the minister for government services to add to the answer.</p> \n  <p><strong>Stuart Robert:</strong></p> \n  <p>I would say to the member, if any member can refer any hardship cases through to me and I will ensure the department looks at it. Mental health and suicide, as we all know, and we all appreciate, are very delicate issues. There are many factors that go into them. Services Australia assess people facing difficult situations every day. We have the largest social services network to support people within federal government departments in times of crisis and vulnerability and we do this everyday. </p> \n  <p>As the prime minister said, the collection of debts is a lawful responsibility of all governments. Right now, just so that colleagues are aware in the House, 939,000 Australians have debts over $5bn that the government lawfully has to collect across a whole range of programs. </p> \n  <p>And governments of all persuasions have done this across the divide.

It was the same policy that the Labor party used and would account for some or more than 20% of the debts they raised on exactly the same basis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>(For the millionth time, the difference is the Coalition removed the human element from the process.)</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The hypocrisy that is put forward by the Labor party when the legal issue that is involved here is about income averaging as being the basis of raising the debt. </p> \n   <p>Now, my government is not going to make \u2013 is not going to walk back from the idea that when monies have been overpaid, when benefits have been overpaid, then we owe to it taxpayers to ensure that we reclaim those debts. </p> \n   <p>Of course that is what is necessary.

Prime minister, if you don\u2019t want Black Lives Matters protests to continue, why don\u2019t you do something about institutionalised racism in this country? Will you agree with the Greens proposal to put action on black deaths in custody on the national meeting this Friday and make it a future item for the future national cabinet meetings and come up with a law so we stop locking up Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at such high rates. </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I thank the member for the question on what is an extremely important issue and that is Indigenous deaths, whether it be in police custody or it be in custody more generally. </p> \n  <p>As the minister for Indigenous Australians pointed out yesterday this is already a matter of significant attention of not just the government but state and territory governments as well. </p> \n  <p>It previously did feature with more specific goals more broadly under justice headings in this area that related to the previous Closing the Gap objectives but as also featuring in the new reform set of Closing the Gap goals which is now coming to agreement for the first time involving the direct involvement of Indigenous peak groups in agreeing what those goals should be. </p> \n  <p>It is also the case that in NSW, for example, we are pleased that there has been progress that has been made in police custody. In NSW there has been one death in police custody, I\u2019m advised, since 2000 and in particular since 2000 when the new arrangements were put in place to provide for access for Indigenous persons who would find themselves in police custody to make those calls and get access to that legal advice.</p> \n  <p> Now the government is now funding that program over the next three years and that has proven to be a very effective mechanism to prevent deaths in police custody. </p> \n  <p>Every death in custody, and particular Indigenous deaths in custody, is an absolute national shame and tragedy and what the minister for Indigenous Australians has been working to do is also to address the contributing factors which find Indigenous Australians in custody. </p> \n  <p>You asked about the agenda of the national cabinet. When I announced the formation of the national cabinet going forward, I also announced the establishment of the national federation reform council. There are only two national taskforces that report to that council; importantly one deals with these very issues in Indigenous affairs, the other one deals with violence against women. </p> \n  <p>We all agreed, premiers, myself, chief ministers, that they were the issues that needed constant national priority and attention by the national federation reform council which brings all the key decision-makers together and for progress to be tracked against the successes that we hope to achieve in that area. So our government is very committed to action in this area. </p> \n  <p><strong>It is an important issue but when it comes to the issue of gatherings and protests, the health advice says it put other Australians\u2019 lives at risk including, in particular, Indigenous lives. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>And I, I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition would agree with me: \u201cDo not go to those rallies.

I hope that anyone who has attended that and indeed, across Victoria, who developed symptoms that are compatible with coronavirus, really need to isolate themselves, get tested, get that result back and become well before they get out and about again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:45:30.801Z\">at 1.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee17c7c8f08758335229efe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:36:44.047Z\">1.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mike Bowers </strong>is in the building.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1270869742434189314\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud races from a press conference to a division in the House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@amyremeikis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guardianaus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politicslive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#politicslive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qQLc6Wwu3c\">https://t.co/qQLc6Wwu3c</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dRfjsxwZEm\">pic.twitter.com/dRfjsxwZEm</a></p>\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1270869742434189314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:42:35.748Z\">at 1.42am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee179be8f08beee219d9486\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:35:01.849Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And to finish up that 3AW interview came this exchange between <strong>Neil Mitchell</strong> and <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>:<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> What was your attitude personally when you were getting all this [Covid] information in the early days?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Well, I knew we were in completely uncharted waters.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Were you frightened by it?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know if I put it that way.

But, you know, the way that was done and the suggestion that they might do it again, sort of, I think, risks public support for even the issue they raise.

This is off the back of Black Lives Matter. In London, the mayor is saying that every monument is now up for review and one of the statues in the UK with a question mark now is of Captain <strong>James Cook</strong>.

And while slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was established yes, sure, it was a pretty brutal settlement. </p> \n   <p>My forefathers and foremothers were on the first and second fleets. It was a pretty brutal place, <strong>but there was no slavery in Australia</strong>. </p> \n   <p>And so I think what we\u2019re seeing with some of these protests, they start on a fair point when they\u2019re raising issues about, you know, people\u2019s treatment in custody or things like that. </p> \n   <p>Fair, fair issue. </p> \n   <p><strong>But now it\u2019s being taken over by other much more politically driven leftwing agendas, which are seeking to take advantage of these opportunities to push their political causes.</strong> And, you know, we\u2019ve got to ... <strong>I\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve got to be honest about our history. </strong>We\u2019ve got to acknowledge the positive and the negative. </p> \n   <p>But, you know, <strong>I think we\u2019ve also got to respect our history as well.

Do we need to be upfront, PM, now, about the fact that some other industries will not have jobkeeper until September as first indicated?</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> <strong>Well, I don\u2019t know why people are suggesting that.</strong> Childcare was a fairly special case because we had moved to that free childcare arrangement. What has been done is that the normal fee arrangements have come back but when working with the childcare sector, when there was a choice between going with ongoing jobkeeper or a 25% subsistence payment to the sector \u2013 so we\u2019re talking about the same amount of support which means more employees will be helped in our consultations \u2013 that was seen as the better way forward. So I think this is a very special case. Jobkeeper is there until the end of September. </p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What about industries other than childcare? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, there are no other sort of special arrangements like we had in childcare so we\u2019ve dealt with that one quite specifically.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will jobkeeper remain until the end of September for everyone else?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve already said that.

Here are the day\u2019s key events: Scott Morrison has apologised to robodebt victims, telling the parliament: \u201cI would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations.\u201d The government\u2019s ensuring integrity bill is off the table, for now, after it consented to Labor\u2019s motion to have it removed from the notice paper. The Senate agreed to an inquiry into Rio Tinto\u2019s destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Pauline Hanson\u2019s \u201call lives matter\u201d motion was denied by the Senate. The OECD warned that Australia\u2019s economic output could fall by 6.3% if there was a second wave of coronavirus. The remuneration tribunal ruled there would be no pay rise for federal MPs this year. The prime minister called on states with closed borders to nominate the date when they will reopen. NSW will raise the state\u2019s limit on gatherings to 20 people from Saturday. As always, thanks for following along with us. Catch you again tomorrow for a rare Friday sitting day. Some breaking news from my colleagues Lorena Allam and Calla Wahlquist. BHP has said it will not damage 40 Aboriginal heritage sites which it received ministerial permission to destroy without \u201cfurther extensive consultation\u201d with traditional owners. It comes after Guardian Australia revealed the resources giant had permission from the Western Australian government to destroy the sites in the Pilbara and that traditional owners had been legally prevented from speaking publicly about the sites. The government appears to have ditched a regulation that reduced the consultation time frame for changes to workers conditions and pay. The regulation, announced in April, allowed employers to provide just 24 hours\u2019 notice, down from a week, to seek wide-ranging changes including cuts to pay, penalty rates, leave entitlements and changes to ordinary hours of work. At the time the government argued it was necessary to allow employers to deal with the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Labor sought to disallow it but failed after One Nation voted against the motion. But One Nation\u2019s support of the government was contingent on the regulation being given a sunset clause. \u201cIt now appears Christian Porter was unable to deliver on his deal with One Nation to amend the regulation so he\u2019s been forced to ditch it altogether,\u201d Tony Burke, Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, said on Thursday. \u201cThis is thoroughly humiliating for the minister \u2013 but a great win for workers.\u201d A judgment in a federal court challenge by the CFMMEU to the regulation was due tomorrow. From AAP: The Morrison government has described a push to lock in two lower house seats in the Northern Territory as premature. The Nationals have formed an unlikely alliance with Labor to guarantee two Northern Territory federal lower house seats in parliament. But the government is keeping its powder dry ahead of a redistribution tipped to reduce the NT\u2019s seats from two to one. NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy introduced a bill to parliament on Thursday to lock in the status quo, with the support of all five upper house Nationals. The government Senate leader, Mathias Cormann, said political parties, parliamentarians and voters would be able to make submissions about the redistribution. \u201cIt is premature to speculate about hypothetical outcomes of an electoral redistribution process yet to be undertaken independently by the Australian Electoral Commission,\u201d said. The AEC will not start the process before 3 July, with boundaries to be decided before the next election. Cormann said the government would work with the electoral parliamentary committee to consider if laws were needed after the redistribution. The push for an inquiry into the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia was agreed to without any dissent in the Senate this evening. Labor senators Anthony Chisholm and Pat Dodson proposed an inquiry into a range of issues, including: the operation of state and federal laws that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage; the decision-making and consultation processes of Rio Tinto; the loss or damage to the traditional owners Puutu, Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people from the destruction of the site. It was referred to the joint standing committee on Northern Australia for inquiry and report by 30 September. But the Greens senator Rachel Siewert said while her party was not opposing the move, she had concerns about the task being handled by a government-dominated committee focused on just part of Australia. \u201cWhy is it being referred to a committee being dominated by the government when they\u2019re involved in decision-making on this issue being investigated?\u201d she said. In the Senate, a matter of public importance is under way on the the decision to end the jobkeeper subsidy for childcare workers from 20 July. Labor\u2019s Jess Walsh says the decision comes despite the pandemic having hit women the hardest. \u201cThis is not a government that has the backs of Australian working women,\u201d she says. As Australia enters a recession, Walsh says the government\u2019s priorities are \u201cgiving out bathroom renovations on one hand and ripping away programs that support women with the other\u201d. She says the removal of free childcare from 13 July will hurt families at a time when many are earning less, \u201cwhen many families are desperately trying to get back on their feet\u201d. On that note, I am going to hand the blog over to Lisa Cox for the evening stretch. We\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning for the Friday sitting. And don\u2019t forget: you have four more days of sittings next week as well! Huzzah! What lucky little ducks you all are. In the meantime, be kind, be thoughtful, and take care of you. And from AAP: Sunrise host Samantha Armytage and commentator Prue MacSween face a racial vilification lawsuit over a controversial segment on Indigenous adoption aired on Channel Seven. The potential federal court action comes after settlement negotiations collapsed in a group racial discrimination complaint filed in the Australian Human Rights Commission. During a March 2018 broadcast, Armytage and panellists on the breakfast TV show discussed Aboriginal adoption. MacSween said: \u201cJust like the first stolen generation, where a lot of children were taken because it was for their wellbeing, we need to do it again.\u201d The federal court action is being led by Aboriginal elder Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grovenor, the group\u2019s lawyers said in a statement on Thursday. They said the eight Aboriginal complainants were forced to take the action after the commission negotiations broke down. \u201cSunrise platformed wealthy white women calling for a stolen generations 2.0 as a means of salvation for our young people,\u201d Dixon-Grovenor said. \u201cThis shameful, profoundly hurtful and devastating display of racism was broadcast by a commercial television station into homes right across Australia. \u201cThe dignity of all Aboriginal people and children was violated in our very own homes and lounge rooms around Australia.\u201d A Seven spokeswoman said the network was not aware of any actual claim being filed at this stage so could not comment on the case. \u201cSeven settled the original matter in late 2019 in the federal court with the Yirrkala community and the Yolngu families and offered an unreserved apology on-air shortly after,\u201d she said. After negotiations broke down the group had 60 days to file a case in the federal court. AAP understands law firm Susan Moriarty will file proceedings on their behalf once they receive a certificate stating the initial negotiations were unresolvable. In case you haven\u2019t seen it: Pauline Hanson giving Malcolm Roberts a hand in counting the \u201cayes\u201d. There were two of them: Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts. From AAP: The Australian stock market has plunged 3% in its worst day in six weeks, snapping a seven-day winning streak. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index closed on Thursday down 187.8 points, or 3.05%, at 5,960.6 points, while the broader all ordinaries index closed down 189.8 points, or 3.03% lower, at 6,079.5. Awwwwww. Jim Molan reads us! Thanks for the clicks, senator. Daniel Hurst found this in yesterday\u2019s Senate Hansard, from one of Molan\u2019s speeches: Senator Wong made reference to \u2018Sky after dark\u2019. I\u2019m a proud member of the association of \u2018Sky after dark\u2019. If I remember rightly, I was on late last night and it was dark, which is always a lot better than \u2018Guardian by day and night\u2019, I must admit. The ideas I hear on Sky after six o\u2019clock or 5.30 these days are, in my humble view, a lot more substantial than many of the ideas that I read in the Guardian. But that doesn\u2019t go, of course, to the purpose of this bill. I was in the Senate gallery a short time ago when the chamber divided over Pauline Hanson\u2019s attempt to suspend standing orders to allow consideration of her motion that \u201call lives matter\u201d. Hanson\u2019s attempt failed, as she garnered support from only her One Nation colleague Malcolm Roberts. Most others \u2013 including the Coalition, Labor and the Greens \u2013 united against the attempt to suspend standing orders. But it\u2019s worth noting that the conservative Liberal party senator Jim Molan stepped out of the chamber immediately before the division on Hanson\u2019s motion and returned straight after the result was read out, 51 votes to 2. It looked very much like he abstained rather than voting with his government colleagues \u2013 but we\u2019re chasing a comment from his office. Patricia Karvelas: Just finally, there\u2019s something significant that\u2019s happened in the Senate. Pauline Hanson was trying to get her motion up, the all lives matter motion. The government, the Greens, Labor, minor parties ensured that never did go to a vote. Why did you all work together on that? Concetta Fierravanti-Wells: I have to say I\u2019m on leave at the moment, so I haven\u2019t been in the chamber. So I\u2019m not fully across what\u2019s happened this afternoon in relation to that. In relation to this, can I just say all lives matter. And therefore as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have to say that the activities that we\u2019ve seen, particularly of some of the protesters at a time when we are in these very difficult circumstances, I think has demonstrated a degree of irresponsibility. Karvelas: That\u2019s the language of senator Hanson\u2019s motion that all lives matter. The reason the movement is called Black Lives Matter is black people around the world and in the US are disproportionately represented in these kinds of cases, with the police and the justice system. That\u2019s why the movement exists because there is a different treatment. Fierravanti-Wells Patricia, can I just say I respect the right of people to express their point of view and to protest. The point being at this point in time, given what we are going through, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate thing to do. I appreciate events in the US. Can I also say in relation to the events in the US, I think we do need to distinguish what\u2019s happening in the US and what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world. I do respect this issue but at this particular point in time I would have liked to have seen a lot more responsibility on the part of Australians and I know this is an issue that a lot of Australians are very upset about. There are people who weren\u2019t able to go to weddings and mourn their families. Karvelas: I\u2019m talking about the substantive issue: black lives matter. That\u2019s because black people are not treated the same in the justice system. Do you agree with that? Fierravanti-Wells Patricia, I think as myself being a lawyer; I think the justice system has served us well in Australia. As I have said, I think in the end what is really important is that all Australians have the opportunity to be their best. And that includes most especially having a job and so therefore the focus of our government has been on ensuring jobs, jobs, jobs. That means jobs for all Australians. Karvelas: You say the justice system as the served our nation well. Do you think it has served Indigenous Australians well? Fierravanti-Wells I think it has served Australia well. There are concerns and there have been concerns in relation to deaths in custody. But I think in the end when you do look at the reasons why young people go off the rails or things happen, it\u2019s because ultimately there has been a breakdown issue in their family circumstances or their economic circumstances. And as somebody who worked with Father Chris Riley, there are many things that contribute to young people or people going off the rails. So ultimately, stability and a very important component of that is work. So it is vitally important for us to have a strong economy and part of that strong economy is to ensure that as many people are in jobs as is possible. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells then says \u201cAll lives matter\u201d when asked about Pauline Hanson\u2019s motion. SIGGGGGHHHHH. If I have to explain to anyone, again, why all lives matter is an offensive and completely tone-deaf response to Black Lives matter, please send an email to doyourresearchandthentakealookinthemirror@gmail.com The Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells who crossed the floor to support a crossbench motion for a Senate inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China, tells the ABC she doesn\u2019t believe it is smart for Australia to have so much trade with one country: The point is it is not a good business model to put a third of your trade eggs in one basket. I mean, this is something that the universities have seen. They obviously haven\u2019t followed the edicts or the teachings of their business schools in terms of diversifying their investments. The point that needs to be made particularly after what we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic is that we have to reduce our reliance on overseas supply chains. We have to reduce our dependency on this one economy, which is a communist regime. It is not, it\u2019s a totalitarian regime and not a democratic country. I think what we\u2019ve seen through this pandemic is a growing need for us to decouple from China, to reduce our dependency on the communist regime and build up our domestic resilience, particularly in relation to non-reliance of overseas supply chains. The \u201censuring integrity\u201d union busting bill is officially dead (for now). The government consented to Labor\u2019s motion to have it removed from the notice paper. On Scott Morrison\u2019s comments this morning that \u201cthere was no slavery in Australia\u201d (which is not true. We didn\u2019t call it slavery, but naming a steaming pile of awfulness something other than a steaming pile of shit, doesn\u2019t change what it is). Pat Dodson is of course, much more eloquent in his response, when asked by Patricia Karvelas if he thought people would be \u201csurprised\u201d by the prime minister\u2019s comments: I would be as well if I was a South Sea Islander. They were all indentured labourers on the cane fields and shipped back, and thousands of them dropped back on the islands, as well as the Aboriginal people who were basically incarcerated, enslaved on pastoral properties under acts which indentured them to these employers without any pay. I think whatever Mr Morrison\u2019s experience is, he really should have a really serious look at Australian history and understand \u2013 I saw people carrying water and being slaved without pay. So prior to 1967 the world was a bit different to what Mr Morrison might recall. Pat Dodson spoke to Patricia Karvelas about Pauline Hanson\u2019s latest attempt to divide the Senate: Well I don\u2019t think it was designed to generate any light. It was more designed to generate more heat and unconstructiveness. And One Nation is the master at that. So I\u2019m glad that the parties combined to put a stop to that form of nonsense. Of course all lives matter, but in the unwritten subliminal message there\u2019s that black lives really don\u2019t matter and the white lives do. It\u2019s never the debate we need in this country if we\u2019re trying to rebuild relationships. The government also denied formality for the Greens motion calling for the Senate to stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, so you know, balance. Ahhhh there we go. Mike Bowers was in the Senate when Pauline Hanson learned she wouldn\u2019t be allowed her latest \u201cwhite boomer Karen\u201d platform. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers: \u201cBut first, let me take a selfie.\u201d (Before the chamber reps write me a letter, this is a joke. I have no idea what Barnaby Joyce was doing with his phone. That\u2019s just a general life rule of mine.) *Randy Newman starts playing through the chamber.* Michael McCormack is that guy your auntie married who calls you \u201cBBQ sauce!\u201d every time he sees you because of that one time you dropped some on your shirt 10 years ago. Commenting on today\u2019s report that a person who attended Saturday\u2019s Black Lives Matter rally in Melbourne has tested positive for Covid-19, Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance said: Many Australians proudly took action for the families of the victims of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody, who don\u2019t have a choice but to continue the call for justice. The moment was bigger than the protest itself. It was the product of hundreds of years of systemic racism and racist policing that state governments and police have directly contributed to. Individuals weighed up carefully the decision to protest and the importance of the lives of 434 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have died in custody without anyone held accountable for their deaths. Safety was paramount and people did their utmost to support the official advice on social distancing, using masks and hand sanitiser. Anyone feeling unwell was urged to stay home. The official advice stands that any person who attended the rally and is feeling unwell should get tested. We will continue to campaign for justice, and to push Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody to the top of the national agenda. It has sort of been forgotten about, because it is a very restricted policy, but Andrew Leigh managed to eke out a speech ahead of question time which included homebuilder: The prime minister needs to stop taking his policy ideas from reality TV. Just because you gave 300 grand to Scott Cam doesn\u2019t mean The Block is a good basis for our economic recovery. It\u2019s as absurd as the minister for multiculturalism downplaying racism by pointing to MasterChef. In reality, this government is more like Married at First Sight \u2013 a train wreck Australians can\u2019t look away from.\u201d Over in the Senate, Mathias Cormann has denied Pauline Hanson\u2019s latest \u201cit\u2019s OK to be white\u201d motion \u2013 this time couched as \u201call lives matter\u201d. Labor supports the government\u2019s position on this one (obviously). So she\u2019ll be getting her angry tweet on about being gagged in about five ... four ... three. Oh \u2013 question time ended. I just needed a moment to sit and recover from yet another hour of dazzling democracy in this country. It is five hours out, but the Guardian AFL blog has begun. Just a small point \u2013 while this from Scott Morrison is more contrition than has been previously shown by the Coalition government: And in relation to the particular gentleman that you referred to, that is a very distressing situation that you have raised. I would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations. But the issue is the one of ensuring how the government can best do this. Where there are lessons to be learned here they will be learned. That is what the minister for government services is employing now. I will ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. Morrison did not apologise for the scheme. He apologised for the hurt or harm in the way the government dealt with the issue, to the individual raised by Bill Shorten, and \u201canyone else who has found themselves in those situations\u201d. You may remember Christian Porter said there could not be an apology because of the ongoing legal issues: David Speers: Do you now apologise for putting this flawed system in place? Porter: The system was flawed. I\u2019m not going to use that word because there\u2019s litigation ongoing and as attorney general I can\u2019t use that sort of language in the context of the litigation. Speers: You can\u2019t apologise because of the prospect of further damages? Porter: There\u2019s an argument which we will resist in the courts about the way in which the government ran the system. But what we do acknowledge is that using average, annualised ATO data, which many governments \u2013 Labor and Liberal \u2013 have done has, as it transpired, been shown to be an insufficient basis for raising those debts. Speers: So this was a flawed system, you were wrong to do it, but you won\u2019t apologise? Porter: Well there\u2019s litigation ongoing and that litigation argues amongst other things negligence and we don\u2019t concede that. Speers: Does legally insufficient mean illegal? Porter: There wasn\u2019t a lawful basis, that\u2019s what it means. Speers: Is it illegal? Porter: You can you use that, but that\u2019s a criminal term very often, but civilly, it was unlawful. There was no lawful basis for it. Scott Morrison uses the end of question time to wish his daughter Lily a happy birthday. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: 97% of funding in the first round of the small- to medium-enterprise export hub grant scheme was awarded to Coalition electorates just before the last election. Did the prime minister approve exports reports like he approved sports reports? Morrison: I will ask the minister to add to my answer but I absolutely reject the assertion and allegation just made by the member in the question that he put forward. Once again, the member is putting forward completely untruthful statements and he has a habit of making untruthful allegations, Mr Speaker. The assertion that the member made regarding myself and the assertion against my character is completely rejected. It is completely rejected and I think it reflects badly on the member for making that assertion. Karen Andrews: \u201cI am very happy to add to the answer to this question and I\u2019m happy to assist the member in his understanding of the program because he clearly does not understand how this particular program works. Now the name of this program is the SME rxport hubs and that\u2019s probably an indication of how it operates because it is a hub which means that it services an entire region. \u201cSo the assertion that the member is making clearly just demonstrates a very limited understanding of the program. So the SME export hubs don\u2019t just help those businesses located just next door to them; they actually assist a number of businesses across wide regions. \u201cNow a clear example that I\u2019d like to actually put to the House, and this might also assist the member with his understanding, is that in South Australia we have Food South Australia. They received a grant to establish a hub in round one. They are explicitly offering to assist all businesses across South Australia. Now, let\u2019s be clear, it is based in a location but it provides support right across South Australia. So I would also like to take the opportunity to point out, Mr Speaker, that this is a competitive grant program. \u201cAll applicants provided evidence of how they met the criteria through a two-stage application process. They were independently assessed. Now, Mr Speaker, I will just finish on this point, and that is for both funding rounds I, as the minister, accepted advice of the committee and their recommendations without change.\u201d Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Does the government agree that it owes all Australians, including Centrelink recipients, a duty of care to behave lawfully? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government of course, in all of its activities, seeks to do those in a lawful manner. That is the responsibility of every citizen let alone every government. And that is what the government will always endeavour to do. Where we have advice and where matters indicate, as has been the case in relation to the use of income averaging as the sole determinant of raising a debt, then obviously government practices change and I just note simply again that this is a practice that has been in place over at least two governments. That elected in 2013 until now and the previous Labor government that applied the same practice. (Again, the Coalition removed the human element of the program. It automated it.) Queensland LNP senator Gerard Rennick continuing to paint himself in glory. At the end of the day, if you can keep a child at home and if you can keep a parent at home, you\u2019re going to halve the congestion on the roads, you\u2019re going to halve the pollution, and you\u2019re going to increase the quality of life for young children and their parents ... Dorothy didn\u2019t tap her shoes together and say: \u2018There\u2019s no place like childcare.\u2019 She said: \u2018There\u2019s no place like home.\u2019 I guarantee you, when people grow up, they don\u2019t pick up the phone and call their childcare guardian from when they were at childcare 20 years ago. They talk to mum and dad. This party will always stand up for the rights of the family and will always try and encourage a bond between the child and the parent. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: Is the government aware how many Australians suffered severe psychological trauma or attempted to take their own life or indeed sadly did take their own life due to the pressure of an unlawful robodebt? Robert: I will again reiterate to members of the House that mental health and suicide are delicate areas and there are many factors that contribute in these circumstances. We all know that talking about suicide and talking about issues of mental health require sensitivity and can I caution the House before jumping to any unfounded conclusions. As I say again, Services Australia runs a very large social network support for people in times of crisis and vulnerability and I could encourage members to point those experiencing issues to those services. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: I refer to the prime minister\u2019s illegal robodebt scheme. Cancer-suffering grandfather Raymond Murphy had to sell his house and move to his shed to afford medical treatment. He said debt collectors ripped him to shreds over a $2,300 robodebt while he was in hospital. Why won\u2019t the government apologise to Mr Murphy and thousands of other Australians ... with their unlawful robodebt scheme? Morrison: I\u2019ll ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. The business of raising and recovering debts on behalf of taxpayers is a difficult job and it deals with Australians in many very sensitive circumstances. Of course I would deeply regret \u2013deeply regret \u2013 any hardship that has been caused to people in the conduct of that activity. The government has many difficult jobs that it has to do dealing with Australians in very sensitive circumstances and that is true particularly at this time. It is our instruction that we would hope that all agents of the government when pursuing the debt recovery option that they would be sensitive to people\u2019s circumstances. And in relation to the particular gentleman that you referred to, that is a very distressing situation that you have raised. I would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations. But the issue is one of ensuring how the government can best do this. Where there are lessons to be learned here they will be learned. That is what the minister for government services is employing now. I will ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. Stuart Robert: I would say to the member, if any member can refer any hardship cases through to me and I will ensure the department looks at it. Mental health and suicide, as we all know, and we all appreciate, are very delicate issues. There are many factors that go into them. Services Australia assess people facing difficult situations every day. We have the largest social services network to support people within federal government departments in times of crisis and vulnerability and we do this everyday. As the prime minister said, the collection of debts is a lawful responsibility of all governments. Right now, just so that colleagues are aware in the House, 939,000 Australians have debts over $5bn that the government lawfully has to collect across a whole range of programs. And governments of all persuasions have done this across the divide. The government has paused all debt collection across all programs as we work our way through the Covid crisis but government will have to restart that debt collection and will do it sensibly and do it engaging all people, do it in a very transparent manner. It is incumbent on us all if we have constituents who are hurting or suffering, bring them through to me. All colleagues know where I am. Give me a buzz and we will seek quickly to help you out with that. Alan Tudge took a dixer, and somehow managed to avoid pointing to a popular TV cooking show as proof Australia is not racist, as well as not once again point out the trope of multicultural Australian\u2019s contribution to food in this country. Probably because it was on city planning, and not multiculturalism, but in this day and age, it\u2019s a feat. Just in case anyone was in doubt that politics was absolutely back as normal, that last part of that answer from Scott Morrison should put that to bed. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister accept responsibility for the illegal robodebt scheme that he created and announced? Morrison: I thank the member for his question. I made reference to this in answers yesterday. The issue of legality goes to one single point and that is the use of income averaging as the sole purpose upon which a debt may be raised for the purposes of reclaiming that debt where money has been made in excess of a beneficiary\u2019s entitlements. Now, Mr Speaker, it is true, as a minister in previous portfolios and indeed as prime minister, I always accept responsibility for the decisions we take and the policies we support and that policy was to use income averaging as a determinant to raise debt. It was the same policy that the Labor party used and would account for some or more than 20% of the debts they raised on exactly the same basis. (For the millionth time, the difference is the Coalition removed the human element from the process.) Morrison: The hypocrisy that is put forward by the Labor party when the legal issue that is involved here is about income averaging as being the basis of raising the debt. Now, my government is not going to make \u2013 is not going to walk back from the idea that when monies have been overpaid, when benefits have been overpaid, then we owe to it taxpayers to ensure that we reclaim those debts. Of course that is what is necessary. Mr Speaker, it has to be done lawfully and where issues of lawfulness are raised in relation to ... income averaging \u2013 I will accept responsibility as prime minister and ministers previous are involved certainly do. The hypocrisy that is put forward by the Labor party is that the very practice that they followed in government, that was continued by our government, they now seek to draw some distinction with. It is not the case. The leader of the opposition in his long six weeks as a member of the expenditure review committee, when he was in government, may not be familiar with how these things work as some of us who have spent a bit more time managing these issues than he has. For someone who has spent such a long time in this place he has a very narrow set of experience. If you want to ask about standing orders or how the parliament works, then this fellow\u2019s your man. When you ask him though when it comes to matters of economic policy and doing the right thing by Australian taxpayers, this leader of the opposition would not have a clue. Labor\u2019s Nita Green has asked a volley of questions to Mathias Cormann about extending jobkeeper, citing remarks from Liberal MP Warren Entsch that there is a \u201cstrong argument\u201d to extend the support (in some sectors). Cormann replied the government will make further decisions after the Treasury review but \u201cthe most important thing\u201d voters in far-north Queensland would like to see \u201c is a removal of state borders\u201d. That sets off shouts of \u201cOPEN THE BORDERS\u201d from the Coalition \u2013 senator James McGrath is certainly the loudest. Penny Wong notes that South Australia has a border ban despite having a Liberal premier, Steven Marshall. Sarah Hanson-Young threw the switch to something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT by asking Corman \u201cdoes art matter\u201d. Cormann: Yes. SHY follows up by asking how many times Scott Morrison has said \u201cart\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d since the coronavirus crisis compared to references to \u201cfooty\u201d. Cormann took it on notice. The third and final question is about whether women\u2019s jobs matter. Cormann replied \u2013 yes \u2013 then quoted statistics about workforce participation from before the coronavirus crisis. Nothing about the gendered impact of the contraction. Jason Clare to Josh Frydenberg: The OECD has specifically called for extra government investment in social housing to protect the economy from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Why is the government ignoring the OECD\u2019s advice on social housing? Frydenberg: The government contributes around $6bn a year for housing assistance \u2013 around $6bn a year, Mr Speaker, for housing assistance. When it comes to social housing and other support we know that under the former treasurer, now prime minister, we established the [national housing infrastructure facility] program which is to help grow the community housing sector. We established the $1bn national housing infrastructure facility. $30m was in the Hobart city deal to build more than 100 social and affordable homes. $78m for domestic violence housing services, Mr Speaker, and $60m to build emergency accommodation and $18m for keeping women safe in their homes program. Now governments at all levels have responsibility when it comes to social housing and this is primarily a state responsibility but the commonwealth continues to invest significantly in social and community housing, particularly through the $1bn NHFIC program, Mr Speaker. Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: The minister for Indigenous Australians said yesterday: \u201cWe\u2019re confident that the Australian people will be able to have their say on an Indigenous voice this year.\u201d When will his government \u2013 your government \u2013 hold a referendum to enshrine a voice to the parliament in the constitution? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the minister for Indigenous Australians and indeed the shadow minister for how they have sought to work together on this issue because it is my personal hope that Australia will reach a point where we could have a consensus where this could be achieved but, Mr Speaker, it has always been my view that I am not interested in seeing issues go forward that may fail and will divide Australians. I want to do things that bring Australians together around this proposition. I hope that we will be able to do that as soon as possible and I can\u2019t say when that will be because we have not arrived at that point and I still think there is quite a journey that we are all on. I want to thank the minister for Indigenous Australians for his commitment, his dedication, his passion and his persistence as he has sought to build consensus on this issue. But we are not there yet and I hope one day we may be. Adam Bandt to Scott Morrison: There have been 437 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the royal commission delivered its final report. Prime minister, if you don\u2019t want Black Lives Matters protests to continue, why don\u2019t you do something about institutionalised racism in this country? Will you agree with the Greens proposal to put action on black deaths in custody on the national meeting this Friday and make it a future item for the future national cabinet meetings and come up with a law so we stop locking up Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at such high rates. Morrison: I thank the member for the question on what is an extremely important issue and that is Indigenous deaths, whether it be in police custody or it be in custody more generally. As the minister for Indigenous Australians pointed out yesterday this is already a matter of significant attention of not just the government but state and territory governments as well. It previously did feature with more specific goals more broadly under justice headings in this area that related to the previous Closing the Gap objectives but as also featuring in the new reform set of Closing the Gap goals which is now coming to agreement for the first time involving the direct involvement of Indigenous peak groups in agreeing what those goals should be. It is also the case that in NSW, for example, we are pleased that there has been progress that has been made in police custody. In NSW there has been one death in police custody, I\u2019m advised, since 2000 and in particular since 2000 when the new arrangements were put in place to provide for access for Indigenous persons who would find themselves in police custody to make those calls and get access to that legal advice. Now the government is now funding that program over the next three years and that has proven to be a very effective mechanism to prevent deaths in police custody. Every death in custody, and particular Indigenous deaths in custody, is an absolute national shame and tragedy and what the minister for Indigenous Australians has been working to do is also to address the contributing factors which find Indigenous Australians in custody. You asked about the agenda of the national cabinet. When I announced the formation of the national cabinet going forward, I also announced the establishment of the national federation reform council. There are only two national taskforces that report to that council; importantly one deals with these very issues in Indigenous affairs, the other one deals with violence against women. We all agreed, premiers, myself, chief ministers, that they were the issues that needed constant national priority and attention by the national federation reform council which brings all the key decision-makers together and for progress to be tracked against the successes that we hope to achieve in that area. So our government is very committed to action in this area. It is an important issue but when it comes to the issue of gatherings and protests, the health advice says it put other Australians\u2019 lives at risk including, in particular, Indigenous lives. And I, I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition would agree with me: \u201cDo not go to those rallies. You are putting others\u2019 lives at risks.\u201d The issue you raise is important and it is understood and acknowledged by all in this chamber \u2013 that is a great reflection on this country. Multi-tasking Scott Morrison style: talking in question time, while tweeting (allegedly). Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister listen to 81% of company directors who want a cautious phasing out of fiscal support such as jobkeeper rather than the government\u2019s hard economic snapback? Morrison: Once again the member for Rankin misrepresents the government\u2019s position and he misrepresents the government\u2019s policies. He seems to be unaware of the broad range of measures that the government has been putting in place, globally recognised, that are providing the necessary economic supports. We have listened carefully right across the economy. Those working, those running businesses, and particularly to those running businesses, that\u2019s why the treasurer announced the extension of the instant asset write-off, a very important measure. It is why the measures that kick in in July that involves further support and stimulus payments in the economy in July will be occurring. It is why one of the first things we did was to ensure that jobseeker would be at a sufficient level ... What the government will continue to do is make decisions about the level of supports we provide into the economy based on the best possible advice and the best reading of the economic situation as that becomes increasingly clear. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing as a cabinet. That is what the expenditure review committee is doing, which is a committee of cabinet that is considering these issues and we are looking at all of those matters extremely carefully. Now that may not suit the convenience of the member for Rankin or indeed the leader of the opposition or anyone else but if they want to work to a political timetable and agenda that is up to them. The government has the important responsibility of calibrating our support for economic lifelines into this country and to ensure they are done in a way that limits the burdens on future generations, that is targeted and comprehensive, that uses the mechanisms that are already in place so as to not risk the sort of waste that we saw when stimulus measures were put in many years ago. We have learned the lessons of Labor\u2019s failures in this area where they, I\u2019m sure, if they had the opportunity to sit on these benches, which I\u2019m sure would put a shudder through the spine of all of Australians if they believed that the Labor party were dealing with this issue right now, it would put a shudder through their spine and they will feel very comfortable that this government is taking a mature and responsible approach to calibrating our economic supports on the best available economic data and not rushing off for a headline, which is what the member for Rankin seems to be only interested in. Michael McCormack takes a dixer, but I just remembered I have a very important appointment staring at a wall, which is just as illuminating. Justine Elliott to Scott Morrison: Prime minister, the government\u2019s been all over the place on how long workers who rely on jobkeeper have guaranteed support or whether they\u2019ll be left behind. Why won\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer to this simple question: will more Australian workers be kicked off jobkeeper early or not? Morrison: The only people talking out of both sides of their mouth when it comes to the issues of the Covid response is the Labor party. They oppose the very measures that they support. Each way on every issue has been the response of the Labor party. Feigning, Mr Speaker, so much support for the government\u2019s response but taking every single opportunity to niggle and undermine for their own political purposes. This is disappointing. That that is the approach that the Labor party has sought to take during this crisis. I am pleased that there are better examples. There are better examples and that has been exhibited by my colleagues who sit around the national cabinet table, the Labor states who sit around that table. I have made it abundantly that jobkeeper is in place for the legislated period we have put in it place, which is until the end of September. That is what we are doing, Mr Speaker. We have been saying that consistently but those opposite have sought to sow confusion and to undermine these positions and the interjection comes about childcare. The interjection comes about childcare. I explained the matter very clearly yesterday. We put in place a better support for workers. Over $700m in direct subsidy support to the childcare sector to support those jobs on top of the rebates, which extend to 95% rebate for childcare fees for persons who are on the jobseeker payment. So Australians know that they are getting the leadership from this government when it comes to the economic policies and lifeline that they need to move through this crisis and as we\u2019ve seen from the OECD that has been recognised. It is recognised across this country, it is recognised internationally, but because of the political motives of the Labor party they just don\u2019t want to see it. The government\u2019s first dixer in Senate question time is to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, asking about how Australia\u2019s economy is faring relative to others in the OECD. Cormann responded by expounding on the OECD\u2019s report about the risk of a second wave, and how it could compound a 5% GDP contraction this year with a further 1.5% downturn. And in the course of answering, Cormann claimed Australians have a responsibility to do everything to avoid a second wave, including a \u201cpatriotic duty not to attend mass rallies\u201d such as the Black Lives Matter protests. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong was disgusted at that answer, reminding him over the despatch box that \u201cpatriotic Australians also want to stop Aboriginal Australians dying\u201d. It is straight into it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Why is the prime minister committed to the hard snapback of jobkeeper in September despite warnings from the OECD about withdrawal of support? Morrison: The government has a review of the jobkeeper program, which is currently under way. As I said it has been conducted and will be concluded in the month of June. The government then will consider the recommendations of that report. These things are not done in haste, Mr Speaker, as I outlined yesterday to the member for Rankin when he put this matter and I made reference that he may not be familiar with those processes of government but you do things in a very considered and careful way when you do these things, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. As I stressed to the leader of the opposition yesterday, jobkeeper, Mr Speaker, is not the only measure of support and I note that the OECD has acknowledged Australia today and the extensive measures that Australia has put in place, comprehensive, right across the board, and recognise at an international level for being of sufficient scale to ensure that Australians have been getting the economic lifeline they need during this crisis. So the government will continue to plan for the many months ahead and indeed the many years ahead. The government\u2019s plans go forward to ensure that we can rebuild the economy, that we can get Australians back into jobs, and we will be using the full suite of measures that have been available to us very early on in the crisis. Indeed, on that very first day when the last meeting of Coag was held, the governor of the Reserve Bank presented to the premiers and myself, as well as the secretary of Treasury, and, Mr Speaker, both of those experts in this area encouraged the government and all the states and territories to ensure that the government did the fiscal heavy lifting as we went through this crisis, and that\u2019s exactly what we have done. We have responded to the crisis in historic levels, unprecedented in this country, which has been giving Australians the confidence that has been building day after day, week after week, Mr Speaker, under the strong economic policies and response of this government. It is the downhill slide to question time. Hold your loved ones close. Treasury has released data on the top 10 postcodes in each state which are most reliant on jobkeeper (as in, the most applications). The top 10: NSW 2000 \u2013 10,290 Vic 3000 \u2013 6,693 NSW 2170 \u2013 3,995 Vic 3029 \u2013 3,681 Qld 4870 \u2013 3,607 Vic 3030 \u2013 3,211 Vic 3175 \u2013 3,211 Qld 4000 \u2013 3,048 SA 5000 \u2013 3,046 NSW 2153 \u2013 2,841 In terms of what resources NSW police will be deploying tomorrow, the officer holding this press conference (I didn\u2019t catch his name and I am not from NSW, so I don\u2019t recognise him) said: We will be well resourced for any eventuality. My colleague Elias Visontay has since informed me it is assistant commissioner Mick Willing I\u2019ve spoken to the diagnostics industry about the federal government\u2019s deal to source $200m Covid-19 tests from Andrew Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation back in April. It is less than impressed about the circumstances of the purchase. You may remember that Minderoo managed to source 10m Chinese-manufactured Covid-19 tests for the Australian government at a crucial time, which the government is paying it back for. But Pathology Technology Australia, the peak group for 90% of the companies supplying diagnostic devices to Australia, says the deal lacked transparency, consultation and brought new testing technology to Australia at a time when it wasn\u2019t really needed. Dean Whiting, the PTA\u2019s chief executive, said: Where we have a problem here was that there was a complete lack of transparency upfront and a complete lack of consultation and discussion with how this would fit within the current laboratory setup that we have in Australia. We had completed and submitted a very detailed audit of the current technology already in Australian laboratories for this kind of testing, and we had determined there was more than enough technology already in the field to significantly ramp up testing. The office of the health minister, Greg Hunt, has defended the deal, saying it was crucial to diversify testing technology and that the Minderoo-sourced tests were being used. A spokesman also said it would have been \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d to consult PTA on procurement. NSW police are also headed to the supreme court to stop a protest planned for the weekend that is for a \u201cdifferent cause\u201d to have it declared unauthorised under the health orders. The difference is police have not received any notification of tomorrow\u2019s BLM protest, which means it can deem it \u201cunauthorised\u201d, while they have received notification of the weekend protest. NSW police say they will be enforcing the current health order at the planned Black Lives Matter protest for tomorrow. Linda Burney spoke to the ABC about the prime minister\u2019s comments this morning about Black Lives Matter protests: The last thing we need at the moment are statements such as [that made by] the prime minister, which are quite contentious and antagonistic. What\u2019s required right now is strong political leadership, an understanding that people are very serious about deaths in custody, and in particular the number of First Nations people [who] have died in custody since the end of the royal commission in 1991. There are ways to deal with this issue, and it is not by being antagonistic. Tanya Plibersek has been talking about this for a while: According to troubling new independent data, the number of people taking up construction trades last year plunged by nearly 12%. This is further proof that the Liberals\u2019 cuts to Tafe created a tradie shortage before coronavirus. Under Scott Morrison, Australia has gone from having a tradie shortage before coronavirus, to having a tradie crisis now. We will need tradies to help Australia recover after coronavirus \u2013 to lift us out of recession \u2013 so why won\u2019t Scott Morrison help save tradies now? Seven years of the Liberals has seen $3bn cut from Tafe and training, widespread skills shortages, and 140,000 apprentices and trainees lost. On top of that, we recently learnt that another 100,000 apprentices and trainees will go this year if Scott Morrison doesn\u2019t do something serious to help. There was a 73% fall in apprentice job ads between January and April this year. The Australian Industry Group says youth unemployment will skyrocket if there isn\u2019t a substantial increase in federal government support. Head of the Australian Council of Social Service, Dr Cassandra Goldie, is talking to the ABC about the need to permanently increase the unemployment payment: Well, I\u2019m urging members of parliament, parliamentarians, to listen deeply and carefully to the communities that they represent. Look, people are telling us now that with the level of payments that are being received, people are spending this money carefully and wisely on desperately needed [things]. That\u2019s what we need in the economy, is people, of course, participating in the economy. The government did the right thing by doubling the rate of the jobseeker payment because we could have confidence that it was going to people who needed additional support and it would be money spent in the economy. You remember those debates about how we support the economy? Well, now more than ever we need to be really disciplined about what we should do here. So listen. The thing that we\u2019re being told is that people are sleeping better because they are not so desperately financially distressed. They are paying for fresh fruit and vegetables and they\u2019ve been able to do that [but couldn\u2019t in the past when] living on $40 a day. They are not having to skip meals that they were routinely having to do before ... For many people, the main game is always going to be about getting back into employment. That\u2019s exactly what we all want to work on. But in order to be able to do that, you\u2019ve got to be able to live with a level of covering the basic costs, and of course housing is a big problem for people. So ... we know the government has to grapple with its reality. We cannot allow so many people to be plunged back down into deep distress. It\u2019s not what the economy needs and socially it would be just devastating. We do need to be honest about our history: Jim Chalmers has responded to the OECD report: \u201cEchoing concerns raised by the Reserve Bank, the IMF, private forecasters and Labor about the rapid withdrawal of support in September, the latest economic outlook noted that: \u2018The authorities should be considering further stimulus that may be needed once existing measures expire at the end of the third quarter 2020\u2019; and \u2018In particular, some income support measures may need to be extended beyond their September expiry date.\u2019 \u201cThe OECD makes it clear that much more needs to be done to support jobs and secure a strong, inclusive and sustainable recovery, including investment in social housing, highlighting a major failure of the government\u2019s HomeBlunder program. \u201cThe less done to protect jobs and support vulnerable workers, business and communities in the coming months, the harder and longer the recovery will be. \u201cThe virus struck an economy experiencing slower investment and the effects of severe drought and catastrophic bushfires, ending a 29-year economic expansion. \u201cHaving introduced support for the economy too narrowly and too slowly, Australians can\u2019t afford for the government to withdraw that support too quickly or too bluntly. \u201cAustralia desperately needs an effective, well-executed response to this crisis, and a plan that bolsters the recovery and sets Australia up for the future. \u201cAustralians have worked together to combat the virus, but more work must be done by the Morrison government to ensure that our hardest-hit Australians are not left out and left behind in the recovery.\u201d The Australian Institute of Company Directors has released a survey of 2,371 of its members about the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. The jobkeeper wage subsidy was identified as the biggest support to business during Covid-19, with 44% nominating it as the biggest support. Small and medium enterprises (47%) and not-for-profits (51%) were the most likely to nominate jobkeeper as the biggest support. 37% said government policy measures had not supported them, and 7% nominated industry-specific packages. Company directors were overwhelmingly (81%) in favour of \u201ca cautious phasing out of government policies, such as the jobkeeper subsidy scheme and coronavirus supplement\u201d, even at the cost of increased government deficits and debt, as opposed to 19% of respondents who would prefer \u201ca rapid wind-down of government policies in order to start to rebuild public finances and restore the economy to normal operation\u201d. There were no new cases of Covid reported in WA in the past 24 hours. Brendan O\u2019Connor held a press conference to talk about this story from David Crowe at the SMH and the Age: The fact is there were eight grants, seven and a half of the grants went into government-held seats, in terms of the money, 90% of the money went into government-held electorates. It beggars belief it is not another politicisation by Scott Morrison just prior to the election. It is clear they have chosen to act in a base political way in order to get a political dividend and this needs to be explained. If there\u2019s another reason, if there is some other reason as to why this has occurred, yet again, because this is the ninth grant process where there has been questions of honesty, integrity, in relation to these matters, then the prime minister should answer those questions, explain himself, not just too to the parliament, not just to the people of Australia but the businesses in all non-government electorates who were deprived opportunities to grow their businesses. \u2019Twas a foggy ole morning in Canberra on Thursday: Michael Gunner, the NT\u2019s chief minister, has announced a tourism voucher for Territorians, to kickstart territory domestic travel: The Territory Labor government has announced the scheme to encourage Territorians to explore their Territory and support local tourism businesses until borders can safely reopen to interstate visitors. More than 26,000 vouchers worth $200 will be available from 1 July, Territory Day, for Territorians to put towards a tourism experience, tour, accommodation, hire car or recreational fishing charter, so long as they match the spend with their own money. The $5.2m initiative is supported by a marketing campaign \u201cNever have I ever \u2026\u201d encouraging people to book something they have never got around to enjoying. It has been developed in partnership with Northern Territory regional tourism organisations, Tourism Top End and Tourism Central Australia. From 1 July, Territorians aged 18 and over will be able to register and redeem their voucher at www.territoryvoucher.nt.gov.au. They can then book online, over the phone or in person through their visitor information centres in Darwin, Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. The vouchers must be used on a bookable product available through the centres. Hospitality venues can also benefit by packaging their offerings with a tourism product such as a \u201cstay and meal\u201d deal. Vouchers are valid for 30 days; bookings and travel must be completed by 31 October. Earlier this year the government injected $2m into an immediate tourism resilience plan to minimise the impact on the tourism industry from the bushfires and the coronavirus pandemic. George Christensen is, of course, an \u201call lives matterer\u201d \u2013 and of course he is all in. Here he was yesterday in the parliament: All lives matter, but during a pandemic mass protests breaching our public health laws could cause lives to be lost. Just days ago, tens of thousands of activists engaged in protests which turned violent, triggered by an event which occurred not here but in the USA. Behind these protests were the extremist Communist party of Australia and antifa, a group that engages in terror tactics. Protesters waved signs saying: \u2018The only good cop is a dead cop.\u2019 Police officers were punched, kicked, spat on and abused, with chants of \u2018Eff the police\u2019. Protesters threw bricks at, bashed and jumped on top of police cars. We don\u2019t need this anti-police, race-baiting violence and division here in our country. What of social distancing restrictions in force to deal with the pandemic? What a slap in the face these protests were to our diggers and veterans who couldn\u2019t attend Anzac Day ceremonies. What disrespect to those in mourning, who couldn\u2019t go to the funerals of loved ones. To think Labor and Greens politicians attended these rallies. To think state Labor governments gave wink-and-nod approvals for the protests to go ahead. I know I speak for the silent majority when I say this race baiting is not welcome here, this violence is not welcome here, and this disrespect for public health and the Australian community is most certainly not welcome here. The Senate has 39 motions in its general business list today. Which is 53 pages worth. We are truly in the worst timeline. Q: The prime minister said today those who do attend another Black Lives Matter protest later in the week should be charged. Do you agree with that sentiment, given that those arrested could also be disproportionately Indigenous? Josh Frydenberg: Well, in terms of protecting Indigenous lives, that\u2019s been an absolute focus for our government through the course of this pandemic. We have put in place lots of different measures to ensure that weekend we could get as much support and as much protection to those communities given their vulnerable vulnerabilities. When people gather for the debates and protests, they need to consider what is the broader impact on the community? We do know it puts people at risk. As to whether charges should be laid that would be a matter for state authorities. Q: You\u2019re a leader, the deputy leader of the Liberal party, should they be charged, in your view? Frydenberg: I absolutely support the measures being taken by our legal authorities in response to those who break the law. How can Josh Frydenberg push to have the borders open now, while also criticising the protests as threatening public health. Is it contradictory? Absolutely not. What we have been absolutely clear about is that people shouldn\u2019t have gathered in those numbers for those rallies. In doing so, they put the broader community\u2019s health at risk. That was the obvious message from the medical experts about those rallies. And it was very unfortunate that they proceeded in the way that that did. Obviously, we\u2019ll wait and see what the health outcomes are in the weeks ahead. The treasurer says the OECD report is not great but Australia is in a good position to once again open again. He is pushing for the borders to be opened. The prime minister and the states are looking at July. We know this. But still. Here we are. As we have success on the health front, we are starting to ease the restrictions, and it\u2019s critically important that we maintain that momentum, that we lift those restrictions on the domestic borders, closed borders cost jobs. There is no clear medical reason as to why those domestic borders should be closed. So, we need to continue to follow the medical advice, but we also need to ease those restrictions that are in place and let Australians get back to work. Queensland gets its own special shout-out. As it always does: We do know the restrictions more generally, if they\u2019re eased, will see about 850,000 people get back to work and more than $9bn added to the economy each month. It depends on various states and the sectors that will benefit. So, take Queensland. They have a $30bn tourism industry. It\u2019s critically important for Queensland, for them to lift those border restrictions to get people in their tourism industry back to work. How Mike Bowers saw the chamber this morning: Victoria has recorded eight new cases of Coronavirus in the last 24 hours \u2013 including someone who went to the Black Lives Matter protest. From the state\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brett Sutton: The case who attended the Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne developed symptoms after attending, but really, within 24 hours. So, it would be very unlikely that it\u2019s been acquired from the protest. Normally, people develop symptoms four to six days after being exposed to coronavirus. As you know, up to 14 days, the incubation period can be, so the time from being exposed to develop symptoms so to develop within 24 hours it would be very unlikely acquired from attending the protest. Nonetheless, because of attendance at the protest, within 24 hours of developing symptoms they were potentially infectious. So the lesson about warning people not to attend applies, the directions in place that limit mass gatherings that limit gatherings of any size to 20 are for a reason. I hope that anyone who has attended that and indeed, across Victoria, who developed symptoms that are compatible with coronavirus, really need to isolate themselves, get tested, get that result back and become well before they get out and about again. Mike Bowers is in the building. And to finish up that 3AW interview came this exchange between Neil Mitchell and Scott Morrison: Mitchell: What was your attitude personally when you were getting all this [Covid] information in the early days? Morrison: Well, I knew we were in completely uncharted waters. Mitchell: Were you frightened by it? Morrison: I don\u2019t know if I put it that way. I was very conscious of the gravity of the situation, and the responsibility that now fell on my shoulders and particularly the shoulders of the premiers as well. And I, you know, I\u2019m interested in history, always have been. And, you know, I knew that during the Spanish flu pandemic of 100 years previous, one of the things that led to so many more lives being lost is the federation didn\u2019t work together, and I knew one of my first responsibilities was going to have to be to keep the country together and make sure the states and territories work together with the commonwealth. And, you know, it hasn\u2019t always gone to plan, but I tell you what, it has been a standout example to the rest of the world about how people can come together and work together. Mitchell: I know you\u2019ll be modest about this but if the optimism is right and if we get it through, through it without significant death rates and with the economy rebuilding and there\u2019s some hope of that \u2013 you will have your place in history. Morrison: That\u2019s for others to judge. All I know is that I learned many years ago from a guy called General Norman Schwarzkopf. When placed in command, take charge. And that\u2019s what that situation required and, and I had the very willing cooperation of my fellow leaders around the country, my cabinet ministers of my own cabinet, an extraordinary job \u2013 Greg Hunt, an extraordinary job Josh [Frydenberg], tremendous job so, look, everyone\u2019s been doing their bit, and it\u2019s everyone\u2019s been doing their bit, that\u2019s where we need to keep doing our bit and not get complacent about it. And so anyone thinking of, you know, going out there this weekend, [protesting] just don\u2019t do it. Josh Frydenberg will be holding a press conference in the next 10 minutes or so \u2013 that will be on the OECD report about a second wave. Queensland has one new case \u2013 a returned traveller in quarantine. So there has been no community transmission in Queensland again today. If you haven\u2019t watched this as yet, you should. But then the next minute, the prime minister wants a date for the states to reopen their borders: Neil Mitchell: The other point of this though is if we do get through the next two or three weeks without a surge, is that an indication that we\u2019re in a pretty good position \u2013 if you can have tens of thousands of people on the streets and you don\u2019t get an outbreak and, god let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t, doesn\u2019t that say well hang on, we\u2019re in a pretty good position we can start easing things even more? It\u2019s sort of an experiment in a sense? Scott Morrison: And not one that was welcomed and a highly risky and dangerous one, and it is certainly our hope that that is the case, but the only reason that would be the case is because so many Australians made sacrifices to ensure that there wasn\u2019t that sort of community transmission occurring that would have made that event, an absolute certainty of causing a second wave. So everyone paid the price in their own businesses, their own lives, their own liberties. And that produced that that that scenario where the risk was clearly a lot lower than it might otherwise been and I\u2019m just saying to people, look, it\u2019s a free country, and we have our liberties, but the price of that liberty is exercising it responsibly and respecting fellow Australians, people who would turn up to a rally this weekend, we\u2019d be showing great disrespect to their neighbours. Mitchell: You want to reopen state borders as quickly as you got the power to make it happen \u2013 if Queensland wants to stay closed they can, can\u2019t they? Scott Morrison: Well, look, I\u2019ve sought to do this, working in concert with people. And that\u2019s been how we have run the national cabinet. I am getting a bit frustrated with it. The steps three process would see interstate borders, interstate travel I should say, happening in July. That was the timetable that was agreed. And so what I would like Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania to do is to nominate the date that those borders will be open in July. Now, I\u2019m not confident, all would do that. Western Australia has made their position pretty clear. But I would be hopeful that the other three states could, as soon as possible nominate a date in July, that borders will be open. Frankly, what is more important now is that they give the certainty of a date because you know hotels have to be provisioned, planes have to be fuelled. They have to be ready to get back in the air and the crews have to be brought back and training has to be done on Covid-safe operating environments and sanitiser needs to be placed in these areas, there\u2019s a lot of work to do. So nominate the date and let\u2019s get on with it. Neil Mitchell: If we hadn\u2019t had those protests would you now be looking at easing things a bit quicker? Scott Morrison: Yes, no doubt, and, and let\u2019s let\u2019s put the $1 figure on it. The OECD has come out and said that a second wave would say Australia\u2019s GDP fall by 6.3%, not 5% \u2013 now that is a $25bn cost to the Australian economy. And this is why, you know, people should \u2013 I think people wanting to take this further this weekend, are showing a great disrespect to their fellow Australians. Mitchell: Should they be charged? Morrison: I think they should. I mean, I really do think they should, because they\u2019ll be kind of a double standard here. I think the issues of last weekend were very difficult, but I think people carrying it on now, it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about pushing people pushing a whole bunch of other barrows now, and it puts others lives and livelihoods at risk. I saw some people say, when they attended this rally, oh, I knew the risk I was taking by attending \u2013 they were talking about themselves, they were talking about the Australians who weren\u2019t there, you know, millions of quiet Australians who have done the right thing. And, you know, they didn\u2019t seem to be that concerned about their health, or their businesses or their jobs. For those who might need a little light relief this morning, either because of what we have been hearing this morning, or just because it is Thursday, the worst day of the week: As expected \u2026 Neil Mitchell: There is a very, sadly high level of Indigenous incarcerations, about 30% compared to 3% of the population, but black deaths in custody, I mean, that\u2019s a furphy isn\u2019t it? I mean since the royal commission as I saw it, there have been fewer Indigenous people per head of the prison population dying in custody than have white people. Scott Morrison: And that is welcome news and initiatives that our government has put in place has contributed to ensuring that that continues to be improved. There are targets specifically, both in in the former and in the new closing the gap targets which address this issue. In my home state, there has been, I understand one death in custody since 2000. Mitchell: It has painted Australia as a racist country \u2013 do you think we are? Morrison: Look, like any country we\u2019ve got to be mindful of it. And that\u2019s why I say, being mindful of this issue is a positive thing I urge people to express this view, not by attending rallies. I mean, if we can stand on the end of their driveways on Anzac Day and remember that those who gave us liberty we can exercise that liberty, I think in a more respectful way to our fellow Australians who have undergone great sacrifices. Alan Tudge has moved to shut down Adam Bandt\u2019s motion. The government has the numbers. He wants a national integrity commission: MEMBER: I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Melbourne from moving the following motion: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) the Senate passed the National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) on 9 September 2019 and the Bill was sent to the House for debate on 10 September 2019; (b) the Government has prevented all attempts to debate and vote on the National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) in the House; (c) the Government ignored a resolution of the Senate on 10 February 2020 calling on the House to vote on the National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2); and (d) in May 2020, the Attorney-General said that legislation to establish a Commonwealth Integrity Commission would be further delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an exposure draft being \u201cready for release\u201d; and (2) calls on the Government to stop blocking debate and vote on this critically important issue; and (3) agrees that government business order of the day no. 49 National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) be called on immediately and passage of the bill through all stages take priority over all other business during periods of government business until its completion. Adam Bandt is now moving to suspend standing orders. Scott \u2018there was no slavery in Australia\u2019 Morrison says he has \u201calways\u201d had an interest in history. Meanwhile in the Senate, Pauline Hanson still struggles to understand the basic concept of how supporting one group does not push back on others. Like, for instance, if you were holding a fundraiser for cancer and I ran through screaming WHAT ABOUT DIABETES?!!!! I\u2019d be a dick. Don\u2019t be a dick. The bells are ringing for the beginning of parliament \u2013 Scott Morrison is still talking to Neil Mitchell. Scott Morrison says he \u201cdoes not feel defensive\u201d about China, because \u201cwe have done nothing to offend the relationship at all\u201d. Gladys Berejiklian says there has been no community transmission in NSW \u2013 so she is announcing a further easing of restrictions: So, from this Saturday, you will be able to welcome 20 people into your home as well as having gatherings outside with 20 people. This is based on the health advice, given the data and how well we\u2019ve been doing. And from Saturday also you will be able to attend food courts in a socially distanced way. Can I say, that whilst we\u2019re easing restrictions on the number of people that can come into your home and the number of people that can gather outdoors and the number of people who can attend food courts, can I make the statements, please do not let your guard down and when you are around vulnerable people, how you treat your loved ones and those with underlying illnesses that can be impacted more heavily with the virus. We cannot forget the virus is still amongst us. Scott Morrison is now calling on all the closed states to nominate the date they will re-open in July. Because he is getting \u201cfrustrated\u201d at the interstate border closures. Sooooooooo I guess he is not too worried about that second wave from the protests then. \u201cPeople who rallied this [past] weekend, showed great disrespect for their neighbours,\u201d Scott Morrison says. \u201cNot surprisingly\u201d \u2013 because if Covid were picked up by anyone during the protests, the tests won\u2019t find it. It is too early. Exciting news for L-Platers \u2013 licence tests are back. From Victoria: Based on advice from Victoria\u2019s Chief Health Officer, learner permit and licence testing including drive tests will progressively resume from Monday 15 June. The first priority under the staged resumption will be to re-book tests for those whose appointments were postponed due to coronavirus restrictions. As part of the resumption, more than 200 new staff will be hired to help work through the postponed appointments as quickly as possible, with testing to resume at all VicRoads testing locations. Six new, temporary licence testing sites will also be established to increase testing capacity, which will commence operation in the coming months. The Chief Health Officer has outlined a range of measures to allow drive testing to commence safely for the workforce and public. This includes appropriate cleaning of vehicles used in tests, proper comprehensive hygiene for applicants, instructors and testing officers and the use disposable seat covers, particularly if the customer is using their own vehicle. No one should be participating in a driving test if they are unwell. Customers with a postponed appointment will be contacted by VicRoads directly to reschedule their test in the order of cancellation. New appointments will be available once the backlog of postponed tests is cleared. Waiting for the prime minister to speak to Neil Mitchell, on Melbourne radio 3AW, the Karens are out in force and they have the call line saved and they are not afraid to hit it. Scott Morrison has called in now. He is very against renaming his electorate \u2013 Cook. Very against it. And on the funerals: Scott Morrison: I\u2019ve always found that this issue on funerals has been the hardest decision that was taken and the most heartbreaking, and of all the letters and, you know, there\u2019s been over 100,000 that I\u2019ve received on so many issues. This has been a very constant one and I do agree. The timing has been complicated, frankly, by these rallies last weekend. We don\u2019t know what the health impact of that is. And while I think people were respectful of the issue that was being raised, broadly, I think the double standards that they allowed themselves to perpetrate by turning up has offended, rightly, I think Australians right across the country. There\u2019s no disagreement about the importance of the issue that they were talking about. But, you know, the way that was done and the suggestion that they might do it again, sort of, I think, risks public support for even the issue they raise. And so I think they need to think carefully about that and again, I say don\u2019t do it and I\u2019m glad that the police in New South Wales and the state government will take a strong approach on that. But on the issue of funerals, I do want to see that go back to normal. I want to see people going back to church and places of worship. I want to see Australia getting back to normal. I want to see planes in the air and we want to see that happen as soon as it can and the health evidence of what\u2019s been happening is all pointing towards that. Ben Fordham: So there\u2019s no reason why the New South Wales government couldn\u2019t double the number of people going to funerals, and that would account for the vast majority of funerals if people were allowed to have 100 immediately. And then you can double it to 200 in a fortnight or whatever and then get back to normal. But this is the only thing that pops up in every email I get \u2013 funerals. Morrison: Oh, look and for me, too. But I would only say this one thing, the rally last weekend is the only legitimate real block to this at the moment, because we actually don\u2019t know right now whether those rallies on the weekend may have caused outbreaks. We actually don\u2019t know at this point and we won\u2019t know, my health advice is for at least another week. And we do know that in other countries where there have been these sorts of rallies, that they have led to those sorts of outbreaks and if there\u2019s, you know, it just puts a massive spanner in the works. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so frustrating. And that\u2019s why I appealed to people before last Saturday. By all means, raise your issue. But by doing this, they have put the whole track back to recovery at risk and certainly any further action on this front would be absolutely unacceptable on any terms because we want to see all this stuff come back in and the funerals for me personally, I mean, we both have lost a parent recently and we were both in a position to have our fathers well remembered and that was incredibly important to us. And it breaks my heart about every funeral story that I hear and I want to see that come back like so many other things. But people going out and going to mass rallies puts that at risk. Just do the right thing by each other. For those questioning what the lead-up to the \u201cno slavery in Australia\u201d comment (which is demonstrably untrue) from the prime minister was, here is the exchange: Ben Fordham: PM, we\u2019ve seen countless statues pulled down around the world because of links to slavery. This is off the back of Black Lives Matter. In London, the mayor is saying that every monument is now up for review and one of the statues in the UK with a question mark now is of Captain James Cook. How do you feel about the removal of these statues? Morrison: Well, when you\u2019re talking about Captain James Cook, in his time he was one of the most enlightened persons on these issues you could imagine. I mean, Australia when it was founded as a settlement, as New South Wales, was on the basis that there\u2019d be no slavery. And while slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was established yes, sure, it was a pretty brutal settlement. My forefathers and foremothers were on the first and second fleets. It was a pretty brutal place, but there was no slavery in Australia. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing with some of these protests, they start on a fair point when they\u2019re raising issues about, you know, people\u2019s treatment in custody or things like that. Fair, fair issue. But now it\u2019s being taken over by other much more politically driven leftwing agendas, which are seeking to take advantage of these opportunities to push their political causes. And, you know, we\u2019ve got to ... I\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve got to be honest about our history. We\u2019ve got to acknowledge the positive and the negative. But, you know, I think we\u2019ve also got to respect our history as well. And this is not a licence for people to just go nuts on this stuff. So this was Mathias Cormann at the Senate Covid-19 committee on Tuesday: Q: So the prime minister\u2019s guarantee that jobkeeper will be there and that people can count on it isn\u2019t really a guarantee at all, is it? Cormann: I completely disagree with that. Again, jobkeeper will be there \u2013 Q: Based on your last answer, where you won\u2019t rule out more people being removed from jobkeeper, what are they counting on? Cormann: I won\u2019t rule out adjustments at the end of a review. I can\u2019t pre-empt or hypothesise \u2013 Q: So people can\u2019t count on it, because at the end of the review there may be adjustments and those adjustments might be people. And this was the prime minister on Sydney radio 2GB just a few minutes ago: Q: Jobkeeper is due to expire in September but there\u2019s a chance it might end earlier for some industries like it will for childcare on July 20. Do we need to be upfront, PM, now, about the fact that some other industries will not have jobkeeper until September as first indicated? Scott Morrison: Well, I don\u2019t know why people are suggesting that. Childcare was a fairly special case because we had moved to that free childcare arrangement. What has been done is that the normal fee arrangements have come back but when working with the childcare sector, when there was a choice between going with ongoing jobkeeper or a 25% subsistence payment to the sector \u2013 so we\u2019re talking about the same amount of support which means more employees will be helped in our consultations \u2013 that was seen as the better way forward. So I think this is a very special case. Jobkeeper is there until the end of September. Q: What about industries other than childcare? Morrison: Well, there are no other sort of special arrangements like we had in childcare so we\u2019ve dealt with that one quite specifically. Q: Will jobkeeper remain until the end of September for everyone else? Morrison: Well, I\u2019ve already said that. So I don\u2019t know what that other speculation is about. That just sounds like Labor making mischief. Q: I thought it was because you guys said it was under review. Morrison: That\u2019s about how you\u2019re implementing the program, that\u2019s a lot of administrative issues and things like that. I mean, the reason we put jobkeeper in place for six months was to provide that confidence and certainty and that\u2019s what it\u2019s done. It is Collingwood v Richmond in the AFL tonight as Australia\u2019s best football league resumes its season. (Go Pies!) The number of deaths in custody has risen since Saturday. Scott Morrison also said the only impediment to loosening restrictions further was the Black Lives Matter protests at the weekend. Authorities are waiting to see if there is an increase in cases in the next two weeks which could be traced back to the protests. The deputy chief medical officer Prof Michael Kidd had a chat to the ABC about that this morning: Well, clearly with the protests, what we saw was very large numbers of people coming together and as we saw from the media reports in many cases people had difficulty maintaining physical distancing from other people and if we had had a person or a number of people with Covid-19 amongst those crowds, then there would have been the risk of significant transmission. Now, we still don\u2019t know if that has occurred or not because, of course, the incubation period for Covid-19 is five to seven days, up to 14 days. So we will only start seeing new cases occurring if that transmission had occurred on the weekend over the days ahead. So, yes, we\u2019re continuing to be very cautious and obviously we need to see what happens over the next few days \u2026 The good news is we have had very low levels of community transmission occurring in Australia. Over the last week, we had 43 new cases diagnosed and two-thirds \u2013 sorry, three-quarters of those have been in people who have come into Australia from overseas and who had been in quarantine. So only a very small number of people with community transmission. Obviously with each of those cases, we\u2019re concerned and the state authorities are moving very quickly to trace the contacts of those people. The OECD is warning of the economic hit of a second wave of coronavirus: This report is from AAP: Australia\u2019s economic output could fall by 6.3% this year if there\u2019s another wave of coronavirus cases, a key global economic body warns. But even without a second wave, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says Australia\u2019s gross domestic product will still fall by 5% this year, with severe and long-lasting consequences. The federal government should consider what support might be needed once the existing measures ends in September, such as strengthening the social safety net and investing in energy efficiency and social housing, the OECD said. Education, training and improving job search programs should be focused on getting unemployment down, it added. Expanded loan guarantees and accelerated insolvency processes could result in a more dynamic recovery, the organisation said in its latest economic outlook. States and territories have begun easing restrictions with no resulting surge in cases, so far. But there\u2019s another week to go before it\u2019s known if the virus spread at mass anti-racism protests across the country last weekend. The government has said it\u2019s unlikely broad restrictions will be applied if there\u2019s another outbreak of cases, and its strategy will focus on local containment areas. The OECD said a second outbreak could be smaller in Australia than elsewhere, due to the nation\u2019s geography and continued restrictions on international travel. The report acknowledged the virus had hit Australia\u2019s economy at a time when investment was already weak and the impact of severe drought and devastating bushfires were being felt. This led to a 0.3% drop in growth in the March quarter, prompting the government to warn Australian is now in a recession given another fall is expected in the June quarter data, due later this year. An economic recovery could be faster if consumer sentiment rapidly rebounded, the OECD said. But a key risk to its outlook is high levels of household debt, as well as a downturn in the housing market. Scott Morrison is speaking to Sydney radio 2GB. That is two weeks in a row. Last week was with Ray Hadley, where he bumped Peter Dutton. This week it\u2019s with Ben Fordham. You\u2019ll be pleased to know that there has been no slavery in Australia, according to the prime minister. Except \u2026 there was slavery in Australia. It\u2019s well documented. We just didn\u2019t call it slavery. For almost 100 years between the 1860s and the 1970s, Indigenous people were taken from their homes and lands to work on sheep and cattle properties across Australia. They were taken with the consent of the state and federal governments. It was very rare that the stolen people were paid for their work. It wasn\u2019t just the land \u2013 Indigenous people were installed in kitchens and homesteads as house staff as well. We like to say that this land was built on the sheep\u2019s back, but anyone with an understanding of Australian history, beyond the \u201cCaptain Cook rah-rah\u201d you may have been taught at school, knows that is not true. You can read more about it here, but you\u2019ll find plenty more sources with not much trouble. Governments have been ordered to pay back wages, for those people still alive. You can call it what you want \u2013 we named it the \u201cProtection Act\u201d for a long time \u2013 but taking people from their homes, forcing them to work and giving them pittance in return is something Australia\u2019s past is just as familiar with as the US. Well, in the last 12 hours, we had a Liberal senator cross the floor and an incredibly passionate demand to take Indigenous issues seriously from a Labor senator who sat on the 1991 royal commission. Parliament is back. In terms of Covid-19, it\u2019s all about the economy now. You saw that yesterday with question time and you\u2019ll see it again with the \u201ccalm and considered\u201d government MPs who seem to be banking on at least another term. Or at least that\u2019s what Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cfive-year plan\u201d seemed to point to yesterday, as he was speaking about the economy. We\u2019ll have that and everything else that happens today. You have the Guardian Canberra crew and the whole brains trust at your disposal. I have only had one coffee, so am now climbing walls. But onwards and upwards! Ready?",

      "bodyText": "The Restaurant Group and the fashion brands Monsoon Accessorize and Quiz have announced plans to close branches and renegotiate rents, putting thousands of jobs at risk, and underlining the impact of the coronavirus shutdown on businesses in the hospitality and retail sectors. The Restaurant Group, which owns the Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and Garfunkel\u2019s restaurant chains, will close a further 125 of its sites as it looks to cut costs and rent, putting 3,000 jobs at risk. The group, which also owns Wagamama and a number of pub and restaurant concessions in airports, had previously announced that some of its branches would not reopen when coronavirus restrictions were lifted. It plans to permanently close 125 locations that are not performing well or have unfavourable lease terms, under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). In addition, it is seeking lower rents and improved terms at a further 85 restaurants. The majority of restaurants to close permanently will be those in the Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s chain. The Wagamama chain and the group\u2019s airport concessions will not be affected by the proposed closures. The Restaurant Group\u2019s chief executive, Andy Hornby, thanked employees for their understanding and commitment, saying: \u201cThe proposed CVA will deliver an appropriately sized estate for our leisure business to ensure we are well positioned despite the very challenging market conditions facing the casual dining sector.\u201d Along with its rivals in the hospitality sector, the group has undergone a turbulent few months, and issued a profit warning in March, shortly after all of its outlets were closed because of the government shutdown. It said at the time that most branches of its Tex-Mex dining chain Chiquito would not reopen, and announced that it would permanently close its 11 Food &amp; Fuel pubs in London, a decision that led to the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. The Monsoon and Accessorize fashion brands have been bought out of administration by their founder, Peter Simon, who has injected \u00a315m into the business in an attempt to save the brands and up to 2,300 jobs. The restructuring specialist FRP Advisory oversaw the sale of the chains in a deal that will permanently close 35 stores and which has made 545 workers redundant. The owner of the businesses, Adena Brands, a company ultimately controlled by Simon, will also seek to renegotiate rents with the landlords of 162 Monsoon Accessorize shops. The company is seeking to save up to 100 of the chains\u2019 230 stores, although both brands continue to trade online. Simon, who began his retail career selling coats from a stall in Portobello Market in London in the 1970s and opened the first Monsoon store in Knightsbridge in 1973, said the business had been his \u201cpassion and life\u201d, adding that he did not want to see it fall victim to the \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d triggered by coronavirus. \u201cBoth Monsoon and Accessorize were trading well before the coronavirus pandemic but the business simply could not withstand the financial impact of having to close all its UK, franchise and joint-venture stores for almost three months,\u201d Simon said. The administration has come less than 12 months after Monsoon Accessorize won support from creditors to close stores and slash rents in a CVA, which was intended to prevent the company\u2019s collapse. In a further hit to the high street, the fashion brand Quiz has announced plans to put its 82 branches in the UK and Ireland into administration before buying them back, allowing it to renegotiate rents with its landlords. Most of the chain\u2019s employees will transfer to the new company, although 93 jobs will be cut. Signet Group, the world\u2019s largest retailer of diamond jewellery and owner of the Ernest Jones and H Samuel chains , also confirmed it would not be reopening 80 of its UK stores after the shutdown.",

He told the BBC: \u201cWe do need to be confident before we make any such announcement that it is the right thing at the right time. We are at the 2-metre point now. That\u2019s what the best available guidance supports. Obviously, we continue to keep this under active review. \u201cWe all recognise how limiting 2 metres is. We are not blind to the very severe challenges it poses, not just for schools but for the wider economy.\u201d Clarke\u2019s comments echo Boris Johnson\u2019s remarks at the previous evening\u2019s No 10 briefing. \u201cAs we drive this disease down, as we get the incidence down, working together, I want to make sure that we keep that 2-metre rule under constant review,\u201d the prime minister said. Johnson is under pressure to act rapidly if he can, with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development predicting that the UK will suffer greater economic damage from coronavirus than any country in the developed world. The Paris-based organisation said there would be an 11.5% fall in GDP in Britain during 2020, greater than in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the US. There is particular worry about the wave of joblessness that is expected when the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, with significant unemployment expected for hospitality workers. The British Beer and Pub Association has said even when pubs in England are able to open again, only one in three will be able to do so, given the 2-metre rule. On Wednesday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, followed a visit to a branch of John Lewis, to promote the reopening of non-essential retail outlets, by indicating strongly to backbench Tory MPs that he wanted the 2-metre rule amended. Sunak reportedly told the 1922 Committee many more pubs could open if the distancing limit was reduced to 1 metre, noting the number of other countries with lower limits.",

      "body": "<p>The nurse who told Marija she was still pregnant thought she was giving her patient good news. She chided Marija, who was seven weeks along, for not starting her vitamins sooner and sent her home.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Marija (not her real name) was devastated. Six days earlier, she had tried to terminate the pregnancy with abortion pills she ordered online. But she had experienced terrible morning sickness throughout her pregnancy, and had thrown up after taking the first of the two pills. She was worried the medication had not had time to work before she vomited. After taking the second pill and bleeding for a few days, she went to the hospital to find out if she had miscarried.</p> <p>Marija could not tell the nurse about the pills. Abortion is illegal in all circumstances in Malta, the only EU country that has a total ban on the procedure with no exceptions for rape, incest, foetal abnormality or the health of the mother. It is also highly taboo in the staunchly Catholic island nation. So Marija listened to the advice about the pregnancy the nurse thought was wanted, went home and booked a flight to the UK.</p> <p>In mid-February, Marjia flew to London to have a surgical abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in Ealing. She travelled alone, staying two nights in a hotel before flying home. The pills had cost \u20ac100. Overall, the trip cost \u20ac1,500, equivalent to a month\u2019s salary for the 34-year-old accountant. She split the fee with her boyfriend.&nbsp;</p> <p>A month later, Marija\u2019s journey would have been all but impossible. Malta officially closed its borders as part of its coronavirus lockdown on 11 March, in effect also shutting any legal route to abortion. Currently, ordering pills online is the only way to terminate a pregnancy on the island, and it is a criminal offence.&nbsp;</p> <p>If Marija had not been able to get out before the borders closed, \u201cI think I would be dead by now\u201d she says \u2013 rendered suicidal by the idea of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I saw that positive test, I was so scared and trapped. You don\u2019t think properly, you don\u2019t have anywhere to go. You\u2019re stuck here.\u201d</p> <p>The Abortion Support Network, a charity that helps people travel from Malta, Gibraltar and Poland to access abortions in countries with more liberal laws, saw a dramatic increase in calls to its hotline when borders closed in March. \u201cThe contacts we are getting are a lot more frantic,\u201d says the network\u2019s founder, Mara Clarke.</p> <p>At the moment, the charity is advising women who are under the 12-week cut-off point for a medical abortion to order abortion pills online from Women on Web and Women Help Women, which distribute the medication worldwide, usually for a donated fee.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are indications that a very small number have been able to leave the island for an abortion during the pandemic, but the overwhelming majority are turning to abortion pills. Women Help Women told the Guardian demand from Malta had tripled since the pandemic began.&nbsp;</p> <p>Malta\u2019s abortion law dates to the British colonial period. Under the criminal code, anyone who seeks or assists with a termination can be sentenced to up to three years in prison. But prosecutions are rare.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis pandemic has cemented how dire the situation is, how desperate women are, how absolutely ugly it is to have a total ban,\u201d says Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer and founder of the Women\u2019s Rights Foundation.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Dimitrijevic and many other activists point out that the travel ban has merely accentuated an existing problem, where legal abortion is only available to those who can afford a flight out of the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe women who would generally travel now have to resort to a situation where they have to purchase pills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to become criminals.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke puts it more bluntly: \u201cNow almost everybody knows what it\u2019s like to be a poor woman living in a country with a bad abortion law.\u201d</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Rights Foundation is part of the first wave of abortion activism ever to take place in Malta and has been joined by a handful of advocates for change, grouped under the collective Voice for Choice which organised Malta\u2019s first ever demonstration against the abortion ban in September last year.</p> <p>Isabel Stabile, the only openly pro-choice gynaecologist in Malta, and a member of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Drs4ChoiceMalta/videos/1553211164832013/\">Doctors for Choice</a>, says she has seen an increase in patients seeking advice about unwanted pregnancies.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of them have had terrible stories, stories on the lines of, \u2018I\u2019ve got a diagnosis of a serious congenital anomaly and the [Maltese] National Health Service won\u2019t do anything about it, because the law is what it is \u2013 can you help me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The well-travelled route from Valletta to London for those needing abortions mirrors the journeys of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/03/why-irelands-battle-over-abortion-is-far-from-over-anti-abortionists\">thousands who had to leave Ireland</a> and Northern Ireland to end unwanted pregnancies before liberalisation in those countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Charmaine (not her real name), who travelled to the UK from Malta to end a pregnancy in 2011, describes her country as \u201clike Ireland on steroids\u201d when it comes to abortion \u2013 \u201cin terms of how small we are, how tight-knit we are, how difficult it is to to leave the country\u201d.</p> <p>Many in the Maltese pro-choice movement point to the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/08/abortion-refusal-death-ireland-hindu-woman\">Savita Halappanavar,</a> who died of septicaemia after doctors in an Irish hospital refused her a termination while she was miscarrying in 2012. There have been close calls in Malta too \u2013&nbsp;in 2014, Canadian holidaymaker <a href=\"https://womenforwomenmalta.com/2019/09/26/welcome-to-womenforwomen/\">Marion Mifsud Mora</a> was refused a termination after her waters broke at 17 weeks\u2019 gestation, and she had to be flown out of the country to end the pregnancy and fight off the ensuing infection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marija has not told anyone except her boyfriend about her abortion. \u201cHere, even if you say the word that you agree with abortion, they look at you sideways,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>No one interviewed for this article who had had an abortion wanted their real name used, mainly because family support would not be available. \u201cIf my father knew I had an abortion \u2026 I\u2019m sure he would disown me,\u201d Charmaine says.</p> <p>Anti-abortion sentiment cuts across Maltese social and economic lines. Even university students are <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/majority-of-university-students-oppose-abortion-study-indicates.705555\">mostly opposed</a> to it. Children are still shown the notorious 1984 anti-abortion film, The Silent Scream, as part of sex education.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d66a00bbe6d3d196e516f2cfb2083453fcbe1d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d66a00bbe6d3d196e516f2cfb2083453fcbe1d5/1352_640_3785_2271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-abortion demonstrators in Malta\u2019s capital Valletta, protesting at the legalising of over-the-counter emergency contraception\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-abortion demonstrators in Malta\u2019s capital, Valletta, protesting at the legalising of over-the-counter emergency contraception.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dimitrijevic says she has had bullets left at her home for her pro-choice stance, and had her car tyres slashed. Mina Tolu, who ran unsuccessfully on a Green party ticket during the 2019 European parliament elections, was hit with a wave of online vitriol after releasing a video which challenged Maltese politicians to discuss abortion. One of the party\u2019s co-founders quit in protest.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot prepare yourself for those comments. I regret not having had a strong enough support network to help me get over the barrage,\u201d Tolu says.</p> <p>But the fault lines have changed over time. Alfred Sant, who served as Malta\u2019s prime minister in the 1990s and is now an MEP, has seen it firsthand.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the government started stocking contraceptive pills in state clinics in the late 70s or early 80s, all hell broke loose,\u201d the veteran politician recalls. \u201cThen a few years ago, the controversy focused on legalising the morning-after pill.\u201d</p> <p>Sant, 72, describes himself as \u201cleaning towards pro-choice\u201d but qualifies that by saying that the issue is \u201cnot a cut and dried one\u201d. He was the only one of Malta\u2019s six MEPs to vote in favour of a <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0148_EN.html\">resolution</a> in March which called on EU member states not to use the pandemic as an excuse to restrict reproductive health services.</p> <p>\u201cIn private, people admit that there\u2019s a hypocrisy to our stance. Politicians, too,\u201d Sant says. \u201cThey know that Maltese are going abroad to get abortions and that there are local doctors who recommend abortions. They admit that there are scenarios when abortion is justified. But they won\u2019t say so publicly.\u201d</p> <p>He believes the public mood is gradually shifting and says it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that abortion will eventually be legalised.</p> <p>But that looks unlikely during this political term. Former prime minister Joseph Muscat, who resigned in January after the scandal surrounding the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, hinted that he would push for a <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/muscat-wants-national-debate-on-abortion.762723\">national debate</a> on abortion in his resignation speech. But his successor, Robert Abela, poured cold water on that notion, <a href=\"https://newsbook.com.mt/en/prime-minister-abela-declares-his-opposition-to-muscat-if-he-intends-working-to-introduce-abortion/\">affirming his anti-abortion</a> stance immediately afterwards. President <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/president-to-speak-at-anti-abortion-manifestation.766645\">George Vella</a>, a former doctor, vehemently opposes legalisation, and has <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/president-to-speak-at-anti-abortion-manifestation.766645\">spoken at anti-abortion rallies</a>.</p> <p>Malta is due to reopen its borders on 1 July. But that does not mean accessing abortion overseas will suddenly be easy. Currently, the list of 17 countries to which travel will be permitted does not include the main destinations for abortions \u2013 the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium.</p>",

You\u2019re stuck here.\u201d The Abortion Support Network, a charity that helps people travel from Malta, Gibraltar and Poland to access abortions in countries with more liberal laws, saw a dramatic increase in calls to its hotline when borders closed in March. \u201cThe contacts we are getting are a lot more frantic,\u201d says the network\u2019s founder, Mara Clarke. At the moment, the charity is advising women who are under the 12-week cut-off point for a medical abortion to order abortion pills online from Women on Web and Women Help Women, which distribute the medication worldwide, usually for a donated fee. There are indications that a very small number have been able to leave the island for an abortion during the pandemic, but the overwhelming majority are turning to abortion pills. Women Help Women told the Guardian demand from Malta had tripled since the pandemic began. Malta\u2019s abortion law dates to the British colonial period. Under the criminal code, anyone who seeks or assists with a termination can be sentenced to up to three years in prison. But prosecutions are rare. \u201cThis pandemic has cemented how dire the situation is, how desperate women are, how absolutely ugly it is to have a total ban,\u201d says Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer and founder of the Women\u2019s Rights Foundation. But Dimitrijevic and many other activists point out that the travel ban has merely accentuated an existing problem, where legal abortion is only available to those who can afford a flight out of the country. \u201cThe women who would generally travel now have to resort to a situation where they have to purchase pills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to become criminals.\u201d Clarke puts it more bluntly: \u201cNow almost everybody knows what it\u2019s like to be a poor woman living in a country with a bad abortion law.\u201d The Women\u2019s Rights Foundation is part of the first wave of abortion activism ever to take place in Malta and has been joined by a handful of advocates for change, grouped under the collective Voice for Choice which organised Malta\u2019s first ever demonstration against the abortion ban in September last year. Isabel Stabile, the only openly pro-choice gynaecologist in Malta, and a member of Doctors for Choice, says she has seen an increase in patients seeking advice about unwanted pregnancies. \u201cThe vast majority of them have had terrible stories, stories on the lines of, \u2018I\u2019ve got a diagnosis of a serious congenital anomaly and the [Maltese] National Health Service won\u2019t do anything about it, because the law is what it is \u2013 can you help me?\u2019\u201d The well-travelled route from Valletta to London for those needing abortions mirrors the journeys of thousands who had to leave Ireland and Northern Ireland to end unwanted pregnancies before liberalisation in those countries. Charmaine (not her real name), who travelled to the UK from Malta to end a pregnancy in 2011, describes her country as \u201clike Ireland on steroids\u201d when it comes to abortion \u2013 \u201cin terms of how small we are, how tight-knit we are, how difficult it is to to leave the country\u201d. Many in the Maltese pro-choice movement point to the case of Savita Halappanavar, who died of septicaemia after doctors in an Irish hospital refused her a termination while she was miscarrying in 2012. There have been close calls in Malta too \u2013 in 2014, Canadian holidaymaker Marion Mifsud Mora was refused a termination after her waters broke at 17 weeks\u2019 gestation, and she had to be flown out of the country to end the pregnancy and fight off the ensuing infection. Marija has not told anyone except her boyfriend about her abortion. \u201cHere, even if you say the word that you agree with abortion, they look at you sideways,\u201d she says. No one interviewed for this article who had had an abortion wanted their real name used, mainly because family support would not be available. \u201cIf my father knew I had an abortion \u2026 I\u2019m sure he would disown me,\u201d Charmaine says. Anti-abortion sentiment cuts across Maltese social and economic lines. Even university students are mostly opposed to it. Children are still shown the notorious 1984 anti-abortion film, The Silent Scream, as part of sex education. Dimitrijevic says she has had bullets left at her home for her pro-choice stance, and had her car tyres slashed. Mina Tolu, who ran unsuccessfully on a Green party ticket during the 2019 European parliament elections, was hit with a wave of online vitriol after releasing a video which challenged Maltese politicians to discuss abortion. One of the party\u2019s co-founders quit in protest. \u201cYou cannot prepare yourself for those comments. I regret not having had a strong enough support network to help me get over the barrage,\u201d Tolu says. But the fault lines have changed over time. Alfred Sant, who served as Malta\u2019s prime minister in the 1990s and is now an MEP, has seen it firsthand. \u201cWhen the government started stocking contraceptive pills in state clinics in the late 70s or early 80s, all hell broke loose,\u201d the veteran politician recalls. \u201cThen a few years ago, the controversy focused on legalising the morning-after pill.\u201d Sant, 72, describes himself as \u201cleaning towards pro-choice\u201d but qualifies that by saying that the issue is \u201cnot a cut and dried one\u201d. He was the only one of Malta\u2019s six MEPs to vote in favour of a resolution in March which called on EU member states not to use the pandemic as an excuse to restrict reproductive health services. \u201cIn private, people admit that there\u2019s a hypocrisy to our stance. Politicians, too,\u201d Sant says. \u201cThey know that Maltese are going abroad to get abortions and that there are local doctors who recommend abortions. They admit that there are scenarios when abortion is justified. But they won\u2019t say so publicly.\u201d He believes the public mood is gradually shifting and says it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that abortion will eventually be legalised. But that looks unlikely during this political term. Former prime minister Joseph Muscat, who resigned in January after the scandal surrounding the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, hinted that he would push for a national debate on abortion in his resignation speech. But his successor, Robert Abela, poured cold water on that notion, affirming his anti-abortion stance immediately afterwards. President George Vella, a former doctor, vehemently opposes legalisation, and has spoken at anti-abortion rallies. Malta is due to reopen its borders on 1 July. But that does not mean accessing abortion overseas will suddenly be easy. Currently, the list of 17 countries to which travel will be permitted does not include the main destinations for abortions \u2013 the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium.",

The state\u2019s chief medical officer, Brett Sutton,<strong> </strong>said the person developed symptoms only 24 hours after the protest meaning \u201cit would be very unlikely that it\u2019s been acquired from the protest\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cNormally, people develop symptoms four to six days after being exposed to coronavirus,\u201d Sutton said.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou and it\u2019s Thursday 11 June. Robodebt apology The prime minister, Scott Morrison, apologised for \u201cany hurt or harm\u201d caused by the government\u2019s robodebt program, which is responsible for more than $1bn in unlawful debts. Further protests New South Wales police applied to the supreme court to stop a second Black Lives Matter protest that is planned for Friday in Sydney and would be in breach of coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings. Scott Morrison also said that protesters who attend should be charged. Morrison also said that Australia had \u201cno history of slavery\u201d, a claim which contradicts parts of the nation\u2019s history. Covid-19 case after Melbourne march A person in Victoria who attended and Black Lives Matter protest last week in Melbourne tested positive for Covid-19. The state\u2019s chief medical officer, Brett Sutton, said the person developed symptoms only 24 hours after the protest meaning \u201cit would be very unlikely that it\u2019s been acquired from the protest\u201d. \u201cNormally, people develop symptoms four to six days after being exposed to coronavirus,\u201d Sutton said. However, he said they were \u201cpotentially infectious\u201d on the day of the rally. Treasurer calls for borders to open The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, pushed for all states to open their borders, telling parliament that \u201cclosed borders cost jobs\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that we maintain that momentum, that we lift those restrictions on the domestic borders,\u201d he said. \u201cClosed borders cost jobs. There is no clear medical reason as to why those domestic borders should be closed.\u201d Travel voucher for the NT The Northern Territory announced a tourism voucher worth $200 will be given to 26,000 Territorians to encourage intrastate travel. The $5.2m initiative is supported by a marketing campaign \u201cNever have I ever \u2026\u201d encouraging people to book something they have never got around to enjoying. Restrictions further eased in NSW The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced that food courts would reopen on Saturday, and that people could have 20 people in their house, and gatherings outside of 20. Gyms and fitness centres were already slated to reopen on Saturday, and community sport will return on 1 July. Union-busting bill dead The government\u2019s \u201cunion-busting\u201d bill is officially dead after the government consented to Labor\u2019s motion to have it removed from the notice paper. Stock market drops The Australian stock market dropped 3%, lodging its worst day in six weeks. It had previously been on a seven-day winning streak.

Claimants in unexpected hardship can defer the repayments for three months.</p> \n<p>Sam Williams, a benefits specialist at Warrington Citizens Advice, said the five-week wait was a \u201creal shock\u201d to claimants: \u201cYou can sense them trying to do the mental maths on whether they can get by until their first payment and even then, if it will be enough for their essential bills and for them to put food on the table for their kids.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe talk people through their options, but taking an advance is something many feel nervous about. Instead I\u2019ve seen people literally scraping by until their first payment: asking family and considering credit cards or other forms of credit from lenders; missing bills; and relying on food banks for support. It can put an enormous strain on people both financially and emotionally.\u201d</p> \n<p>The survey of 500 new claimants found 14% who applied for universal credit since the lockdown were unable to afford food and heating while waiting for a first payment, while one in five (19%) borrowed from family and friends.</p> \n<p>With many more people expected to claim universal credit as the government\u2019s pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">job retention scheme unwinds</a>, the charity is calling on ministers to support claimants by temporarily turning advance loans into a non-repayable grant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said:\u201cUniversal credit has been a hugely important safety net during this crisis, but it\u2019s simply not right that some end up skipping meals, borrowing from family members or falling behind on bills while they wait for money to come through.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has said that it is too complicated to change the payment process for universal credit. Yet tackling this technical challenge is needed to reduce the human cost of the five-week wait.\u201d</p> \n<p>A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWith universal credit no one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available. We recognise this is a difficult time for people on low incomes and we\u2019ve injected more than \u00a36.5bn into the welfare system \u2013 including increasing universal credit by up to \u00a31,040 a year \u2013 to help those in most need.</p> \n<p>\u201cRepayments of advances&nbsp;are made over 12 months and deductions are capped.

The charity said its advisers had helped claimants who had reported skipping meals, relying on hot water bottles for warmth, and selling personal possessions to bring in cash to help them stay afloat during the built-in five-week wait for the payment. About 3 million people have claimed universal credit since March as businesses shed jobs during the lockdown. Citizens Advice estimates that a fifth of UK adults have applied or expect to apply for benefits as a result of coronavirus. Although 1 million recent claimants took out an advance loan from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to see them through the five-week wait, many had refused it, said Citizens Advice, because they would rather \u201cscrape by\u201d than go into debt. Ministers have insisted there is no need to shorten the controversial five-week universal credit wait because of the availability of advance loans of up to 100% of the estimated award, repayable over 12 months. Claimants in unexpected hardship can defer the repayments for three months. Sam Williams, a benefits specialist at Warrington Citizens Advice, said the five-week wait was a \u201creal shock\u201d to claimants: \u201cYou can sense them trying to do the mental maths on whether they can get by until their first payment and even then, if it will be enough for their essential bills and for them to put food on the table for their kids. \u201cWe talk people through their options, but taking an advance is something many feel nervous about. Instead I\u2019ve seen people literally scraping by until their first payment: asking family and considering credit cards or other forms of credit from lenders; missing bills; and relying on food banks for support. It can put an enormous strain on people both financially and emotionally.\u201d The survey of 500 new claimants found 14% who applied for universal credit since the lockdown were unable to afford food and heating while waiting for a first payment, while one in five (19%) borrowed from family and friends. With many more people expected to claim universal credit as the government\u2019s pandemic job retention scheme unwinds, the charity is calling on ministers to support claimants by temporarily turning advance loans into a non-repayable grant. Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said:\u201cUniversal credit has been a hugely important safety net during this crisis, but it\u2019s simply not right that some end up skipping meals, borrowing from family members or falling behind on bills while they wait for money to come through. \u201cThe government has said that it is too complicated to change the payment process for universal credit. Yet tackling this technical challenge is needed to reduce the human cost of the five-week wait.\u201d A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWith universal credit no one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available. We recognise this is a difficult time for people on low incomes and we\u2019ve injected more than \u00a36.5bn into the welfare system \u2013 including increasing universal credit by up to \u00a31,040 a year \u2013 to help those in most need. \u201cRepayments of advances are made over 12 months and deductions are capped. More than 900,000 urgent payments have been made to claimants, landing in their accounts within days of a request, since mid-March.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Imagine</h2> <p>Over these past 11 weeks of lockdown, I have become intimately familiar with the cracked white walls of my flat, stained by remnants of Blu Tack and decked with hastily pasted posters and photo frames. Like any committed TV watcher, the centre of my living space is my television \u2013&nbsp;the welcome object of my focus away from plates piling up in the sink. Once I had rinsed through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/09/the-last-dance-michael-jordan-netflix\">The Last Dance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu\">Normal People</a>, Tiger King and the rest, though, I found myself gravitating to an escapism of a different, more aesthetic kind.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b007ght1/imagine\">Alan Yentob\u2019s Imagine series</a> seems like a daunting undertaking at first glance: hour-long, ponderous documentaries on the biggest personalities in the arts, from Jeff Koons to Marlon Brando and Doris Lessing. It even stretches to the concept of the internet. There are three episodes from its 17-year archive currently on BBC iPlayer \u2013&nbsp;on Lenny Henry, Anish Kapoor and Howard Hodgkin \u2013 and they have become unexpected highlights of my current viewing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c23f67ca39909bf1ee002393ba06f1149d0ffff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c23f67ca39909bf1ee002393ba06f1149d0ffff/0_7_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A reminder of the vibrant creativity that exists around us\u2019 ...

Lenny Henry and Imagine\u2019s Alan Yentob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loriam Reed-Drake/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yentob is a reassuringly calm presence, forever hunched and trailing behind his interviewees, asking suitably vague questions about the meaning and allure of works, while glimpses of Kapoor\u2019s luridly bright sculptures, Henry\u2019s booming laugh, and Hodgkin\u2019s swirling colourscapes have provided much-needed reminders of all the vibrant creativity that exists around us. Hopefully, it is something we will be able to enjoy for real again once we emerge back into some semblance of normality.&nbsp;If nothing else, the programmes have at least inspired me to decorate my flat a little better. <em>Ammar Kalia</em></p> <h2>Devs</h2> <p>Whenever I hear tech bros talk on TV shows, the phrase \u201chacking the mainframe\u201d starts running ticker-tape-style through my brain, drowning out all the actual dialogue. Which is why <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087gj19\">Devs (BBC iPlayer/FX)</a> \u2013 the Silicon Valley-set thriller from Alex Garland (The Beach, Ex Machina) \u2013 wasn\u2019t exactly something I was prepared to clear my schedule for. What I was willing to do was vaguely overhear bits of it as my partner watched in the proper manner \u2013 a style of viewing that meant it took an inordinately long time for me to realise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/05/devs-tv-review-alex-garland\">Devs is less about big computers</a> and more about the big questions.</p> <p>What begins as a whodunnit set amid the shadowy goings-on at Amaya, a technology firm led by a Charles Manson lookalike called Forest (Parks and Rec\u2019s Nick Offerman), swiftly morphs into a) a rough guide to quantum physics, and b) a discussion of determinism so involving it will recolour your entire worldview. Devs does for free will what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/15/inception-review\">Inception did for lucid dreaming</a> and The Truman Show did for your life being a morally dubious reality-TV experiment.</p> <p>It may have taken me a while to get on board, but I won\u2019t forget this stylish, heartrending and compelling show in a hurry. <em>Rachel Aroesti</em></p> <h2>Classic soaps</h2> <p>With lockdown shutting down soap filming and the nation\u2019s favourite serials reduced to a few showings a week, I have found a solution: watching old soap episodes <a href=\"https://www.britbox.co.uk/\">on BritBox</a>. Thanks to the service\u2019s archive system, I\u2019m&nbsp;reliving a plane destroying Emmerdale, seeing Den hand Angie divorce papers on Christmas Day, and crying:&nbsp;\u201cFree the Weatherfield One!\u201d<br><br>If you had asked me six months ago if I would be spending a global pandemic rewatching old episodes of Coronation Street \u2013 I\u2019d say yes, that sounds exactly like something I would do, where can I see them?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77de25f3ed299fdece47ca3d6a8edac7ad12b52b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77de25f3ed299fdece47ca3d6a8edac7ad12b52b/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Some of the biggest moments on British TV\u2019 ...

      "bodyText": "Imagine Over these past 11 weeks of lockdown, I have become intimately familiar with the cracked white walls of my flat, stained by remnants of Blu Tack and decked with hastily pasted posters and photo frames. Like any committed TV watcher, the centre of my living space is my television \u2013 the welcome object of my focus away from plates piling up in the sink. Once I had rinsed through The Last Dance, Normal People, Tiger King and the rest, though, I found myself gravitating to an escapism of a different, more aesthetic kind. Alan Yentob\u2019s Imagine series seems like a daunting undertaking at first glance: hour-long, ponderous documentaries on the biggest personalities in the arts, from Jeff Koons to Marlon Brando and Doris Lessing. It even stretches to the concept of the internet. There are three episodes from its 17-year archive currently on BBC iPlayer \u2013 on Lenny Henry, Anish Kapoor and Howard Hodgkin \u2013 and they have become unexpected highlights of my current viewing. Yentob is a reassuringly calm presence, forever hunched and trailing behind his interviewees, asking suitably vague questions about the meaning and allure of works, while glimpses of Kapoor\u2019s luridly bright sculptures, Henry\u2019s booming laugh, and Hodgkin\u2019s swirling colourscapes have provided much-needed reminders of all the vibrant creativity that exists around us. Hopefully, it is something we will be able to enjoy for real again once we emerge back into some semblance of normality. If nothing else, the programmes have at least inspired me to decorate my flat a little better. Ammar Kalia Devs Whenever I hear tech bros talk on TV shows, the phrase \u201chacking the mainframe\u201d starts running ticker-tape-style through my brain, drowning out all the actual dialogue. Which is why Devs (BBC iPlayer/FX) \u2013 the Silicon Valley-set thriller from Alex Garland (The Beach, Ex Machina) \u2013 wasn\u2019t exactly something I was prepared to clear my schedule for. What I was willing to do was vaguely overhear bits of it as my partner watched in the proper manner \u2013 a style of viewing that meant it took an inordinately long time for me to realise that Devs is less about big computers and more about the big questions. What begins as a whodunnit set amid the shadowy goings-on at Amaya, a technology firm led by a Charles Manson lookalike called Forest (Parks and Rec\u2019s Nick Offerman), swiftly morphs into a) a rough guide to quantum physics, and b) a discussion of determinism so involving it will recolour your entire worldview. Devs does for free will what Inception did for lucid dreaming and The Truman Show did for your life being a morally dubious reality-TV experiment. It may have taken me a while to get on board, but I won\u2019t forget this stylish, heartrending and compelling show in a hurry. Rachel Aroesti Classic soaps With lockdown shutting down soap filming and the nation\u2019s favourite serials reduced to a few showings a week, I have found a solution: watching old soap episodes on BritBox. Thanks to the service\u2019s archive system, I\u2019m reliving a plane destroying Emmerdale, seeing Den hand Angie divorce papers on Christmas Day, and crying: \u201cFree the Weatherfield One!\u201d If you had asked me six months ago if I would be spending a global pandemic rewatching old episodes of Coronation Street \u2013 I\u2019d say yes, that sounds exactly like something I would do, where can I see them? BritBox has been criticised for essentially being no more than a repeats service, but this is why the soap archive works so well. Unlike every other programme that gets frequently reshown, soaps are one-offs, producing some of the biggest moments on British TV, never be shown again. Richard Hillman driving the Platts into the canal isn\u2019t the sort of thing made to only be watched once. My only complaint is that the EastEnders archive is worryingly sparse. Where is the Max and Stacey videotape reveal, or Sharongate\u2019? Don\u2019t hold out on me now, BBC. Frances Ryan Strong Many people have unlocked unknown physical potential by working out during lockdown. My dabbling in calisthenics, however, has brought mixed results: the price of firmer buttocks has been the tragically debilitating onset of stiff knees. Time, then, to participate in vigorous exercise the best way I know, by watching other people do it in leotards on Netflix. I enjoy Ultimate Beastmaster, in which international gym bunnies represent their countries on a big obstacle course, and I\u2019m pumped to watch The Titan Games, which dropped on Netflix last week, is fronted by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, and features ordinary American heroes \u2013 ripped nurses, buff teachers, jacked single dads \u2013 facing off in Gladiators-style contests.

As states and cities across the country continue to reopen, new hotspots of the disease are developing in regions including Texas, Florida and the Southwest, with nine California counties experiencing a rise in infections and hospitalisations. The state has at last cancelled two major music festivals, Coachella and Stagecoach, over concerns about coronavirus. The Guardian asked experts about the likelihood of a second wave. Locking down a week earlier could have saved 20,000 British lives, according to the leading UK epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, who was advising Boris Johnson\u2019s government during the country\u2019s initial outbreak. George Floyd\u2019s brother urges Congress to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 Raw with grief, but giving expression to a community\u2019s collective pain, Philonise Floyd testified before Congress on Wednesday, just a day after his elder brother George had been laid to rest in Houston. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he said.

Stop the pain.

The labor movement is reconsidering its relationship with police unions. The east coast branch of the Writers Guild of America is the first affiliate of the AFL-CIO to call for the removal of the International Union of Police Associations from the labor federation that represents them both. Amazon is banning police use of its facial recognition software, Rekognition, for a year, after a backlash over the company\u2019s ties to law enforcement. The death of Manuel Ellis is being reinvestigated. Ellis, an African American man from Washington state, died in police custody in March. His death has since been ruled a homicide. Will Trump stoke racial tensions with a comeback rally in Tulsa? The Trump campaign is going back out on the road, with the president set to hold his first rally since early March in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next week, despite expert warnings that such mass gatherings could still exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Whether by accident or design, the event also threatens to inflame existing racial tensions, by taking place in a city with a history of racial violence, and on 19 June \u2013 known as Juneteenth \u2013 which is considered the anniversary of the end of slavery in the US. Trump expressed his own reverence for American history on Wednesday, when he tweeted that he would \u201cnot even consider\u201d renaming US military bases named after Confederate military leaders, despite the Pentagon indicating it is open to the idea. Nascar is banning the Confederate flag from tracks over its symbolic links to slavery, in a move made under pressure from the sport\u2019s sole black driver, Bubba Wallace, who is saving a retrograde organisation from itself, writes Andrew Lawrence. Europe\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past \u2013 and racist present In the past, as protests over racial injustice played out across the Atlantic, many in Europe comforted themselves with the notion that \u201cthings are better\u201d there than in the US. But Britain has its own long racist legacy, not to mention a shameful record of black Britons dying in police custody. And, as Gary Younge writes, Europeans\u2019 cultural awareness of American racial violence has allowed many to ignore similar acts of brutality in their own countries.

A group of hackers for hire targeted ExxonMobil critics who were campaigning against the company for withholding information about the climate crisis, according to a report that refers to the hacker group as Dark Basin.

Black doctors, nurses and midwives were exasperated by the failure to protect women.</p> <p>In the United States, too, black and Native American women suffer greater rates of maternal mortality than white women. This is just one of many examples of racial inequality in health.

A UK study published in January showed that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32021472/\">Asian patients with dementia</a> were 14% less likely to be prescribed beneficial anti-dementia drugs than white patients were.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scientists have continued to ask whether there might be deeper genetic factors at play</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t as though nobody has spoken out about this before. Many of us have been shouting for years into what has felt like the void, trying to get professional health bodies and politicians to act on what has always been apparent in the data: that to be black or brown is to see your body suffer disproportionately and you may even die sooner than average. The problem is particularly pronounced in the US. According to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/015.pdf\">research</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the life expectancy gap between black and white Americans has narrowed over time, but still sits at more than three years.</p> <p>Little did we know that it would take a pandemic to finally put the issue of minority-ethnic health at the top of the agenda. Within weeks, data began to show that ethnic minorities in both the US and the UK were clearly bearing the brunt of the virus. As we began clapping for NHS workers, stories emerged in the press of Asian and black doctors dying in surprisingly high numbers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">Ate Wilma Banaag</a>, a nurse at Watford general hospital, died in early April.

Data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in early May suggested that black people in England and Wales at that time were around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">four times more likely</a> than white people to die from Covid-19.</p> <p>The media attention on coronavirus meant these figures couldn\u2019t easily be ignored. But neither should we have been all that surprised. All the factors that have long impacted the health of minorities were inevitably going to play out in the event of a pandemic. When you factor in that London \u2013 which has a <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/regional-ethnic-diversity/latest\">minority white British</a> population \u2013 was hit first, and that many high-risk frontline jobs, particularly in hospitals, are held by BAME people, then the data pretty well matched what anyone should expect. We could have predicted this. There was no great riddle here, no scientific puzzle to be solved.</p> <p>What was really odd was all the head-scratching in the press, even in major scientific journals. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8210941/Mystery-high-risk-black-Asian-Britons.html\">\u201cMystery over high risk to black and Asian Britons</a><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8210941/Mystery-high-risk-black-Asian-Britons.html\">\u201d</a>, ran an online Daily Mail headline. It was as though people had forgotten that racial disparities in health have always existed. A hasty government review into minority-ethnic deaths due to Covid-19, published last week, scrambled to explain in a few weeks what researchers have been documenting for decades. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/key-findings-from-public-health-englands-report-on-covid-19-deaths\">Public Health England report</a> not only failed to tell us anything we didn\u2019t already know, but even fell short of telling us everything we did, including the considerable health impacts of structural discrimination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9541227fbea61c40a749947b233ddda8478fd839\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9541227fbea61c40a749947b233ddda8478fd839/0_0_3146_3500/899.jpg\" alt=\"Composite file photos of some of the BAME healthcare staff who have died during the UK\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic.\" width=\"899\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Composite file photos of some of the BAME healthcare staff who have died during the UK\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, in their desperation to solve the race puzzle they had invented for themselves, scientists have continued to ask whether there might be deeper genetic factors at play. Could it be possible that BAME people have innate qualities that make them more likely to get sick? You know, those horribly faulty black and brown genes? The UK Biobank, a repository of public DNA, is being mined for correlations as I write. Some medical researchers appear to have forgotten that the racial categories we use every day are socially, not genetically, defined. In the US, for instance, a person can have just one ancestor of African origin and still be categorised as black based on their appearance and society\u2019s perception of them. </p> <p>But then, this is what the medical community has always done: pathologise blackness. In the US in the 19th century, as Harvard historian Evelynn Hammonds has documented, a medical condition known as \u201cdrapetomania\u201d was invented by white physician Samuel Cartwright to describe the phenomenon of black slaves running away from their owners. Because how else to explain the errant behaviour of the naturally enslaved? From bone density and skin thickness to susceptibility to pain, doctors have long sought to isolate what is tangibly different about those who society has already oppressed. Despite their persistent failure to find any meaningful differences, they still do it now.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the pandemic has rolled on, many experts have wondered whether vitamin D might be responsible for the gaps we\u2019ve seen. After all, we know that it\u2019s linked to immunity and that it\u2019s harder to get enough of it when you\u2019ve got darker skin and you\u2019re living in a colder climate. Voila! It\u2019s one of those neat explanations that immediately absolves society of all blame for social disparities in health. The reason those with darker skins are dying is that they\u2019ve simply forgotten to take their supplements! </p> <p>A more likely explanation for some of the disparities we see, as people are slowly beginning to acknowledge following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis, lies not in race, but in racism.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tackling racism is just one crucial part of the enormous task of making life fairer for everyone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Racial health inequality has its roots in the same neck-crushing racism as a bigoted thug with a police badge, but it plays out in more subtle ways: in the white flight that created ethnic ghettos, in the inhumanity shown to migrants and refugees, in the difficulties black and Asian people face in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/07/ethnic-minorities-jobs-gap-bame-degrees\">getting good jobs</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/ethnicitypaygapsingreatbritain/2018\">ethnicity pay gaps</a>, in all the little bullets that society fires at you if your skin colour happens to be different. If you want to know how early these bullets begin to be fired, even infant mortality rates are higher in the US among black Americans.</p> <p>Being poor is a crucial social factor when it comes to bad health. The <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492\">life expectancy of women</a> living in the most deprived areas of England is more than seven years lower than that of women living in the least deprived, according to the most recent data published by the ONS. <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492\">For men</a>, the gap is more than nine years.

Having a single parent company would make share-based acquisitions and demergers easier to do, the company said. That flexibility was \u201ceven more important\u201d as the coronavirus pandemic was fomenting an \u201cincreasingly dynamic business environment\u201d, it added.</p> \n<p>The group employs 2,500 people in the Netherlands and 6,000 in the UK. It said the change would have no real impact on the day-to-day running of the business. \u201cThere will be no change to the operations, locations, activities or staffing levels in either the UK or the Netherlands as a result of unification,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The Dutch government, however, was disappointed by the latest review. \u201cWe regret this proposal as we would rather have seen a simplification with a Dutch company at the head,\u201d the economy minister Eric Wiebes told parliament. \u201cBut at the same time we understand that this simplification has no consequences for Dutch operations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unilever said it had engaged with the Dutch government ahead of the announcement and confirmed its foods and refreshment business, which is around 40% of sales, will remain based in Rotterdam.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today&nbsp;email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden&nbsp;email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>British investors had objected to Unilever shifting its domicile to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands\">Netherlands</a> because they feared it would result in the company being ejected from the FTSE 100.

      "bodyText": "Unilever has picked London as its home in an about-face on the company\u2019s 2018 decision to \u201cgo Dutch\u201d which was abandoned after a revolt by British shareholders. Despite a fresh internal review at the consumer goods group that this time selected London rather than Rotterdam as the location of its headquarters, the Unilever chairman, Nils Andersen, insisted it was not a flip-flop but a pragmatic way to complete an overdue overhaul of its unwieldy corporate structure. \u201cThis is in no way a 180-degree turn,\u201d said Andersen, who took over as chairman at the end of 2019. \u201cWe are doing the same thing which is getting the unification through and getting a simpler and more strategically flexible company out of the other end.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is absolutely no change in direction but a little bit of a change in where we land, but for the company it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d The company\u2019s dual structure is a hangover from Unilever\u2019s formation through the merger of a Dutch margarine producer and a British soapmaker 91 years ago. The climbdown in 2018 represented a major blow to the credibility of the then top team \u2013 chairman Marijn Dekkers and chief executive Paul Polman, both Dutchmen who had lobbied hard for a relocation that they insisted was not linked to Brexit. Polman stepped down at the end of 2018 and was succeeded by Alan Jope, a Scotsman. The business secretary, Alok Sharma welcomed the Unilever plan, tweeting: \u201cDelighted to see Unilever\u2019s proposals to become a fully incorporated UK company \u2013 a clear vote of confidence in the UK.\u201d Unilever, which owns more than 400 brands including Marmite, Cif and Dove, has always refuted that Brexit played any part in its thinking. Having a single parent company would make share-based acquisitions and demergers easier to do, the company said. That flexibility was \u201ceven more important\u201d as the coronavirus pandemic was fomenting an \u201cincreasingly dynamic business environment\u201d, it added. The group employs 2,500 people in the Netherlands and 6,000 in the UK. It said the change would have no real impact on the day-to-day running of the business. \u201cThere will be no change to the operations, locations, activities or staffing levels in either the UK or the Netherlands as a result of unification,\u201d it said in a statement. The Dutch government, however, was disappointed by the latest review. \u201cWe regret this proposal as we would rather have seen a simplification with a Dutch company at the head,\u201d the economy minister Eric Wiebes told parliament. \u201cBut at the same time we understand that this simplification has no consequences for Dutch operations.\u201d Unilever said it had engaged with the Dutch government ahead of the announcement and confirmed its foods and refreshment business, which is around 40% of sales, will remain based in Rotterdam. British investors had objected to Unilever shifting its domicile to the Netherlands because they feared it would result in the company being ejected from the FTSE 100. That would have forced funds that track the FTSE 100, and funds that buy only UK stocks, to sell their shares. If shareholders back the new plan, Unilever\u2019s Dutch entity will be merged into its UK arm with Dutch investors receiving one Unilever plc share for each Unilever NV share they hold. The company will retain listings in London, Amsterdam and New York. Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said: \u201cThis is a positive move for investors as it simplifies the structure and removes the danger of the shares leaving the FTSE 100 index. It should make any demerger of the company\u2019s tea business easier if that goes ahead and Unilever clearly expects opportunities to arise from the current economic situation so speed of action could be important.\u201d",

For residents with dementia, that can pose problems. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s very, very confusing,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cIt\u2019s like explaining to a small child what social distancing means; it just won\u2019t happen.\u201d One resident found it very hard to understand why her family was sitting 5 metres away from her, with face masks on, so she picked up her walking frame, repeatedly moving towards them. The resident was persuaded to keep apart with \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d. Anderson decided to lock Eskgreen down a week before Mother\u2019s Day and the UK-wide announcement on 23 March. The residents adapted to the new regime and were content at first. The home used its Facebook page and smartphones to share stories and set up video calls to help maintain family contact. But the long lockdown has had an effect, particularly for those residents spending long periods in their rooms alone. \u201cTheir mental health is impacted by feeling isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to engage people with their families as much as possible, but it has been really difficult. The general mood has lifted now because it looks like we\u2019re nearing the end of the tunnel, but it was quite dark for a while.\u201d",

UK governments must now urgently commit to measures to address the backlog, including the allocation of the staffing and resources needed to deliver the safest possible care.\u201d Cancer Research UK said the figures showed that Covid-19 had had a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on cancer patients and led to delays in care for tens of thousands of patients. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to see the impact that Covid-19 is having on cancer patients and these figures show just how much the virus has affected cancer waiting times,\u201d said Sarah Woolnough, the charity\u2019s executive director of policy and information. \u201cThe dramatic fall in the number of urgent referrals, down 60% compared to the same time last year, and the drop in people receiving treatment on time in April is hugely concerning. It means that tens of thousands of patients are in a backlog needing vital cancer care.\u201d She welcomed NHS England\u2019s creation of \u201cCovid-free\u201d centres where cancer treatment can happen without fear of patients becoming infected and its use of new ways of helping patients get treated, for example through \u201cchemotherapy buses\u201d in hospital carparks. Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS\u2019s national clinical director for cancer, urged anyone with potential symptoms of cancer to see their GP and get referred for what could be life-saving diagnostic tests. The 60% drop in GP referrals shows \u201cthat many people have put off seeing their GP for possible symptoms due to fear of catching the virus or not wanting to burden staff. \u201cLives are saved if more people are referred for checks. So my message to anyone who has a worrying symptom is: the NHS is here for you and can provide safe checks and treatment if you need it, so please help us help you, and get in touch with your local GP like you usually would,\u201d he said.",

Stock markets around the world have seen steep selloffs as investors rein in their optimism after the Federal Reserve poured cold water on their hopes that a recovery would be quick. The FTSE 100 was on course for a 2.9% fall 90 minutes before the closing bell, and US stocks were showing similar declines. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, the investment bank, said: Last Friday\u2019s jobs report from the BLS reported unemployment at 13.3%, but today\u2019s \u2018insured\u2019 unemployment rate based on continuing claims is at 14.4%. Add in all unemployment benefit recipients \u2013 including those receiving help under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and that\u2019s 29,505,027 people \u2013 and we get 20.3% unemployment. Here are some of the other important developments from today: Oil prices fell steeply as US inventories raised concerns over another supply glut and following the Federal Reserve\u2019s warning over extended economic weakness. Brent crude futures prices fell by 6.8%, or almost $3 per barrel, to $38.89. Job cuts: British Gas owner Centrica will cut 5,000; chemicals company Johnson Matthey will cut 2,500; Business jet maker Bombardier will cut 600 jobs in Belfast. Just Eat Takeaway agreed a deal with US rival GrubHub for $7.3bn, shortly after the former completed its own merger. Unilever said it would combine its UK and Dutch entities into a single London-based PLC.

Rehiring appears to have started. Last week the labor department said the unemployment rate had dipped in May to 13.3% from 14.7% in April \u2013 although officials said difficulty collecting data meant the figure was probably 3% higher.

The Canadian firm, which produces wings for Airbus\u2019s A220 jet in Belfast, is the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland with a workforce of around 3,500. Investors are wary about signs of a potential second wave of Covid-19 cases, even as the world\u2019s largest economy opens up. Texas in particular showed a record number of hospitalisations for Covid-19 this week. Ronald Temple, head of US equity at Lazard Asset Management, said: The US labor market churn continues. Job losses in excess of 1.5m remain extremely high considering the pre-Covid record was 695,000 claims. Fortunately, continuing claims declined by 339,000 implying more people gained employment than lost it. While the worst of the job losses might be behind us, the recent surges in new Covid-19 cases in states such as Texas and Arizona could stall the nascent recovery if not brought under control. The 10th straight drop in initial claims is welcome, but they remain hugely elevate, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: Our preliminary forecast for next week is for flat or slightly higher claims, based on Google search data and partial hard numbers from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that May\u2019s payroll increase was a one-time fluke, because claims only measure the pace of gross layoffs, and tell us nothing about the pace of re-hiring of people laid off earlier in the crisis. But markets will not like to see any increase in the claims numbers, which will magnify the uneasiness now being triggered by the second wave of Covid cases, mostly in the South. Over the course of the crisis there have been more than 43m jobless claims. Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian, who warned earlier today that stock markets are getting ahead of the terrible economic data, welcomed the fall in intial and continuing claims. Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari had a somewhat different reaction: An important factor in looking at the latest jobless claims report is how it squares with the non-farm payrolls data which last week showed the US economy added jobs - suggesting a quicker recovery was in the offing and taking pretty much everyone completely off guard. One key thing to keep in mind is that - although a significant improvement, the data on their own are unprecedented before the crisis. More than 1m jobless claims in a week was unheard of since comparable data were first collected in the 1960s. The coronavirus crisis broke the scale. But then again, a recovery is a recovery, and today\u2019s data do appear to show that the economic crisis has peaked (or at least its first wave). Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, a US broker, said: The slight decline in initial jobless claims, following last week\u2019s surprisingly upbeat nonfarm payroll numbers, suggests that the US recovery is slowly getting underway and the underlying economic fundamentals may be more robust than anticipated. If this downward trend continues, it could help support the current market rally, but there are still potential risks to the recovery. The possibility of a second virus wave and ongoing civil unrest, alongside heightened rhetoric around US-China trade relations, may weigh on the confidence of consumers and businesses. The weak data, which suggests the global economy might be in for a long, drawn-out recovery, has also added to the weight on the FTSE 100. It has now lost 3% for the day, or 188 points. The mid-cap FTSE 250 is also down by 3%. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 3.1% and France\u2019s Cac 40 is down by 3.3%. US stock market futures have extended their losses after the jobless reading. Futures for the S&amp;P 500, the US benchmark, are down by 2.6%. Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures point to 3.2% and 1.7% losses respectively when trading opens in about 40 minutes. The number of Americans making continued claims for unemployment fell to 20.9m in the week ending 30 May, down from 21.3m in the prior week, the data showed. The speed of the crisis has been unprecedented in recent history, with initial jobless claims hitting a record 6m in a week at the height of the crisis. Some 1.54m Americans made new unemployment claims in the week ending on 6 June, according to the US Department of Labor, as the toll of the coronavirus crisis mounted further. The reading, which was almost exactly in line with economists\u2019 expectations, suggested the US economy is recovering as claims slowed, but it still portrayed a workforce suffering from a severe recession. The previous week\u2019s* reading was 1.88m. Reaction to follow. *This post has been changed to correct \u201cmonth\u201d to \u201cweek\u201d. The publisher of the Sun and the Times has warned of impending job losses as part of a major cost-cutting programme as the coronavirus pandemic hammers newspaper sales and advertising revenue. Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News UK, has sent an email to staff announcing that the business needed to \u201creset\u201d with the coronavirus hastening the shift towards digital publishing. Newspaper publishers have benefitted from record digital audiences as readers crave news on the coronavirus. However, with businesses shut down and many advertisers keen to steer clear of running promotions around content relating to the pandemic, publishers have seen a significant decline in print sales and advertising revenue. You can read the full report here: The toll of job losses from the pandemic may have only just started, as the pandemic destroys demand in many industries. Almost one in 10 architecture practices fear they will go under in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nearly three-quarters of firms expect profits to fall over the next 12 months, and of those, 8% say that their practice is unlikely to remain viable, according to the latest RIBA Future Trends survey. Current workloads were down 33% in May compared with a year earlier. For the second month in a row, all regions expected workloads to fall in the next three months. But regions were less pessimistic than they were in April, at the height of the pandemic (London, the Midlands &amp; East Anglia recorded the biggest levels of pessimism). Overall, the future workload index rose to -49 after dropping to -82 in April, a record low. The staffing index also improved, by seven points to -30, although it remained in negative territory, indicating further job losses. Adrian Dobson, RIBA\u2019s executive director of professional services, said: The current pandemic and economic uncertainty are clearly continuing to impact both architects\u2019 current workloads and their confidence about the future, with the majority expecting their workloads to decrease in coming months. But while many participants continued to point to the serious recession ahead, some also began to reference glimmers of hope in the form of new enquiries and new commissions. The Fed has also contributed to movements on oil markets. Futures prices for both Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, are down by more than 3% today. One barrel of Brent crude for August delivery will set you back $40.34. The price for WTI was $38.11 just after midday. Prices are well above the lows of April (when US oil futures went negative) but far below the start of the year. The retreat on Thursday came as demand fears came to the fore. US inventories data suggested that there is more oil in storage, while the Federal Reserve\u2019s forecasts showed that the central bank expects anything but a V-shaped economic recovery. Pablo Shah, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: While last Friday\u2019s labour market figures signalled that the nadir of the current crisis has been passed, the Fed\u2019s latest comments reiterate the longstanding economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, pouring cold water on the notion of a V-shaped recovery. CEBR forecasts that the US economy will contract by 6.0% in 2020, with GDP not expected to reach 2019 levels until 2023. Sterling is down by 0.45% against the US dollar at $1.2689 this morning - a move that would end a 10-day winning streak for the pound. The pound briefly broke above $1.28 on Wednesday for the first time since 12 March, after the dovish Fed scotched any hopes of interest rates rising any time soon. (Interest rate increases generally make a currency more attractive relative to others.). However, the pound dropped back on Thursday. The dollar basket, which measures its performance against a broad basket of currencies, is up today, but only after hitting a three-month low. The rush for dollars that characterised the early crisis (and nearly caused a financial crisis to go with the health and economic crises) has now well and truly eased. Another round of big job losses that we missed earlier: chemicals company Johnson Matthey plans to make 2,500 redundancies as it halved its dividend. The company is a major supplier of material for catalytic converters on cars, amid a major fall in vehicle sales prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. The cuts will affect 17% of its total workforce. Johnson Matthey said costs cuts would come from consolidating plants in its clean air division, which accounts for about 60% of sales, and by using better technology to simplify the organisation, Reuters reported. The company said, however, that it would accelerate its growth strategy by investing \u00a3400m in 2021 with a focus on climate change and sustainable technology. Following automotive OEM (original equipment manufacturers)shutdowns earlier in the year, we are now seeing our customers gradually reopen their plants. However, visibility on the path of recovery remains low. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: Johnson Matthey\u2019s decision to cut its dividend \u2013 and in the process end a streak of increases that dates back to the late 1980s \u2013 means that 48 FTSE 100 firms have now announced some kind of reduction to or suspension of payments to shareholders, compared to 47 that have kept or increased them since the start of the year. Advisors for Intu have reportedly asked the company\u2019s bondholders for \u00a312m to keep the shopping centres it owns running through an administration process, according to Sky News. Intu, which owns Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead among 17 UK malls, might not be able to keep running during administration without the injection, Sky News said. KPMG has been lined up to carry out an administration if Intu fails to agree a deal with investors over its debt repayments. Lloyds has been fined \u00a364m by the City watchdog after an investigation found the bank failed treat mortgage customers fairly after they fell into financial difficulty. The fine is linked to Lloyds\u2019 mishandling of over 526,000 mortgage customers between 2011 and 2015, who have since been reimbursed a combined total of \u00a3300m. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said Lloyds had avoided a higher fine of \u00a391m because it had accepted the regulator\u2019s findings. The bank\u2019s \u201csystems and procedures for gathering information from mortgage customers in payment difficulties or arrears resulted in the banks\u2019 call handlers not consistently obtaining adequate information to assess customers\u2019 circumstances and affordability\u201d, the FCA said. Mark Steward, the FCA\u2019s executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: Banks are required to treat customers fairly, even when those customers are in financial difficulties or are having trouble meeting their obligations. By not sufficiently understanding their customers\u2019 circumstances the banks risked treating unfairly more than a quarter of a million customers in mortgage arrears, over several years. In some cases, customers were treated unfairly, including vulnerable customers. Customers should still pay what is owed, but banks are obliged to treat their customers fairly when making new payment arrangements. Firms should take notice of the action we have taken today to ensure that their own treatment of customers meets our expectations.\u201d More than 1m British businesses have furloughed at least one employee, according to data from HM Revenue and Customs that covers up to 31 May. Claims up to that point totalled \u00a317.4bn, HMRC said. The government pays 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500 a month under the scheme. You can see from the below table which sectors were the biggest claimants, with retail leading the way followed by accommodation and food services. There was also a very large number of manufacturing claims, given its relatively small share of the total economy. More than a fifth of normal household spending has been prevented by the lockdown, according to interesting new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In the financial year ending March 2019, UK households spent an average of \u00a3182 per week on activities that have since been largely prevented by government guidelines (such as travel, holidays and meals out). This is equivalent to 22% of a usual weekly budget of \u00a3831, money that households could be saving, spending in other areas or using to cover any loss of income. Britons have been paying back debt at rates unprecedented in recent times - although there is a stark divide between those whose income has not fallen and those who have been badly affected. Figures from the Bank of England show \u00a37.4bn of consumer credit was repaid during the first full month of strict restrictions on business and social life, the largest net repayment since records began in 1993. And the ONS said that younger households, renters and people living in London were the most vulnerable to a fall in income, because they spend the highest proportion on essentials: food and shelter. The ONS has also made a handy interactive graphic showing where the average Briton spends her or his money. (If the below graphic does not function you can try the original post on the ONS website.) The government is clearly happy with the Unilever decision: business secretary Alok Sharma has said it represents a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in the UK. Although given the revolt by major shareholders when Unilever tried to do the reverse move to the Netherlands, it does not appear the company had much choice... There\u2019s a fair bit of Anglo-Dutch stock market action today. Just Eat Takeaway is headquartered in the Netherlands but its Just Eat arm was founded in the UK. Added to that recipe will be a dash of New York, as it acquires GrubHub for \u00a35.8bn. The tie-up will give the Netherlands-based Just Eat Takeaway access to the lucrative food delivery market in the US, writes the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge in her full report. The combined business will be able to serve customers in 25 countries. Along with the US, these include some of the world\u2019s most profitable food delivery markets \u2013 the UK, Netherlands and Belgium. Under the terms of the deal, which will need approval from both sets of shareholders, Grubhub\u2019s shareholders would own 30% of the combined group. You can read the full report here: Italian industrial output was not quite as bad as expected in April, according to data just published - but it still suffered an eye-watering monthly fall. Production in April dropped 19.1% month-on-month, according to the National Institute of Statistics in Italy, better than economists\u2019 expecations of a 24% drop. However, it still points to a massive recession in the Italian economy, which was the first European country to enter a full lockdown. Almost an hour into trading and the mood on European stock exchanges is, if anything, bleaker. The FTSE 100 has lost 2.5% or 158 points to trade at around 6,169 points. There are falls of similar proportions across Europe\u2019s main markets. More UK job losses from this morning: Heathrow Airport has started a voluntary redundancy scheme as it tries to cut costs. Heathrow said that passenger numbers in May were down 97% and it was preparing for further declines due to Britain\u2019s quarantine rule, which means that arrivals in the UK must quarantine for two weeks. The move has triggered a big backlash against the government by the airline industry. Via Reuters: The airport, which has about 7,000 staff, said on Thursday that its employment levels were no longer sustainable and that it had agreed to start voluntary redundancy with unions. \u201cWhile we cannot rule out further job reductions, we will continue to explore options to minimise the number of job losses,\u201d Heathrow Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said in a statement. The majority of the Centrica job losses will come in the second half of 2020 - in another sign of the difficulties facing the economy as government withdraws its furlough scheme that is paying many workers\u2019 wages. That said, Centrica was struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic. The Guardian\u2019s Nils Pratley in April wrote: Everything is going wrong at once. Power usage in the UK has plunged as offices and factories have shut. Bad debts will inevitably rise among small businesses and British Gas consumers. Ominously, Centrica also said it would seek to \u201csimplify terms and conditions\u201d for those UK employees who do not lose their jobs. The company said: Centrica has over 80 different employee contracts, each with multiple variants, with many of the agreements dating back over 35 years. We need to modernise these to enable us to best serve the changing expectations of today\u2019s customers while retaining the quality of our services. Centrica chief executive Chris O\u2019Shea is only three months into the job, having abruptly taken over from Iain Conn as the crisis hit. He said: I believe that our complex business model hinders the delivery of our strategy and inhibits the relentless focus I want to give to our customers. We have great people, strong brands that are trusted by millions and leading market positions, but the harsh reality is that we have lost over half of our earnings in recent years. Now we must bring focus by modernising and simplifying the way we do business. I truly regret that these difficult decisions will have to be made and understand the impact on the colleagues who will leave us. However, the changes we are proposing to make are designed to arrest our decline, allow us to focus on our customers and create a sustainable company. British Gas owner Centrica has said it plans to cut 5,000 jobs as part of a significant management shake-up. Over half of the struggling utility copmany\u2019s cuts will be concentrated in management roles, the company has announced. The company will have fewer customer-facing business units all of which will report directly to the CEO. Three management layers will be removed to create a flatter, less bureaucratic organisation which is closer to, and focused on, the customer. As a result of these changes, around half of the current 40 strong Senior Leadership Team will leave the group by the end of August. More details to come shortly. Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever has decided to simplify its corporate structure and move to a single UK entity - potentially ending a long-running saga that has seen it dragged into the Brexit debate. Unilever, which owns brands such as Marmite, Hellman\u2019s and Magnum, had planned to move its headquarters to the Netherlands two years ago, but backed down after London-based investors revolted. The move would have shunted it off the FTSE 100, a problem for some investment mandates. The formation of the Britain-based parent, Unilever PLC, will be achieved through a cross-border merger between Unilever PLC and Unilever NV, with shareholders of Unilever NV getting one share of Unilever PLC in exchange for each share held. Share listings will be retained in both countries. The Dutch media has its own take that will be painful for its government: Volksrant says the move is a \u201cBlow for Rutte\u201d, the prime minister. The Dutch government had tried to lure Unilever to make Amsterdam its main listing. The FTSE 100 selloff has been worse than feared in the opening minutes: London blue-chip stocks are down by 2.4%. Germany\u2019s Dax index is down by 2.5%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 2.1%. There are losses of more than 2% in Italy and Spain as well. Just Eat Takeaway has announced a takeover deal with US-based rival GrubHub for $7.3bn, in a move that will create the world\u2019s largest fast food delivery service outside of China if completed. The move was a blow to Uber, who had approached GrubHub about a merger with its subsidiary, Uber Eats. However, the deal foundered amid concerns over US regulatory action. Just Eat only completed a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway in January. Just Eat Takeaway shares fell by another 1.7% in early trading in London, having fallen by 13% last night when the talks were first revealed. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Stock market indices around the world have tumbled after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell delivered a pessimistic outlook for economic growth and suggested that it would be a long time before the central bank would be able to withdraw support for the economy. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 2.8%, the broader Topix lost 2.2%, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell by 2%. In mainland China the Shanghia Stock Exchange lost 0.9%. FTSE 100 futures suggest stocks in London could fall by a steep 1.9% at the opening bell, while Germany\u2019s Dax could lose 2.1%. The reality check for markets came after Federal Reserve forecasts showed US GDP shrinking by 6.5% this year (an election year!). The Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting members\u2019 forecasts suggested that interest rates would remain near zero throughout 2022 - a \u201cstrong signal\u201d that it believes the effects of the crisis will be lasting, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid, head of thematic research. He said: The Fed reiterated that it expects to maintain the near-zero fed funds rate until it is confident the economy is on track to achieve the central bank\u2019s dual mandate. [...] Powell reinforced this message with the line that they are not even \u201cthinking about thinking about raising rates.\u201d Despite the crisis, the S&amp;P 500 is still almost at the level it reached at the beginning of the year. In normal times that would indicate that economic prospects were apparently unchanged, a reading that is patently untrue. The Fed\u2019s dovish tone, suggesting the stimulus will keep coming, initially pushed up stocks last night, but eventually the mood soured. Seeing as the Fed made it clear they will be keeping rates close to zero for a few years, US stocks were initially pushed up by the announcement, but the bullish move didn\u2019t last There could be further doses of reality for investors later when the latest US initial unemployment claims come through, showing how many people felt they needed to claim out-of-work benefits. The agenda 9am BST: Italy industrial production (April) 1:30pm BST: US initial jobless claims (week of 6 June)",

      "body": "<p>You might have heard about \u201ceating the rainbow\u201d \u2013 choosing as many different colours of fruit and vegetables as possible to squeeze the most health benefits from them. And if you\u2019ve thought about giving it a go, now is the ideal time to try it, as spring\u2019s beautiful weather means this season\u2019s veg, from bright-red radishes to earthy purple aubergines, are bursting with vibrant colour.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although we\u2019ve become used to the luxury of eating our favourite vegetables year-round, when the veg you pick for your plate is seasonal and locally produced, you know it\u2019s as fresh as possible, has been grown to UK standards, and has a smaller carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s also a way of helping our farmers stay on their feet during a difficult time for food producers everywhere, and reduces the food waste caused by the temporary closure of cafes and restaurants across the UK due to coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next time you fill your basket, consider choosing a vibrant range of veg to add a rainbow to your plate that will offer hope to local producers. And once you\u2019ve taken the vegetables home, here are some great ways to whip them up.</p> <p><strong>Radishes&nbsp;<br></strong>In season from June until October, radishes are the ideal fiery salad staple, adding vibrant pinky-red hues to your plate. For such a diminutive vegetable, they\u2019re highly nutritious, and packed with antioxidants. Pairing well with fennel and rocket, both of which are also in season this month, the radish\u2019s roots in the mustard family give it a peppery bite which has enough flavour to elevate salads out of the ordinary. For extra crunch, soak your radishes in iced water before slicing \u2013 or simply bite into them whole.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Summer squash<br></strong>We tend to turn to squash in colder weather, but summer squashes \u2013 with soft, edible skin in shades of yellow and green \u2013 are ideal for creating dishes well-suited to summer. Less well-known varieties include crookneck and scallop, as well as the more familiar courgette, all light in calories thanks to their high water content, and a great source of vitamin C and fibre. Chilled soup with a swirl of creme fraiche, light pasta with lemon and courgette, and salads sprinkled with feta are all great vehicles for summer squash.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Carrots<br></strong>A staple in every British kitchen, carrots are rarely seen as a seasonal vegetable \u2013 but they\u2019re at their best right now up until the end of September. Treat carrots with care, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with great flavour, as well as some tasty health benefits. Roast baby carrots with honey and tahini yogurt, make them into soups, pasta sauces and patties, or bake them into a carrot cake \u2013 just don\u2019t boil them until they\u2019re limp and lifeless.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c126f44645daade1d15db8b0feabcba085ffbb45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c126f44645daade1d15db8b0feabcba085ffbb45/0_0_3413_5120/667.jpg\" alt=\"Overhead view of halved artichoke\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Globe artichokes can be shaved into salads, barbecued or simmered and served with hollandaise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Winslow Productions/Getty Images/Tetra images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Globe artichoke<br></strong>Artichoke hearts are packed with flavour, loaded with vitamins and minerals, and very low-fat \u2013 providing you\u2019re not eating them jarred in oil. Preparing fresh artichoke takes time, but is worth it: strip off the tough outer leaves and slice a thick wedge off the base, remove the stem and scoop out the thistley choke to reveal the white heart in the middle. Once prepped, the globe artichokes can be shaved into salads, barbecued whole, or simmered and served simply with buttery hollandaise.</p> <p><strong>Asparagus<br></strong>Arguably the most British of all vegetables, asparagus\u2019s lease hath all too short a date, famously flourishing from St George\u2019s Day in April into mid June. Tasting of summer itself, the stalks are best eaten unadulterated, steamed with a little butter and a grinding of black pepper, or eaten raw.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Cabbage&nbsp;<br></strong>Regarded by most of us as a winter vegetable, cabbage is actually in season year-round, and is joined in June by more vitamin-packed green leafy goodness in the form of chard, savoy cabbage and spring greens. But rather than automatically thinking of coleslaw, try getting creative with cabbage by shredding it into duck salad, charring chunks with butter as an alternative side dish, or using it to make a zingy kimchi to top eggs, rice and Asian-style burgers.</p> <p><strong>Mangetout<br></strong>Also known as snow or sugar peas, mangetout comes into its own for just three months a year, from June to August. Infinitely snackable and enjoyed by most children, these young garden peas can be thrown into stir fries, shredded into noodle salads, and are especially good eaten raw with all kinds of dips. Keep a fresh bag in your fridge, and you\u2019ll find yourself crunching through them at an alarming rate.</p> <p><strong>Fennel<br></strong>Considered by many to be a superfood thanks to its antioxidant properties, the aniseed notes of fennel can be divisive \u2013 but there are myriad ways of preparing it if you\u2019re a fan. The classic way to serve fennel when it\u2019s in season is shaved into a salad with other crisp, watery vegetables such as cucumber and celery, often topped with dill to accentuate the anise flavour. It\u2019s also a great partner for seafood dishes, such as a light smoked trout salad.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/jun/09/every-day-is-like-friday-why-its-time-to-eat-more-hake-monkfish-and-mackerel\">Every day is like Friday: why it's time to eat more hake, monkfish and mackerel</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Watercress&nbsp;<br></strong>From April until September, watercress is in season in the UK, ready to add a slightly bitter, peppery crunch to salads, wraps and sandwiches, or to be blended with veg and potatoes to make a soup whose vivid green colour makes it particularly popular with children. For such an unassuming leaf, it\u2019s also a nutritional powerhouse, crammed with iron, calcium and vitamins C, A and E.</p> <p><strong>Aubergine<br></strong>Packed with fibre and a great source of vitamins B1 and B6, aubergines are incredibly versatile and a great carrier of flavour.

      "bodyText": "Rohingya leaders have urged Bangladesh to lift an internet ban imposed on a million refugees in the city of Cox\u2019s Bazar, warning that rumours and panic over Covid-19 is deterring people from getting tested. Limits on communication are exacerbating already dire conditions for the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who live in cramped bamboo huts with as many as eight family members to a room, and are dependent on communal taps and toilets. In some areas, basics such as soap are lacking. Aid agencies in the city in south-east Bangladesh, 20 miles from the border with Myanmar, have warned repeatedly that the virus could thrive in the camps and that medical facilities would be unable to cope. As of 10 June, 35 refugees have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization, while three have died. In total, 30 are in quarantine, though it is feared that there are more undetected cases. The outbreak has coincided with flu season, adding to confusion over symptoms, but community members say that people are avoiding going to clinics because they are worried about being moved to isolation facilities. Last week, two people fled quarantine because they believed they would be sent to centres far from their families, according to reports. Many of the Rohingya refugees sheltering in Cox\u2019s Bazar fled to Bangladesh in 2017, following a military crackdown in Myanmar on its minority Muslim population, which the UN has since said was carried out with \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d.

Since the start of the year, many have attempted to flee Cox\u2019s Bazar by embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Malaysia, 1,000 miles away. They have then been left stranded at sea for months as countries respond to the coronavirus pandemic by tightening their borders. This week, 270 refugees were detained by Malaysia after their damaged trawler was intercepted by the country\u2019s coastguard. Separately, another boat carrying hundreds of refugees from Cox\u2019s Bazar was recently intercepted by Bangladesh and escorted to Bhasan Char, a remote silt island, apparently to reduce the risk of bringing the virus into Cox\u2019s Bazar. Some refugees fear they could face the same fate, though the UN\u2019s refugee agency said that 200 beds in severe respiratory infection isolation and treatment centres were available, and that hundreds more were being established.

      "body": "<h2><strong>IT\u2019S IN THE GAME</strong></h2> \n<p>Last weekend, television coverage of the Bundesliga was enhanced by artificial crowd noise that drowned out the squeaky-trainers-in-school-hall soundtrack for a more satisfactory ambience. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it proved an artistic decision that pleased everyone, one way or another: either an aural comfort blanket during unsettling times and a baby step back towards reality, or an opportunity for an iconoclastic hot whine on the old social media disgrace. Thank you, TV sorcerers! What would supporters worldwide, and indeed your severely uninspired Fiver, do without you?</p> \n<p>They\u2019re taking things up a notch on Thursday evening in Spain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/la-liga-restart-preview-silent-seville-derby-kicks-off-spains-new-normal\">as La Liga returns</a> with the&nbsp;<em>Gran Derbi</em>&nbsp;between Sevilla and Real Betis. In normal times, the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n would be filled with over 42,000 excited Andalusians hoping to attain local bragging rights, or at the very least witness a bench-emptying 40-man stramash. But as we\u2019ve known for the best part of 20 years now, these are not normal times. And so top video-game manufacturer EA Sports and some company or other called Vizrt have been drafted in to whip up a delicious computerised lie for the duration of the upcoming 40-day, 110-game festival o\u2019futbol. 1 UP! Ready!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/la-liga-restart-preview-silent-seville-derby-kicks-off-spains-new-normal\">La Liga restart preview: silent Seville derby kicks off Spain's new normal | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This Vizrt lot are in charge of virtually repopulating stadia across the land, filling them with images of fans in home-team colours. The Fiver was sorely disappointed to discover that they\u2019re not the digital arm of a certain Newcastle-based periodical, but a collective of Norwegian whizz-kids who produce real-time digital content. Bah. Our dream firm of Biffa Bacon, Paul Whicker the Tall Vicar, Skinheed, Roger Mellie, Rude Kid and Mrs Maybee and her Crazy Baby will remain unrealised for a while yet.</p> \n<p>As for sonics, the folk behind the Fifa games will plunder their files for some bespoke singing and chanting. Now, none of this is the same as 40,000-odd real people in situ giving it plenty, of course it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s better than sterile silence. And at least the computer-game programmers that football has been forced to go cap-in-hand to are technologically advanced enough to deliver a passable simulacrum of real life. Had this situation arisen during the 1980s, for example, we\u2019d have been tuning into scenes of Andoni Goikoetxea and Diego Maradona high-kicking each other in the throat to the one-channel strain of In the Hall of the Mountain King while desperately trying to avoid capture by a hungry toilet. So however it looks and sounds over the next month, let\u2019s be nice.

      "bodyText": "IT\u2019S IN THE GAME Last weekend, television coverage of the Bundesliga was enhanced by artificial crowd noise that drowned out the squeaky-trainers-in-school-hall soundtrack for a more satisfactory ambience. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it proved an artistic decision that pleased everyone, one way or another: either an aural comfort blanket during unsettling times and a baby step back towards reality, or an opportunity for an iconoclastic hot whine on the old social media disgrace. Thank you, TV sorcerers! What would supporters worldwide, and indeed your severely uninspired Fiver, do without you? They\u2019re taking things up a notch on Thursday evening in Spain, as La Liga returns with the Gran Derbi between Sevilla and Real Betis. In normal times, the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n would be filled with over 42,000 excited Andalusians hoping to attain local bragging rights, or at the very least witness a bench-emptying 40-man stramash. But as we\u2019ve known for the best part of 20 years now, these are not normal times. And so top video-game manufacturer EA Sports and some company or other called Vizrt have been drafted in to whip up a delicious computerised lie for the duration of the upcoming 40-day, 110-game festival o\u2019futbol. 1 UP! Ready! This Vizrt lot are in charge of virtually repopulating stadia across the land, filling them with images of fans in home-team colours. The Fiver was sorely disappointed to discover that they\u2019re not the digital arm of a certain Newcastle-based periodical, but a collective of Norwegian whizz-kids who produce real-time digital content. Bah. Our dream firm of Biffa Bacon, Paul Whicker the Tall Vicar, Skinheed, Roger Mellie, Rude Kid and Mrs Maybee and her Crazy Baby will remain unrealised for a while yet. As for sonics, the folk behind the Fifa games will plunder their files for some bespoke singing and chanting. Now, none of this is the same as 40,000-odd real people in situ giving it plenty, of course it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s better than sterile silence. And at least the computer-game programmers that football has been forced to go cap-in-hand to are technologically advanced enough to deliver a passable simulacrum of real life. Had this situation arisen during the 1980s, for example, we\u2019d have been tuning into scenes of Andoni Goikoetxea and Diego Maradona high-kicking each other in the throat to the one-channel strain of In the Hall of the Mountain King while desperately trying to avoid capture by a hungry toilet. So however it looks and sounds over the next month, let\u2019s be nice. The boffins are trying their best. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE! Join Scott Murray from 9pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Sevilla 2-2 Real Betis. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a journey\u201d \u2013 Martin Braithwaite gets his chat on with Sid Lowe to talk about all things Middlesbrough and Barcelona, plus the years he spent in a wheelchair as a child. RECOMMENDED LISTENING A Football Weekly special: Black Lives Matter, racism in the game and representation in sports media. And Football Weekly Extra will be out soon, too. FIVER LETTERS \u201cEmpty stands at matches (Fiver passim) are a chance to introduce TV audiences to music beyond rough-and-tumble jock jams and Premier League orchestral hits. Pipe in Brian Eno for some peaceful bus-parking, blast Ornette Coleman\u2019s free jazz to lend chaotic tension to a high line, or, in the case of my Spurs, fill the arena with Captain Beefheart so that the field of play contains something more confusing than Serge Aurier\u2019s throw-in technique\u201d \u2013 Seth Kleinschmidt. \u201cRe: the Travis last line of Tuesday\u2019s Fiver, I just wrote to say, here\u2019s your answer\u201d \u2013 P\u00e5l J\u00f8rgen Bakke. \u201cYesterday\u2019s Fiver mentioned the last time Everton beat Liverpool in a league match, 10 years ago. What you didn\u2019t also mention was, that very same day, there was a Football Weekly Live on in the city. I remember Andy Hunter being quite unimpressed with Mr Roy, and a certain Irish contributor wearing quite a challenging shirt. I\u2019d lost my voice shouting when Mikel Arteta scored the second goal so was unable to provide feedback on the shirt at the time.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Premier League shirts will show support for Black Lives Matter and the NHS when games resume next week. Dele Alli has been given a one-match ban and fined \u00a350,000 for an offensive social media post about coronavirus in which he mocked an Asian man. \u201cIt was an extremely poorly judged joke about a virus that has now affected us more than we could ever have imagined,\u201d said the Spurs and England player, who claimed he was \u201cbetrayed\u201d by a friend who sold the video to a newspaper.

      "body": "<p>The house where Jane Austen completed all six of her novels and lived for the last eight years of her life, is at risk of closing before the end of the year due to the financial pressures of lockdown and is launching an appeal to secure its future.</p> <p>Lizzie Dunford, director of Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum, in Chawton, Hampshire, said it receives no regular public funding and is dependent on visitors and supporters. When the doors were closed on 20 March due to the coronavirus pandemic, the museum, which employs 16 staff and has 50 volunteers, lost all its income.</p> <p>Now there is \u201ca very real risk\u201d that the museum will close permanently before the end of 2020, Dunford said, with its collections of first editions, letters and objects owned by the Austen family set to be dispersed and all staff made redundant.</p> <p>\u201cOne hundred per cent of our daily operational costs are covered by face to face visits,\u201d said Dunford, who started as director in April. \u201cThis source of funds has been suddenly and devastatingly switched off.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the museum\u2019s workers are furloughed, with the remaining staff managing an online shop. But the museum is now appealing for emergency funding, with Dunford asking \u201ceveryone worldwide who has ever escaped reality with one of Jane\u2019s sparkling novels to help ensure the survival of the house that saw them first emerge\u201d.</p> <p>Austen moved to the cottage in 1809 with her mother, her sister Cassandra and her friend Martha Lloyd, after her brother Edward inherited the estate at Chawton. There she completed novels including Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Emma, working at a little table by the dining room window. The family remained at the house after her death in 1817, with the cottage split into three homes for staff on the estate in 1845.</p> <p>The Jane Austen Memorial Trust raised funds to buy the house in 1947, and it opened to the public two years later. It now houses letters, first editions and objects relating to the author, including a letter case carved for Austen by her brother Francis, a ring and her writing table.</p> <p>\u201cFor those who visit, the cottage\u2019s every room is filled with intimate associations to this beloved writer,\u201d Dunford said. \u201cThere is no other place surviving so closely associated with her. The only one of her homes open to the public, it is the most treasured Jane Austen site in the world and holds an internationally significant collection of items.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/janeaustenshouse-COVID19appeal\">The museum has set a target of \u00a375,000</a> to ensure its survival during the pandemic, and has already raised more than \u00a313,000.</p> <p>Austen scholar and trustee at the museum Kathryn Sutherland said she was proud to support the appeal at a time when \u201cwindows on alternative lives and ways of being\u201d brought to us by novels, music and plays, were needed more than ever.</p> <p>She said the museum offers \u201ca supplement to our reading, a kind of authentication. This is where she wrote. Readers from all over the world come there to find confirmation of the intimacy of connection that we discover in the books.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d all be the poorer without these special places. We owe it to ourselves to save them,\u201d Sutherland added.</p> <p>Several public figures have rallied to the cause, including historian, broadcaster and curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Lucy Worsley, who urged donations to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lucy_Worsley/status/1252892334745886720\">\u201cthe place where every sentient person\u2019s favourite author finished her six novels\u201d</a>. Actor Samuel West and playwright Laura Wade also called for people to donate, as has gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh, who lives close to the museum. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD1jnJ-YNdw\">In a video</a> made for the museum, he paid tribute to Austen\u2019s ability to create \u201ca world that was real to her which we can now share\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you go to Jane Austen\u2019s house, you feel her presence there, it\u2019s one of those houses that really does have atmosphere,\u201d he said.</p>",

There she completed novels including Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Emma, working at a little table by the dining room window. The family remained at the house after her death in 1817, with the cottage split into three homes for staff on the estate in 1845. The Jane Austen Memorial Trust raised funds to buy the house in 1947, and it opened to the public two years later. It now houses letters, first editions and objects relating to the author, including a letter case carved for Austen by her brother Francis, a ring and her writing table. \u201cFor those who visit, the cottage\u2019s every room is filled with intimate associations to this beloved writer,\u201d Dunford said. \u201cThere is no other place surviving so closely associated with her. The only one of her homes open to the public, it is the most treasured Jane Austen site in the world and holds an internationally significant collection of items.\u201d The museum has set a target of \u00a375,000 to ensure its survival during the pandemic, and has already raised more than \u00a313,000. Austen scholar and trustee at the museum Kathryn Sutherland said she was proud to support the appeal at a time when \u201cwindows on alternative lives and ways of being\u201d brought to us by novels, music and plays, were needed more than ever. She said the museum offers \u201ca supplement to our reading, a kind of authentication. This is where she wrote. Readers from all over the world come there to find confirmation of the intimacy of connection that we discover in the books.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d all be the poorer without these special places. We owe it to ourselves to save them,\u201d Sutherland added. Several public figures have rallied to the cause, including historian, broadcaster and curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Lucy Worsley, who urged donations to \u201cthe place where every sentient person\u2019s favourite author finished her six novels\u201d. Actor Samuel West and playwright Laura Wade also called for people to donate, as has gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh, who lives close to the museum. In a video made for the museum, he paid tribute to Austen\u2019s ability to create \u201ca world that was real to her which we can now share\u201d. \u201cWhen you go to Jane Austen\u2019s house, you feel her presence there, it\u2019s one of those houses that really does have atmosphere,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>We woke up on Tuesday to the sound of drilling, something not heard in New York for three months. The streets are still on the empty side, and everyone is wearing masks, but as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/new-york-reopen-coronavirus-lockdown\">lockdown eased</a> this week \u2013 most shops remained closed, but construction sites reopened \u2013 the city entered a new phase. It should have been hopeful; last week, New York reported its first day with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/new-york-city-reports-first-day-with-no-confirmed-coronavirus-deaths-since-march-11.html\">no deaths</a> from the virus since 11 March. Instead, the slight relaxation of rules brought home how far things still are from normality.</p> <p>There will be anatomies of how we changed during lockdown and whether any of the long-term predictions came to pass. In the short term, however, the experience of re-engaging with the city felt as uncomfortable as blood returning to a deadened limb. At the height of the virus, the sense of urgency ushered in an alternative reality that suspended the need to think much beyond the next day.

      "bodyText": "We woke up on Tuesday to the sound of drilling, something not heard in New York for three months. The streets are still on the empty side, and everyone is wearing masks, but as the lockdown eased this week \u2013 most shops remained closed, but construction sites reopened \u2013 the city entered a new phase. It should have been hopeful; last week, New York reported its first day with no deaths from the virus since 11 March. Instead, the slight relaxation of rules brought home how far things still are from normality. There will be anatomies of how we changed during lockdown and whether any of the long-term predictions came to pass. In the short term, however, the experience of re-engaging with the city felt as uncomfortable as blood returning to a deadened limb. At the height of the virus, the sense of urgency ushered in an alternative reality that suspended the need to think much beyond the next day. Now, with no school until September and the temperate nudging towards 90F this week, there was a feeling of burnout. Everyone talks about the new normal, and here it was: anticipating a second wave, while trying to process what happened during the first. Certain things during this period have become intolerable: lectures from celebrities, particularly those directing us to \u201cbe kind\u201d; unmasked runners; men whose productivity went up during lockdown while their wives scrambled to fit work around the kids.

Perhaps if I\u2019d read The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse at Christmas, I might have loved it. But not now.

(To give an idea to those who haven\u2019t read the book, at one point the boy discovers something better than cake and it is \u2013 of course \u2013 a hug.) Our own lockdown ended absurdly.

      "bodyText": "Reports that Michael Schumacher is to undergo stem cell surgery within days are inaccurate, it is understood. The Schumacher family declined to comment on reports being widely published on Thursday but it is believed they would not consider any such operation during the coronavirus outbreak. Schumacher is still in recovery after a skiing accident in 2013. The seven-times Formula One champion, who was in a coma for six months, is being cared for at home in Switzerland. Reports in the Italian media claimed the stem cell operation would be performed by the French cardiologist Dr Philippe Menasche, who is understood to have operated on Schumacher late last year. A representative of the Schumacher family reiterated their long-held position in declining to comment on private matters or speculation on the former Ferrari driver\u2019s condition. It is understood that while surgery may take place at some point it will not occur while the health risks attached to coronavirus remain. Schumacher, 51, is reported to have muscle atrophy and osteoporosis from being confined to bed for six years. Menasche has pioneered a technique for grafting stem cells on to the heart, replacing damaged cells with healthy ones. The procedure is believed to be safe but there is no evidence it would have any effect on the brain. The neurosurgeon Dr Nicola Acciari noted that stem cell surgery did not guarantee positive results. \u201cThe goal is to regenerate Michael\u2019s nervous system,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the past 20 years, science has made enormous progress with stem cell treatment. But that does not change that we still do not know much about the brain. We are not able to say what the results will be.\u201d The Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, Schumacher\u2019s teammate at Ferrari in 2006, said in May that any recovery would be difficult. \u201cI know how he is, I have information,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing about all this is that we know his situation is not easy.

It\u2019s almost like hearing live music for the first time; a different kind of beauty than you get on a daily walk or a drive to a castle, something vividly real but constantly evaporating into the air.</p> <p>Aside from 25 production staff, there\u2019s almost no one else in the venue for this concert, which is being streamed online as one of the first fully realised gigs since the arrival of coronavirus. Backed solely by her acoustic guitar, Marling plays one set for the UK in the evening and a later one for a US audience. She is recorded in crystal clarity and filmed on three cameras, two of them roving around and approaching her, capturing the changing weather across her face.</p> <p>There have been plenty of free lo-fi performances by stars on Instagram during lockdown, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief\">charity initiatives such as Together at Home</a>, but Marling\u2019s concert is the next step for a live music sector flailing for its previous levels of artistry and revenue: \u00a3900m losses are predicted for this year in the UK. The event is ticketed at \u00a312 or $12 a stream, and while her manager won\u2019t give me exact numbers, he says more than 6,000 have been sold. Michael Chandler, the chief executive of Union Chapel, says events such as this feel like \u201ca glimmer of light\u201d for a shuttered venue that, with two-metre social distancing, could only accommodate 84 of its usual 900 capacity.</p> <p>\u201cI loved it,\u201d Marling says between her sets, relaxed and happy. \u201cI love the weirdness of the intensity of playing live, and that was a totally uninterrupted version of it.

Laura Marling performing in the empty Union Chapel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marling superfan Mitchell Stirling, who watched the livestream at home and has seen her 32 times before, concurs. \u201cLaura\u2019s never one for onstage banter, so you\u2019re not missing out on that kind of thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a strange hinterland between being at an intimate concert and watching a DVD, but it was excellent.\u201d Another fan, Hannah Gallagher, says it was \u201cgorgeous, and the production values were incredible. She doesn\u2019t need to pull out many tricks, and that translated well. Me and my boyfriend WhatsApp-called each other while livestreaming the concert on our laptops; he put his phone up next to him so he could turn to me as if he was standing next to me at a gig, which was really nice.\u201d</p> <p>The livestream\u2019s director, Giorgio Testi, says it is \u201ca dream come true, because you can capture the beauty of the venue and the artist without ruining the experience for people watching in a crowd. My job can become even more creative.\u201d He aimed for \u201csomething extremely cinematic\u201d, using ambitiously long, unbroken shots to help immerse everyone watching at home, and says this approach demands an artist of Marling\u2019s calibre. \u201cIt brings back the importance of being a very good performer, because you can\u2019t hide. Either you can do it, or you shouldn\u2019t show up on stage.\u201d</p> <p>The chat-averse Marling doesn\u2019t acknowledge his cameras\u2019 presence, but says there is potential for other performers to play around with them. \u201cThe ability to think up a persona with that level of intricacy is actually really hard, and that doesn\u2019t come naturally to me, either. My persona, I guess, is holding on to intensity for as long as I possibly can. For other people, it\u2019s more theatrical, and that could be an amazing extra quality to this new normal.\u201d</p> <p>The hope is that this could become an entirely new ticketed format to match the success of livestreamed theatre and opera performances, with the strictures of coronavirus forcing people to embrace the idea. Audiences who live too far from a touring route could get to experience a performer at close quarters, and as Hannah says: \u201cThere was no one putting their phones up and blocking your view; there was guaranteed clarity. And you don\u2019t have annoyances like toilet breaks.\u201d</p> <p>But even if there is scope for experimentation and theatricality, as well as a financial lifeline for venues and artists, something is lost by not having an audience there. It is eerie to watch Marling sing to cameras and empty pews, like a dispatch from a secure bunker to the survivors of an apocalypse outside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a spontaneity to a live audience, they become an energetic force in themselves.

I never look at the audience when I play that song. And at the end, I bend down to touch the tuner, and there\u2019s a row of people right in my face who I\u2019m seeing for the first time. They tend to be women about my age. To look someone in the eye who is having a really intense experience, that has a real effect on me.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like my fanbase are like me, ish; whether they\u2019re male or female, they have a similar emotional landscape. They\u2019re not adoring, they\u2019re connecting. I don\u2019t think people put me on a pedestal, I think they see me as somebody who is articulating something for them that they\u2019ve experienced. I find that quite moving, and overwhelming. Something about being really intensely watched puts you in a different mindset; it is like a fuse being lit.\u201d</p> <p>Something is lost for the audience at home as well. \u201cI did miss the crowd,\u201d Gallagher says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see how people react when a song comes on that they really enjoy. Watching Laura at Glastonbury, it was Nothing Not Nearly; the girls beside me loved it too, and I got really emotional and swept up in it.\u201d Marling\u2019s team tell me plans are afoot for an optional chat function in future streams, but you can never engineer the shared frisson that ripples through a crowd.</p> <p>As well as the management company Marling is signed to, which is planning similar gigs with Sleaford Mods, Jack Garratt and more, there are a huge number of other initiatives trying to conjure that frisson nonetheless. Neo-soul singer Erykah Badu has <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/music/news/erykah-badu-quarantine-concert-livestreams-business-1234582892/\">created her own streaming platform</a>, recently reasoning: \u201cI could directly do business with the people I am serving, it\u2019s a magnificent feeling.\u201d Meanwhile startups such as Maestro, Side Door and Release Party offer ticketed livestream services if you don\u2019t want to build one yourself. With Glastonbury long since cancelled, its Shangri-La area will recreate its cyberpunk raves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/08/glastonbury-to-create-virtual-shangri-la-with-fatboy-slim-and-more\">in a 3D virtual reality setting in July</a>, with sets from Fatboy Slim, Carl Cox and more accessed via computer or smartphone; Tomorrowland, one of the world\u2019s biggest dance festival brands, will attempt something similar the same month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85d00e7009de3cca67edc5e83f83b2e3705dcf82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85d00e7009de3cca67edc5e83f83b2e3705dcf82/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shangri-La at Glastonbury 2019 \u2013 the area will be recreated digitally this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shangri-La at Glastonbury 2019 \u2013 the area will be recreated digitally this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the real world, club promoters have attempted socially distanced raves in forests, drive-ins or with dancers fenced off from one another with hazard tape.

It is, he says, a theatrical trip \u201cthrough the birth contractions of modern music\u201d with blues, ragtime and New Orleans jazz being performed across seven areas in a 30,000-sq ft space, to households of four people socially distanced from other groups. At \u00a3202 for each household, it is pricey, just like one recent socially distanced club night in Germany, which cost \u20ac70 (\u00a363) a ticket. The worry is that live music will become an elite pastime during coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cheap,\u201d admits Wilson. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the only gig in town, and it\u2019s a lot of content for \u00a350 a person; you\u2019ll be seeing 15 to 18 musicians a night in lots of different iterations.\u201d He argues that as lockdown restrictions start to lift, festival promoters should be planning this kind of small-scale, truly live event. \u201cI think congregating a couple of thousand people in a large space in the countryside and marshalling it properly, it doesn\u2019t sound too difficult an operation to me.\u201d</p> <p>Audiences and cash-strapped artists will be eager for that kind of scaled-back operation, as well as livestreams, even if they aren\u2019t a complete replacement for the live scene of old. Marling says lockdown is \u201canxiety-making. A year and a half\u2019s worth of income has gone. And this [livestreaming] won\u2019t solve it, because it\u2019s not totally financially viable; it\u2019s quite a production to put on.\u201d</p> <p>However the finances shake down as this new format finds its feet, Marling\u2019s stunning performance, captured with startling intimacy by Testi and his team, is the perfect proof of concept. As she sings on Daisy, standing in the heart of the empty church: \u201cWoman alone is not a woman undone.\u201d I try to cling on to every upward-fading note, not knowing when I might hear them next.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Beer sales slumped to their lowest level in 20 years in the first three months of the year, as lockdown forced the UK\u2019s 47,000 pubs to shut up shop. Pubs, bars, supermarkets and shops sold 1.5bn pints of beer between January and March, down 7.2% on the same period of 2019 and the worst result since the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) began publishing figures in 2000. The slump was entirely down to the loss of trade at pubs and bars affected by the Covid-19 restrictions that Boris Johnson announced in mid-March. While shops and supermarkets sold slightly more beer than usual during the quarter, the amount sold and consumed in pubs and bars plunged more than 16%, or about 450,000 pints. This was despite the fact that the period only included 10 days in which pubs were forcibly shut due to lockdown restrictions. The industry is likely to suffer much steeper falls when figures for April to June come out, because lockdown has been in place for the entire period. The BBPA said plummeting sales underlined the need for urgent clarity about when pubs will be allowed to reopen. The government sparked confusion earlier this week by hinting that beer gardens could potentially open by 22 June in England, before saying it would stick with its earlier plan that pubs would remain shut until 4 July at the earliest. The trade body said pubs would need at least three weeks to prepare, meaning they would need to be told by 13 June whether a July opening will be possible. \u201cThese stark figures reveal how the lockdown is having a devastating impact on our world-class breweries and pubs,\u201d said BBPA chief executive, Emma McClarkin. \u201cWe are urging the government to get Britain brewing again now and re-open our pubs from 4 July. \u201cTo do this our sector needs at least three weeks notice so that our breweries can brew fresh beer and our pubs can get ready to reopen safely. Our pubs and breweries are desperately in need of this clarity.\u201d Reopening of pubs hinges partly on whether the government reviews physical distancing requirements. If the required distance remains at two metres, only 12,500 \u2013 a third of England\u2019s pubs \u2013 could reopen, comparedwith 75%, or 28,000 of them, at one metre.",

      "body": "<p>Thousands of people lost their lives \u201cprematurely\u201d because care homes in England lacked the protective equipment and financial resources to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, according to council care bosses.</p> <p>In a highly critical report, social care directors say decisions to rapidly discharge many vulnerable patients from NHS hospitals to care homes without first testing them for Covid-19 had \u201ctragic consequences\u201d for residents and staff.</p> <p>In many places, vulnerable people were discharged into care facilities where there was a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) or where it was impossible to isolate them safely, sometimes when they could have returned home, the report says.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, thousands have lost their lives prematurely in social care and were not sufficiently considered as part of wider health and community systems. And normality has not yet returned,\u201d James Bullion, the president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), said in a foreword to the report.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is clear that adult social care was rendered ill-equipped and under-resourced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic by the failure of successive governments of all political colours to recognise and understand how essential social care is.\u201d</p> <p>Care homes could account for half of all Covid-19 deaths in England by the end of June, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/07/more-than-half-of-englands-coronavirus-related-deaths-will-be-people-from-care-homes\">one recent estimate</a>. </p> <p>The rapid discharge of thousands of NHS patients into the care system to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients began in mid-March. It was not until 15 April that the government recommended testing before admission to care homes, and there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/why-did-so-many-people-die-of-covid-19-in-the-uks-care-homes\">widespread criticism</a> of the slow and chaotic rollout of the testing programme.</p> <p>Although the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said in May that the government had thrown a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-care-home-residents-deaths-england-wales\">\u201cprotective ring\u201d</a> around care homes, the report found low levels of confidence among local authorities\u2019 adult social care directors that sufficient testing was available for care home residents, staff and unpaid carers.</p> <p>Bullion said directors were still not confident that testing was comprehensive enough, and PPE supply had only just begun to improve. \u201cSocial care is not out of the woods,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said there had been too much emphasis on protecting the NHS at the expense of care homes, which had been treated as an \u201cafterthought\u201d in the fight against Covid-19. Lack of testing, issues with access to PPE and a lack of policy focus on social care in the early weeks of the pandemic had had \u201ctragic consequences for individuals\u201d.</p> <p>Bullion, the director of adult social care at Norfolk county council, said the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-uk-english-councils-welcome-extra-16bn-support\">\u00a33.2bn bailout of councils</a> to meet the extra costs of the pandemic was inadequate. More emergency cash was needed as well as a new long-term funding settlement to put the system on a sustainable footing, he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cSocial care and its workforce are at the frontline of this unprecedented pandemic which has had a devastating effect on many individuals and families. Every death has been a tragedy.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cAdult social care will continue to get all the support and resources they need to tackle the impacts of the pandemic, with \u00a33.2bn for local authorities to help address pressures on local services, including in adult social care, and \u00a3600m to control infections in care homes.\u201d</p> <p>Liz Kendall, the shadow minister for social care, said: \u201cThese findings expose the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on social care, and the grief and trauma that so many people have been through.&nbsp;The government has been too slow to protect elderly and disabled people and support those who need help most, and&nbsp;Adass is right to say social care must never be exposed like this again.\u201d</p> <p>The Adass report was based on a survey held during May of adult social care directors in 146 of the 151 councils in England with social care responsibilities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people lost their lives \u201cprematurely\u201d because care homes in England lacked the protective equipment and financial resources to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, according to council care bosses. In a highly critical report, social care directors say decisions to rapidly discharge many vulnerable patients from NHS hospitals to care homes without first testing them for Covid-19 had \u201ctragic consequences\u201d for residents and staff. In many places, vulnerable people were discharged into care facilities where there was a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) or where it was impossible to isolate them safely, sometimes when they could have returned home, the report says. \u201cUltimately, thousands have lost their lives prematurely in social care and were not sufficiently considered as part of wider health and community systems. And normality has not yet returned,\u201d James Bullion, the president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), said in a foreword to the report. He added: \u201cIt is clear that adult social care was rendered ill-equipped and under-resourced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic by the failure of successive governments of all political colours to recognise and understand how essential social care is.\u201d Care homes could account for half of all Covid-19 deaths in England by the end of June, according to one recent estimate. The rapid discharge of thousands of NHS patients into the care system to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients began in mid-March. It was not until 15 April that the government recommended testing before admission to care homes, and there has been widespread criticism of the slow and chaotic rollout of the testing programme. Although the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said in May that the government had thrown a \u201cprotective ring\u201d around care homes, the report found low levels of confidence among local authorities\u2019 adult social care directors that sufficient testing was available for care home residents, staff and unpaid carers. Bullion said directors were still not confident that testing was comprehensive enough, and PPE supply had only just begun to improve. \u201cSocial care is not out of the woods,\u201d he said. He said there had been too much emphasis on protecting the NHS at the expense of care homes, which had been treated as an \u201cafterthought\u201d in the fight against Covid-19. Lack of testing, issues with access to PPE and a lack of policy focus on social care in the early weeks of the pandemic had had \u201ctragic consequences for individuals\u201d. Bullion, the director of adult social care at Norfolk county council, said the government\u2019s \u00a33.2bn bailout of councils to meet the extra costs of the pandemic was inadequate. More emergency cash was needed as well as a new long-term funding settlement to put the system on a sustainable footing, he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cSocial care and its workforce are at the frontline of this unprecedented pandemic which has had a devastating effect on many individuals and families. Every death has been a tragedy. \u201cAdult social care will continue to get all the support and resources they need to tackle the impacts of the pandemic, with \u00a33.2bn for local authorities to help address pressures on local services, including in adult social care, and \u00a3600m to control infections in care homes.\u201d Liz Kendall, the shadow minister for social care, said: \u201cThese findings expose the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on social care, and the grief and trauma that so many people have been through. The government has been too slow to protect elderly and disabled people and support those who need help most, and Adass is right to say social care must never be exposed like this again.\u201d The Adass report was based on a survey held during May of adult social care directors in 146 of the 151 councils in England with social care responsibilities.",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The tracers had reached 85% of those contacts \u2013 26,985 people \u2013 and asked them to self-isolate.

We clearly have got more to do to make sure that we reach everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was pleased with the way test and trace had worked in its first week. \u201cIt\u2019s already had a huge impact: the system is working well, and as we\u2019ve both said from the start, we\u2019ll keep improving it. It will keep getting better,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, he repeated his message that it was the public\u2019s \u201ccivic duty\u201d to comply with requests from contact tracers.</p> \n<p>However, Hancock also underlined the scale of the challenge when he said the ongoing Office for National Statistics study of the prevalence of the coronavirus in the community has shown that as many as 70-80% of those who test positive have no symptoms.</p> \n<p>Asked about the NHSX coronavirus app, originally slated for launch in mid-May, Hancock played down its significance, saying, \u201cthe app will help, and we\u2019ll bring it in when it is right to do so\u201d.</p> \n<p>He also acknowledged that further easing of lockdown restrictions will depend on how successful the new system is. \u201cThe better test and trace is, the more lockdown measures we can relieve safely.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to do to improve the speed of the entire service,\u201d Harding said, \u201cbut actually we have really significant testing capacity and the single biggest thing we can do to improve the process is actually encourage anyone with symptoms to get a test.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T16:45:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Tracing graphic 1\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T16:45:49/embed.html\">Tracing graphic 1</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There were many reasons why the contacts of a third of those who tested positive could not be tracked down, she said.

Critics have voiced concern that some will not be able to afford to give up work for two weeks, but Harding stressed that financial support was available.</p> \n<p>The 8,117 people referred to the contact-tracing service after testing positive is a lower number than the government website claims had tested positive in that week, 28 May\u20133 June, which was around 13,000. Newton said their numbers were only for England, and that some of the positive tests displayed online referred to individuals who might have had more than one test.</p> \n<p>Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cBeing unable to contact 33% of diagnosed cases is a concern particularly as a mobile number is involved in requesting the test.</p> \n<p>\u201cAn absolutely crucial part of the test and trace system is the public committing to it \u2013 the system can not work without the public\u2019s involvement.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Mark Harris, a professor of virology at the University of Leeds,<strong> </strong>said it was surprising that contacts were being asked only to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWhy are they not being tested, as is undertaken in other countries?&nbsp;By testing contacts we will also be able to identify other infected individuals and broaden the scope of the contact tracing to the next tier of contacts.&nbsp;This will help in identifying potential foci of infection and possibly inform localised lockdown strategies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock said: \u201cNHS Test and Trace is a new service on a scale never seen before, designed to help us control and contain this virus, and save lives. </p> \n<p>\u201cBacked by our rapid expansion of testing across the country, the new data shows how we are already helping to stop the spread of the virus with thousands of people booking a test, isolating and sharing their recent close contacts.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;\u201cThe service is key to helping us to return to a more normal way of life. We need everyone\u2019s support and collaboration to ensure that we can continue to keep infections falling.\u201d</p>",

Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, he repeated his message that it was the public\u2019s \u201ccivic duty\u201d to comply with requests from contact tracers. However, Hancock also underlined the scale of the challenge when he said the ongoing Office for National Statistics study of the prevalence of the coronavirus in the community has shown that as many as 70-80% of those who test positive have no symptoms. Asked about the NHSX coronavirus app, originally slated for launch in mid-May, Hancock played down its significance, saying, \u201cthe app will help, and we\u2019ll bring it in when it is right to do so\u201d. He also acknowledged that further easing of lockdown restrictions will depend on how successful the new system is. \u201cThe better test and trace is, the more lockdown measures we can relieve safely.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to do to improve the speed of the entire service,\u201d Harding said, \u201cbut actually we have really significant testing capacity and the single biggest thing we can do to improve the process is actually encourage anyone with symptoms to get a test.\u201d There were many reasons why the contacts of a third of those who tested positive could not be tracked down, she said. Sometimes the phone numbers and emails that contact tracers had been given were wrong. Sometimes people did not answer their phones or emails and sometimes people refused to tell the contact tracers who they had been spending time with. \u201cInterestingly, some people said to us: well, I\u2019ve already told my mates that I tested positive so I don\u2019t need you to,\u201d Harding said. Prof John Newton, the director of health improvement for Public Health England, who heads the testing and tracing programme, said they had to ensure they had the correct details for those people with a positive test. \u201cI think the key point for us in the 33% is we need to make sure when people apply for a test, we need to double check that we\u2019ve got the right information from them that\u2019s valid, so that when we come to go back to them, we can make contact. Those things are being improved all the time.\u201d Harding said she could not at this stage break down the numbers to reveal how many people had refused to self-isolate. Critics have voiced concern that some will not be able to afford to give up work for two weeks, but Harding stressed that financial support was available. The 8,117 people referred to the contact-tracing service after testing positive is a lower number than the government website claims had tested positive in that week, 28 May\u20133 June, which was around 13,000. Newton said their numbers were only for England, and that some of the positive tests displayed online referred to individuals who might have had more than one test. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cBeing unable to contact 33% of diagnosed cases is a concern particularly as a mobile number is involved in requesting the test. \u201cAn absolutely crucial part of the test and trace system is the public committing to it \u2013 the system can not work without the public\u2019s involvement.\u201d Mark Harris, a professor of virology at the University of Leeds, said it was surprising that contacts were being asked only to self-isolate. He said: \u201cWhy are they not being tested, as is undertaken in other countries? By testing contacts we will also be able to identify other infected individuals and broaden the scope of the contact tracing to the next tier of contacts. This will help in identifying potential foci of infection and possibly inform localised lockdown strategies.\u201d Hancock said: \u201cNHS Test and Trace is a new service on a scale never seen before, designed to help us control and contain this virus, and save lives. \u201cBacked by our rapid expansion of testing across the country, the new data shows how we are already helping to stop the spread of the virus with thousands of people booking a test, isolating and sharing their recent close contacts. \u201cThe service is key to helping us to return to a more normal way of life. We need everyone\u2019s support and collaboration to ensure that we can continue to keep infections falling.\u201d",

It might be 1 metre this time tomorrow.\u201d Houghton said he felt this summed up the central government approach: \u201cThey seem to be reacting to situations rather than reading situations \u2013 that seems to be the case all the way through, whether care homes or PPE. Is the virus managing the government or is the government managing the virus?\u201d Advice given by the environmental and modelling group of the government\u2019s Sage scientific advice body on 26 April was that the risk from face-to-face contact drops to an acceptable level at 2 metres. Scientists say any change of advice would have to be backed by clear rationale on how the epidemic is being managed. \u201cNo measure should be seen in isolation,\u201d said Prof Susan Michie, the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London. \u201cOne would expect measures to be part of an overall strategy, but we haven\u2019t seen that. We\u2019re just having different announcements about different things at different times \u2013 things are being suddenly sprung on people because of political expediency.\u201d Michie said a concern over replacing the 2-metre guidance with 1 metre would be that to many people it would signal things going \u201cback to normal\u201d. \u201cIf you begin to say that 2 metres doesn\u2019t matter any more \u2013 because that\u2019s how it will be seen \u2013 it undermines the mental model of how transmission happens that\u2019s so carefully been built up over the past few months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there\u2019s a very good argument. The risks will be higher and more people will get ill.\u201d The MHCLG said it could not comment on speculation about a change to the rules.",

The event took place moments after troops and police cleared a path for the president and his entourage to walk the short distance to the nearby St John\u2019s church, also known as the Church of the Presidents, by violently ousting peaceful protesters chanting and singing amid ongoing nationwide demonstrations in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. \u201cI should not have been there,\u201d Milley told the National Defense University in a pre-recorded video commencement address. \u201cMy presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\u201d Milley and defense secretary Mark Esper were widely criticized for participating in the photo-op, with many former defense officials saying the two were helping Trump\u2019s efforts to politicize the military. \u201cAs senior leaders, everything you do will be closely watched, and I am not immune,\u201d Milley said. \u201cAs many of you saw the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society.

If states want to resort to using troops to quell protests, they use their local national guard, and the president is constitutionally expected to refrain from using federal military in domestic law enforcement unless requested by a state governor. However, the president has jurisdiction in the District of Columbia, which is not a state and has a mayor but no governor. Esper and Milley have said they thought they were merely going to inspect troops who were ranged outside the White House in Lafayette Square, or look at damage to the church located there.

Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, James Mattis, had swiftly and roundly slammed the president for his belligerent talk and handling of the swelling protests against police brutality and racism, while Esper also broke ranks over Trump\u2019s actions to direct US military to gather on the outskirts of the capital as a show of force and apparently poised to intervene if protests became too volatile. Milley\u2019s apology also comes amid another standoff between the White House and the Pentagon over the potential renaming of military bases named after Confederate generals. Milley and Esper signaled earlier this week that they were open to a conversation on renaming the bases, after years of critics complaining the bases\u2019 names celebrated the Confederacy\u2019s efforts to preserve slavery, which Trump has flatly refused to consider.

Culturespaces took two years to create <em>Les Bassins de Lumi\u00e8res</em>, installing 90 video-projectors and 100km of optical fibres, but the entire 41,000m2 site is being redeveloped as a vast gallery, workshop and arts complex.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/03/life-after-lockdown-in-resilient-marseille\">'We will survive': life after lockdown in resilient Marseille</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five minutes\u2019 walk away is a second titanic overground bunker, built as a depot to store four billion litres of fuel to supply the submarine base.

Despite the coronavirus, de Cointet is hoping for around 400,000 visitors a year. Entry is in half-hour slots with many already sold out for June. He expects visitors to spend about an hour and a half watching the projections in the Bassins, but they can stay for as long as they want. Construction of the German-built submarine base, the U-Boot-Bunker, began in 1941 to house 15 submarines in Nazi-occupied Bordeaux. It withstood allied bombardment until the city was liberated in August 1944 and, over the decades, has been used as a metallurgy plant, occasional festival venue and film set. Culturespaces took two years to create Les Bassins de Lumi\u00e8res, installing 90 video-projectors and 100km of optical fibres, but the entire 41,000m2 site is being redeveloped as a vast gallery, workshop and arts complex. Five minutes\u2019 walk away is a second titanic overground bunker, built as a depot to store four billion litres of fuel to supply the submarine base. Its six-metre-thick concrete walls now house 650 barrels of whisky for Bordeaux\u2019s Moon Harbour distillery. The company\u2019s marketing manager, Aude Medina, is delighted that the Bassins are open and is optimistic about life after lockdown. \u201cWe had no whisky production or public visits for two months, but I think people will begin to come out slowly, though staying closer to home, so we will attract more visitors from our local region.\u201d As confinement measures are eased, the docklands\u2019 Mus\u00e9e Mer Marine is now open at weekends, Les Halles de Bacalan gastronomic market is open mornings from Wednesday to Sunday, and the city\u2019s spectacular wine centre, La Cit\u00e9 du Vin reopens on 19 June. Gustav Klimt, d\u2019or et de couleurs and Paul Klee, peindre la musique runs until 3 January 2021. Open daily April-September: 10am-7pm (Mon-Thurs and Sun), 10am-9pm (Fri and Sat). October-March: 10am-6pm (Mon-Thurs and Sun), 10am-7pm (Fri and Sat). Tickets: adult \u20ac13.50, 5-25 years \u20ac9, senior \u20ac12.50, family \u20ac40",

      "bodyText": "Only one of the six commissioners on Scott Morrison\u2019s Covid-19 commission has volunteered to release their conflicts of interest, prompting calls for greater transparency from the publicly funded body. The government has refused to release the conflict-of-interest declarations for members of its National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC), a prominent advisory body shaping non-health aspects of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 strategy. There have been increasing concerns about a lack of proper governance structures around the taxpayer-funded commission, which operates with a broad remit and a budget of more than $5m. The commission is headed by Nev Power, the former head of Fortescue Metals, and other commissioners include the Industry Super chair Greg Combet, former health department secretary Jane Halton, rich-lister Paul Little, EnergyAustralia chair Catherine Tanna and CSIRO chair David Thodey. Officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet said it could not release their conflict-of-interest declarations because they were provided \u201cin confidence\u201d. The Guardian approached each of the commissioners and asked whether they would release their interests of their own volition. Only Combet agreed to do so. A spokesman told the Guardian Combet\u2019s \u201cinterests are already publicly available and widely known\u201d, and provided a list including his chairmanship of Industry Super Australia and IFM Investors, as well as his membership of the Invest Victoria advisory board and occasional consulting roles. The interests he declared had already been published on the NCCC\u2019s website, where others had also published their public directorships. A spokeswoman for Little, a former managing director of Toll Holdings, said his \u201cpublic directorships are on the public record and we do not comment on his private interests\u201d. Thodey, a former Telstra chief executive, told the Guardian his interests and investments had been declared internally to the government to ensure \u201ctransparency and any conflicts are disclosed and addressed\u201d. \u201cThe commissioners are also asked at every meeting to consider if there are any new conflicts of interest,\u201d Thodey said. Questions to Power were answered by an NCCC spokesperson, who said his directorships and those of other commissioners were a \u201cmatter of public record, published on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission\u2019s website\u201d. \u201cAs indicated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to the Senate select committee on Covid-19 at its hearing on 4 June, the NCCC chair and commissioners\u2019 declarations are of private interests and it is not the department\u2019s intention to provide those.\u201d Other commissioners either did not respond or declined to comment. Guardian Australia is not suggesting the commissioners are conflicted or that they have not internally declared their interests appropriately. But critics say there is a lack of proper governance surrounding the NCCC, a publicly funded body led by prominent private-sector leaders who may hold a variety of unknown interests. The Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said publicly disclosing conflicts was \u201cthe least the government commissioners\u201d could do, given they had been handpicked to advise the government on spending billions of dollars taxpayer funds. \u201cThe roles of the NCCC commissioners are, by design, intended to influence government,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cIt is clearly in the public interest for any conflicts of interest to be publicly declared. There is no excuse for any potential conflicts of interest to remain secret.\u201d Crossbench senator Rex Patrick also urged \u201cfull disclosure\u201d of the commissioners\u2019 interests. \u201cThe commissioners are being paid from the public purse, are performing public activities and their output may have significant influence over the future expenditure of public money,\u201d he said. The role of Power as NCCC head has raised some concern among civil society groups. The commission has advocated for gas development as a way to boost economic growth after the coronavirus crisis. Questions around commercial conflicts prompted Power to step aside from his position as deputy chairman of a gas company, Strike Energy. Speaking at a parliamentary inquiry earlier this month, Power acknowledged there was a \u201cperceived conflict\u201d, but said he had not attended a Strike Energy board meeting and would not vote on any operational or strategic matters while he was at the NCCC. He also stood by his view that Australia should be considering competitive gas supply as a raw material for \u201cboth existing and new manufacturing industry to preserve and create jobs\u201d.",

Friday\u2019s meeting of leaders comes as the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has urged Australians not to participate in mass gatherings, describing protests as a \u201cvery high risk environment\u201d given thousands of people are in close proximity, and there are difficulties in subsequently identifying all contacts. A person who attended the mass Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne last weekend has tested positive to Covid-19, and Scott Morrison on Thursday intensified criticism of the activism, declaring people ignoring the public health advice should be charged by authorities.

The AHPCC statement said Victoria has launched \u201ca significant investigation to determine the source of the infection and identify close contacts\u201d. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has said it was unlikely the infection had been acquired at the protest, but it was possible the person was infectious. The man, in his 30s, wore a mask. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said if the coming weeks showed only a small spike in Covid-19 infections among protest attendees, \u201cthen obviously it\u2019s easy to cope with and we can contact trace, contain, isolate, quarantine as we\u2019ve done, you know, really for the last few months\u201d. \u201cBut I think the biggest worry is that we have a large number of outbreaks that seed more community transmission,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Thursday evening. \u201cWe\u2019ve got almost no community transmission in Australia at the moment. It\u2019s a fantastic position \u2026 so that\u2019s what we want to keep.\u201d On the easing of restrictions, Murphy said every state and territory was in a different place and health officials wanted to make sure \u201cthat we relax our restrictions carefully and progressively\u201d and monitor the impact. Murphy said the lack of an upswing in cases after the recent relaxation in rules was \u201ca really good sign\u201d that would give governments confidence to progressively loosen controls, \u201cbut if you go too far too quickly you can get a larger outbreak\u201d. In the interview, Murphy acknowledged there was a risk of the public losing interest in complying with the rules given the low number of Covid-19 cases at present. He agreed that there was \u201csome arbitrariness\u201d about some of the regulations, but added there was \u201cno rule book to this\u201d and officials were \u201cdoing what they can with the best of information that we have\u201d. While issuing warnings against mass gatherings, Morrison has attempted this week to step up pressure on the premiers to open state borders to assist with normalising economic activity. But the premiers have signalled they will move at their own pace. The Western Australian premier Mark McGowan said late on Thursday he would reopen the border when it is safe to do so. \u201cWe have opened up our economy within WA to a far greater degree by a country mile than any other state in Australia. That\u2019s got far more people back to work\u201d. The Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the state was tracking towards a border opening in July. \u201cJuly will definitely see more of Queensland opening up,\u201d the premier said. \u201cWe will see more people in restaurants and cafes, we will see more people in activities, more people in stadiums, so July is going to be a very good month for Queensland.\u201d",

When Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018, got her absentee ballot in the mail, it arrived with a sealed return envelope, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/us/politics/atlanta-voting-georgia-primary.html\">she was unable to mail it back</a>. \u201cSo not only do we have to deal with widespread voter suppression,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cevidently, some weirdo is going around licking people\u2019s envelopes.

Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd.html\">had at least 17 prior complaints</a> against him \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know the right number of complaints it should take to get a police officer fired, but it definitely should not be more than the number of stamps to get a free smoothie at Jamba Juice,\u201d Bee said.

      "bodyText": "A supporter of Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has desecrated a beachside memorial to Covid-19 victims as the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose above 40,000. Activists from civil society group Rio de Paz dug 100 symbolic shallow graves on Copacabana beach before dawn on Thursday to represent the Brazilian lives lost. At least 40,276 people have now died, according to a coalition of news outlets which has been compiling an independent tally since Brazil\u2019s health ministry was accused of seeking to conceal the full figures last week. But the NGO\u2019s founder, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Costa, said Bolsonaristas began haranging activists as they stood beside the mock cemetery. Soon after a man was filmed knocking down the wooden crosses protesters had placed in the sand near a banner reading: \u201cBrazil, land of graves\u201d. \u201cThey feel such rage \u2013 and I think they\u2019re reproducing the behaviour of the person occupying the highest position in the land,\u201d Costa said of his group\u2019s assailants. Among those watching the vandalism was a grieving father who campaigners said had lost his 25-year-old son to Covid-19. The man re-erected the crosses and shouted: \u201cRespect the pain of others.\u201d Costa said he felt anger at the profoundly disrespectful act \u2013 the first such attack he had experienced in 13 years protesting against politicians from across the political spectrum. But he said that most of all he felt pity for the man, and other hardcore Bolsonaristas, who were \u201cso blinded by ideological passion that they had closed their eyes to reality\u201d. Polls show millions have turned on Bolsonaro over his internationally condemned handling of coronavirus, which he has dismissed as \u201ca little flu\u201d. But the rightwing populist maintains a solid support base of about 30%. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s mistakes are not so subtle that only the most perceptive people are able to detect them. It\u2019s all so clear,\u201d said Costa, a Presbyterian church leader. \u201cSo how is it that some people cannot see this?\u201d Costa said Brazil was experiencing \u201cthe worst crisis in its history\u201d. \u201cThousands have died. Families are in mourning. People are unemployed. At a moment like this you might expect the president of the republic to offer words of hope, to show compassion, to behave soberly and signal a way forwards. Instead, we see him joining anti-democratic protests, telling journalists to shut up, riding horses, driving jet-skis [and] organizing barbecues.\u201d As he smashed the symbolic cemetery, the Bolsonarista branded activists leftist terrorists. Costa said the memorial had nothing to do with left or right. \u201cWhat moves us is a commitment to life. They use this discourse to delegitimize anti-Bolsonaro protesters \u2013 as if only those on the left were capable of noticing this government\u2019s insane and anti-democratic acts.\u201d",

When the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies discussed contact tracing in early May, according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888807/S0402_Thirty-second_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">the minutes (pdf)</a> \u201cit agreed that at least 80% of contacts of an index case would need to be contacted for a system to be effective.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But these figures don\u2019t tell the story. There are at least four potential drawbacks.</p> \n  <p><em><strong>1 - Positive cases never referred to the service</strong></em></p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891703/NHS_test_and_trace_bulletin__England__-_28_May_to_3_June_2020.pdf\">statistical bulletin (pdf)</a> from the Department of Health and Social Care says 8,117 people who tested positive between 28 May and 3 June were referred to the test and trace service for England. But these were probably only a small proportion of the new cases that week. According to <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/5june2020\">an ONS survey</a>, there were an estimated 39,000 new cases in England every week during May. Towards the end of the month the infection rate was falling, but these figures suggest thousands of cases are being missed by test and trace, largely because people are getting infected but not getting a test.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>2 - People who don\u2019t cooperate</em></strong></p> \n  <p>In his video message (in which he also says the system will get better over time), Hancock says that 85% \u201cof all those who needed to be contacted\u201d were contacted. That\u2019s misleading. Some 85% of the contacts who were actually identified - ie, people named as having been in close contact with someone who tested positive - were reached by the service and told to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>But only 67% of those who tested positive and whose names were passed on to the service provided names of their contacts. For the 33% who did not provide any names, for obvious reasons 0% of their contacts were contacted.</p> \n  <p>If 5,407 people testing positive provided the names of 31,794 contacts, then on average each Covid-positive person had 5.88 contacts who might be at risk. That means if there were 8,117 people testing positive being referred to the service, there were around 47,700 people in total who needed to be reached and told to self-isolate. In the event 31,794 people were contacted - a \u2018success rate\u2019 of 67%.</p> \n  <p>Arguably that\u2019s still quite reasonable for the first week, but it is well short of Sage\u2019s target of 80%.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>3 - People who don\u2019t cooperate on time</em></strong></p> \n  <p>The figure quoted above is based on the 67% of Covid-positive people referred to the service who did provide details of their contacts. But, as the statistical bulletin shows, only 79% of people provided details of their contacts within 24 hours. <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the chair of the Commons health committee, says that if you ignore the other 25% who took longer, you get a different success rate.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt/status/1271060790599200768\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the face of it these are encouraging no.s.

But, in <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/why-i-broke-boris-johnson\">an article for the New Statesman</a>, he says he has lost faith in the prime minister because he now thinks the PM has given up listening to a wide range of voices and is now intolerant of criticism. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It took six years for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s governments to begin to stop listening to alternative voices. The same patterns had emerged within six months of Johnson becoming prime minister, and within six weeks of his general election victory last December. In her early years the Iron Lady relished argument and intellectual debate \u2013 and those internal jousts strengthened her for the public battles with her true opponents. In the starkest of contrasts, the team inside today\u2019s No 10 has often preferred to greet internal dissent with retribution \u2013 much of it pre-briefed to favoured journalists. Throughout the Westminster village every Tory had quickly learned the score: do, say and tweet as you are told \u2013 or else. In February\u2019s reshuffle we learned that earning the disfavour of key prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings was fatal, even if you were chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone was dispensable.

The SNP has actively been exploring the idea - <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister recently described it as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/universal-basic-income-ubi-scotland-uk-nicola-sturgeon-coronavirus-a9498076.html\">an idea whose time has come </a>- and the Scottish government had funded a modest pilot to examine the feasibility of the idea.</p> \n  <p>Its <a href=\"https://basicincome.scot/2020/06/10/draft-final-report-cbi-feasibility-study/\">final report</a> is now out.

That is why I have written to UK ministers urging them to engage constructively with us on this matter and discuss next steps towards a universal basic income pilot.</p> \n   <p>This is now the time to seriously consider a basic income pilot as part of a UK-wide Covid-19 programme of support to ensure a strong and fair economic and social recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s appeal to the UK government for help implementing a universal basic income is almost certainly doomed to failure. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the chancellor, has repeatedly said he is not in favour (eg<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46#block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46\"> here</a>).</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:16:41.317Z\">at 12.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee20e848f089c0fbf358766\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:03:30.356Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>After Boris Johnson yesterday said that all pupils would return to school in <strong>England</strong> after the summer holidays, one of the UK\u2019s main teachers\u2019 unions has issued what it calls a \u201cnational education recovery plan\u201d.<br><br>The prime minister said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, will next week issue details of what he called \u201ca huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months\u201d.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we has actually peaked in infection rates before we went into lockdown, and that was therefore coming already down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he went on to allege that Ferguson and his epidemiological modelling was discredited. Duncan Smith said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think this piece of information comes from the man who ran the Imperial College model which has been now roundly trashed by almost every single scientist, particularly in Oxford and Edinburgh. And so my point is, be very careful: you get scientists and they disagree with each other about these.</p> \n   <p>The government acted on the advice of the science at the time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Imperial College model has its critics, but the idea that it has been \u201croundly trashed\u201d is just wrong. Ferguson is no longer a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (he resigned over a lockdown breach), but <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888813/S0404_Thirty-fourth_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">in its minutes </a>Sage said he had made \u201can important contribution\u201d and the modelling produced by his team is still being used by Sage as it advises government.</p> \n  <p>Duncan Smith\u2019s argument about the epidemic peaking before the lockdown was announced seems to have been lifted an article by the Spectator editor<strong> Fraser Nelson </strong>that he posted on Twitter yesterday.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FraserNelson/status/1270975518192566272\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Neil Ferguson's claim that infections were surging in the week before lockdown is being challenged by studies using observed (rather than modelled) data.

The health secretary Matt Hancock said that 85% of contacts given were self-isolating had still \u2018beaten his expectations\u2019. But analysis showed that between 28 May and 3 June, 8,117 individuals tested positive and were referred for contact tracing. Of those, 5,407 (67%) were reached and asked for contacts. However, ONS surveillance data suggests there were at least 23,000 new symptomatic cases in that period, meaning that 75% of cases were not found. Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee, expressed concern that the system won\u2019t be able to do its job if less than a fifth of new infections are being picked up. Matt Hancock did not rule out making cooperation with test and trace compulsory. Priti Patel was accused of using using her own experiences of prejudice to \u201cgaslight\u201d the \u201cvery real racism\u201d faced by black people in the UK. A group of 33 BAME Labour MPs wrote to the home secretary, accusing her of trying to \u201csilence\u201d Florence Eshalomi when she told the Commons of her experiences of racism and said she would \u201cnot take lectures\u201d on prejudice. Things then took an odd turn when Matt Hancock accused those MPs of treating Patel as \u201cthe wrong type of BAME\u201d. Urgent cancer referrals in England fell by 60% in the first month of lockdown. NHS England figures revealed fewer urgent cancer referrals made by GPs in April (60% down from last year) and urgent referrals for breast cancer fell by 78%. The UK death toll rose by 151 to 41,279. That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side. If you would like to continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. The government of the Isle of Man has announced it will remove social distancing restrictions for individuals and businesses from Monday, the first place in the British Isles to relax the measures. From 15 June, the two metre rule will no longer apply, businesses won\u2019t have to implement social distancing, and employees will be permitted to return to work as normal in most settings. Social distancing and PPE will, however, remain a requirement in health and care environments, including residential homes. It comes as for 22nd consecutive day, no active cases of Covid-19 were recorded on the island. Other recently announced changes, including the reopening of schools, restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, gyms and hotels, will be coming into force on 15 June also. The Isle of Man borders remain closed to non-residents until further notice. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s press conference. Hancock, the health secretary for England, said he was not ruling out making cooperation with the new test and trace system compulsory. Asked if he would introduce an enforcement mechanism to ensure people comply with it, he replied: We\u2019re not ruling it out at the moment but we don\u2019t think we need it. He said that, even though today\u2019s figures showed that a third of people testing positive for coronavirus were being missed by test and trace, the system was working better than he expected at this stage. He said: I think that the system has worked well and to get two-thirds in the first week of operation, it beat my expectations. Then to have the vast majority - 85% - of the contacts that were given self-isolating, that beat my expectations too. He said people had a \u201ccivic duty\u201d to cooperate with test and trace. He refused to say when the app - which was originally supposed to be an integral part of test and trace - would be rolled out nationwide. Asked when he would introduce it, he said that would happen \u201cwhen it\u2019s right to do so\u201d. He went on: As we launched NHS Test and Trace we were clear we want to embed this system and get confidence that people are following the advice that\u2019s given by human beings before introducing the technological element. Dido Harding, head of the test and trace system, said that the 15% of contacts who have not agreed to self-isolate, according to the data, were not necessarily refusing. She explained: A significant proportion of them we haven\u2019t reached yet and spoken to or been able to get a response from them. I don\u2019t think we should leap to the conclusion that all 15% of contacts are actively choosing not to self-isolate. Some simply won\u2019t have replied to the text message or the email or we had the wrong email or number for them. Hancock accused Labour MPs of treating Priti Patel, the home secretary, as \u201cthe wrong type of BAME\u201d. Asked about a letter sent to Patel by BAME Labour MPs accusing her of using her heritage to try to stop them speaking out on racism (see 4.55pm), he said he abhorred this sort of \u201cdivisive identity politics\u201d. He explained: Of course Priti Patel was not wrong to talk of her personal experiences of racism. I have seen this letter and I abhor this divisive identity politics that\u2019s being levelled at Priti Patel. I am incredibly proud to be part of the most diverse government in history. I am very proud to be part of that with Priti and Rishi [Sunak] and Alok [Sharma] and Nadhim [Zahawi] and Kemi [Badenoch] and Ranil [Jayawardena] and James [Cleverly] and Suella [Braverman] and all the rest. We don\u2019t think that there\u2019s such a thing as the wrong type of BAME, we think that people are equal. That\u2019s what we need to see as a society, everybody seeing others as equal. Police in Bristol are investigating an apparent attack on the statue of a black playwright, poet and actor in which a suspected corrosive substance was poured over it. Some residents fear that bleach may have been used to attack the statue of Jamaican-born Alfred Fagon in the St Paul\u2019s area of the city. The incident was reported to the police shortly after the city council retrieved the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston from the harbour in Bristol where it was dumped by Black Lives Matter protesters on Sunday. A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset police said it was not clear what had happened to the bust and appealed for witnesses. The spokesperson said: Police were made aware today, Thursday 11 June, of an incident involving the statue of Alfred Fagon in St Paul\u2019s. The incident seems to have left the statue covered with an unknown substance. It\u2019s not clear when it happened but officers are recording the incident and making enquiries with Bristol city council to clarify ownership and establish whether the statue has suffered permanent damage. Bristol radio presenter and DJ Docta Flex said he believed the statue had been violated. \u201cThis is criminal damage,\u201d he said. The St Pauls poet and community activist Lawrence Hoo said: Someone came and bleached him. Everything didn\u2019t get made better a couple of days ago, and just to show that in this climate, someone still felt to come down and try and deface the one statue we\u2019ve got from one person from the community of culture that had been recognised enough to be adorned on a plinth. Fagon,a member of the Windrush generation, arrived in England as a teenager in 1955. He worked for British Rail and served in the army before forging a career in the arts in Bristol and London After Fagon died in 1986, the bust on the corner of Ashley Road and Grosvenor Road was commissioned by a committee chaired by Paul Stephenson, the civil rights activist who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963. The number of prisoners who have tested positive for Covid-19 flatlined in the most recent data released by the Ministry of Justice. As at 5pm on Wednesday, 490 prisoners were confirmed to have had the virus across 80 prisons, no change in 24 hours, while the number of infected staff rose by three to 964 across 105 prisons. Figures obtained by the Lord Bishop of Gloucester show that more than 3,500 prisoners have previously displayed symptoms of Covid-19. Of those, 1447 (or 42%) were tested. There are around 79,800 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. Independent Sage, the group of scientists operating as an alternative to the government\u2019s Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) says the test and trace figures out today are \u201calarming\u201d because they show 75% of cases are being missed. This is from Sir David King, the former government chief scientific adviser who chairs Independent Sage. It is of course reasonable to expect that the first week of a new programme like this will have teething problems however these figures are alarming. What is of particular concern is that we are continuing to see the country coming out of lockdown before a fit for purpose \u2013 let alone world beating - test, track and trace system is up and running. And here is an extract from the Independent Sage press release explaining why they think it is missing 75% of cases. It says: Independent SAGE analysed the figures released today that showed 8,117 individuals testing positive for Covid-19 between May 28 and June 3 were referred for contact tracing. Only 5,407 (67%) were reached and asked to provide details of recent contacts. ONS surveillance data however suggested that there were at least 23,000 new symptomatic cases during that time period, meaning that only about a quarter of symptomatic cases had been found by the test and trace system. Matt Hancock said today that 85% of contacts had been traced. This is deeply misleading as it relates only to the 5,407 individuals who were reached by contact tracers and ignores the 75% of new cases that were simply not found. Most people want social distancing measures to remain at two metres, new data suggests. A snap poll by YouGov found that 58% of people want the rules to be kept at the current distance, while just under a quarter (24%) want it dropped to one metre. Support for the shorter social limit increased with older generations, with 32% of those over 65 preferring the one metre rule, compared to 17% of 18 to 24-year-olds. Meanwhile, 8% of respondents said the restrictions should be scrapped altogether. The figures come after suggestions that the prime minister may be considering reducing the restriction in an attempt help schools reopen. The Daily Telegraph reported that Boris Johnson is looking at following WHO advice and cutting the distance, mirroring guidance already followed by countries including France, Denmark and Singapore. At PMQs on Wednesday, he promised to \u201ckeep that two-metre rule under constant review\u201d and the business secretary Alok Sharma said this week that \u201cfor economic reasons, businesses will want to take a look at this two-metre rule\u201d. When asked whether there was a hard and fast rule on an effective distance to stop the spread of the virus, one scientist said \u201cit is just a matter of reducing risk with increased physical distance.\u201d Jonathan Reid, professor of physical chemistry at the University of Bristol, explained: Physical distancing is a way of reducing the exposure of an individual to the large droplets generated when someone sneezes, coughs or even speaks. He added: The further you stand away from someone, the fewer droplets you will be exposed to when someone sneezes or coughs in your direction. 1m only prevents you from being exposed to the largest of droplets, two metres reduces your exposure but doesn\u2019t make it zero risk. Q: [From the Birmingham Post] Why is the national lockdown being eased before powers are in place to enforce lockdowns locally? Hancock says those powers are available. If local leaders think they do not have the appropriate powers, they should contact him, he says. Q: Will you publish regional R figures? Hancock says there are more than 10 models feeding into Sage. One model had R above 1 in some regions. But that was just one model. He says the overall assessment was different. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: [From the Daily Express\u2019s Macer Hall] What reasons are people giving for not cooperating? Harding says test and trace have not been able to contact all these people. So they cannot assume they are refusing to comply. What\u2019s encouraging is that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people are complying. Q: Some Labour MPs have written to Priti Patel criticising the way she spoke about her experience of racism. (see 4.55pm.) Was she wrong? Hancock says Patel was right to speak out. He says he abhors this attempt to use identity politics. He says he is proud to be part of the most diverse government in history. And it is wrong to suggest that Patel is the wrong sort of minority. Q: When will antibody tests be rolled out? Harding says at the moment the science does not tell you whether people with antibodies have immunity. Hancock says the ONS study showed that 70 to 80% of people testing positive do not have symptoms. But the more people who self-isolate - whether they are symptomatic or not - the more likely the chain of transmission will be broken, he says. Harding says testing is now being rolled out to at-risk workers, like taxi drivers and security guards, who don\u2019t have symptoms. She says they need to get better at hunting out the virus. Q: Are you ruling out any enforcement mechanism? Hancock says he is not ruling it out. But he thinks they don\u2019t need that at the moment. Hancock says he is not ruling out making complying with test and trace compulsory. Harding says most people have been not just willing to comply, but enthusiastic. Q: Why don\u2019t you test the people told to self-isolate? Hancock says they have looked at this. The virus can incubate for 14 days. And so, even if someone tested negative, they would still have to self-isolate. He says that is why these people are not being tested; it is not a capacity problem, he says. Q: [From ITV\u2019s Tom Clarke] This is not yet a world-class system. Isn\u2019t it too early to relax lockdown? No, says Hancock. He says the PM promised there would be a world-class system, and we will get one. He says he is confident that the measures announced for this weekend - the social measures at the weekend (support bubbles), retail measures on Sunday - are being introduced safely. Q: When will you tell us how quickly people are being tested? Harding says the turnaround time for testing has not yet been published. She says they are working with the UK Statistics Authority to make sure the data is robust. She says she knows it sounds easy. But she says there are many laboratories. They want to make sure the data is reliable. Q: [From the BBC\u2019s Hugh Pym] Are you worried that you could not get contract details for a third of people? Hancock says it\u2019s the first week and he thinks it is working well. He says that getting contact details for two thirds of people beat his expectations. Harding says she thinks this is a good result for the first week. Some of it is about learning when it is best to contact people. They contact people 10 times if needed to get details of their contacts. She says she has been learning when the best time to contact people is. Q: What is the situation with the app? Hancock says it will help. They will introduce it when it is right to do so. Andy from Bromsgrove asks if there will be any more public support for people told to self-isolate by test and trace. And would all workers at a firm have to self-isolate if a colleague tests positive? Hancock says a support package is in place for people who need to self-isolate. Businesses can reduce the risk of this by operating in a Covid secure. If they are, then people should not have to self-isolate if a colleague gets coronavirus. Harding says close contact means being in close contact for 15 minutes or more, or coming into close contact with them. She says this won\u2019t happen if workers are working in a Covid secure way. Harding is now presenting figures about the test and trace system. She says NHS test and trace is a service for the public, and it works best with the cooperation of the public. She says some people did not tell the service they would self-isolate. But it is important they do, she says. She says if you develop symptoms, you must get a test. The system is working well at scale, she says. But they will keep learning. Hancock turns to test and trace. He says it is like the government\u2019s \u201cradar\u201d - it shows where the virus is. Addressing the public, he says people have a role to play too. They should get a test if they have symptoms, and participate in test and trace. He says it is people\u2019s \u201ccivic duty\u201d to comply. He says the figures out today show why test and trace will be world-class. Here are the hospital figures. And here are the death figures. Hancock says that the virus is \u201cin retreat\u201d and that the government\u2019s plan is working. Hancock starts with the daily slides. Here are the latest figures for testing and new cases. Matt Hancock, the health secretary for England, is taking the government\u2019s afternoon press conference. He will be appearing with Dido Harding, head of the test and trace system. It is starting any minute now. Priti Patel has clashed with a group of BAME Labour MPs who accused the home secretary of using her Indian heritage to cast doubt on black communities\u2019 experience of racism. She said she \u201cwill not be silenced\u201d by the 33 MPs who wrote to her, accusing her of having used her own experiences of prejudice to \u201cgaslight\u201d the \u201cvery real racism\u201d faced by black people in the UK. The exchange came after the home secretary told of the racism she has herself suffered and said she would \u201cnot take lectures\u201d on prejudice in the Commons earlier in the week. But she was accused of having sought to \u201csilence\u201d the black Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who called for action from the government to tackle discrimination. In the letter, shadow minister Naz Shah and other Labour MPs, including Eshalomi, Diane Abbott, Tan Dhesi and Rosena Allin-Khan, question Patel\u2019s attitude towards Black Lives Matter protests: We write to you as black, Asian and ethnic minority Labour MPs to highlight our dismay at the way you used your heritage and experiences of racism to gaslight the very real racism faced by black people and communities across the UK. Our shared experiences allow us to feel the pain that communities feel, when they face racism, they allow us to show solidarity towards a common cause; they do not allow us to define, silence or impede on the feelings that other minority groups may face. Being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism. In conclusion, we ask you to reflect on your words and to consider the impact it had towards the black communities in the UK trying to highlight their voices against racism. During the Commons exchange on Monday, Eshalomi called on Patel to \u201cact now\u201d to resolve \u201cstructural inequality, discrimination and racism\u201d as thousands of protesters took to the streets to demand change in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in the US. The Vauxhall MP asked the home secretary if she does \u201cactually understand the anger and frustration\u201d felt, and whether she wants to see action from the government. Patel replied: Well, on that basis, it must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a P*** in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband\u2019s in order to advance her career. So, when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance for social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the House. Patel received support from fellow BAME Tory MP James Cleverly who tweeted: BAME Labour MPs tell Priti Patel to stop disagreeing with them. They champion diversity of race in politics but not diversity of option. When I first read this letter it came across as offensive and crass. But upon rereading it and thinking carefully about the point these MPs are trying to make I now realise that it is indeed deeply offensive and crass. And here is more comment from Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, on test and trace. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has called for a broader curriculum to be introduced which better explains Britain\u2019s role in the slave trade. During a Call Keir online Q&amp;A with people in Barnet, north London, Starmer reiterated his previous comments that the forceful removal of the slave trader Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol was wrong, but argued that more education was needed about the part played by famous Britons in slavery. BLM demonstrators toppled the statue before sinking it into the city\u2019s harbour on Sunday. It has since been recovered by Bristol city council, with plans to place it in a museum. Asked about what his party would do to develop a \u201crelevant and appropriate curriculum\u201d in the light of George Floyd\u2019s death, Starmer said there had been a \u201cnarrowing\u201d of the school curriculum \u201cover recent years\u201d, and called for it be given a wider scope, focusing on information beyond that needed to pass exams. He added: Obviously there has been a lot discussion in the last few days about our history in the slave trade, probably more discussion in the last few days than there has been in the last few years. While I think pulling down the Colston statute in Bristol in the way it was done was wrong, I do think that statue should have been brought down a long time ago. That was a man who made his money from trading people, a hundred thousand people from Africa to the Caribbean, including women and children, and he branded them on their chests with the initials of his company to show they were his property. That bit of history ought to be something we know about from school, it shouldn\u2019t be something we are learning because something happened last weekend - it should be something that we all know about as part of the curriculum. So I would be in favour of broadening the curriculum. His comments come after a cross-party group of more than 30 politicians, led by Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran MP, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, calling for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global Black Lives Matter movement. Sky\u2019s Kate McCann has spotted another quirk in the test and trace figures, which makes the \u201c85% success\u201d figure (see 4.16pm) even more selective. She explains why here. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has published its latest estimate of the R number in the region. It is between 0.5 and 0.9. That is an improvement on last week, when it was between 0.7 and 0.9. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has released a video welcoming the test and trace figures. (See 1.13pm.) In it he says: These figures show that in its first week of operation 27,000 people were asked to isolate because they are at risk and that\u2019s 85% of all those who needed to be contacted. It\u2019s a testament to the effectiveness of the NHS test and trace system. Put like that, 85% sounds like a very good result. When the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies discussed contact tracing in early May, according to the minutes (pdf) \u201cit agreed that at least 80% of contacts of an index case would need to be contacted for a system to be effective.\u201d But these figures don\u2019t tell the story. There are at least four potential drawbacks. 1 - Positive cases never referred to the service The statistical bulletin (pdf) from the Department of Health and Social Care says 8,117 people who tested positive between 28 May and 3 June were referred to the test and trace service for England. But these were probably only a small proportion of the new cases that week. According to an ONS survey, there were an estimated 39,000 new cases in England every week during May. Towards the end of the month the infection rate was falling, but these figures suggest thousands of cases are being missed by test and trace, largely because people are getting infected but not getting a test. 2 - People who don\u2019t cooperate In his video message (in which he also says the system will get better over time), Hancock says that 85% \u201cof all those who needed to be contacted\u201d were contacted. That\u2019s misleading. Some 85% of the contacts who were actually identified - ie, people named as having been in close contact with someone who tested positive - were reached by the service and told to self-isolate. But only 67% of those who tested positive and whose names were passed on to the service provided names of their contacts. For the 33% who did not provide any names, for obvious reasons 0% of their contacts were contacted. If 5,407 people testing positive provided the names of 31,794 contacts, then on average each Covid-positive person had 5.88 contacts who might be at risk. That means if there were 8,117 people testing positive being referred to the service, there were around 47,700 people in total who needed to be reached and told to self-isolate. In the event 31,794 people were contacted - a \u2018success rate\u2019 of 67%. Arguably that\u2019s still quite reasonable for the first week, but it is well short of Sage\u2019s target of 80%. 3 - People who don\u2019t cooperate on time The figure quoted above is based on the 67% of Covid-positive people referred to the service who did provide details of their contacts. But, as the statistical bulletin shows, only 79% of people provided details of their contacts within 24 hours. Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the Commons health committee, says that if you ignore the other 25% who took longer, you get a different success rate. Hunt\u2019s argument is based on the assumption that, if people who have been in contact with a coronavirus-positive person are not told to self-isolate quickly, then self-isolation becomes much less valuable because they may have passed the infection on. 4 - People not complying with self-isolation Those involved in test and trace say most people asked to self-isolate have been happy to comply. But there are no figures to back this up. As Sage concluded at its meeting on 1 May, \u201ca high level of adherence to requests to isolate is required for the system to be effective\u201d. UPDATE: See 4.34pm, 4.43pm, and 5.55pm for more on what today\u2019s figures say about potential problems with the test and trace scheme. London Zoo\u2019s website is crashing as a result of the number of people trying to buy tickets ahead of its reopening next week. Responding to customers who were receiving error messages on Thursday afternoon when trying to organise a visit, the zoo tweeted that the site is \u201cstruggling to keep up with the number of bookings\u201d. In another message it said: It comes as zoos and safari parks prepare to reopen in England from Monday. Some, including London Zoo, Chester Zoo and Bristol Zoo have reported financial struggles during the pandemic and worried they would not survive the crisis. If you\u2019re still trying to wrap your head around the new rules surrounding \u201csupport bubbles\u201d in England, Amelia Hill has answered some of the more pertinent questions here: The government has been accused of rushing to announce \u201cheadline-grabbing policies\u201d without properly engaging with school leaders first. Boris Johnson announced plans on Wednesday night for a \u201cmassive catch-up operation over the summer\u201d for pupils, adding details will come next week. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, warned the scheme was \u201cthe latest in a long line of eye-catching announcements that will suffer from a lack of input from the profession\u201d. He said: As with the announcement that all children would return to primary school before the summer, the government has rushed to announce headline-grabbing policies without properly engaging with the profession first. The language of summer catch-up completely underplays the scale and the nature of the challenges likely to be faced because of prolonged absence from school. There is no quick fix. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is leaving the broadcaster LBC with immediate effect, it has been announced. It follows widespread anger over comments made by Farage comparing Black Lives Matter protestors to the Taliban. Here is the full story from our colleague Jim Waterson The British Council is in line for a \u00a360m bailout to save it from collapse after being \u201cheavily hit\u201d by the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Foreign Office said the council, which promotes cultural relations and educational opportunities overseas, is at \u201crisk of insolvency\u201d. The loan would \u201cstabilise\u201d the British Council\u2019s finances until mid-August, Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams told MPs. The council has already taken measures to reduce its deficit and cut costs, including furloughing staff using the government scheme and similar mechanisms in other countries. But Adams said: Without additional support from Government, the British Council will shortly become insolvent. The FCO is therefore seeking a contingencies fund advance to provide an initial loan of up to 60 million to the British Council, drawn down in tranches depending upon need and contingent on the approval of FCO and HM Treasury, to stabilise their financial situation until mid-August 2020. The terms of the loan will be agreed with HM Treasury. A further 83 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 27,790. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England 8 London 3 Midlands 26 North East &amp; Yorkshire 18 North West 10 South East 16 South West 2 Total 83 One further person with coronavirus has died in Northern Ireland, taking the death toll reported by the Department of Health to 538. There have been four new confirmed cases of the virus, bring the total since the outbreak began to 4,822. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 41,279 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Wednesday. That is a rise of 151 from 41,128 the day before. The government\u2019s figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 52,000. The DHSC also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Thursday, 197,007 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,266 positive results. Overall, a total of 6,240,801 tests have been carried out and 291,409 cases have been confirmed positive. The figure for the number of people tested has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d across all methods of testing. Travel firm Tui has extended the suspension of holidays for customers from the UK and Ireland due to coronavirus travel restrictions. The firm said in a statement: Tui UK and Ireland today confirms that due to the ongoing travel restrictions all beach holidays up to and including 10 July will be cancelled. With so much uncertainty around when travel will be able to recommence, customers due to travel before the end of August have the opportunity to amend their holiday for free, so they don\u2019t have to pay until closer to their new departure date. We are constantly monitoring the situation and will start taking people on holiday again as soon as we are able to do so. Cambridge University has announced a \u00a31m bursary programme targeted at helping UK adults whose careers have been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The university\u2019s Institute of Continuing Education is offering 1,000 bursaries, each worth \u00a31,000, to go towards tuition fees on one of more than 30 part-time courses. Those eligible to apply for the bursaries include UK residents who have been furloughed and those who have been made redundant on or after 1 April. Courses included in the scheme include coaching, cognitive psychology and genetics. Dr James Gazzard, director of the Institute of Continuing Education, said: The full economic impact of the current pandemic has yet to be fully understood, but there is a risk that the crisis creates a \u2018missed generation\u2019 of adults left without jobs and unable to afford the time and cost of full-time retraining. Our hope is that they will use these open-access Cambridge undergraduate qualifications to improve their employability and incorporate lifelong learning into their broader approach to wellbeing. The Cambridge Thousand Futures Bursary will mean access to a range of part-time remote qualifications will be available from \u00a31,150. The typical cost of an equivalent number of undergraduate credits at most UK universities ranges from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,600, the institute said. The programme is also open to key workers as defined by the government\u2019s list, those who have received an NHS letter to say they are in the \u201cmost at risk\u201d category, and people who were aged 70 before 1 April. Virtual open days will take place on Friday and Saturday, with applications to be considered on a first-come first-served basis. The closing date for applications is 31 July. Public Health Wales said a further six people had died after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of deaths there to 1,425, while the total cases increased by 63 to 14,581. Nearly a fifth of people in some areas of the UK have been furloughed from their jobs, PA Media reports. Analysis of new data shows that 25,400 people have been furloughed in Tottenham, north London, making it the worst-hit parliamentary constituency in the country, as just under 18% of people pick up a government-supported pay cheque. Meanwhile, Crawley, close to Gatwick airport in West Sussex, is the worst-hit local authority by proportion of population. The figures show that 20,000 people, or 17.8% of the local population, including children and pensioners, have been furloughed there. The government launched its jobs retention scheme in March, allowing companies to send workers home, with the Treasury paying up to 80% of their salaries. In England, 6.5m jobs had been furloughed by 31 May, dominated by London and the south-east, at more than 1m each. Around 628,000 workers have been furloughed in Scotland, 317,000 in Wales, and 212,000 in Northern Ireland, the figures show. The government is soon set to ease the support for businesses using the furlough scheme to keep their employees on the books. The data shows that around 1.1m businesses have claimed cash to help support their staff. Wholesale and retail businesses were the worst hit, claiming \u00a33.3bn for 1.6 million workers. It also further reveals the destruction wrought on the hospitality sector, with accommodation and food services companies furloughing 1.4 million people, and claiming \u00a32.6bn in furlough cash. Tim Montgomerie, the journalist who founded the influential ConservativeHome website, used to be an enthusiastic supporter of Boris Johnson. But, in an article for the New Statesman, he says he has lost faith in the prime minister because he now thinks the PM has given up listening to a wide range of voices and is now intolerant of criticism. Here\u2019s an extract. It took six years for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s governments to begin to stop listening to alternative voices. The same patterns had emerged within six months of Johnson becoming prime minister, and within six weeks of his general election victory last December. In her early years the Iron Lady relished argument and intellectual debate \u2013 and those internal jousts strengthened her for the public battles with her true opponents. In the starkest of contrasts, the team inside today\u2019s No 10 has often preferred to greet internal dissent with retribution \u2013 much of it pre-briefed to favoured journalists. Throughout the Westminster village every Tory had quickly learned the score: do, say and tweet as you are told \u2013 or else. In February\u2019s reshuffle we learned that earning the disfavour of key prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings was fatal, even if you were chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone was dispensable. Except Dom. In an interview on the World at One, Montgomerie, who is particularly close to Sajid Javid, the former chancellor who was effectively sacked because he would not let No 10 choose his advisers, said he was especially worried about the influence of Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser. What I worry about is that [Cummings] is a brilliant figure, but half of his ideas are crazy, and half of his ideas are good. He shouldn\u2019t be in a leadership position, he shouldn\u2019t be in a dominant position. And I\u2019m afraid that is what has happened inside Downing Street ... The Vote Leave operation that Dominic Cummings ran during the EU referendum has essentially been transplanted into Downing Street, and there is a lack of diversity in thought and personnel as a result. Probation services in England and Wales will be fully restored to public ownership and control, the justice secretary has announced, marking the final nail in the coffin of Chris Grayling\u2019s disastrous privatisation reforms. Under Grayling\u2019s widely derided shake-up in 2014, the probation sector was separated into a public sector organisation, the National Probation Service (NPS) managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) previously announced that all offender management, around 80% of all probation work, would be brought under the state-run National Probation Service (NPS). The remaining services, such as rehabilitation and the provision of unpaid work, will no longer be offered up for private tender, the justice secretary said, marking the complete return of probation services to the public sector. Around 2,000 workers at the private providers, known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs), are to be brought over to HM Prison and Probation Service. Robert Buckland told the Commons: The delivery of unpaid work, behavioural change programmes will be brought under control of the NPS alongside offender supervision when current CRC contracts end in June next year. This will give us a critical measure of control, resilience and flexibility with these services which we would not have had were they delivered under 12 contracts with an umber of organisations. Much of the Downing Street lobby briefing was taken up with a discussion of the test and trace figures. But here are some other lines from the briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the government had not ruled out the need for the Nightingale hospitals having to reactivated. The emergency hospitals, built within days when it was feared the NHS would be overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, were largely unused. But the spokesman said the government \u201cmay still need\u201d them in the months ahead. The spokesman said Boris Johnson was urging people not to take part in mass Black Lives Matters demonstrations, in breach of social distancing guidelines. He said: [The PM] has been very clear that any gatherings of more than six people would be illegal and would urge people not to take part in protests if they can\u2019t be conducted in a lawful way. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will take the daily press conference at 5pm. He will be appearing with Dido Harding, who is in charge of the test and trace programme. Dido Harding, the Tory peer who runs the test and trace programme, has admitted that the system needs to improve. Commenting on the first set of performance statistics for it published today (see 1.13pm), she told journalists: We are not at the gold standard yet that we want to be, of isolating all contacts within 48 hours of someone requesting a test. But you can absolutely see the path of how we are going to get there. She said the programme was \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. But it would improve, she said. Just as the infection rate is coming down in the country, so is our capability to test and trace growing. We have got real scale - this is a national-level service that has stood up in extraordinary time. Is it completely perfect? No, of course it isn\u2019t. Is there stuff that we all need to do better? Yes there is. But I think it\u2019s fit for purpose as we stand today and will get better through the summer. The Department of Health and Social Care has now published its first set of statistics (pdf) about the operation of the new test and trace system. Here are the key points flagged up by PA Media. Some 5,407 (67%) out of 8,117 people who tested positive for Covid-19 between May 28 and June 3 provided details of recent contacts. The other 2,710 (33%) were not reached. Of those people who were reached and asked to provide information about their contacts, just over three-quarters (79%) were contacted within 24 hours of their case being transferred to the test and trace system. Some 14% were contacted between 24 and 48 hours, 3% between 48 and 72 hours, and 4% were contacted after 72 hours. From 31,794 contacts who were identified over the period, 26,985 (85%) were reached and advised to self-isolate, NHS figures reveal. It is worth stressing, of course, that the system only went live on 28 May, and so these numbers may change over time. Nicola Sturgeon has said the latest scientific estimates are the R rate, the rate at which Covid-19 infections are spreading in the community, has fallen in Scotland to between 0.6 to 0.8, confirming a steep decline in the number of people in hospital and deaths. The first minister told the daily coronavirus briefing that \u201cunder that estimate we expect that the virus will continue to decline\u201d. She cautioned that there was still a risk of a resurgence in infections, but added: \u201cWe should continue to celebrate the progress.\u201d As a result, she announced that workers would be allowed now to return to construction sites, while observing social distancing, but added that \u201cwe still have some way to go\u201d before seeing building at full capacity. In her daily summary, she announced there were five deaths of those with confirmed Covid-19, with 909 people in hospital, 78 fewer than on Wednesday. Many of the key data have fallen in Scotland to the levels of mid- to late-March, leading Sturgeon to confirm the lockdown may be eased in Scotland more quickly. The R number in Scotland had been between 0.7 and 0.9. And the number of infected people in Scotland last week is judged to have been 4,500. There are more details in this Scottish government report (pdf). This chart shows the R number. And here are the estimates for the number of people infected. A total of 2,439 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by five from 2,434 on Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon has said at the Scottish government\u2019s daily briefing. The first minister said 15,682 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 17 from 15,665 the previous day. There are 909 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a fall of 78 in 24 hours. Of these patients, 21 were in intensive care, up three. In the Commons earlier the housing minister Chris Pincher answered an urgent question tabled by Labour about Robert Jenrick\u2019s intervention in a planning decision that helped the Tory donor Richard Desmond. Jenrick, the communities secretary, did not appear to answer the UQ himself. Labour\u2019s Steve Reed said that it was \u201castonishing\u201d that two weeks after Jenrick took a decision that potentially saved Richard Desmond millions of pounds, Desmond donated \u00a312,000 to the Conservative party. Reed went on: This sequence of events raises grave concerns about cash for favours. If he wants to restore trust, the secretary of state must immediately publish all documents and all correspondence related to this decision. The public needs reassurance that the integrity of the planning process cannot be auctioned off at Conservative party fundraising dinners. Pincher said Jenrick acted \u201cproperly and with propriety\u201d in relation to this decision. Referring to the donation to the Conservative party, Pincher said: The applicant, I think, has paid for tickets to a Conservative party event, that is apparently where the funds came from. Ministers have no knowledge of funds which are provided to political parties through donations or through payment for tickets - these are spendings made by donors which go to parties of all persuasions. They are declared in the proper and usual way. None of this is known to ministers, none of it is discussed by ministers, it certainly wasn\u2019t discussed on this occasion. As our colleague John Harris explained in a column last month, the coronavirus crisis has renewed interest in the merits of introducing a universal basis income. The SNP has actively been exploring the idea - Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister recently described it as an idea whose time has come - and the Scottish government had funded a modest pilot to examine the feasibility of the idea. Its final report is now out. And the Scottish government has concluded that, although the idea is \u201cdesirable\u201d, it would be impossible to introduce one without the support of the UK government because of the way so much welfare and tax policy is still decided in London. Aileen Campbell, the Scottish government\u2019s communities secretary, said: The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the UK social security system and strengthened calls to further explore how a universal basic income could provide support to people and reduce poverty. We now have the perfect opportunity to take that forward. The Scottish government agree with the report\u2019s conclusion that while introducing a basic income pilot is desirable, it can only be done with the full cooperation and collaboration of all relevant parties, particularly the UK government. That is why I have written to UK ministers urging them to engage constructively with us on this matter and discuss next steps towards a universal basic income pilot. This is now the time to seriously consider a basic income pilot as part of a UK-wide Covid-19 programme of support to ensure a strong and fair economic and social recovery. The SNP\u2019s appeal to the UK government for help implementing a universal basic income is almost certainly doomed to failure. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has repeatedly said he is not in favour (eg here). After Boris Johnson yesterday said that all pupils would return to school in England after the summer holidays, one of the UK\u2019s main teachers\u2019 unions has issued what it calls a \u201cnational education recovery plan\u201d. The prime minister said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, will next week issue details of what he called \u201ca huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months\u201d. But the National Education Union (NEU) has quickly issued its own version that looks beyond summer and the effects on English schools when the restart in September. The NEU\u2019s 10-point plan recommends: Local authorities organising summer schools for pupils, with places for those eligible for free school meals paid for by the government; Next year\u2019s GCSE and A-level exam content should be reduced and more teacher assessment used to account for the amount of time lost by pupils this year; A plan for \u201cblended learning\u201d - combining face to face and online teaching - should be developed for next year, along the lines of that proposed in Scotland; Children and young people living in poverty and low- income homes must be given the resources they need to learn at home. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretaries of the NEU said in a statement: Schools and pupils have had to adapt quickly to extraordinary circumstances. They have done this remarkably well, often with little or unclear guidance from government. This cannot happen again. We need a clear national plan. The government must demonstrate leadership and the capacity to work with local authorities and education unions so that plans are implemented in all the regions. The NEUs 10-point plan addresses significant issues that have to be considered. These issues will need funding and planning. We look forward to speaking to government alongside other education unions and education professionals about how we get this right, and in good time, for both the summer holidays and September. Government cannot let schools struggle through this on their own. Airline passengers are being \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d not to take any hand luggage on flights as part of measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. Travellers should check in all baggage before boarding flights, according to new Department for Transport (DfT) guidance published today. The government urged airlines - which generally charge additional fees for putting luggage in the hold - to use \u201cincentive policies\u201d to minimise hand baggage. The DfT guidance states: You are strongly encouraged to check in baggage to the aircraft hold and minimise any hand baggage. This will speed up boarding and disembarking, and minimise the risk of transmission. Other advice for passengers includes wearing face coverings in airports and remaining seated as much as possible during flights. Airlines are being encouraged to extensively clean aircraft, increase the availability of hand-washing and hand sanitiser, and reduce face-to-face interactions between staff and passengers. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: The government\u2019s advice currently remains to avoid all non-essential travel, but today we are taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back when it is safe for restrictions on travel to be lifted. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said its members welcomed the new guidelines. He said: The guidelines pave the way for the introduction of air bridges, and there is no reason we shouldn\u2019t be getting clarity from government on when and how these will be established over the coming days. Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said: With similar protocols being adopted in other countries, and a targeted approach to reopening travel to low-risk countries, we will have the elements in place to get our economy moving again and protect jobs throughout the whole aviation supply chain. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has suggested that the CBI is backing the government\u2019s decision not to ask for an extension to the transition period. Answering questions on Brexit talks in the House of Commons, Gove said: I know that businesses \u2026 want uncertainty to be removed. That\u2019s why we\u2019re clear that we will end the transition period on the 31st of December, and it is a position that I also understand now the CBI or in favour of. His remarks come just hours after the outgoing CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn, whose relations with the government were severely tested over Brexit, warned that British firms could not cope with a no deal Brexit. \u201cThe resilience of British business is absolutely on the floor,\u201d because of Covid she told the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack. Explaining why the CBI has not called for an extension of the transition period, Fairbairn said on BBC\u2019s Newsnight last week that \u201dbusiness does not have any interest in delaying that because that is uncertainty magnified\u201d. Data from the Covid Symptom Tracker app suggests the number of new coronavirus cases in Britain has halved in a week, with fewer than 5,000 people being infected each day. Last week, the estimate was 9,400 new infections per day, but this has been revised by scientists at King\u2019s College London in light of the new data. However, the data does not include figures from Northern Ireland or care homes, where the virus is still thought to be spreading, so the true rate is likely much higher. The figures were based on close to 13,000 swabs taken between 26 May and 6 June and then extrapolated to the wider population. MailOnline has the story. Good morning. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, joining the blog for the rest of the day. Please feel free to get in touch to share news tips and stories we should be covering. Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ At his press conference yesterday Boris Johnson did not try to contest the claim from Prof Neil Ferguson that he could have halved the coronavirus death toll by launching the lockdown a week earlier. Johnson just said that trying to make that assessment now was \u201cpremature\u201d. But this morning, in an interview with Sky News, the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith strongly challenged Ferguson\u2019s claim. He said: The truth is that we has actually peaked in infection rates before we went into lockdown, and that was therefore coming already down. And he went on to allege that Ferguson and his epidemiological modelling was discredited. Duncan Smith said: I think this piece of information comes from the man who ran the Imperial College model which has been now roundly trashed by almost every single scientist, particularly in Oxford and Edinburgh. And so my point is, be very careful: you get scientists and they disagree with each other about these. The government acted on the advice of the science at the time. The Imperial College model has its critics, but the idea that it has been \u201croundly trashed\u201d is just wrong. Ferguson is no longer a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (he resigned over a lockdown breach), but in its minutes Sage said he had made \u201can important contribution\u201d and the modelling produced by his team is still being used by Sage as it advises government. Duncan Smith\u2019s argument about the epidemic peaking before the lockdown was announced seems to have been lifted an article by the Spectator editor Fraser Nelson that he posted on Twitter yesterday. In his article Nelson claims: \u201cInfections peaked about five days before lockdown and were in fast decline by the time it was introduced.\u201d His source for this is a paper (pdf) by the Bristol University statistician Prof Simon Wood. Wood used death figures to work backwards and infer the fatal infection rate in early March. But Nelson\u2019s argument been contested. Last night, after I posted the Nelson tweet in the blog, Dr David Shaw from the Care and Public Health Research Institute at Maastricht University got in touch to say that Nelson was wrong to refer to the infection rate peaking before lockdown was announced. \u201cIt\u2019s not the infection rate, but the DEATH from infection rate, and there are all sorts of reasons why the death rate might start coming down before the infection rate, not least the massive ramping up of ICU capacity,\u201d Shaw pointed out. The UK government is making great play of its spending in Scotland to help companies furlough staff and fund business bail-out programmes, as deep strains emerge between the Tories and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said the data showed the Treasury\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d package of support has allowed 628,200 jobs in Scotland to be furloughed, including 58,000 people in Edinburgh and 74,000 in Glasgow. Another 146,000 people were given self-employed income support. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, said billions of pounds were being spentment, including an additional \u00a33.5bn in direct funding to the Scottish government through the Barnett formula. \u201cThe UK government is doing whatever it takes to get Scotland, and the whole of the UK, through the coronavirus pandemic and ensure our economy can get back on track,\u201d Jack said. The announcement comes against a backdrop of open conflict between the Scottish Tories and Sturgeon over her handling of the pandemic, which is coming under increasing attack from opposition parties at Holyrood, including the normally friendly Scottish Greens. While Sturgeon and her health secretary, Jeane Freeman, have faced heavy criticism for mishandling care home and community Covid-19 testing, Sturgeon\u2019s popularity has soared during the pandemic, largely due to her assured daily coronavirus briefings. A Panelbase poll earlier in June found 59% of voters were now more confident about how an independent Scotland would be governed, thanks to her leadership during the crisis. Patients are missing out on vital treatments, diagnostic tests and outpatient appointments due to the coronavirus pandemic, new data shows, as waiting times soar across NHS England. The full extent of the monumental pressure the NHS came under at the height of the Covid-19 crisis and the effect the crisis has had on patients is laid bare in the latest data. Cancer The number of people entering treatment for cancer has dropped significantly meaning many patients who would have ordinarily been tested for cancer were not seen. In April 2019 almost 200,000 people were referred to a consultant for suspected cancer by their GPs. This April that figure fell to just 79,573. MacMillan says approximately 210,000 people should have entered the system in April. That means roughly 130,000 people who would ordinarily be referred to a consultant have not been. Around 7% of these patients would usually require cancer treatment meaning around 9,000 people might not have had their cancer diagnosed in April. Diagnostics Patients requiring certain diagnostic tests - such as MRI scans, echocardiograms and colonoscopies - for six weeks or more soared to 468,622 making April the worst month on record. On average in the year to January 5,741 patients were waiting more than six weeks for an MRI scan. That figure stood at almost 79,000 in April. Referrals to treatment The median length of time patients are waiting on the referral for treatment stood at 12.2 weeks in April, the longest they have been in well over a decade. More than a million patients are now waiting for more than 18 weeks for treatment. The number of patients waiting over a year for a test jumped from 1,613 in February to 11,042 in April, a seven-fold increase in just two months. A&amp;E Having fallen to an all time low in April the number of people attending major A&amp;E departments rose again in May, from 689,720 to 924,215. In the year prior to the crisis hitting A&amp;E attendances averaged at 1.3m. When other A&amp;E attendances are included (single specialty and minor injury units) 1.3m people attended A&amp;E departments in May, the second lowest number since records began. NHS England figures also show that a total of 79,573 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in April 2020, down from 199,217 in April 2019 - a fall of 60%. This is the number of people seen by a cancer doctor within two weeks of being referred. Urgent breast cancer referrals showed an even bigger drop: down from 16,753 in April 2019 to 3,759 in April 2020, a fall of 78%. The charity Pregnant Then Screwed, which campaigns to end discrimination against mothers, is threatening legal action against the government over its self-employment income support scheme (SEISS), which funds those affected by the pandemic. The scheme - introduced in April by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer - initially provided a payment of 80% of average earnings over three years, capped at \u00a37,500. It has since been extended to the end of August at a slightly lower rate. The charity claims the eligibility conditions and calculation methods chosen by Sunak have a discriminatory effect on women since they do not exempt periods of maternity leave. Pregnant Then Screwed believes almost 70,000 women may be affected. It is asking the chancellor to take immediate steps to change SEISS so that time out for maternity leave is discounted when average earnings are calculated. Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said: The chancellor has failed to consider the disproportionately negative impact on vulnerable new mothers when setting up this scheme. Rishi Sunak has been questioned on this in parliament, but he continues to ignore the problem. We have spoken to so many women about this topic, they are angry, they are in financial hardship and they are struggling to understand why they aren\u2019t being listened to. The government is not fulfilling [its] public sector equality duty. It is important that they are held to account for this. It is imperative these new mothers are given a voice. Anna Dews of Leigh Day Solicitors, which is advising the charity, said: The Covid-19 pandemic is a public health crisis that affects everyone. Its impact, however, is not equal. Our existing health and socio-economic inequalities mean women in particular are bearing the brunt of this health emergency in many different ways. The financial support package put in place by the government must not add to this negative impact. Our client is calling for its immediate reform and for its current discriminatory approach to be removed.\u201d The Queen has taken part in a video call with the Princess Royal and carers supported by the Carers Trust. The monarch chatted with four carers and the trust\u2019s chief executive, Gareth Howells, on 4 June from Windsor Castle. In a video released on the monarchy\u2019s Twitter account, the Queen could be heard saying: Interesting listening to all your tales and stories. I\u2019m very impressed by what you have achieved already. I\u2019m very glad to have been able to join you today. According to the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, is sending a junior minister to answer the Commons urgent questions about his intervention in a planning decision that helped the Tory donor Richard Desmond. The lockdown appears to have had a disproportionate negative impact on disabled people, a report from the Office for National Statistics out this morning says. On the basis of a survey, it found that in May disabled people were more likely to be worried about a range of issues than their non-disabled counterparts. It said: A higher proportion of disabled people than non-disabled people were worried about the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on their well-being (62.4% for disabled people compared with 49.6% of non-disabled people); their access to groceries, medication and essentials (44.9% compared with 21.9%); their access to health care and treatment for non-coronavirus-related issues (40.6% compared with 21.2%); and their health (20.2% compared with 7.3%) in May 2020. As this chart shows, disabled people were also more likely to be feeling stressed or anxious, and feeling lonely. David Ainslie, from the disability analysis branch at the ONS, said: An ongoing part of ONS\u2019s work is looking at inequalities in society. This is reflected in the way the pandemic is impacting on different groups. Disabled people are becoming more concerned about their mental health and experiencing feelings of loneliness as time goes on, whereas among non-disabled adults these concerns remain stable. A&amp;E attendances at hospitals in England were down 42% last month compared with a year ago, new figures show. A total of 1.3m attendances were recorded in May 2020, down from 2.2m in May 2019. NHS England, which published the figures, said the fall was \u201clikely to be a result of the Covid-19 response\u201d - an indication that people have continued to stay away from A&amp;E departments because of the coronavirus outbreak. The year-on-year drop in A&amp;E attendances of 42% in May compares with a fall of 57% recorded in April. More than a fifth of usual household spending has not been possible during the lockdown, Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis has found. In the financial year ending March 2019, UK households spent an average of \u00a3182 per week on activities that have since been largely prevented by government guidelines - such as travel, holidays and meals out. This is equivalent to 22% of a usual weekly budget of \u00a3831, money that households could be saving, spending in other areas or using to cover any loss of income, the ONS said. Sir Simon Rattle has said orchestras need \u201cclarity\u201d from the government on their future - or they \u201cmay not survive\u201d. The music director of the London Symphony Orchestra said orchestras could face a \u201cdevastated landscape on the other side\u201d of the pandemic. In a joint letter to the Guardian with Sir Mark Elder, music director of the Halle Orchestra, he said musicians feel \u201cout in the wilderness\u201d. They wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this - orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality.\u201d They added: \u201cWe must find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline of when that might be and how it can be implemented. \u201cWe understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before - we will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems.\u201d They went on: \u201cWe refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism.\u201d Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here is the agenda showing what\u2019s coming up. 9.30am: The Office for National Statitics publishes new coronavirus data, including a report on household spending and a report on the impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities. 9.30am: HMRC publishes figures on the take-up of the coronavirus job retention scheme. 10.30am: Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, answers a Commons urgent question about his intervention in a planning decision that helped the Tory donor Richard Desmond. 11.30am: Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, makes a statement to MPs about reforms to the probation service. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments hold their daily briefings. 2pm: The Department of Health and Social Care is due to publish figures about the number of people being contacted through test and trace. 5pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is due to take the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. Asked if he believed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) got it wrong about lockdown timings, Prof Mark Woolhouse, of Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not on Sage, so I can\u2019t speak for the processes that led to that advice. The timing of an intervention for an epidemic like this is extremely complicated. Lockdown is a very drastic measure, so it is no surprise that governments around the world have been very reluctant to implement it. He added: \u201cThe problem is, from my point of view, the scientific advice - and this comes all the way back to the World Health Organization - is the only option we are giving our governments in lockdown. \u201cThat is an extremely crude way to deal with an epidemic of this nature.\u201d Please do get in touch today as my colleague Andrew Sparrow and I live blog. We are keen to hear any news tips, insights or useful bits of information. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Boris Johnson is considering reducing the 2-metre physical-distancing restriction to allow schools in England to reopen fully by September, the Daily Telegraph reports. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, criticised the government\u2019s efforts to get pupils back in class, using an article in the paper to claim \u201cmismanagement\u201d was putting at risk the welfare and education of children. The newspaper reports that Johnson is looking at following World Health Organization advice and reducing physical distancing to 1 metre - guidance already followed by countries including France, Denmark and Singapore. At prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, he promised to \u201ckeep that 2-metre rule under constant review\u201d. Asked about opposition criticism that the government did not act fast enough, the local government minister Simon Clarke told the BBC: I think what we did was that we acted in good faith to try to save both lives and livelihoods. I think that\u2019s been the consistent theme of our approach to this crisis. So, there is a lot of being wise after the fact. I do think that for Labour to try to politicise it in that way, on that issue, feels in poor taste. I don\u2019t recall, frankly, the opposition adopting a hard and fast line that we should be entering full lockdown. Is the worst of the pandemic behind us? Here\u2019s what scientists know so far. Interesting article this morning from Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. She said: My own view is that we can avoid a second wave if governments aggressively contain the virus through testing, tracing and isolating carriers, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as handwashing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it\u2019s needed. The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination. Read the full article here. Hello everyone and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live feed on coronavirus. Please do share any news tips, insights or useful bits of information with me this morning while I blog. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com On 19 March, just a few days before he self-isolated with Covid-19, Boris Johnson told the daily Downing Street briefing that in 12 weeks \u201cwe can turn the tide\u201d. \u201cI am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing,\u201d he said. So has this happened? This is the question asked of local government minister Simon Clarke on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning. \u201cI think the tide has been turned ... the government has tried to make its own assessment based on the best available science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have made decisions in good faith based on available evidence.\u201d He was asked about possibly reducing the 2m social distancing rules, as the government comes under growing pressure from backbench MPs to do so, amid concerns about how this will affect the reopening of schools and the economy. He said that the government knew how \u201climiting\u201d it was and that it was under review. Centrica, which owns British Gas, has said it will cut 5,000 jobs due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on an already declining business. Ofsted\u2019s Amanda Spielman said: Many schools are already showing that within the public health guidance that sets the expectation for these bubbles of 15 children there\u2019s a great deal that can be done. It is also important to remember that within the bubbles social distancing is an aspiration, not an absolute expectation. There needs to be a more \u201ccan do\u201d approach to reopening schools, according to Ofsted. Chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I would like to hear a much more optimistic approach. I think it should be about what we can do, not about what we can\u2019t do. Patients could be left facing delays in receiving tests and treatment as health services restart due to hospitals not being properly equipped to handle the surge in screenings, it has been reported. According to an investigation by The Independent, a mix of workforce shortages and Covid-19 precautions could see the number of people awaiting diagnosis on a range of medical issues reach 10 million this year. President of the Royal College of Pathologists Prof Jo Martin told the paper 97% of NHS labs do not have the number of pathologists required to meet demand. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity to keep up even under normal circumstances. But with the additional catch-up work we will be even further behind,\u201d she said. The Royal College of Radiologists warned that precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus were contributing to a backlog in requested scans. Vice president for clinical radiology Dr Caroline Rubin told the newspaper that radiology departments were running at about 60% capacity. \u201cIn some places patients are being told to wait in their cars until we call them in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to clean between each patient but if it\u2019s a Covid patient it needs a deep clean which can take half an hour or more. \u201cWe stopped virtually all non-urgent imaging at the start of lockdown. Everything has been put on a waiting list and deferred so we have a significant backlog going forward.\u201d The NHS has fast-tracked the rollout of a new type of radiotherapy for cancer patients amid the coronavirus pandemic. NHS England has announced it is accelerating the use of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) which requires fewer doses than standard radiotherapy, cutting the number of hospital visits that potentially vulnerable cancer patients need to make. Where conventional radiotherapy requires 20-30 treatments, SABR is a very precise method using a high dose of radiations and only requiring about five outpatient visits, according to the NHS. The number of coronavirus deaths in the UK could have been halved if the government had introduced the lockdown a week earlier, according to damning testimony from one of the scientists who was advising the government at the time. The stark claim by Prof Neil Ferguson that thousands of lives could have been saved intensified the pressure on the government over its handling of the outbreak, leaving Boris Johnson facing repeated questions at the daily Downing Street press conference.The prime minister insisted it was \u201cpremature\u201d to make judgments about the government\u2019s approach, and said he had taken the steps \u201cthat we thought were right for this country\u201d, on the basis of scientific advice. About 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England, Boris Johnson has said. Mayors in some of England\u2019s biggest cities are warning that local authorities are at risk of going bust with potentially devastating consequences for communities unless the government takes immediate action. Britain\u2019s housing market remains depressed despite a pick-up in enquiries from people looking to buy, but estate agents are expecting a sharp increase in demand for homes with gardens over the next two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The UK coronavirus death toll rose by 245 yesterday, according to the latest government figures, taking the death toll to 41,128 in hospitals, care homes and the community. The UK will experience the worst economic contraction among developed countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new forecast. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts the British economy will shrink by 11.5% in 2020 due to the lockdown imposed since the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Heathrow Airport has launched a voluntary redundancy scheme and warned it cannot rule out further job cuts as it battles to recover from the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had agreed the scheme with unions, which comes just days after it cautioned around 25,000 jobs could be at risk. Chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: Throughout this crisis we have tried to protect frontline jobs but this is no longer sustainable, and we have now agreed a voluntary severance scheme with our union partners. While we cannot rule out further job reductions, we will continue to explore options to minimise the number of job losses. The government is facing increasing pressure to drop the 2m social distancing rule in England. Tory backbenchers, including former cabinet ministers Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Damian Green, say it is essential for the economy. The government has said it is constantly reviewing its coronavirus lockdown guidance. It comes after prime minister Boris Johnson said single adults could be able to stay at one other household from Saturday. No 10 said the plans were in place to help combat loneliness. It does not apply to those who are shielding, or other UK nations. Hello everyone and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live feed on coronavirus.

Desperate times, it seems, call for desperate measures \u2013 and to be fair, getting away with a stolen kettlebell does sound like a pretty high-intensity workout.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s looking like workout equipment is the new toilet paper. People across the US are now hoarding kettlebells, bikes and other home fitness gear. Stores that sell exercise equipment are recording sales boosts of over 600%; in April, a Colorado fitness equipment company made as much money in one day as they would normally make in a month. And in a turn of events worthy of a Portlandia sketch, people are queueing up online \u2013 the one place we go to avoid queues \u2013 to buy overpriced workout equipment marked up by as much as 150%. While many of us may be grieving over the swimsuit bodies that \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 we never would have had, pandemic or not, it seems some people are willing to pay any price to keep in shape. Exactly how much is hard to know. How long is a piece of string? If the price of this $397 jump rope is anything to go by, the answer is: quite a lot. Brompton Bicycles confirmed on Wednesday that they are fully booked with orders for the next seven months and will not be able to fulfil any future orders. These bikes \u2013 most of which cost over $1,000 \u2013 are perhaps useful because they are tiny and can be folded. So, people are buying a commuter bike most loved for its ability to be squeezed into the backs of cabs and on to crowded subways, in a city where ridership levels are at an all-time low, and a normal bike would do the job better. Baffling. So, too, is the fact that homes are currently being put on the market at jacked-up prices, on the basis of having a \u201cPeloton area\u201d (read: a space in the hallway for your $2,000 stationary bike). In some cases, it seems, money truly is the root of all evil. But at least it\u2019s not just us: right now, the whole world seems to be experiencing a great kettlebell drought. In Australia, people buying damaged kettlebells for $400 (but we shouldn\u2019t laugh \u2013 remember when the US suffered an Oatly shortage, the sort of \u201cmilk\u201d you don\u2019t need to stockpile because it has a shelf life of one year?). In Georgia, an iron company has begun mass-producing kettlebells to respond to the need. One New Yorker told the Times that he had his kettlebells repeatedly stolen. Desperate times, it seems, call for desperate measures \u2013 and to be fair, getting away with a stolen kettlebell does sound like a pretty high-intensity workout.",

      "body": "<p>You could tell the news wasn\u2019t going to be that great when we got the cast list. If the new track and trace system had been an overwhelming success, there would have been every chance that Boris Johnson would have rolled out of bed to take the credit. Instead, we got Matt Hancock, everybody\u2019s favourite punchbag, still wearing his favourite pink tie that has so far brought him nothing but bad luck.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to feel just a little sorry for Matt. His vaulting ambition that led him to ignore all his gut instincts about having nothing to do with a Boris Johnson government has brought him nothing but hubris. He knew Boris was a wrong \u2018un from the off. He even said as much during his short-lived campaign to be Tory party leader last summer. But when faced with a choice of acting on principle or grasping whatever cabinet post was going begging, Mattbeth chose the latter.</p> <p>His eyes are now dead, his shoulders slumped. The enjoyment of being on TV at the Downing Street press conference \u2013 The lights! The greasepaint! \u2013 has long since worn off. Because he knows he only ever gets the crap gigs. The ones that no one else wants to do. And even Westminster\u2019s very own Mr Tigger, a man who could once achieve orgasm just by polishing his enamel NHS badge, can\u2019t even muster a veneer of enthusiasm. The briefing is just a chore to be rushed through while giving away as little information as possible.</p> <p>Matt began with the usual white noise. Although the number of cases was actually up from a day earlier, the figures continued to fall. Er, hello?

      "bodyText": "You could tell the news wasn\u2019t going to be that great when we got the cast list. If the new track and trace system had been an overwhelming success, there would have been every chance that Boris Johnson would have rolled out of bed to take the credit. Instead, we got Matt Hancock, everybody\u2019s favourite punchbag, still wearing his favourite pink tie that has so far brought him nothing but bad luck. It\u2019s hard not to feel just a little sorry for Matt. His vaulting ambition that led him to ignore all his gut instincts about having nothing to do with a Boris Johnson government has brought him nothing but hubris. He knew Boris was a wrong \u2018un from the off. He even said as much during his short-lived campaign to be Tory party leader last summer. But when faced with a choice of acting on principle or grasping whatever cabinet post was going begging, Mattbeth chose the latter. His eyes are now dead, his shoulders slumped. The enjoyment of being on TV at the Downing Street press conference \u2013 The lights! The greasepaint! \u2013 has long since worn off. Because he knows he only ever gets the crap gigs. The ones that no one else wants to do. And even Westminster\u2019s very own Mr Tigger, a man who could once achieve orgasm just by polishing his enamel NHS badge, can\u2019t even muster a veneer of enthusiasm. The briefing is just a chore to be rushed through while giving away as little information as possible. Matt began with the usual white noise. Although the number of cases was actually up from a day earlier, the figures continued to fall. Er, hello? It was clear that neither Matt nor the person who had written this crap had bothered to make sure if it made any sense. He had a plan and it was working. It would just have been nice to know that the government had been hell-bent on killing more than 50,000 people \u2013 and counting \u2013 right from the start of the pandemic. Having dispensed with the daily platitudes, Hancock moved on to the results of the first week\u2019s track and trace programme.

      "bodyText": "More than a third of employees in some towns in Britain have been furloughed due to coronavirus, according to figures that also reveal the government\u2019s job retention scheme has now cost almost \u00a320bn. Crawley in Sussex, which sits next to Gatwick airport, had 33.7% of employees furloughed last month while in contrast Cambridge had just under half that proportion at 17.4%. Burnley, Slough, Sunderland and Birmingham were also in the top five towns and cities with the largest percentage of employees sent home after their employers found there was no work for them to do during the coronavirus lockdown. Cambridge headed a list of university towns that boasted the least number of furloughed staff, including Oxford, Exeter and Cardiff. According to analysis by the thinktank Centre for Cities of the first regional breakdown of furlough data published by the government, the scheme is estimated to cost \u00a319.6bn. London was the worst affected region, with Tottenham the capital\u2019s worst affected constituency. The Treasury launched the coronavirus jobs retention scheme (CJRS) in March, allowing companies to send workers home, with the Treasury paying 80% of their usual wage, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month. The government published figures up to 31 May say the scheme has supported more than 6.4 million staff in England, in addition to more than 628,000 jobs in Scotland, 316,500 in Wales and nearly 212,000 furloughed staff in Northern Ireland. The self-employment income support scheme (SEISS), which paid up to \u00a32,500 to self employed workers unable to earn a living, boosted the incomes of 146,000 people in Scotland at a cost of \u00a3425m.

By the end of April, none of these items were left, the report found.</p> <p>Auditors said that officials from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told them that the procurement of PPE had, until April, stuck rigidly to buying exactly what was needed at that time.</p> <p>\u201cThe department told us that the manufacture and supply of PPE has for many years been based on \u2018just in time\u2019 procurement and manufacturing principles,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>They found that one in three homes for the elderly suffered coronavirus outbreaks and confirmed figures released last week by NHS England about the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-care-homes-nhs-hospital-discharges-deaths-a9544671.html\">number of hospital patients</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-care-homes-nhs-hospital-discharges-deaths-a9544671.html\"> discharged to care homes</a>.</p> <p>NHS England and NHS Improvement advice at the time was to urgently discharge from hospital \u201call patients medically fit to leave\u201d in order to free up bed space for coronavirus patients, auditors said.</p> <p>\u201cDue to Government policy at the time, not all patients were tested for Covid-19 before discharge, with priority given to patients with respiratory illness or flu-like symptoms,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The advice was changed on 15 April but the NAO noted that, as of 17 May, one in three care homes had declared a coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1,000 homes dealing with positive cases during the peak of infections in April.</p> <p>Figures show that many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/uk-care-homes-scramble-to-buy-their-own-ppe-as-national-deliveries-fail\">care homes received little PPE from the government</a>. While health settings received a third of the number of eye protectors required from central government, care homes received 5%; hospitals received three quarters of gloves required from central stocks, care homes received 8%; and care homes received no gowns from central stocks.</p> <p>The report also discloses that the government does not know how many NHS or care workers have been tested in total during the pandemic.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the health and social care select committee and a former health secretary, said: \u201cIt seems extraordinary that no one appeared to consider the clinical risk to care homes despite widespread knowledge that the virus could be carried asymptomatically\u201d.</p> <p>Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said it showed that care homes were \u201cat the back of the queue\u201d during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cResidents and staff were an afterthought yet again: out of sight and out of mind, with devastating consequences,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Auditors concluded that the complicated nature of social care provision, including its \u201clack of\u201d integration with the NHS, \u201cmade responding to the crisis more difficult in a number of ways\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, the number of institutions, both national and international, involved in acquiring PPE made the process more onerous.</p> <p>A DHSC spokesperson defended the government\u2019s record, saying the numbers used for judging PPE supply in the NAO report were \u201cmisleading\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe modelled PPE requirements presented in this report are theoretical worst case estimates \u2013 it is misleading to compare them to figures on centrally procured PPE, which do not account for equipment supplied through other routes or existing local stocks,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cSixty per cent of care homes have had no outbreak at all, according to the latest Public Health England statistics.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended to clarify that the numbers of gloves, eye protectors and masks held by PHE in February were in their millions, not thousands. For example there were 156m face masks, not 156,000 as stated in an earlier version.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s plan to distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) during the coronavirus pandemic was undermined because officials failed to stockpile gowns and visors despite warnings to do so, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has revealed. The report published on Friday by the National Audit Office (NAO) said this meant less than half of the expected pieces of certain equipment were handed out to frontline workers as the crisis developed. The only categories of PPE that increased in volume in the government\u2019s stockpile between 24 January and 21 February, when ministers were acutely aware of the pandemic in China, were aprons and clinical waste bags. Health unions and senior MPs have been deeply concerned by the NAO findings, which also confirmed that 25,000 hospital patients were discharged to care homes at the height of the pandemic before testing became routine. About 300 UK health workers have so far died of Covid-19, and many NHS staff groups and families claim inadequate PPE played a key role in exposing them. Susan Masters, a Royal College of Nursing director, said the report shows nursing staff were severely let down. \u201cOur members in working communities, care homes or hospitals, who have had trouble accessing the necessary protective equipment to keep them and their patients safe, will be alarmed to see that a vital opportunity to stockpile adequate equipment was missed,\u201d she said. The report was released on Friday, hours after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the government had not ruled out the introduction of an enforcement mechanism if people failed to comply with the test and trace system. \u201cWe\u2019re not ruling it out at the moment but we don\u2019t think we need it,\u201d he told the No 10 briefing, where it was announced that 41,279 people had died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK - a rise of 151 since Wednesday. The NAO\u2019s report into the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic examined the government\u2019s response to the pandemic since Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, confirmed the first cases of coronavirus on 31 January. The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) recommended in June last year that Public Health England should stockpile gowns and switch from glasses to visors when glasses next required reordering, the report said. In February, Public Health England had 83m gloves \u2013 so 41.5m pairs \u2013 25.7m pairs of eye protectors, and 156m face masks. By the end of April, none of these items were left, the report found. Auditors said that officials from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told them that the procurement of PPE had, until April, stuck rigidly to buying exactly what was needed at that time. \u201cThe department told us that the manufacture and supply of PPE has for many years been based on \u2018just in time\u2019 procurement and manufacturing principles,\u201d the report said. They found that one in three homes for the elderly suffered coronavirus outbreaks and confirmed figures released last week by NHS England about the number of hospital patients discharged to care homes. NHS England and NHS Improvement advice at the time was to urgently discharge from hospital \u201call patients medically fit to leave\u201d in order to free up bed space for coronavirus patients, auditors said. \u201cDue to Government policy at the time, not all patients were tested for Covid-19 before discharge, with priority given to patients with respiratory illness or flu-like symptoms,\u201d the report said. The advice was changed on 15 April but the NAO noted that, as of 17 May, one in three care homes had declared a coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1,000 homes dealing with positive cases during the peak of infections in April. Figures show that many care homes received little PPE from the government. While health settings received a third of the number of eye protectors required from central government, care homes received 5%; hospitals received three quarters of gloves required from central stocks, care homes received 8%; and care homes received no gowns from central stocks. The report also discloses that the government does not know how many NHS or care workers have been tested in total during the pandemic. Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the health and social care select committee and a former health secretary, said: \u201cIt seems extraordinary that no one appeared to consider the clinical risk to care homes despite widespread knowledge that the virus could be carried asymptomatically\u201d. Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said it showed that care homes were \u201cat the back of the queue\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cResidents and staff were an afterthought yet again: out of sight and out of mind, with devastating consequences,\u201d she said. Auditors concluded that the complicated nature of social care provision, including its \u201clack of\u201d integration with the NHS, \u201cmade responding to the crisis more difficult in a number of ways\u201d. Similarly, the number of institutions, both national and international, involved in acquiring PPE made the process more onerous. A DHSC spokesperson defended the government\u2019s record, saying the numbers used for judging PPE supply in the NAO report were \u201cmisleading\u201d. \u201cThe modelled PPE requirements presented in this report are theoretical worst case estimates \u2013 it is misleading to compare them to figures on centrally procured PPE, which do not account for equipment supplied through other routes or existing local stocks,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cSixty per cent of care homes have had no outbreak at all, according to the latest Public Health England statistics.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended to clarify that the numbers of gloves, eye protectors and masks held by PHE in February were in their millions, not thousands. For example there were 156m face masks, not 156,000 as stated in an earlier version.",

      "body": "<p><strong>What&nbsp;was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>Leicester were surpassing expectations, sitting third in the table as a result of performances that suggested Brendan Rodgers is on course to fulfil the club\u2019s aim of building a team with more dimensions than the sensational 2016 title winners. For a while they even looked like they might challenge Liverpool: they racked up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/southampton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">9-0 win at Southampton</a> as part of a club-record eight consecutive top-flight wins, all while playing with verve, skill and intelligence. That dream ended in December with consecutive defeats by Manchester City and Liverpool.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/29/brendan-rodgers-reveals-both-he-and-his-wife-have-had-coronavirus\">Leicester's Brendan Rodgers reveals he and his wife had coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, in the new year, Leicester were hit hard by the injury to their inspirational midfielder Wilfried Ndidi, winning only one league game in seven. But when he returned to full fitness, Leicester regained their best form. In their last match before lockdown they showed their attacking might with a 4-0 thrashing of Aston Villa, with Jamie Vardy seemingly back to his best and Harvey Barnes demonstrating the ability that will make him great if he produces it more regularly.</p> <p><strong>What about now? </strong>That match against Villa was not all sunlight: Ricardo Pereira suffered a knee injury that will prevent him from playing in the remainder of the season. He will be difficult to replace because he is one of the best right-backs in the league, secure defensively and superb going forward. James Justin has impressed in his few outings since joining from Luton last summer and will now get a chance to show what he can do consistently. Meanwhile, the exceptionally talented left-back Ben Chilwell, who has had some worrying off-days this season, needs to recapture the form that has led to Chelsea being linked with a big transfer bid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>Their gifted young players must demonstrate they can sustain top performances during a high-stakes run-in. Losing the Carabao Cup semi-final to Aston Villa was a wounding blow. Qualifying for the Champions League would be an admirable achievement and they go into their last nine matches with an eight-point lead over fifth-place Manchester United \u2013 whom they host in their final game of the season. More consistency from Barnes, Chilwell, Youri Tielemans and Demarai Gray would be particularly welcome and, of course, Justin will have to rise to a big challenge. To help focus their minds Rodgers recommended his emerging talents devote part of lockdown to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/the-last-dance-spectacular-michael-jordan-netflix\"> watching The Last Dance</a>, the Netflix documentary about Michael Jordan. \u201cIf you want to know what being elite is and what being at the very top level in terms of preparation is, and focus and improvement and being better and winning, this is what you should be watching,\u201d&nbsp;he said.</p> <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>No breaches were reported. The main concern was for the wellbeing of Rodgers, who fell ill with coronavirus two weeks after their last match. \u201cI wasn\u2019t well and it was later detected I had the virus,\u201d&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;\u201cA week after that, my wife had it. We spent about three weeks feeling the effects. We were nowhere near as bad as a lot of people but we lost our smell and taste for three weeks. We lost our strength, so I had a little feeling of whatever it must be like. It was tough.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Kasper Schmeichel donated \u00a320,000 to Age UK in March. \u201cLet\u2019s do all we can to help the elderly,\u201d the goalkeeper said.</p> <p><strong>Key player in the run-in? </strong>Ndidi. The Nigerian secures central midfield, providing assurance to Leicester\u2019s fine defence and talented attackers. Without him Leicester are not as confident or secure. Even though Kelechi Iheanacho has improved so much he often warrants a start ahead of Ayoze P\u00e9rez, Leicester remain quite dependent on Vardy, still the best finisher at the club.</p>  <figure

      "bodyText": "What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Leicester were surpassing expectations, sitting third in the table as a result of performances that suggested Brendan Rodgers is on course to fulfil the club\u2019s aim of building a team with more dimensions than the sensational 2016 title winners. For a while they even looked like they might challenge Liverpool: they racked up a 9-0 win at Southampton as part of a club-record eight consecutive top-flight wins, all while playing with verve, skill and intelligence. That dream ended in December with consecutive defeats by Manchester City and Liverpool. Then, in the new year, Leicester were hit hard by the injury to their inspirational midfielder Wilfried Ndidi, winning only one league game in seven. But when he returned to full fitness, Leicester regained their best form. In their last match before lockdown they showed their attacking might with a 4-0 thrashing of Aston Villa, with Jamie Vardy seemingly back to his best and Harvey Barnes demonstrating the ability that will make him great if he produces it more regularly. What about now? That match against Villa was not all sunlight: Ricardo Pereira suffered a knee injury that will prevent him from playing in the remainder of the season. He will be difficult to replace because he is one of the best right-backs in the league, secure defensively and superb going forward. James Justin has impressed in his few outings since joining from Luton last summer and will now get a chance to show what he can do consistently. Meanwhile, the exceptionally talented left-back Ben Chilwell, who has had some worrying off-days this season, needs to recapture the form that has led to Chelsea being linked with a big transfer bid. What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Their gifted young players must demonstrate they can sustain top performances during a high-stakes run-in. Losing the Carabao Cup semi-final to Aston Villa was a wounding blow. Qualifying for the Champions League would be an admirable achievement and they go into their last nine matches with an eight-point lead over fifth-place Manchester United \u2013 whom they host in their final game of the season. More consistency from Barnes, Chilwell, Youri Tielemans and Demarai Gray would be particularly welcome and, of course, Justin will have to rise to a big challenge. To help focus their minds Rodgers recommended his emerging talents devote part of lockdown to watching The Last Dance, the Netflix documentary about Michael Jordan. \u201cIf you want to know what being elite is and what being at the very top level in terms of preparation is, and focus and improvement and being better and winning, this is what you should be watching,\u201d he said. Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? No breaches were reported. The main concern was for the wellbeing of Rodgers, who fell ill with coronavirus two weeks after their last match. \u201cI wasn\u2019t well and it was later detected I had the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cA week after that, my wife had it. We spent about three weeks feeling the effects. We were nowhere near as bad as a lot of people but we lost our smell and taste for three weeks. We lost our strength, so I had a little feeling of whatever it must be like. It was tough.\u201d Any unsung/community heroes? Kasper Schmeichel donated \u00a320,000 to Age UK in March. \u201cLet\u2019s do all we can to help the elderly,\u201d the goalkeeper said. Key player in the run-in? Ndidi. The Nigerian secures central midfield, providing assurance to Leicester\u2019s fine defence and talented attackers. Without him Leicester are not as confident or secure. Even though Kelechi Iheanacho has improved so much he often warrants a start ahead of Ayoze P\u00e9rez, Leicester remain quite dependent on Vardy, still the best finisher at the club. End-of-season prediction Leicester will finish in the top four and could satisfy their craving for a trophy by landing the FA Cup.

As the economy reopens and people return to work, person-to-person contact will increase and an already \u201cshocking number of infections and deaths among workers will rise,\u201d the union said.</p> <p>In its two-page ruling, the appeals court said OSHA is authorized to issue an emergency temporary standard, or ETS, if it determines that employees are exposed to grave danger from a new hazard in the workplace, and that an emergency rule is needed to protect them from that danger.</p> <p>The decision not to issue an ETS \u201cis entitled to considerable deference,\u2019\u2019 the court said.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the regulatory tools that the OSHA has at its disposal to ensure that employers are maintaining hazard-free work environments, OSHA reasonably determined that an ETS is not necessary at this time,\u2019\u2019 the ruling said.</p> <p>The ruling was signed by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao. Henderson and Rao were appointed by Republican presidents and Wilkins by a Democrat.</p> <p>The Labor Department said in a statement Thursday that officials were pleased at the ruling, which backed its contention that existing rules and regulations are protecting Americas workers and that an emergency temporary standard is not needed.</p> <p>\u201cOSHA will continue to enforce the law and offer guidance to employers and employees to keep Americas workplaces safe, said the statement, issued by Loren Sweatt, a top Labor Department official who oversees OSHA, and Kate OScannlain, the department\u2019s top lawyer.</p> <p>OSHA\u2019s performance came under fire at a contentious House hearing last month, in which Democrats accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic.</p> <p>Instead of an emergency standard, OSHA has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps.</p> <p>But the guidance is not mandatory, and Covid-19 cases have spiked at meatpacking plants, prisons, nursing homes and other workplaces deemed essential during the pandemic.</p> <p>AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said he was disappointed that three federal judges \u201cdid not deem the lives of Americas workers worthy of holding an argument or issuing a full opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe post-it length response to the union\u2019s lawsuit acknowledges the unprecedented\u201d nature of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cbut repeats the false claim by Big Business that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration already has done what is needed to protect workers,\u2019\u2019 Trumka said in a statement.</p> <p>More than two million Americans have

Please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. President Trump\u2019s campaign invites for rallies now includes a coronavirus disclaimer, CNN notes. Organisers of the Coachella music festival said that the event would no longer take place this year because of the coronavirus pandemic but announced new dates for April 2021. The event in California and its sister event Stagecoach for country music were rescheduled earlier this year from April until October. But officials in Riverside County on Wednesday cancelled the October event because of continuing concerns over Covid-19. \u201cWe have every intention of returning in 2021. As of now, Coachella weekend one will take place April 9-11, 2021 and weekend two will be April 16-18, 2021. Stagecoach is set for April 23-25, 2021,\u201d organisers Goldenvoice said in a statement on Thursday. It said details of the 2021 lineup would be announced at a later date and that tickets sold for 2020 would be honored in 2021. The 2020 lineup was to have included Frank Ocean, Rage Against the Machine, and Travis Scott. The Trump administration does not have to issue an emergency rule requiring employers to protect workers from the coronavirus, a federal appeals court ruled. The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declared that the Labor Department\u2019s workplace safety arm reasonably determined that an emergency rule \u201cis not necessary at this time.\u201d A top labour union sued the Occupational Health and Safety Administration last month seeking to compel it to issue an emergency temporary standard on the coronavirus. The AFL-CIO said in filing the suit that tens of thousands of workers have been infected on the job through exposure to infected patients, co-workers and unscreened members of the public. As the economy reopens and people return to work, person-to-person contact will increase and an already \u201cshocking number of infections and deaths among workers will rise,\u201d the union said. In its two-page ruling, the appeals court said OSHA is authorized to issue an emergency temporary standard, or ETS, if it determines that employees are exposed to grave danger from a new hazard in the workplace, and that an emergency rule is needed to protect them from that danger. The decision not to issue an ETS \u201cis entitled to considerable deference,\u2019\u2019 the court said. \u201cIn light of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the regulatory tools that the OSHA has at its disposal to ensure that employers are maintaining hazard-free work environments, OSHA reasonably determined that an ETS is not necessary at this time,\u2019\u2019 the ruling said. The ruling was signed by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao. Henderson and Rao were appointed by Republican presidents and Wilkins by a Democrat. The Labor Department said in a statement Thursday that officials were pleased at the ruling, which backed its contention that existing rules and regulations are protecting Americas workers and that an emergency temporary standard is not needed. \u201cOSHA will continue to enforce the law and offer guidance to employers and employees to keep Americas workplaces safe, said the statement, issued by Loren Sweatt, a top Labor Department official who oversees OSHA, and Kate OScannlain, the department\u2019s top lawyer. OSHA\u2019s performance came under fire at a contentious House hearing last month, in which Democrats accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic. Instead of an emergency standard, OSHA has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps. But the guidance is not mandatory, and Covid-19 cases have spiked at meatpacking plants, prisons, nursing homes and other workplaces deemed essential during the pandemic. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said he was disappointed that three federal judges \u201cdid not deem the lives of Americas workers worthy of holding an argument or issuing a full opinion.\u201d \u201cThe post-it length response to the union\u2019s lawsuit acknowledges the unprecedented\u201d nature of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cbut repeats the false claim by Big Business that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration already has done what is needed to protect workers,\u2019\u2019 Trumka said in a statement. More than two million Americans have been infected with Covid-19, and more than 110,000 have died, according a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Twitter said it removed more than 170,000 accounts tied to a Beijing-backed influence operation that deceptively spread messages favorable to the Chinese government, including about coronavirus. The company suspended a core network of 23,750 highly active accounts, as well as a larger network of about 150,000 \u201camplifier\u201d accounts used to boost the core accounts\u2019 content. Twitter, along with researchers who analyzed the accounts, said the network was largely an echo chamber of fake accounts without much further traction. The company also removed two smaller state-backed operations which it attributed to Russia and Turkey, both focused on domestic audiences. Twitter said the Chinese network had links to an earlier state-backed operation dismantled last year by Twitter, Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube that had been pushing misleading narratives about political dynamics in Hong Kong. The new operation likewise focused heavily on Hong Kong, but also promoted messages about the coronavirus pandemic, exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui and Taiwan, the researchers said. Renee DiResta, at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the network\u2019s coronavirus activity ramped up in late January, as the outbreak spread beyond China, and spiked in March. \u201cAccounts praised China\u2019s response to the virus, while also using the pandemic to antagonise the United States and Hong Kong activists\u201d, she said. Open-source researchers at Graphika and Bellingcat had earlier flagged the re-emergence of the so-called \u201cSpamouflage Dragon\u201d network, after it went dormant following the companies\u2019 takedowns last summer. The US State Department said in May it had found a network of inauthentic Twitter accounts with \u201chighly probable\u201d linkages to China disseminating false coronavirus claims. Twitter pushed back on the assertions at the time, saying the 5,000 accounts the agency identified included legitimate non-governmental organizations and journalists. A Twitter spokeswoman on Thursday said the network it removed was not related to what the State Department had identified. Oscar-winning Mexican directors Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu joined actress Salma Hayek to set up a fund to help support movie industry workers out of work due to the pandemic. The Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences announced the fund Thursday. Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu spoke via a video call. \u201cThis was an act of solidarity with our colleagues in this industry, without asking anybody else besides ourselves\u201d, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said. The fund has raised about $440,000 so far, and more donations are expected. Each beneficiary will get a one-time payment of about $885. The money will go first to technical workers like set, costume, sound and visual employees left without work after most productions stopped filming amid the pandemic. First in line will be those who are suffering health problems or who are sole breadwinners. La Corriente del Golfo, a company founded by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Diego Luna, also contributed to the fund, as did many other Mexican and international production companies. The Academy estimates that about 30,000 movie production workers have lost their incomes as a result of the industry shut-down. The government and industry leaders have not announced any date for resuming production. Saudi Arabia is to resume sports activities behind closed doors from June 21, according to state media. It includes returning to training. Playing matches will start after August 4th with decisions left to each sport\u2019s union. The Duke of Cambridge has warned that society faces mental health \u201crepercussions\u201d from Covid-19 as the FA Cup Final in England was renamed after his campaign supporting football fans. Prince William believes the coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and left many people isolated by the lockdown, will cause psychological problems in the future. His comments were followed by the Football Association\u2019s (FA) announcement this year\u2019s final would be renamed from the Emirates to the Heads Up FA Cup Final, after the duke\u2019s Heads Up initiative which aims to raise awareness of mental health and encourage football supporters to speak about their problems or support a fellow fan. In a video call to Arsenal football club head coach Mikel Arteta and some of his staff and players, William said: \u201cI\u2019m really pleased that you guys are all coming back to football soon. \u201cAnd, as you can see behind me, I\u2019ve got the FA Cup, it\u2019s going to be named the Heads Up FA Cup - which is great news. So we\u2019re going to really use the final as a moment to promote good, positive mental health for everyone.\u201d Arteta, who contracted Covid-19 in March, said of players\u2019 mental health during coronavirus: \u201cYou have to create a safe environment for them to be able to talk to you directly without feeling judged, or (worrying) whether that\u2019s going to have consequences for them, whether they\u2019re going to play or not, or my feelings towards them. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been trying to do over the last 12 weeks, by trying to talk individually so they can raise those feelings, their issues, and we can build the club culture that I want, which is based on respect.\u201d Air Canada\u2019s chief executive officer, Calin Rovinescu, has urged the Canadian government to relax travel restrictions as they have been hurting the company\u2019s sales, Bloomberg News reported. Rovinescu called the government\u2019s curbs on travelers \u201cdisproportionate\u201d as the COVID-19 pandemic was easing in many parts of the country. \u201cEnable us to do some reasonable amounts of business,\u201d he said, according to the report, while speaking on a webcast with publishing and event production company Aviation Week. Rovinescu\u2019s remarks were in the context of a letter sent to prime minister, Justin Trudeau, from the Canadian travel and tourism industry, calling for a national plan to cut back pandemic travel restrictions, Air Canada said. Canada and the United States are set to extend a ban on non-essential travel to late July as both countries seek to control the spread of the new coronavirus, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Airlines, including Air Canada, have been among the worst hit as coronavirus-led travel bans resulted in thousands of flight cancellations, forcing carriers to cut jobs and costs as revenue dried up. Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison will discuss relaxing Covid-19 measures. Brazil reported a total of 802,828 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, with 30,412 new infections in the last 24 hours in the world\u2019s second worst outbreak after the United States. With another 1,239 fatalities, the death toll in Brazil has reached 40,919, the health ministry said, the world\u2019s third highest after the United States and the UK. Of the total cases of Covid-19, 345,595 have recovered, the ministry said. There are calls for a Republican lawmaker to resign after he questioned on the Senate floor if the \u201ccoloured population\u201d is contracting coronavirus at disproportionate rates because they do not wash their hands as well as other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union called for GOP Sen. Steve Huffman to step down from office following his remarks that were made during a hearing for a resolution to declare racism a public health crisis. Huffman, who is also a Dayton-area emergency room physician, caused controversy after he questioned Angela Dawson, executive director of the Ohio Commission of Minority Health, on Tuesday over why the COVID-19 rates for black Ohioans were higher than other populations. \u201cCould it just be that African Americans or the coloured population do not wash their hands as well as other groups? Or wear masks? Or do not socially distance themselves?\u201d Huffman asked during Senate testimony. \u201cCould that just be the explanation of why theres a higher incidence? Dawson, who is black, responded: \u201cThat is not the opinion of leading medical experts in this country.\u201d Dawson was among a number of people testifying in support for the resolution that would establish a variety of resources to address racism in the state. Shibani Chettri, an epidemiology PhD student and researcher at Ohio State University, also testified Tuesday as a proponent for the resolution and said witnessing Huffman\u2019s comments was egregious. \u201cThis really brings attention to how we need to do a better job of addressing pervasive racism in health care if a sitting senator and medical professional can ask these sort of patronizing and racist questions\u201d, Chettri said. In a statement, Huffman said he regretted how his question was perceived. \u201cI asked a question in an unintentionally awkward way that was perceived as hurtful and was exactly the opposite of what I meant,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI was trying to focus on why Covid-19 affects people of color at a higher rate since we really do not know all the reasons.\u201d Friday\u2019s UK edition of The Guardian. The UK has scrapped plans for full border checks with the EU on January 1st amid pressures caused by the pandemic, according to Friday\u2019s edition of the Financial Times. It reports that Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has accepted that businesses cannot cope with problems caused by the outbreak and deal with post-Brexit disruption at the border and is considering a temporary light-touch system at ports. There was no \u201cpatient zero\u201d in the UK\u2019s Covid-19 epidemic, according to research showing that the infection was introduced on at least 1,300 occasions. The findings, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, have prompted further criticism that opportunities to suppress the spread of infection in February and March were missed. The study by the consortium \u2013 which was set up to sequence the virus\u2019s genetic code \u2013 shows that introduction of the virus into the UK peaked in mid-March at a time when infection rates were surging in European countries, but before the government clamped down on non-essential travel. Had travel restrictions and quarantine requirements been introduced a week earlier, overall case numbers in the UK may have been far lower, critics say. Read the full story here British Airways is selling some of its multi-million-pound art collection to raise cash to help it through the pandemic. The collection includes pieces by Damien Hirst, Bridget Riley and Peter Doig with one work believed to have been valued at more than \u00a31 million. It is understood at least 10 pieces have been identified for sale by the airline. Madeleine McCann\u2019s grandmother has died of suspected coronavirus, just weeks before police announced a major breakthrough in the investigation into her missing granddaughter. Eileen McCann, 80, passed away last month. Madeleine\u2019s parents Kate and Gerry attended her socially distanced funeral in St Conval\u2019s, East Renfrewshire in Scotland, near to where she lived, according to reports. The family\u2019s spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: \u201cThe family will definitely not be commenting on a private family matter.\u201d The total number of Covid-19 cases worldwide has reached 7,440,350, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US has the highest number of cases with 2,013,940 followed by Brazil with 772,416. The global death toll from coronavirus is creeping towards 419,000. The figure stands at 418,392, according to Johns Hopkins University which is based in the US. The US is the country with the highest death toll which stands at 113,467. Brazilian officials have announced an agreement with China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech to produce its coronavirus vaccine in Sao Paulo, where tests involving 9,000 volunteers are to begin next month. France\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 27 on Thursday, versus an average daily increase of 50 over the last 15 days, to 29,346, the fifth-highest total in the world. On Wednesday, 23 Covid-19 deaths were reported. Only one of the six commissioners on Scott Morrison\u2019s Covid-19 commission has volunteered to release their conflicts of interest, prompting calls for greater transparency from the publicly funded body. The Australian government has refused to release the conflict-of-interest declarations for members of its National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC), a prominent advisory body shaping non-health aspects of the Covid-19 strategy. Following criticism over officers not wearing face masks including from lawyers, protesters and the mayor, the New York Police Department have issued a bizarre response, claiming: \u201cWe can put our energy to better use\u201d. Almost half of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers detected in Bahrain were found to pose a risk of spreading the virus to others, according to research by the country\u2019s coronavirus taskforce. Deaths from Covid-19 in Italy climbed by 53 on Thursday against 71 the day before, Reuters reports, citing the country\u2019s civil protection agency, pushing the total to death toll from the outbreak to 34,167. European Union officials and experts have said that Europe could face a surge of coronavirus infections in coming weeks as a result of the mass anti-racism protests that have spread across the continent. Global equity markets fell sharply on Thursday in their worst sell-off since markets crashed in March, while safe-haven assets rose after the US Federal Reserve\u2019s sobering outlook cast doubt on hopes for a V-shaped recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. A broad rout slammed Wall Street, a 10-day winning streak in Asia came to a halt and major European bourses fell about 4%, ending a recent rally that had recouped much of the market\u2019s deep losses and even drove the Nasdaq to record highs this week. US Treasury and euro zone government bonds rallied after the Fed signaled it plans years of extraordinary support to counter the economic fallout from a still spreading pandemic. US gold futures settled more than 1% higher and the dollar, yen and Swiss franc all benefited from safe-haven flows as Wall Street slumped. The latest unemployment numbers from the Labor Department show 1.5 million more people applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total number of Americans who lost their jobs since mid-March to 44.2 million. It comes as the number of Covid-19 cases in the US reached 2,012,767, according to Johns Hopkins University. Sweden\u2019s decision to leave schools open for under-16s during the pandemic did not lead to any major outbreaks of Covid 19, according to Anna Ekstrom, the country\u2019s education minister. She said research by the Swedish Public Health Agency showed that Swedes working in education had not been more likely to be diagnosed with coronavirus than those in occupations. Schools for older pupils and universities have been given the go-ahead to reopen from 15 June but for summer schools and courses only. From Saturday, Swedes without any Covid-19 symptoms can travel within the country. On Sunday, elite sports can resume although no fans will be allowed to attend. Surgeons in Chicago have given a new set of lungs to a young woman with severe lung damage from coronavirus. Northwestern Medicine on Thursday announced the procedure, which took place last Friday. Only a few other COVID-19 survivors, in China and Europe, have received lung transplants. The unnamed Chicago patient is in her twenties and was on a ventilator and heart-lung machine for almost two months before her operation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The 10-hour procedure was challenging because the virus had left her lungs full of holes and almost fused to the chest wall, said Dr. Ankit Bharat, who performed the operation. She remains on a ventilator while her body heals but is well enough to visit with family via phone video and doctors say her chances for a normal life are good. \u201cWe are anticipating that she will have a full recovery\u201d, said Dr. Rade Tomic, medical director of the hospital\u2019s lung transplant program. The patient had recently moved to Chicago from North Carolina to be with her boyfriend. Following widespread criticism over officers not wearing face masks including from lawyers, protesters and the mayor, the New York Police Department have issued a bizarre response, claiming: \u201cWe can put our energy to better use.\u201d The statement, sent out in response to questions over why the majority of officers do not appear to be wearing masks, referenced the weather, long days and uniforms, but makes no reference to coronavirus or public health in the middle of a pandemic. \u201cPerhaps it was the heat. Perhaps it was the 15-hour tours, wearing bullet resistant vests in the sun. Perhaps it was the helmets,\u201d Sergeant Jessica McRorie, a spokesperson for the deputy commissioner for public information, said. \u201cWith everything New York city has been through in the past two weeks and everything we are working towards together, we can put our energy to a better use.\u201d It comes after legal experts warned of \u201cabysmal\u201dconditions for protesters who they said were being unnecessarily arrested and detained for as long as 48 hours without access to masks, food and water. The Legal Aid Society told the Guardian that police officers \u201crarely\u201d wear masks and are endangering protesters\u2019 health and safety. On Sunday, the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, called on NYPD officers to wear masks, accusing them of \u201cflouting the rules\u201d. Brazilian officials have announced an agreement with China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech to produce its coronavirus vaccine in Sao Paulo, where tests involving 9,000 volunteers are to begin next month. Brazil has the world\u2019s second-highest coronavirus caseload after the United States, with more than 770,000 confirmed infections and nearly 40,000 deaths. Sao Paulo governor, Joao Doria, told a news conference that the Butantan Institute, Brazil\u2019s leading research center, had reached a technology transfer agreement with Sinovac Biotech. \u201cThe studies show that the vaccine could be distributed by June 2021,\u201d if tests prove conclusive, Doria said. \u201cThis agreement would allow us to produce at large scale and immunize millions of Brazilians.\u201d Sinovac Biotech, one of four Chinese laboratories authorised to conduct clinical vaccine trials, said a month ago that it was prepared to produce 100 million doses of the vaccine under the commercial name Coronavac. In Sao Paulo, 9,000 volunteers will be injected with doses of that vaccine beginning in mid-July, in the third and final phase of testing. Last week, Sao Paulo State University announced that a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford will be tested among 2,000 Brazilian volunteers beginning in mid-June. Doria used the unveiling of the Sinovac Biotech deal, which he described as \u201chistoric,\u201d to criticise President Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cWe have had to overcome Brazil\u2019s disagreements with China, with other countries and with organizations like the WHO,\u201d he said, referring to criticism of China by several of Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet ministers. In March, one of the president\u2019s sons accused the Chinese \u201cdictatorship\u201d of hiding what it knew about the coronavirus, prompting Beijing to demand an apology. Bolsonaro in recent days has also threatened to withdraw Brazil from the World Health Organization - as the United States did last month - accusing it of \u201cideological bias.\u201d Alluding to the controversy, Doria said, \u201cThe politicization of disease has never saved a life, to the contrary.\u201d Since the onset of the pandemic, Bolsonaro has clashed with state governors over stay-at-home measures that they have adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. He has continued to press for a resumption of economic activities despite infections continuing to rise. Toronto will make masks on public transport mandatory by 2nd July when the city\u2019s transport agency approves the measure. John Tory, the city\u2019s mayor, said the mandate would help prevent the spread of Covid-19 as more people use the transport system as businesses reopen. Transport officials will also distribute one million masks to residents, particularly those in low-income areas. Egypt will open up its main seaside resorts for international flights and foreign tourists from 1 July, the cabinet said. The country suspended regular international flights in March and shut down restaurants, hotels and cafes. Apart from the resorts, other international flights will remain suspended until further notice. Hotels were allowed to reopen for domestic tourists last month at reduced capacity if they met health protocols. The areas opening up are southern Sinai, where the resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh and Dahab are located, Red Sea province, home to the Hurghada and Marsa Alam resorts, and Marsa Matrouh on the Mediterranean, the cabinet statement said. The pandemic has shut down Egypt\u2019s tourist sector, which the government says accounts for 5% of GDP. Egypt also announced the relaxation of some restrictions during the next two weeks, including reducing the night curfew by an hour. Shop hours will be extended by an hour. The country has reported 38,284 coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, including 1,342 deaths. New daily cases have stayed above 1,000 over the past two weeks. Egypt is also considering reopening mosques in the least affected provinces starting from 1 July and will hold end-of-year exams for pupils in the final year of high school as scheduled later this month, state information minister, Osama Heikal, told a televised briefing. Public beaches and parks will remain shut until the end of June, he added. Chile has exceeded 154,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 2,600 deaths, one hundred days after the outbreak began and with the health service straining under increased admission numbers. \u201cIt has been a very hard 100 days,\u201d health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, told reporters. \u201cJune is going to be the toughest month in the fight against the disease.\u201d Health authorities reported 154,092 cases and 2,648 deaths so far. Chile reported its first case of coronavirus on 3 March, brought by citizens returning from trips to Asia and Europe. By mid-March the government had declared a state of catastrophe for three months, closed its borders, suspended school classes and introduced rolling quarantines for the worst-hit areas. In mid-April, President Sebastian Pinera referenced a \u201cnew normal\u201d and a plan to return Chileans to work and schools. Three-and-a-half weeks from the Dominican Republic\u2019s presidential election, leading candidate Luis Abinader said he and his wife had tested positive for coronavirus. The country is one of the worst-affected by the coronavirus pandemic in the Caribbean and Latin America, with 1 out of every 500 people infected, and remains in a state of emergency. Presidential and legislative elections are set to go ahead on 5 July, after being postponed from the original date of 16 May due to the outbreak. Some 7.5 million Dominicans are expected to cast their ballot at home and abroad. According to a poll by the company Mark Penn/Stagwell published at the end of May, Abinader is leading on 39%, two points above the ruling party candidate Gonzalo Castillo. If neither candidate obtains an absolute majority in the first round, they will face a run-off on 26 July. Abinader\u2019s opponents were among those to publicly wish him a quick recovery. \u201cWe ask God for his quick recovery and good health,\u201d President Danilo Medina wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou have all our support and solidarity.\u201d France\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 27 on Thursday, versus an average daily increase of 50 over the last 15 days, to 29,346, the fifth-highest total in the world. On Wednesday, 23 Covid-19 deaths were reported. Joe Biden has released a plan on how to reopen the US economy in a way that is \u201cas effective and safe as possible\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. The plan calls for guaranteeing coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment for anyone called back to work, as well as paid leave for anyone who gets sick. Biden also proposed creating a national contact tracing workforce and establishing best practices for schools and childcare facilities to reopen. \u201cA stronger, more effective reopening requires doing the work to keep workers safe, to restore consumer confidence, to support small businesses, to ensure seniors can participate, and to provide parents with the help they need to get back to work,\u201d the Biden campaign said in a press release about the plan. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee criticized Trump last week for celebrating the unemployment rate slightly dropping to 13.3%, emphasizing that 20 million Americans were still out of work. \u201cTrump has abdicated any effective federal leadership, leaving state, tribal, and local officials to do their best without help from Washington,\u201d the Biden campaign said. \u201cWith cases of Covid-19 still rising rapidly in parts of the country, Trump has effectively ceased to mobilize any national public health response.\u201d A report containing measures to protect ethnic minority groups in the UK from coronavirus has been drawn up for government but has yet to be published, the BBC reported. Public Health England (PHE) published a review last week that said the virus kills people from ethnic minorities at disproportionately high rates, which was criticised by MPs for not including recommendations to protect these communities. A senior academic said that a second report, containing safeguarding proposals, also existed. PHE said this report will now be published next week. Raj Bhopal, an emeritus professor of public health, from the Usher Institute, at Edinburgh University, said the document was an \u201copen secret\u201d and had \u201cevery hallmark of a [government] report ready to go to the press\u201d. He told the BBC: \u201cThe public has expressed a great deal of disappointment as well as the people who were part of this consultation, asking, \u2018Where have our voices gone?\u2019 \u201cPublic trust saves lives. If you consult the public, you must publish the results. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ve wasted their time, you\u2019ve wasted your own time, you\u2019ve wasted taxpayers money, and you\u2019ve lost trust.\u201d Brazilians dug 100 graves and stuck black crosses in the sand of Rio\u2019s Copacabana beach on Thursday, in a tribute to the nearly 40,000 people who have died from Covid-19 in the country so far, Reuters reports. The graves were dug overnight on the beach opposite the ritzy Copacabana Hotel in a protest mounted by non-governmental organisation Rio de Paz, which has been critical of the government\u2019s response to the surging coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has become a hotspot of the coronavirus pandemic, with 39,680 deaths and over 770,000 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, the world\u2019s worst outbreak after the US. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, has downplayed the gravity of the pandemic and pushed local governments to lift quarantine measures, sending contradictory signals to Brazilians on whether to use masks and practise social distancing. \u201cThe president has not realised that this is one of the most dramatic crises in Brazil\u2019s history,\u201d said organiser Antonio Carlos Costa, who criticised Bolsonaro for not showing solidarity with the suffering. \u201cFamilies are mourning thousands of dead, and there is unemployment and hunger,\u201d he said. Not everyone agreed with the protest. An angry man pulled out crosses, shouting against the symbolic tribute. Another man, who said his 25-year-old son died of Covid-19, went around replacing them. \u201cIt\u2019s such a tragedy,\u201d said passer-by Marcia Lucia Dias. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening to see the crosses. But this is really happening. Our authorities contradict themselves and we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Carbon dioxide emissions have rebounded around the world as lockdown conditions have eased, raising fears that the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could surge higher than ever after the coronavirus pandemic unless governments take swift action, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. Emissions fell by a quarter when the lockdowns were at their peak, and by early April global daily carbon dioxide emissions were still down by 17% compared with the average figure for 2019, research published last month in the journal Nature Climate Change found. Today, daily carbon emissions are still down on 2019 levels, but by only 5% on average globally, according to an updated study. The sharp rebound was the result of the easing of lockdown measures, which has seen millions of people around the world return to work and pre-lockdown habits. \u201cThings have happened very fast,\u201d said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia, and lead author of the studies. \u201cVery few countries still have stringent confinement. We expected emissions to come back, but that they have done so rapidly is the biggest surprise.\u201d Emissions for the year to date, from 1 January to 11 June, are 8.6% lower than in the same period for 2019, and emissions for the whole of this year are likely to be between 4% and 7% lower than for the whole of last year. That is not enough to make a significant contribution to the cuts in emissions needed to fulfil the Paris agreement on climate change, which will require structural changes to transport systems and how energy is generated. Thousands of people lost their lives \u201cprematurely\u201d because care homes in England lacked the protective equipment and financial resources to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, according to council care bosses, writes Patrick Butler, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs editor. In a highly critical report, social care directors say decisions to rapidly discharge many vulnerable patients from NHS hospitals to care homes without first testing them for Covid-19 had \u201ctragic consequences\u201d for residents and staff. In many places, vulnerable people were discharged into care facilities where there was a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) or where it was impossible to isolate them safely, sometimes when they could have returned home, the report says. \u201cUltimately, thousands have lost their lives prematurely in social care and were not sufficiently considered as part of wider health and community systems. And normality has not yet returned,\u201d James Bullion, the president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), said in a foreword to the report. He added: \u201cIt is clear that adult social care was rendered ill-equipped and under-resourced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic by the failure of successive governments of all political colours to recognise and understand how essential social care is.\u201d Cases are rising in nearly half of US states, according to an analysis by the Associated Press, even as lockdowns begin to be rolled back across the country. In Arizona, hospitals have been told to prepare for the worst; Texas has more hospitalised Covid-19 patients than at any time before; and the governor of North Carolina said recent jumps caused him to rethink plans to reopen schools or businesses. AP analysed data compiled by The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer organisation that collects coronavirus testing data in the US. It found that in 21 states as of Monday, the rolling seven-day average of new cases per capita was higher than the average seven days earlier. Among those states with rising cases were Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas - all states where the US president, Donald Trump, this week said he was planning to hold rallies that may draw thousands of people. Jay Butler, who oversees coronavirus response work at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said: \u201cIt is a disaster that spreads. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s an entire continental seismic shift and everyone feels the shaking all at once.\u201d Almost half of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers detected in Bahrain were found to pose a risk of spreading the virus to others, according to research by the country\u2019s coronavirus taskforce. The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, could help to shed light on what has become a hot topic this week, after the World Health Organization\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria van Kherkove, suggested asymptomatic transmission was \u201cvery rare\u201d. Kherkove later backtracked saying that there had been a misunderstanding over her comments. Bahrain\u2019s data, shared with the Guardian on Thursday, is based on 367,764 tests, and is claimed to be the first based on real cases rather than models. It suggests that 44% of cases were still infectious despite not showing any symptoms. Asymptomatic cases were considered infectious if contact tracing of the original patient found other cases who had not been in contact with any other known cases. The finding comes after the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for more research on the extent to which the coronavirus could be spread by people who don\u2019t show symptoms. \u201cSince early February, we have said that asymptomatic people can transmit Covid-19, but that we need more research to establish the extent of asymptomatic transmission,\u201d Tedros said on Tuesday. Bahrain, which is fifth in the world for testing rates, has recorded 16,667 cases. So far 11,487 patients have recovered, and 34 have died. Deaths from Covid-19 in Italy climbed by 53 on Thursday against 71 the day before, Reuters reports, citing the country\u2019s civil protection agency, pushing the total to death toll from the outbreak to 34,167. Italy, which back in February became one of the first countries hit by a major coronavirus outbreak, has the fourth highest death toll in the world, after the US, Britain and Brazil. According to the latest update, the daily tally of new cases rose by 379, compared to 202 on Wednesday. Italy has so far confirmed 236,142 cases of coronavirus, the seventh highest global tally behind those of the US, Russia, Brazil, Spain, Britain and India. People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 30,637 from 31,710 the day before. Authorities also reported that a national smartphone app to trace coronavirus infections has been downloaded 2.2m times in the 10 days. The government, like those of other European countries hit by the virus, is touting the software as a vital tool to help avoid a second wave of infections. Germany launches its own version next week. Unlike some contact-tracing apps planned by European governments, the Italian app does not rely on a centralised database. \u201cWe want a summer in which tourism is as safe as possible. This app can help us resume activities after the lockdown,\u201d Paola Pisano, the technological innovation and digitalisation minister, told Reuters. European Union officials and experts have said that Europe could face a surge of coronavirus infections in coming weeks as a result of the mass antiracism protests that have spread across the continent. Hundreds of thousands of people have crowded together in cities over the past week to protest against systemic racism and police violence against black people, in a renewed movement sparked by the killing of George Floyd by police in the US. \u201cIf you advise everybody to keep one and half meter from each other, and everybody just stands next to each other, holding each other, then I don\u2019t have a good feeling about that,\u201d Jozef Kesecioglu, who chairs the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, was quoted as saying by the Canadian-owned news agency Reuters. Asked whether there could be a surge of infections in the coming two weeks, he said: \u201cYes, but hopefully I\u2019m wrong.\u201d Most countries in the 27-nation bloc have passed the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak and are gradually reopening business and borders, as infections decreased in recent days. Before the protests, scientists expected a second wave only after the summer. But mass gatherings might impact this positive trend. \u201cAs for any infectious respiratory disease, mass events could be a major route of transmission,\u201d Martin Seychell, a health official at the EU commission told Reuters when asked about the possibility of an earlier second wave caused by demonstrations. The virus was still circulating, although at lower rates than some weeks ago, he said. The European Commission is seeking a mandate from member states to buy promising Covid-19 vaccine candidates in advance from pharmaceutical firms, as long as they are not produced solely in the US, Reuters reports. All vaccines in clinical trial this year are in principle eligible for advance purchases, but not those which are produced exclusively in the US, because Washington has signalled it will not allow sales abroad before its own needs are met, the EU officials told a news conference. The EU executive wants to pay for up to six potential vaccines in deals where the makers would commit to providing doses when and if they become available. It will ask EU health ministers at a video conference meeting on Friday to back the plan, which has been swiftly devised as the bloc fears it may not have access to enough shots should a vaccine be developed. \u201cSourcing from producers that would only have production capacity in the United States would not really be an option for us,\u201d one commission official said, adding this would not guarantee that the shots are available for the EU population. \u201cWe pay up front a significant part of the investment needed in exchange for a commitment from the pharmaceutical manufacturer to give us a vaccine when is available,\u201d the official told a news conference. The purchase agreements would be financed with an EU emergency fund, which currently has a budget of 2.4bn euros ($2.7bn), officials said, confirming Reuters\u2019 earlier reports. One month after France ended its strict eight-week lockdown, there has been no spike in coronavirus cases as life returns towards normality, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. The number of new Covid-19 cases continued to drop even as most of France reopened for business \u2013 while maintaining distancing and protection measures \u2013 with the number of additional deaths down to its lowest figure since March. France\u2019s health authorities say there are now only 933 patients in intensive care with the virus across the country, having fallen from a peak of 7,148 in April, and the number of new admissions to emergency units is now at 20 in the last 24 hours. This figure has not been above 50 in the last three weeks. An estimated total of 29,319 people have died of the coronavirus in France in hospitals and care homes since the pandemic began \u2013 an increase of 23 deaths in hospital in the last day. Of this total, more than a third of deaths occurred in care homes, but the government has stopped updating the figures because of the difficulty of accurately establishing a cause of death. Almost 72,000 people diagnosed with Covid-19 have recovered and been discharged from hospital. New cases of coronavirus have spiked in the Balkans, leading officials in Bosnia, North Macedonia and Albania to appeal to citizens to respect public health advice and Serbia\u2019s president to postpone campaign rallies, the Associated Press reports. Epidemiologists across the region, where many restrictions were lifted last month, have said that new clusters are appearing after events such as celebrations, family gatherings or funerals. In Serbia, clusters have also appeared on university campuses in bigger cities. Serbia reported 71 new confirmed cases of infections on Thursday, compared to 18 new cases on 1 June. Similar numbers have been recorded in the past several days after a previous drop. In neighbouring Bosnia, nearly 60 new cases were reported. Authorities in Albania reported 44 new cases, the highest daily number so far and the third consecutive day with an increase. The country has been in a relaxed mode for more than two weeks. North Macedonia recorded 174 new cases and seven deaths on Wednesday, its highest number of Covid-19 deaths in more than a month. Across the region, mass gatherings had gradually been allowed, with people not keeping physical distance or wearing masks, although authorities advised using the protections in public. Some 20,000 fans packed a stadium on Wednesday during a football match between Belgrade\u2019s bitter rival teams, Red Star and Partizan. On Thursday, Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, said his Progressive party will not hold rallies ahead of Serbia\u2019s 21 June parliamentary election to avoid further spread of the virus, according to a report by the state broadcaster RTS. Branislav Tiodorovic, an epidemiologist from Serbia\u2019s state crisis team, told RTS on Thursday: The virus is still here. We are on the line between an uncertain and a favourable situation. This is something we had expected, but we must all get serious again and implement protection measures. A US woman who survived Covid-19 has received a double lung transplant, making her the first in the country known to have a received a transplant after her lungs were badly damaged by the disease, reports Kenya Evelyn for the Guardian US. \u201cShe\u2019s awake, she\u2019s smiling, she FaceTimed with her family,\u201d Dr Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the lung transplant program at Northwestern Medicine, told the New York Times. Bharat said the woman, who is in her 20s, had no serious underlying medical conditions. She has a long way to go, but is recovering. The 10-hour surgery took several hours longer than expected because inflammation left the patient\u2019s lungs \u201ccompletely plastered to tissue around them, the heart, the chest wall and diaphragm\u201d. Hospital authorities said the young woman is still on a ventilator. Although the transplanted lungs are healthy, the virus has left the patient\u2019s chest muscles too weak for independent breathing. Bharat said the transplant was her only chance for survival. However, the medical team emphasised that even though the operation could save some desperately ill coronavirus patients, the transplant option \u201cis not for every Covid patient\u201d. Kazakhstan has locked down several towns and villages and tightened restrictions in one of its provinces following a rise in new Covid-19 cases, a month after ending its nationwide state of emergency. In the central Karaganda region, retailers and public transit will work shorter hours and private cars will be banned from moving at night from 13 June, Reuters reported, citing a government statement. Several towns and villages would be locked down again and 70% of public sector employees in the province will work from home, it said, adding that many local residents and businesses were disregarding social distancing rules. Earlier this month, the central Asian nation tightened restrictions, although to a lesser extent, in two other provinces that had also reported high rates of new cases. Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic of 19 million people bordering China and Russia, has confirmed 13,558 Covid-19 cases, after an additional 239 were reported on Thursday, with 67 deaths. It has also separately reported 2,529 asymptomatic cases. Rohingya leaders have urged Bangladesh to lift an internet ban imposed on one million refugees in the city of Cox\u2019s Bazar, warning that rumours and panic over Covid-19 is deterring people from getting tested, write Rebecca Ratcliffe and Rizwan Ahmed. Limits on communication are exacerbating already dire conditions for the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who live in cramped bamboo huts, with as many as eight family members to a room, and are dependent on communal taps and toilets. In some areas, basics such as soap are lacking. Aid agencies in the city in south-east Bangladesh, 20 miles from the border with Myanmar, have warned repeatedly that the virus could thrive in the camps and that medical facilities would be unable to cope. As of 10 June, 35 refugees have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization, while three have died. In total, 30 are in quarantine, though it is feared that there are more undetected cases. The outbreak has coincided with flu season, adding to confusion over symptoms, but community members say that people are avoiding going to clinics because they are worried about being moved to isolation facilities. Last week, two people fled quarantine because they believed they would be sent to centres far from their families, according to reports. Finland will be opening borders to tourists from neighbouring Baltic and Nordic countries, excluding Sweden, from 15 June, writes Antonia Wilson, for the Guardian\u2019s travel desk. In a similar move to Denmark and Norway, Sweden has been excluded from Finland\u2019s list based on current rates of infection. Finnish borders are due to open to tourists from Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 15 June. Tourists from other EU countries may be permitted after 14 July (the Finnish government is expected to review restrictions again in two weeks\u2019 time).

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has been asked if there is anything \u201cstrange\u201d about the country\u2019s official coronavirus death figures. He gave a fairly straightforward answer: \u201cNo.\u201d Peskov earlier said the low mortality rate was due to a highly efficient Russian healthcare system, rather than statistical manipulation as some experts in Russia and abroad have suggested. Last month Russian officials defended the country against claims that its unusually low mortality rate from Covid-19 was suspicious, saying its method of ascribing cause of death is \u201cexceptionally precise\u201d. Reports that Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years, meanwhile, indicated the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least double the official tally, casting further doubt on the accuracy of Russia\u2019s Covid-19 death figure. The Russian capital reportedly had 5,799 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d for the month of May but has recorded only 2,750 deaths primarily due to coronavirus. The data is in line with other major cities, including St Petersburg, where total mortality rates have shown thousands of deaths not reflected in official coronavirus tallies. Russia has so far reported more than 500,000 cases, the world\u2019s third-largest number, and 6,532 deaths - a tally that is significantly lower than in many other countries with serious outbreaks. The World Health Organization said this week that Russia\u2019s low death rate was \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d. Last month, Moscow\u2019s authorities more than doubled the official death toll from Covid-19 in the Russian capital for April. They said the new tally included even the most \u201ccontroversial, debatable\u201d cases. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the latest scientific estimates are that the R rate, the rate at which Covid-19 infections are spreading in the community, has fallen in Scotland to between 0.6 to 0.8, confirming a steep decline in the number of people in hospital and deaths. Sturgeon told the daily coronavirus briefing that \u201cunder that estimate we expect that the virus will continue to decline\u201d. She cautioned that there was still a risk of a resurgence in infections, but added: \u201cWe should continue to celebrate the progress.\u201d As a result, she announced that workers would be allowed now to return to construction sites, while observing social distancing, but added that \u201cwe still have some way to go\u201d before seeing building at full capacity. In her daily summary, she announced five further deaths of those with confirmed Covid-19, with 909 people in hospital, 78 fewer than on Wednesday. Many of the key numbers have fallen in Scotland to the levels of mid- to late-March, leading Sturgeon to confirm the lockdown may be eased in Scotland more quickly. The R number in Scotland had been between 0.7 and 0.9, and the number of infected people in Scotland last week is judged to have been 4,500. There are more details in this Scottish government report (pdf). UK death toll rises by 151 to 41,279 The UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 41,279 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Wednesday. That is a rise of 151 from 41,128 the day before. The government\u2019s figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 52,000. The DHSC also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Thursday, 197,007 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,266 positive results. Overall, a total of 6,240,801 tests have been carried out and 291,409 cases have been confirmed positive. The figure for the number of people tested has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d across all methods of testing. You can follow all our UK coronavirus news over on our live blog Another 1.5 million people in the US filed for unemployment benefits last week even as states continued to relax their coronavirus quarantine measures, writes Dominic Rushe and Amanda Holpuch in New York. In just 12 weeks, more than 44m claims have been made for benefits as people lost their jobs. Rehiring appears to have started. Last week the labor department said the unemployment rate had dipped in May to 13.3% from 14.7% in April \u2013 although officials said difficulty collecting data meant the figure was probably 3% higher. Yesterday Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said the central bank expected unemployment to dip to 9.3% by the year end, it was 3.5% in February. Powell warned that while the trend was positive, it would be \u201cdifficult for many people to find work\u201d for \u201can extended period\u201d. Last week was the second week in a row that unemployment claims were below 2m, a sign that layoffs are slowing from the peak of 6.6m in April. However, the numbers remain historically high. In the last recession, the highest number of weekly unemployment claims peaked at 665,000 in March 2009, and the previous all-time mark was 695,000 in October 1982. \u201cThe downward trend is obviously good news, but in the context of an economy that is reopening it is extremely high, especially when viewed against previous recessions,\u201d James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING, wrote in a note to investors. Nearly three-quarters of new cases of coronavirus are coming from 10 countries, mostly concentrated in the Americas and south Asia, the director general of the World Health Organization has said. Speaking at the UN health agency\u2019s member state briefing on Thursday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the global situation was deteriorating, even as Europe appeared to be over the worst of the outbreak. The biggest threat was complacency, he warned, as he called on countries to continue with \u201cactive surveillance\u201d to ensure there was no rebound in infections in those countries past the peak of transmission. Tedros said: More than 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported, and more than 408,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, at the global level, it is getting worse. More than 100,000 new cases have been reported each day for the most part of the past two weeks. Almost 75% of recent cases come from 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and south Asia. Many countries in the African region are also experiencing an increase, although so far, in most, the caseload is still relatively small. We also see increasing numbers of cases in parts of eastern Europe and central Asia. At the same time, we are encouraged that some countries around the world are seeing positive signs. The biggest threat now is complacency. Studies show that most people are still susceptible to infection. Countries must continue with active surveillance to ensure the virus does not rebound, especially as mass gatherings of all kinds are starting to resume. Without proper safeguards and monitoring, a resurgence is a real threat. Reuters has more from the coronavirus briefing earlier today by the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office from Africa. According to the Canadian-owned news agency, Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s Africa regional director, said that the Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating in Africa, spreading to the hinterland from capital cities where it arrived with travellers. Ten countries are driving Africa\u2019s epidemic, accounting for 75% of the roughly 207,600 cases recorded on the continent, with 5,000 deaths reported, according to Moeti. There was no indication that severe cases and deaths were being missed, nor had the virus caused significant infections in refugee camps across the continent, she said. \u201cEven though these cases in Africa account for less than 3% of the global total, it\u2019s clear that the pandemic is accelerating,\u201d Moeti told the briefing, according to Reuters. \u201cWe believe that large numbers of severe cases and deaths are not being missed in Africa.\u201d Africa\u2019s population was relatively youthful and many countries had already established \u201cpoint of entry\u201d screening measures against Ebola fever \u2013 two factors which may have so far limited the spread of Covid-19, she said. But lockdowns and market closures intended to contain coronavirus contagion had taken a heavy toll on marginalised communities and low-income families, Moeti said. In South Africa, the region\u2019s worst-affected country, high numbers of daily cases and deaths were being reported in Western Cape and Eastern Cape, she said, adding: \u201cSpecifically in the Western Cape where we are seeing a majority of cases and deaths, the trend seem to be similar to what was happening in Europe and in the US.\u201d A major challenge on the continent remained the availability of test kits, Moeti said. \u201cUntil such time as we have access to an effective vaccine, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll probably have to live with a steady increase in the region, with some hotspots having to be managed in a number of countries, as is happening now in South Africa, Algeria, Cameroon for example, which require very strong public health measures, social distancing measures to take place.\u201d The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Iran has passed 180,000, according to new data released on Thursday, as the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, called on Iranians to stick to public health advice aimed at curbing its spread. \u201cIf everyone follows the health instructions exactly, then all jobs can be reopened,\u201d Rouhani said in remarks broadcast on state television, according to the French news agency AFP. \u201cWe are progressing slowly and step by step (because we don\u2019t want) our people to think that the coronavirus era has passed. This would pose a major health problem for us.\u201d Sima Sadat Lari, the health ministry spokeswoman, who recently took over the grim task of giving Iran\u2019s daily coronavirus updates, said 2,238 more people had tested positive in the past 24 hours, pushing the total to 180,156. She said 78 new deaths brought the overall toll to 8,584. Iran reported its first Covid-19 cases on 19 February - two deaths in the Shiite holy city of Qom. Since then, the government has struggled to contain what became the Middle East\u2019s deadliest coronavirus outbreak. Since April, however, it has gradually lifted health protocols in order to reopen its sanctions-hit economy. That has coincided with a fresh surge in cases, which the government denies amounts to a second wave, saying they are due to increased testing. India reported nearly 10,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, with health services in the worst-hit cities of Mumbai, New Delhi and Chennai swamped by the rising infections, according to the Associated Press. India\u2019s tally has reached 286,579 confirmed cases, the fifth-highest in the world, with 8,102 deaths, including 357 in the last 24 hours. However, the government has moved ahead with the reopening of restaurants, shopping malls and places of worship in most of India after lockdown of more than two months. Subways, hotels and schools remain closed. The actual infection numbers are thought to be higher because of limited testing. French news agency AFP visited the Max Smart Super Speciality hospital in New Delhi, one of India\u2019s top private hospitals, where every bed was reportedly occupied by coronavirus patients, and fear was building that worse was to come. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when this is going to peak,\u201d Dr Deven Juneja told AFP during a pause from his rounds. \u201cAll of us are hoping for the best, but we are mentally and physically prepared for the worst.\u201d Juneja said the surge had started to be felt over the past few days, with an increase in the number of people seeking medical help. \u201cThat has definitely increased the load on us. We want to get our patients well as soon as possible and try to create more beds for our patients,\u201d he said. Beijing has confirmed a new coronavirus infection, the first confirmed Covid-19 case in the capital in nearly two months, reports Reuters, citing Chinese official and communist party-backed media. The patient, a 52-year-old man, checked into a clinic on Wednesday due to a fever, according to the official party newspaper People\u2019s Daily. The patient said he has not left Beijing or been in contact with anyone who travelled from overseas in the last two weeks, the report said. Earlier, Chinese health authorities had reported a small spike in imported cases to 11. There were no new deaths or cases of local transmission in Thursday\u2019s report, according to the Associated Press. Chinese officials say just 62 people remain in treatment for Covid-19, while 130 are under observation and isolation for showing signs of the illness or testing positive for the virus without showing any symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 deaths from Covid-19 \u2014 a figure that hasn\u2019t changed in weeks \u2014 among 83,057 cases recorded since the virus was first detected in the central industrial city of Wuhan late last year. Hundreds of children in Indonesia are believed to have died from Covid-19, despite experts around the world saying the coronavirus poses little danger to the young, Reuters reports. \u201cCovid-19 proves that we have to fight against malnutrition,\u201d Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, told Reuters. He said Indonesian children were caught in a \u201cdevil\u2019s circle\u201d, a cycle of malnutrition and anaemia that increased their vulnerability to the coronavirus. He compared malnourished children to weak structures that \u201ccrumble after an earthquake\u201d. Since Indonesia announced its first coronavirus case in March it has recorded 2,000 deaths, the highest in east Asia outside China. A total of 715 people under 18 have contracted the coronavirus, while 28 have died, according to a health ministry document dated 22 May and reviewed by Reuters. It also recorded more than 380 deaths among 7,152 children classified as \u201cpatients under monitoring\u201d, meaning people with severe coronavirus symptoms for which there is no other explanation but whose tests have not confirmed the infection. Even the official figure for children who have died of the coronavirus, at 28 as of 22 May, would give Indonesia a high rate of child death, at 2.1% of its total. Different countries use different age brackets in statistics but deaths for those under 24 in the United States are a little over 0.1% of its fatalities. Indonesia, a developing country of 270 million, suffers from a \u201ctriple burden of malnutrition,\u201d which includes stunting, and anaemia among mothers, and obesity, according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Nearly one in three Indonesian children under five is stunted, it says. \u201cThe nutrition status impacts children\u2019s immunity,\u201d said Dr Nastiti Kaswandani, a paediatric pulmonologist in the capital, Jakarta. \u201cThat\u2019s important in mitigating Covid infections.\u201d Human Rights Watch has called on the United Arab Emirates to urgently address an outbreak of the coronavirus in at least three prisons, the Associated Press reports. The human rights group say relatives of prisoners at a jail near Abu Dhabi, as well as another in Dubai, have said that prisoners have been denied adequate medical care and been kept in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. It accused the authorities of not providing information to inmates or their families about the outbreaks of the coronavirus inside the detention centres. According to the NGO, relatives of prisoners say prison authorities transferred those exhibiting symptoms to unknown locations without testing or medical care for weeks; that prisoners with HIV have been denied access to the hospital that is in charge of their care since mid-March; and that authorities did not increase supplies of soap or hand sanitiser and did not distribute gloves or masks to detainees. Michael Page, the Middle East deputy director at Human Rights Watch, said: Crowded, unsanitary prison conditions and widespread denial of adequate medical care are nothing new in the UAE\u2019s notorious detention facilities, but the ongoing pandemic is an additional serious threat to prisoners\u2019 well-being. The best way for UAE authorities to allay concerns of prisoners\u2019 family members is to allow inspection by independent, international monitors. HRW said it wrote to the UAE\u2019s Interior Ministry on 7 June and has received no response. It noted that in April, Emirati authorities released over 4,000 detainees, but not political detainees held for peaceful dissent. Beijing has criticised a US study suggesting that the virus that causes Covid-19 may have been circulating in China since last August, calling it proof of a disinformation campaign, Reuters reports. The paper by researchers at Boston University and Harvard \u2013 which has not been peer-reviewed \u2013 analysed photos of car parks at Wuhan hospitals and search trends on Baidu, a Chinese search engine. The team led by Elaine Nsoesie at Boston University said they found \u201ca steep increase in volume starting in August 2019\u201d at Wuhan hospital parking lots, \u201cculminating with a peak in December 2019.\u201d While they admitted they could not definitively confirm that the data was linked to the virus, the said it supported conclusions reached by other research suggesting that the virus began circulating earlier than the first reported cases at the end of 2019. On Thursday, China\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the paper as \u201cfull of holes\u201d and \u201ccrudely manufactured.\u201d Hua Chunying, the ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, said the study was evidence of coordinated efforts in the US to \u201cdeliberately create and disseminate disinformation against China\u201d. \u201cSome US politicians and media acted like they found buried treasure and wantonly spread [the study], treating it like new proof that China concealed the epidemic,\u201d Hua told reporters at a regular briefing. Africa will have a \u201csteady increase\u201d in Covid-19 cases until a vaccine is developed, the director general of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said on Thursday. Matshidiso Moeti, the UN health agency\u2019s Africa regional director, spoke as the latest collated figures for the continent, which has so far avoided the kind of mass outbreak seen in the rest of the world, showed about 6,500 more cases were reported since Wednesday. So far Africa\u2019s 54 countries have reported a total of 207,617 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 95,173 recoveries and 5,642 deaths, the WHO African region\u2019s coronavirus dashboard showed. About 1.3 billion people live on the continent. There had been fears that Africa would be hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, but so far it is the least affected region, accounting for only about 5% of global cases. Despite that, Moeti said on Thursday that strong public health measures were needed in current \u201chotspots\u201d in South Africa, Algeria and Cameroon. Moeti told a Geneva briefing: Until such time as we have access to an effective vaccine, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll probably have to live with a steady increase in the region, with some hotspots having to be managed in a number of countries, as is happening now in South Africa, Algeria, Cameroon for example, which require very strong public health measures, social distancing measures to take place. In Germany, the number of active Covid-19 cases has gone up to 5,460 \u2013 the first rise in total cases in two months, writes Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief. On Thursday, health authorities recorded 555 new confirmed infections and 400 new patients who had recovered from the disease, bringing the total number of Covid-19 cases to be recorded in Germany so far to 185,416. 8,755 people have died of the virus in Germany so far, a day-on-day rise of 26. However, the change in dynamic has received relatively little attention in the country as several of the 16 L\u00e4nder, or federal states, took further steps towards relaxing social distancing restrictions. In the eastern state of Thuringia, social distancing measures will be scrapped altogether from this Saturday, though the wearing of masks in shops and on public transport remains mandatory. The R number was estimated to be at 0.86 by the government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute. This is Damien Gayle replacing Josh Halliday now at the helm of the live blog.

Hundreds of Indonesian children have died from coronavirus, Reuters reports, giving the south-east Asian country one of the world\u2019s highest child mortality rates from a disease that experts say poses little danger to the young. The Reuters news agency quotes Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, as saying that Indonesian children were caught in a \u201cdevil\u2019s circle\u201d of malnutrition and anaemia making them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. The country\u2019s official figures suggest that 28 of the 2,000 people to die from Covid-19 up to 22 May were under 18, equating 2.1% of its total \u2013 still a high rate compared to other countries. However, Reuters reports that Indonesia has also recorded more than 380 deaths among 7,152 children classified as \u201cpatients under monitoring\u201d, meaning people with severe coronavirus symptoms for which there is no other explanation but whose tests have not confirmed the infection. So the true death toll among children is much higher than the official figure of 28 given on the 22 May. Yurianto told the news agency: \u201cCovid-19 proves that we have to fight against malnutrition,\u201d comparing malnourished children to weak structures that \u201ccrumble after an earthquake\u201d. The coronavirus pandemic is \u201caccelerating\u201d in Africa with more than 200,000 confirmed cases across the continent and 5,600 deaths, the region\u2019s World Health Organisation director Dr Matshidiso Moeti has said. Moeti said the virus was spreading from capital cities where it arrived with travellers and that 10 countries were bearing the brunt of Africa\u2019s epidemic, accounting for 75% of confirmed cases and infections. South Africa accounts for a quarter of cases. \u201cWe believe that large numbers of severe cases and deaths are not being missed in Africa,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges in Africa continues be availability of supplies, particularly test kits.\u201d The World Health Organization is about to deliver an update on the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. You can watch a livestream of the broadcast on the video above. We\u2019ll post a summary of the briefing when it has finished. The number of new coronavirus cases in Indonesia show no signs of falling, with 979 infections and 41 deaths reported in the past 24 hours. The Jakarta government has said it is confident the spread of the virus has slowed despite the number of infections reaching a record high of more than 1,200 earlier this week. Restrictions in Indonesia\u2019s capital were partly relaxed on Monday after two months of lockdown as as the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation gradually reopens its economy. Jakarta, home to 11 million people, had been under large-scale social restrictions since 10 April. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has recorded 748 new Covid-19 infections to coronavirus, taking the total to 22,980. The number of deaths in the country has risen by 21, to 426 fatalities. There have been 3,326 recoveries. The health ministry has so far tested 52,546 suspected patients, with about 44% of them positive. Most new cases (311) and deaths (eight) have been reported in the capital, Kabul, the country\u2019s worst-affected area in both number of confirmed transmissions and deaths with 9,140 cases and 92 deaths. Mohammad Yaghoub Heidari, the governor of Kabul warned earlier this week of \u201ca catastrophe\u201d in the capital. He said the actual number of infections in Kabul may be much higher than official figures show, even possibly \u201ca million\u201d. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, the acting health minister, also told the public on Wednesday to \u201clearn how to live with coronavirus, because it won\u2019t disappear in a matter of months or weeks\u201d. The UK government\u2019s former chief scientific advisor, Sir David King, has said the UK could have prevented as many as 30,000 deaths if the country had gone into lockdown a week earlier. King, a fierce critic of the UK government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, said he believed there could have been \u201cno more than 10,000 deaths\u201d at this point had the country entered lockdown earlier. Official figures show the UK death toll from people who tested positive for the virus already stands at 41,128. On Wednesday, Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the leading scientists who was advising the UK government, said the number of fatalities could have been halved if more draconian restrictions were imposed a week earlier. Russia has reported 8,779 new cases of Covid-19, bringing its nationwide infection tally to 502,436. Officials said 174 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the official national death toll to 6,532. Russia has the third-highest number of infections in the world, according to John Hopkins University data, behind the US and Brazil. Its daily number of cases, at nearly 9,000, has remained roughly level for the past two weeks. Australia and China have exchanged another salvo over the coronavirus pandemic. Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, told a radio station on Thursday he would not be intimidated or coerced into dampening his criticism of China after Beijing said its students should reconsider choosing to study in the country. \u201cWe are an open-trading nation, mate, but I\u2019m never going to trade our values in response to coercion from wherever it comes,\u201d Morrison told radio station 2GB on Thursday. In response, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said its warning to students were based on facts and called on Australia to take measures to safeguard Chinese citizens\u2019 safety, Reuters reports. China has in recent weeks banned Australian beef imports and imposed tariffs on Australian barley. The warning for students followed a similar warning last week from Beijing for Chinese tourists to avoid Australia. In both cases, officials in Beijing said the warnings were due to racist attacks against Asians during the pandemic. \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. It\u2019s a ridiculous assertion and it\u2019s rejected. That\u2019s not a statement that\u2019s been made by the Chinese leadership,\u201d Morrison said in a separate interview on 3AW. London stocks opened lower on Thursday as fears of a second wave of Covid-19 infections in the US and a gloomy outlook by the Federal Reserve trumped optimism around a global economic revival, Reuters reports. The FTSE 100 index slipped 2.7%, with oil &amp; gas stocks leading declines with a 4.1% tumble. Most cyclical stocks traded lower at the opening bell, while defensive healthcare stocks inched higher. The British mid-cap index fell 2.8%. My colleagues on the Guardian\u2019s business liveblog have more on this morning\u2019s stock movements. The European Union (EU) must reach a deal on a proposed \u20ac750bn economic recovery plan to cope with the impact of the coronavirus crisis by July, a French government minister has said. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, a junior European affairs minister, told France\u2019s BFM Business radio on Thursday: \u201cThere is no other solution than having a deal by July. If we do not have a stimulus plan, we will have a problem.\u201d The European commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, proposed in May that members raise \u20ac750bn on behalf of all members to finance their recovery from the economic catastrophe caused by coronavirus. The plan, which requires approval from the leaders of 27 countries and their parliaments, would be the first time the EU has raised large amounts of debt in capital markets and would, in some ways, make Brussels more closely resemble a central government than ever before. It is, as the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said last month, \u201cEurope\u2019s moment\u201d. With several countries, including the UK, now past the first spike of coronavirus infections, the question turns to what happens next. Prof Devi Sridhar, a chair on global public health at the University of Edinburgh, writes in today\u2019s Guardian that there are a number of competing theories about how best to prevent a second peak. Her own view is that governments must \u201caggressively contain the virus through testing, tracing and isolating carriers, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as hand-washing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it\u2019s needed\u201d. She adds: The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination. Sridhar writes that governments should think of Covid-19 as a series of small fires that must be quickly extinguished before they turn into an uncontrollable blaze. She writes: If coronavirus is our generations\u2019s polio, we might look towards the approach taken by governments in the Pacific. New Zealand has eliminated coronavirus, and Australia is inching closer to this goal. With border checks in place, people living in these countries can return to normal life. Sports matches are taking place in New Zealand, schools have reopened, weddings are being booked and people can safely see relatives. The successes of New Zealand and Australia might force other countries to rethink their own strategies, and the feasibility of eliminating the virus within their borders. Instead of living with a constant threat of Covid-19, people might start asking their own governments \u2013 why not try to get rid of it altogether? India has lifted an export ban on hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug touted by Donald Trump as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against Covid-19. The country\u2019s chemicals minister, Sadananda Gowda, tweeted the announcement late on Wednesday. India is one of the biggest exporters of medicines in the world. But it stopped shipping hydroxychloroquine and its formulations in March as the pandemic disrupted supply chains. It eased some of its restrictions the following month when it exported about 50m tablets to the US, Reuters reported. Gowda said companies would still have to supply 20% of their production of the drug to the domestic market. Several countries have permitted emergency use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients in hospitals. However, evidence of its efficacy is highly contested. The biggest trial of the drug yet, by scientists at Oxford University, concluded last week that the drug does not work and should not be given to any more Covid-19 patients around the world. Hello from me, Josh Halliday, reporting from Manchester, England. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. A quick peek suggests we\u2019ve got readers currently in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Finland, South Africa, India, Germany, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US and Britain, among many others! That\u2019s incredible. Thank you for choosing the Guardian. As ever, feel free to get in touch on: Twitter: @JoshHalliday (DMs open) Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along. My colleague Josh Halliday will take it from here. Mayors in some of England\u2019s biggest cities are warning that local authorities are at risk of going bust with potentially devastating consequences for communities unless the government takes immediate action. As the impact of the Covid-19 crisis hits local authorities, the mayors of London, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool have issued a joint call to highlight the seriousness of the issue and urge Boris Johnson to respond. \u201cUnless the government acts immediately to support local and regional government in England there is a very serious risk that the economic recovery from Covid-19 will be choked off by a new era of austerity \u2013 something the prime minister promised wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said. The situation is so serious that some local councils may be under threat of going bust, the mayors warned. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said support is needed in the north of England now to stop the \u201c2020s being as bad as the 1980s\u201d. Thailand on Thursday reported no new coronavirus infections or deaths, maintaining the total of 3,125 confirmed cases and 58 fatalities. It was the first time in nearly three weeks that no cases were reported and the 17th day without a local transmission. All recent cases have been found in quarantine among Thais returning from abroad. There are 2,987 patients who have recovered, said Panprapa Yongtrakul, a spokeswoman for the government\u2019s Covid-19 Administration Centre. The Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals have been canceled this year due to coronavirus concerns, AP reports. Dr Cameron Kaiser, Riverside County\u2019s public health officer, signed an order Wednesday canceling the popular festivals outside Palm Springs. Health officials are concerned about a possible surge in coronavirus cases in the fall. Coachella, a massive music and arts festival, and Stagecoach, a country music event, are typically held in April but were previously postponed until October. Now, \u201cgiven the projected circumstances and potential, I would not be comfortable moving forward,\u201d Kaiser said. Travis Scott, Calvin Harris and Frank Ocean were set to headline Coachella. The Stagecoach lineup included Lil Nas X, Carrie Underwood and Billy Ray Cyrus. Both festivals are held in Indio. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Confirmed US cases passed 2 million. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in the US, which is by far the worst-affected country worldwide, passed 2 million on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data, which lists 2,000,464 cases.The country has recorded 112,908 deaths.Brazil, with the next highest number of cases, has 772,416 confirmed infections. US deaths could reach 200,000 in September. Ashish Jha, the head of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute, told CNN in an interview on Wednesday that without drastic action, the number of US deaths would march on. Trump to hold rally in Oklahoma, first since coronavirus pandemic began. Donald Trump will hold a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday \u2013 his first since since states began shutting down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The 19 June rally will likely rattle some public health experts, as coronavirus infections rise in about a dozen states. Latin America pandemic deaths passed 70,000, according to a Reuters count, as Mexico hit a daily record for confirmed infections. Brazil, with the largest economy in the region, remains Latin America\u2019s most affected country as total fatalities are just shy of 40,000, the world\u2019s third highest death toll after the United States and Britain. Cuba to test all international visitors for coronavirus. Cuba will test all visitors for coronavirus when it reopens to international tourism, which will be limited at first to the beach resorts at the keys of the Caribbean\u2019s largest island, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said on Wednesday. Mexico City will embark on a large-scale testing effort as the centrepiece of its plan to reopen its economy, its mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has said. The plan sees it diverge from the federal governments strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources. The goal will be performing some 100,000 tests per month by July and trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said. On Wednesday, Mexico confirmed 4,883 coronavirus cases in new daily record. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister. Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cordoba, where he caught Covid-19. Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cordoba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. Cuba will test all visitors for coronavirus when it reopens to international tourism, which will be limited at first to the beach resorts at the keys of the Caribbean\u2019s largest island, the prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, said on Wednesday. Unveiling cautious plans for lifting Cuba\u2019s partial lockdown, Marrero Cruz said specialists would conduct epidemiological monitoring at hotels, where occupation would be limited. Excursions would be restricted to the keys, Reuters reports. Visitors would not be able to visit Havana, the centre of Cuba\u2019s outbreak, at first. In his presentation to the council of ministers, reported by state-run media, Marrero Cruz did not give a timeframe for the reopening to tourism, one of the cash-strapped country\u2019s top sources of hard currency. The prime minister said Cuba would open first to domestic tourism and further details would be announced soon. Thousands of Palestinians stranded around the world by the coronavirus are still seeking a way home, months after countries closed their borders and grounded flights in the face of the pandemic, AFP reports. The Palestinian Authority says 6,000 people want to come home, but the logistics are incredibly complicated. West Bank residents usually travel via Jordan, an easier route than getting the Israeli permit needed to pass through Tel Aviv airport. But the frontier with Jordan remains closed and the PA has no say in when it will open, as Israel controls the border. Israel\u2019s military branch responsible for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, COGAT, did not immediately respond to a request to comment on whether it is involved in facilitating returns. Among Palestinians trying to get to Gaza, the coastal enclave ruled by Islamist group Hamas, about 1,500 stuck in Egypt were allowed to return through the Rafah border crossing last month. Smaller numbers have entered the enclave through Israel, but Palestinians further afield are still stranded. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 555 to 185,416, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The reported death toll rose by 26 to 8,755, the tally showed. Reuters reports that a potential coronavirus vaccine developed in China has shown promising results in animals. The vaccine, developed by Chinese researchers, showed promise in trials in monkeys, triggering antibodies and raising no safety issues, researchers said, and a human trial with more than 1,000 participants is under way. The vaccine candidate, called BBIBP-CorV, induced high-level neutralising antibodies that can block the virus from infecting cells in monkeys, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits, researchers said in a paper published in online by the medical journal Cell on Saturday. The true figure of infection in the US is almost certainly \u201cmultiples more\u201d than the 2m confirmed cases, says Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, but is obscured by the lack of testing. Problems in developing and rolling out an effective test out dogged the initial US response to the pandemic and although testing has now ramped up, only around 6% of the population has received one. People with Covid-19 most likely experience either no noticeable symptoms or only minor symptoms such as a dry cough and mild fever. \u201cWe are very much seeing only the proverbial tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Redlener. \u201cWe are hampered by the lack of sufficient testing, especially as businesses are reopening across all 50 states.\u201d As the country passed 2 million cases, US president Donald Trump has today tweeted about his resort, Trump Doral, Miami \u2013 which is reopening, Trumps\u2019 son Eric announced. Trump, in his tweet, said \u201cAnd the Trump family didn\u2019t ask the Federal government for money to carry this and many other very expensive to carry properties\u201d: He has also tweeted about the Durham probe, an investigation led by John Durham, the US attorney Barr selected to examine the early days of the Russia investigation \u2013 launched in response to the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump also attacked the Seattle mayor, and again tweeted the words Law &amp; Order. Here is our full story on the US passing 2 million cases: For Americans, coronavirus went from being a mysterious affliction that occurred in far-off lands to 1m confirmed cases on US soil within 14 weeks. Now, just six weeks later, the US has broken through the grim milestone of 2m positive tests for Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The anguish of life lost, of a severely wounded economy and wrenching political turmoil have taken a harrowing toll upon a fatigued American public. But further, perhaps far greater pain is yet to come, pandemic experts have warned, even as authorities wave people back into reopened shops and offices and the US president\u2019s political rhetoric on an epochal crisis dwindles away to near silence. \u201cEveryone has just looked at the first 100 yards of this marathon,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in the US, which is by far the worst-affected country worldwide, passed 2 million on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data, which lists 2,000,464 cases. The country has recorded 112,908 deaths. Brazil, with the next highest number of cases, has 772,416 confirmed infections. Many will be watching the daily case numbers from the US anxiously for the next few weeks, as the effects of relaxed restrictions \u2013 and Memorial Day weekend, which saw large crowds in parts of the country \u2013 as well as the recent protests are expected to be seen. It is still possibly too early to determine whether the protests have lead to a spike, despite many protesters wearing masks and practising other social distancing measures. Nine California counties have reported a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalisations. New diagnoses in the heavily populated Los Angeles area are going up in part because testing is more widely available. But officials say infections and hospitalisations in most other parts of the state are being driven by factors tied directly to the loosening of restrictions or overt flouting of public health rules. More on markets, from Reuters: In a challenge to the US stock market\u2019s recent optimism, the Fed predicted the US economy would shrink 6.5% in 2020 and unemployment would still be at 9.3% at year\u2019s end. Data out earlier had also shown core US consumer prices fell for a third straight month in May, the longest stretch of declines on record. As a result, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said he was \u201cnot even thinking about thinking about raising rates\u201d. Instead, he emphasised recovery would be a long road and that policy would have to be proactive with rates near zero out to 2022. \u201cWhile Powell did not commit to any new action at this time, his focus on downside risk and uncertainty reinforces the message that they will take further action, probably by September,\u201d was the take of economists at JPMorgan. \u201cOutcome or calendar based guidance looks likely and Powell left the door open for moving to some form of interest rate caps.\u201d Asian shares eased on Thursday while bonds rallied after a downbeat economic outlook from the US Federal Reserve stoked speculation it would have to add to already historic levels of stimulus to safeguard recovery, Reuters reports. Still, stock losses were modest given the scale of their recent rise. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.3%, a natural pause after 10 straight sessions of gains. Japan\u2019s Nikkei slipped 1.1% as the yen firmed, while Chinese blue chips were off 0.4%. E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4%. The Dow had ended Wednesday down 1.04%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.53%. Bucking the trend, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.67% to a fresh record helped by gains in Microsoft and Apple. Nigeria\u2019s women\u2019s affairs minister, Pauline Tallen, has called on law enforcement to expedite rape cases, which spiked in the country during lockdown. Her call followed protests earlier this week over sexual violence in West Africa\u2019s most populous nation, and a series of high-profile rapes. Tallen said rapes had reached an \u201calarming rate\u201d three times the typical level as women and children were locked down with their abusers. Every state in Nigeria was affected, she said. \u201cWe are calling for legal intervention,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom details that we have, there are hundred of cases that are within our courts that have not been addressed and out of each one case, be sure that there are 10 that have not been reported.\u201d Earlier this week, Nigeria\u2019s most senior policeman ordered the immediate deployment of additional investigators to specialist gender violence desks. Tallen raised the issue at Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting and said that President Muhammadu Buhari supported urgent action. \u201cGovernment will take decisive action at the highest level to protect women and children in this country,\u201d she said. The United States may see 200,000 deaths because of the coronavirus at some point in September, a leading expert said. Ashish Jha, the head of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute, told CNN in an interview on Wednesday that without drastic action, the number of US deaths would march on. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t have increasing cases, even if we keep things flat, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we\u2019re going to hit 200,000 deaths sometime during the month of September,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just through September. The pandemic won\u2019t be over in September.\u201d Jha added: \u201cI\u2019m really worried about where we\u2019re going to be in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d Total US coronavirus-related deaths totalled 112,895 on Wednesday, the worst in the world. US airlines carried 3 million passengers in April, a staggering 96% decline from April 2019 amid the coronavirus pandemic and flight restrictions, the Transportation Department said on Wednesday. The department said US airlines carried about 2.8 million domestic passengers and 132,000 international passengers. International passengers fell 99% over April 2019 as the U.S. imposed flight restrictions on many international visitors. Total US airline passengers were the lowest since 1974 when the government began collecting monthly data. By comparison, there were 76.1 million total U.S. airline passengers in April 2019. The previous low recorded was 14.6 million passengers in February 1975. Passenger traffic has recently risen from April lows and fell only 85% in the week ending June 7, while total flights are down 72%. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said demand for future air travel remains down 82% and revenue for future flights is down 92%. The Australian federal government\u2019s $200m purchase of Covid-19 testing kits from Andrew Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation caught the Australian diagnostics industry by surprise, lacked transparency and came after a detailed audit showed there was \u201cmore than enough technology already in the field\u201d, the sector\u2019s peak body has claimed. The mining magnate and philanthropist announced in April that he had secured 10m Covid-19 PCR tests for Australia from the Chinese manufacturer Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) at a cost of $200m, which would be refunded by the federal government. Latin America\u2019s coronavirus crisis reached a grim new milestone on Wednesday with total deaths exceeding 70,000, according to a Reuters count, as Mexico hit a daily record for confirmed infections. Brazil, with the largest economy in the region, remains Latin America\u2019s most affected country as total fatalities are just shy of 40,000, the world\u2019s third highest death toll after the US and Britain. In the region\u2019s second biggest country, Mexico, a new daily record of 4,883 confirmed cases was reported by the health ministry, along with 708 additional fatalities. The daily totals bring Mexico\u2019s overall official count to 129,184 infections and 15,357 deaths. The World Health Organization has determined that Latin America is the new hotspot for the pandemic, which began around the beginning of the year in China and quickly spread to Europe and beyond. Governments across the globe acknowledge that the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the official counts. Latin American fatalities attributed to the highly-contagious Covid-19 respiratory illness caused by the virus stand at 70,972, while total infections are at 1.45 million. The outbreak has also spread rapidly in Peru, Chile and Columbia. Donald Trump will hold a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, next Friday \u2013 his first since since states began shutting down in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 110,000 lives in the US. The 19 June rally will likely rattle some public health experts, as coronavirus infections rise in about a dozen states. On Wednesday, the US approached nearly 2 million confirmed cases. Trump\u2019s signature rallies often draw tens of thousands of people but have been on hiatus since 2 March because of the coronavirus. The president\u2019s campaign has been eager to resume them as it tries to move past the pandemic, even as cases continue to rise in some parts of the country. A Trump campaign spokesperson tweeted a movie trailer-style video earlier Wednesday that advertised: \u201cThis month we\u2019re back.\u201d Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported a record 4,883 new confirmed coronavirus infections along with 708 additional fatalities on Wednesday, bringing the total in the country to 129,184 cases and 15,357 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the official count. This is very British and Australian and South African (do you eat Marmite in your country?) news, but here in Sydney it must be said: Yeast of our worries: Marmite supplies hit by Covid-19 beer brewing slowdown Marmite can only produce small jars due to the coronavirus pandemic, a company tweet has suggested. The spread, made with yeast extract, is now only being produced in a 250g size jar as a result of brewers\u2019 yeast being more difficult to get hold of, a message sent on the company\u2019s official account said on Wednesday. When asked by a customer why larger 400g squeezy jars were hard to get hold of at the moment, the firm replied: \u201cDue to brewers yeast being in short supply (one of the main ingredients in Marmite) Supplies of Marmite have been affected. \u201cAs a temporary measure we have stopped production of all sizes apart from our 250g size jar which is available in most major retailers.\u201d The Mexico City mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Wednesday the capital will embark on a large-scale Covid-19 testing effort as the centerpiece of its plan to reopen its economy, diverging from the federal government\u2019s strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources, AP reports. The goal will be performing about 100,000 tests per month by July and with those results trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said in a news conference. It will be paired with an intensive information campaign. The sprawling city of 9 million with an equal number or more in the suburbs has confirmed more than 32,000 infections and more than 3,200 deaths, both considered to be undercounts because of limited testing. The city continues to recommend people stay at home if possible, but street traffic has increased considerably in recent weeks as some sectors of the economy were allowed to resume operations. Sheinbaum promised much more detailed information to track potential infections and their contacts. She also said that oxygen meters to provide peoples oxygen levels would be distributed to at-risk populations and pharmacies. Johns Hopkins has just added new cases to its tally for the US, with 1,999,313 currently confirmed. While Reuters and some other outlets have reported that cases have already passed 2 million, throughout the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen to rely on Johns Hopkins data, which is based on official figures. There have been 112,833 confirmed deaths in the US, which has the highest cases and deaths worldwide. Brazil, which is the next worst-affected in terms of cases, has 772,416. Many will be watching the daily case numbers from the US anxiously for the next few weeks, as the effects of relaxed restrictions \u2013 and Memorial Day weekend, which saw large crowds in parts of the country \u2013 as well as the recent protests are expected. It is still possibly too early to determine whether the protests have led to a spike, despite many protesters wearing masks and practising other social distancing measures. Already, nine California counties have reported a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalisations. New diagnoses in the heavily populated Los Angeles area are going up in part because testing is more widely available. But officials say infections and hospitalisations in most other parts of the state are being driven by factors tied directly to the loosening of restrictions or overt flouting of public health rules. Read more about those spikes in our story yesterday: Hello and welcome today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news from around the world for the next few hours.

As US cases near the 2 million mark, with 1,997,636 currently confirmed, according to Johns Hopkins University data, vice-president Mike Pence has claimed there has been no sign yet of an increase in cases from two weeks of protests across the country. He told the Fox Business Network: \u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t see an increase in new cases now, nearly two weeks on from when the first protests took effect. Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House task force Pence chairs, has expressed concern about the protests taking place during the pandemic. And nine California counties have reported a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalizations. New diagnoses are up partly due to more available testing, but loosening of restrictions and flouting of public health rules are also factors. Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: Mexico City will embark on a large-scale testing effort as the centrepiece of its plan to reopen its economy, its mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said. The plan sees it diverge from the federal government\u2019s strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources. The goal will be performing about 100,000 tests per month by July and trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said. The Associated Press reported that it would be paired with an intensive information campaign. France saw a below-average increase in deaths. The death toll has risen by only 23 \u2013 well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks \u2013 to 29,319. That is the fifth-highest nominal total in the world. Hollywood productions will be allowed to resume from Friday, local authorities said. While work could resume, cinemas must remain closed, California state officials said. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, has reported a record number of deaths for the second day running \u2013 even as its metropolis allowed shops to reopen. The centre of the Brazilian epidemic has recorded 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours, raising the state\u2019s confirmed death toll to 9,862, a fourth of the country\u2019s total fatalities, the governor\u2019s office said. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst-hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister. A US pharmaceutical company claimed a drug specifically designed to treat Covid-19 could be authorised for use as early as September. The chief scientist at Eli Lilly and Co told Reuters the feat could be achieved if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing. Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cord\u00f3ba, where he caught Covid-19. Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cord\u00f3ba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown. Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: \u201cOur evaluation is that 800,000 jobs will be lost in the coming months, or 2.8% of total employment.\u201d Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years, a leading Russian radio station has reported, indicating that the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least two times higher than official tallies for the month. The global economy will contract at least 6% this year, with the unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said. Airlines are set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast. With most of the world\u2019s airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely halve, falling from $419bn from $838bn last year. China was accused of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus. The European commission said Russia and China were running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns. in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d",
