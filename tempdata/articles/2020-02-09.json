      "bodyText": "As even House of Lords reformers sometimes allow, the old place has its assets. Yes, it remains a prodigiously costly, bloated, wasteful, unrepresentative and undemocratic feeding area for greedy nonentities and certified idiots, but consider, on the other hand, its pockets of expertise. Lord Winston\u2019s name is usually mentioned at this point. Ditto, Baroness Greenfield, who spoke a year ago. Martin, Lord Rees. Definitely a handful of scientists among the 800 or so trough-users. How many alarmist psychologists or actual astrophysicists does the House of Commons have, in comparison? Even the 12% of peers included by reason of male primogeniture can lay claim to a brainy hereditary, Lord Ridley, professional optimist and climate emergency sceptic. Last month, a debate on coronavirus allowed this polymath to deploy not just his scientific knowhow, but the fiscal wisdom acquired when, as chairman of Northern Rock (another inherited post), he presided over its collapse, including the first run on a British bank for 150 years. Virus-wise, Ridley said, he had a cold himself. Go figure. \u201cIf this virus does spread from man to man \u2013 sorry, person to person \u2013 there is a chance that it may reduce in virulence and it is, therefore, important to keep in perspective the warnings that we give people. While we must not underreact to this, it is also important that we do not overreact and cause major disruption to the economy.\u201d Nor is this sort of advanced perception limited to science and economic catastrophe. New recruit Lord Goldsmith can offer, for instance, in-depth experience of failure, first to become mayor of London, recently to keep his parliamentary seat. Where fraud and dishonesty are concerned, the House of Lords is one of the few legislatures, thanks to its ancient custom of never sacking anyone, regardless of their disgrace, whose membership usually boasts a fair number of qualified criminals. Not only illustrious ones, such as ex-perjurer Jeffrey Archer and Lord Black of Crossharbour (albeit pardoned by Donald Trump); the Tory peers Lord Taylor of Warwick and Lord Hanningfield have both bounced back from imprisonment for expenses fraud. In fact, Lord Hanningfield, whose defence lawyer once feared a sentence would ruin his prospects, returned with rare insights on fellow inmates. \u201cFor example, general knowledge is absent in a lot of prisoners,\u201d Hanningfield reported. \u201cHardly anyone had heard of the House of Lords.\u201d Given the random nature of Lords recruitment, the average age of promotion and the possibility that some experts might shun the opportunity to debate with people such as Ridley or David Cameron\u2019s host of former helpers, it\u2019s inevitable some important areas of expertise get neglected. Take workplace bullying. The reported inclusion in Labour\u2019s new list of peerage candidates of not one but two individuals who have faced \u2013 and denied \u2013 allegations of bullying underlines how easily an organisation that prizes only the most conventional markers of success may struggle to represent the interests of the less fortunate.

There are objections, elsewhere, to an ermine grab by Karie Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff, given disturbing and extensive allegations about being aggressive in the workplace \u2013 all denied \u2013 and while the party is still being investigated over its handling of antisemitism. One former staffer told the Huffington Post: \u201cThat would be the nail in the coffin for Corbyn. He will be beyond rehabilitation if he does that, quite frankly.\u201d Others question celebrity slimmer Tom Watson\u2019s fitness for a title, following his important role, when deputy Labour leader, in the persecution of innocent men targeted by the malevolent fantasist Carl Beech. Understandable: but these critics must still be able to make the case that, in honouring, as alleged, unforgivable obnoxiousness and stupidity, the Lords would be doing anything other than observe hallowed tradition.

      "body": "<p>The Derek and Joy Sander College of Drama and Elocution has a lot to answer for. When he was 10 years old, John Sweeney\u2019s family moved from Manchester down to Hampshire, and at his new school Sweeney was teased and bullied for his northern vowels. His worried mum sent him to elocution classes in Southampton to help him fit in. The drama college did not change his accent much \u2013 Sweeney was cast in plays as the flat-capped northerner \u2013 but it did an expert job in teaching him to project his voice.</p> <p>That voice has been a primary weapon in Sweeney\u2019s one-man tour of duty as a reporter over 40 years, not so much speaking truth to power as, on occasion, yelling it. It was most notoriously employed against the official spokesman of the Church of Scientology in 2007; a clip of Sweeney (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9032000/9032278.stm\">who apologised for \u201closing it\u201d on assignment for the BBC\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9032000/9032278.stm\">Panorama</a></em>) has been viewed several million times. It has also been consistently raised against tyrants and terrorists and gangsters (Sweeney, who retains a schoolboy sense of right and wrong, still likes to call them \u201cbaddies\u201d).

For a few of Sweeney\u2019s dozen years at this paper, I was his editor, taking in copy from his surrealist road trips through civil wars in Algeria and Bosnia and Burundi, heartfelt gonzo stories which dramatised the troubles of the world with himself at centre stage.</p> <p>When I knocked on his door in south London last week, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a few years, but he is one of those people with whom you just pick up in mid-sentence.

Jones was the junior foreign correspondent of the <em>Western Mail</em> in the 1930s, born in Barry. Having been posted to Russia in his 20s, he became the first journalist to tell the story of mass starvation in Stalin\u2019s regime, at a time when the rest of the world was hearing Soviet fake news. Sweeney\u2019s dramatic reconstruction of these events does not aspire to great subtlety, but the story of Jones, a man after the author\u2019s heart, is an enthralling one. (And the inspiration for a film released this week called <em>Mr Jones,</em> starring James Norton.)</p> <p>\u201cFor me, writing novels is like learning to be a brickie,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cMy first two thrillers were overcomplicated. But these historical thrillers (the first, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909269107/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1\" title=\"\">Elephant Moon</a></em>, was set in Burma during the second world war) I think I can do. I\u2019m just finally doing that<strong> </strong>thing of writing exactly the books I would love to read.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Useful Idiot</em> was written partly as therapy during the extremely stressful months in which Sweeney came to the end of his 17-year career at the BBC. The final act of that long and often volatile association had been a well-publicised series of clashes with the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>Sweeney had made an investigative film for <em>Panorama </em>about Robinson, exposing his links to far-right extremists in Germany. But the film \u2013 which went through 45 revised scripts \u2013 was never broadcast after Sweeney himself was secretly filmed, after far too many drinks, trying to persuade an associate of Robinson\u2019s to speak to him on camera. Along the way in that video, circulated online, he was heard suggesting that \u201cthe BBC was a stupid and irritating organisation\u201d and that he shared with Robinson heritage as an \u201cIrish scumbag\u201d.</p> <p>An online hate mob of Robinson supporters came after Sweeney and hundreds of them protested outside the BBC\u2019s Salford offices about his proposed <em>Panorama </em>film. The corporation felt it had no choice but to publicly apologise for the remarks Sweeney had made, which had been \u201coffensive and inappropriate\u201d. He was put on gardening leave before an eventual parting of the ways. In a parting shot to Robinson, Sweeney took to Twitter to say: \u201c\u2026 I can finally say these are not the views of the BBC, but he\u2019s a complete c**t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbb24b59b371af91772026ea0dd7f6c028ce1b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb24b59b371af91772026ea0dd7f6c028ce1b8c/0_318_4497_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambusing Vladimir Putin in Yakutsk, Russia in 2014 over the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambushing Vladimir Putin in Yakutsk, Russia in 2014 over the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By his own admission, Sweeney had something of a breakdown during that period. His second marriage had not long ended and he had recently lost his mother. He wasn\u2019t sleeping and was getting paranoid about the abuse. \u201cI would wake up at three in the morning and all this stuff was going round in my head. I have been threatened lots of times. But in Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan, you have a helmet, a flak jacket, perhaps a security officer. Suddenly the dangerous place is just outside your own front door. I\u2019m cycling around London and people are shouting: \u2018Fuck off Sweeney! Tommy Robinson owns you!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He went to see a psychiatrist about PTSD. The psychiatrist asked him if there were any events he had witnessed that might have triggered his anxiety. He started to tell him about a career that had taken in just about every conflict zone in the world. He talked about the genocidal Hutu and Tutsi killings in Burundi and was still describing things he had seen in Bosnia in the 1990s when the psychiatrist had to intervene to tell him that the session was nearly up. In the end he worked out a rest cure for himself. He and his ex-wife had bought an attic flat in Umbria a decade ago. \u201cI fucked off to Italy and Italy cured me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThough it is true that certain wine bar owners in Perugia\u2019s old town, when they see me, their faces do light up.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney now lives just south of the river with his dog, Bertie. His two kids are in their 20s and 30s. In the months since he left the BBC he has begun the research for a podcast series investigating the killing of his friend Paul Jenks, the British photographer who was shot by a sniper while working in Osijek in Croatia in 1992. He has started on the next novel as well as a memoir and remains involved with campaigning for justice for the murdered Maltese journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/new-claims-emerge-about-daphne-caruana-galizia-plan\" title=\"\">Daphne Caruana Galizia</a>, about whom he co-wrote another book.</p> <p>I wonder where, looking back, he thinks he gets his restless sense of injustice from, his need to go after the baddies. In reply he talks first about his parents, whose photos are on the wall above where we are sitting. His dad left school at 14 to be an apprentice at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. In 1943 he was a third engineer in the merchant navy during the battle of the Atlantic. \u201cHe was a very funny man,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cHe used to do an impression in the pub of how it felt when a depth charge went off when you were in the engine room and the whole world shaking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8320a5579ea891d8a5608a47da1b68019e52fe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8320a5579ea891d8a5608a47da1b68019e52fe7/0_145_1490_894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A frank exchange of words with Tommy Robinson during filming for Panorama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A frank exchange of words with Tommy Robinson during filming for Panorama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mum was originally a scouser too. \u201cThey spent their whole lives either laughing or throwing verbal hand grenades at each other. Which was great. I think they both had a very big sense of social justice and fairness and honesty, and I liked that. For example, I would never, ever fiddle my expenses,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThough I\u2019ll admit they have been substantial on occasion.\u201d</p> <p>I remind Sweeney that one of his lasting legacies at the <em>Observer</em> has been a more parsimonious approach to spending. This dates back to 1992 when he was in a hotel bar in Dubrovnik and the city was under siege. The hotel was being shelled. Sweeney used his voice projection to address the bar: \u201cWe are all going to die, champagne is on the <em>Observer</em>.\u201d Fortunately for the assembled hacks \u2013 but unfortunately for Sweeney\u2019s expense account \u2013 the hotel was spared. Five months later, when the siege ended and the hotel reopened, he received a bill by post for \u00a3983.</p> <p>He set out as a teenager wanting to be a lawyer, but having gone along to trials could never imagine himself defending anyone he believed to be guilty. Journalism did not require that. He got his first break when doing shifts on the <em>Sheffield Telegraph</em>. He\u2019d gone away to visit a friend who was backpacking in India, and on the trip managed to talk his way into an interview with the Dalai Lama. He thought he better dress up like Sir Robin Day for the occasion. The interview began with the Dalai Lama asking Sweeney why he was wearing a bow tie but no socks. It made a centre spread. When he returned, a report of a local crime came in and the news editor sent up the immortal words: \u201cThere has been a murder in Barnsley, where\u2019s the fookin\u2019 Tibet correspondent?\u201d</p> <p>His subsequent career is punctuated with comparable punchlines. Though apparently haphazard, he has an intuitive sense for the bigger picture. He was the first TV journalist, in 2013, to confront Donald Trump about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k3B-tw2sB0\" title=\"\">links to the Russian mafia</a>. No sooner was the name of convicted mobster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/felix-sater-trump-russia-investigation\" title=\"\">Felix Sater </a>\u2013 a former business partner of Trump\u2019s \u2013 out of Sweeney\u2019s mouth than Trump shook his hand and concluded their interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4cfa52e354f0d6830589439a4187f2dd767eadf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cfa52e354f0d6830589439a4187f2dd767eadf1/242_1409_3950_4937/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Sweeney: \u2018I see my hobby as annoying the far right.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Sweeney: \u2018I see my hobby as annoying the far right.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sweeney\u2019s proudest moment in this regard was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpZ_Q7GR7I\" title=\"\">his ambush of Vladimir Putin</a>. He was making a film about the shooting down of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/mh17-downed-by-russian-military-missile-system-say-investigators\" title=\"\">Malaysian Airlines flight</a> MH17, generally believed to be the work of Russian military in Ukraine \u2013 an allegation the Kremlin denied. His producer had realised Putin was due to open a new woolly mammoth museum in Yakutsk, Siberia and they thought they might confront the president there.</p> <p>Sweeney arrived in Yakutsk straight from a long and bibulous night at his niece\u2019s wedding, hungover and jet-lagged. \u201cMy beard was quite full, and we reckoned I could pass quite easily as a professor of mammothology,\u201d he recalls. He lined up with all the other museum curators, who had formed a guard of honour for the president. As Putin came up the steps, Sweeney greeted him with the words: \u201cTell me about the killings in Ukraine, Mr Putin.\u201d Putin, startled, stopped to give his version of events. When Sweeney tried to ask a follow-up question, \u201ca wall of Kremlin muscle closes around me and I am marched off down to the basement where I\u2019m locked in\u201d. He had no phone signal so was unable to contact his bosses at the BBC.</p> <p>When he lost his job recently, Sweeney being Sweeney, he fired off a \u201csubject access request\u201d to obtain the emails that were sent about him while he was in Siberia. He subsequently sends them to me. They include a note which reads: \u201cFunny! I\u2019d like to investigate John Sweeney. It\u2019s always him isn\u2019t it?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m just concerned that Sweeney is going to go roaming and try to do another doorstep [interview with Putin].\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The management have never known what it feels like to try to get neo-Nazi thugs to talk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He sees these notes as indicative of an organisation that \u2013 under siege from all sides \u2013 has lost its nerve. \u201cYou can\u2019t be as neurotic as they are and cope with someone like me. It takes up too much time for them.\u201d</p> <p>He used to have a joke with Mark Thompson, the former director general, who \u201cwhenever he saw me in the corridor he would make a point of literally running in the opposite direction\u201d. Under Tony Hall, he suggests, that retreat was much more in earnest. People like Sweeney, the kind of troublemakers that the best newsrooms have always indulged, \u201cbecame like the coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>He concedes that he probably did not advance his case by addressing director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, in emails as \u201cKim Fran-un\u201d. His great problem, he says, the complaint of journalists the world over, is that \u201cthe management have generally never known what it feels like to try to get neo-Nazi thugs to talk or to be under fire in order to get a story. My fantasy has always been just to work for someone who has also done that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>That was part of the substance of a recent letter to the TV regulator Ofcom that outlined his belief that there had been systemic editorial failures at the corporation, in particular in its handling of Brexit and Russia. He is awaiting a response. In the meantime, one or two of his run-ins with BBC management find their way verbatim into his novel and fit apparently seamlessly into an account of the Soviet secret police in the 1930s.</p> <p>His departure was a prelude to the coming round of BBC redundancies, which are no doubt likely to focus on the more expensive elements of news gathering \u2013 fewer filmed investigations, more talking heads. Before he left, like everyone else, Sweeney was doing vox pops about Brexit. He got it down to a fine art. \u201cI would get off the train, head straight to the main square, find the guy on a mobility scooter with a Waffen SS sticker and get his views on taking back control. Then head over to Waitrose and find some professor on their day off to put the Remain argument. Then, on the way back to the station, a mother with her kids saying: \u2018I just want them to get on with it.\u2019 Forty-five minutes tops. I could do it. But it wasn\u2019t anything to do with journalism.\u201d</p> <p>There has been, in the best of Sweeney\u2019s journalism, something far more dogged, that sense of being a proper pain to those with plenty to hide \u2013 and of looking for comedy as well as tragedy. He cites his TV heroes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/12/alan-whicker-tv-world-dies\" title=\"\">Alan Whicker</a>, Malcolm Muggeridge and celebrated Scot Fyfe Robertson. Before he left the BBC he at least fulfilled his ambition to do \u201ca proper Fyfe Robinson intro\u201d. He had been despatched to interview Ruth Davidson in January. The opening shot of his report was Loch Ness. Flat calm. And then suddenly, breaking the surface, Sweeney announcing: \u201cAll journalists worth their salt should avoid cliches like the plague. So where better than here, in Loch Ness, to start the hunt for that rare mystical beastie, the Scottish Conservative.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney is 61 now, but very far from any sense of retirement; in many ways he feels like he is just getting going. \u201cIt\u2019s like Rod Stewart has train sets, some people collect stamps,\u201d he says. \u201cI see my hobby as annoying the Church of Scientology, Kim Jong-un and the far right.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Useful Idiot is published </em><em>by Silvertail Books (\u00a39.99)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Derek and Joy Sander College of Drama and Elocution has a lot to answer for. When he was 10 years old, John Sweeney\u2019s family moved from Manchester down to Hampshire, and at his new school Sweeney was teased and bullied for his northern vowels. His worried mum sent him to elocution classes in Southampton to help him fit in. The drama college did not change his accent much \u2013 Sweeney was cast in plays as the flat-capped northerner \u2013 but it did an expert job in teaching him to project his voice. That voice has been a primary weapon in Sweeney\u2019s one-man tour of duty as a reporter over 40 years, not so much speaking truth to power as, on occasion, yelling it. It was most notoriously employed against the official spokesman of the Church of Scientology in 2007; a clip of Sweeney (who apologised for \u201closing it\u201d on assignment for the BBC\u2019s Panorama) has been viewed several million times. It has also been consistently raised against tyrants and terrorists and gangsters (Sweeney, who retains a schoolboy sense of right and wrong, still likes to call them \u201cbaddies\u201d). Its finest hour was when Sweeney spoke out, after a four-year investigation, about the evidence given by specialist witness Sir Roy Meadow in a series of cot-death trials. His stubborn work was crucial in helping to free three women falsely convicted for murdering their babies from Britain\u2019s jails in 2003 and save several others from prison. I first heard Sweeney\u2019s inimitable foghorn nearly 30 years ago in the Observer newsroom or, just as often, in the Coach and Horses pub next door, invariably telling stories of the places from which he had recently returned and just about lived to tell the tale.

When I knocked on his door in south London last week, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a few years, but he is one of those people with whom you just pick up in mid-sentence. He\u2019d invited me over to talk about his new book, The Useful Idiot, a novel set in Stalinist Moscow in 1932, as well as what he calls his \u201clatest troubles with the Beeb\u201d.

Though apparently haphazard, he has an intuitive sense for the bigger picture. He was the first TV journalist, in 2013, to confront Donald Trump about links to the Russian mafia. No sooner was the name of convicted mobster Felix Sater \u2013 a former business partner of Trump\u2019s \u2013 out of Sweeney\u2019s mouth than Trump shook his hand and concluded their interview. Sweeney\u2019s proudest moment in this regard was his ambush of Vladimir Putin. He was making a film about the shooting down of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, generally believed to be the work of Russian military in Ukraine \u2013 an allegation the Kremlin denied. His producer had realised Putin was due to open a new woolly mammoth museum in Yakutsk, Siberia and they thought they might confront the president there. Sweeney arrived in Yakutsk straight from a long and bibulous night at his niece\u2019s wedding, hungover and jet-lagged. \u201cMy beard was quite full, and we reckoned I could pass quite easily as a professor of mammothology,\u201d he recalls. He lined up with all the other museum curators, who had formed a guard of honour for the president. As Putin came up the steps, Sweeney greeted him with the words: \u201cTell me about the killings in Ukraine, Mr Putin.\u201d Putin, startled, stopped to give his version of events. When Sweeney tried to ask a follow-up question, \u201ca wall of Kremlin muscle closes around me and I am marched off down to the basement where I\u2019m locked in\u201d. He had no phone signal so was unable to contact his bosses at the BBC. When he lost his job recently, Sweeney being Sweeney, he fired off a \u201csubject access request\u201d to obtain the emails that were sent about him while he was in Siberia. He subsequently sends them to me. They include a note which reads: \u201cFunny! I\u2019d like to investigate John Sweeney. It\u2019s always him isn\u2019t it?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m just concerned that Sweeney is going to go roaming and try to do another doorstep [interview with Putin].\u201d He sees these notes as indicative of an organisation that \u2013 under siege from all sides \u2013 has lost its nerve. \u201cYou can\u2019t be as neurotic as they are and cope with someone like me. It takes up too much time for them.\u201d He used to have a joke with Mark Thompson, the former director general, who \u201cwhenever he saw me in the corridor he would make a point of literally running in the opposite direction\u201d. Under Tony Hall, he suggests, that retreat was much more in earnest. People like Sweeney, the kind of troublemakers that the best newsrooms have always indulged, \u201cbecame like the coronavirus\u201d. He concedes that he probably did not advance his case by addressing director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, in emails as \u201cKim Fran-un\u201d. His great problem, he says, the complaint of journalists the world over, is that \u201cthe management have generally never known what it feels like to try to get neo-Nazi thugs to talk or to be under fire in order to get a story. My fantasy has always been just to work for someone who has also done that stuff.\u201d That was part of the substance of a recent letter to the TV regulator Ofcom that outlined his belief that there had been systemic editorial failures at the corporation, in particular in its handling of Brexit and Russia. He is awaiting a response. In the meantime, one or two of his run-ins with BBC management find their way verbatim into his novel and fit apparently seamlessly into an account of the Soviet secret police in the 1930s. His departure was a prelude to the coming round of BBC redundancies, which are no doubt likely to focus on the more expensive elements of news gathering \u2013 fewer filmed investigations, more talking heads. Before he left, like everyone else, Sweeney was doing vox pops about Brexit. He got it down to a fine art. \u201cI would get off the train, head straight to the main square, find the guy on a mobility scooter with a Waffen SS sticker and get his views on taking back control. Then head over to Waitrose and find some professor on their day off to put the Remain argument. Then, on the way back to the station, a mother with her kids saying: \u2018I just want them to get on with it.\u2019 Forty-five minutes tops. I could do it. But it wasn\u2019t anything to do with journalism.\u201d There has been, in the best of Sweeney\u2019s journalism, something far more dogged, that sense of being a proper pain to those with plenty to hide \u2013 and of looking for comedy as well as tragedy. He cites his TV heroes as Alan Whicker, Malcolm Muggeridge and celebrated Scot Fyfe Robertson. Before he left the BBC he at least fulfilled his ambition to do \u201ca proper Fyfe Robinson intro\u201d. He had been despatched to interview Ruth Davidson in January. The opening shot of his report was Loch Ness. Flat calm. And then suddenly, breaking the surface, Sweeney announcing: \u201cAll journalists worth their salt should avoid cliches like the plague. So where better than here, in Loch Ness, to start the hunt for that rare mystical beastie, the Scottish Conservative.\u201d Sweeney is 61 now, but very far from any sense of retirement; in many ways he feels like he is just getting going. \u201cIt\u2019s like Rod Stewart has train sets, some people collect stamps,\u201d he says. \u201cI see my hobby as annoying the Church of Scientology, Kim Jong-un and the far right.\u201d The Useful Idiot is published by Silvertail Books (\u00a39.99)",
