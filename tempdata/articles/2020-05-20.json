href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding.</p> \n  <p>A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>The US president launched his attack late on Monday, sending a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the WHO had not been sufficiently independent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. The letter accused the WHO of making repeated mistakes, meaning thousands of lives had been lost, and America\u2019s interests not served.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\u201d Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n  <p>His attack was timed to coincide with the start of the two-day World <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> Assembly, which on Tuesday finally backed a draft resolution that supported a WHO-established independent and impartial inquiry into the WHO\u2019s conduct over the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The resolution, supported by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday and largely drafted by the European Union, stops short of the kind of international inquiry focused on China\u2019s conduct that was first canvassed by Australia and the US. The Chinese foreign ministry claimed the resolution was completely different from the politically motivated inquiry sought by Australia.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/member-states-back-who-after-renewed-donald-trump-attack\">Member states back WHO after renewed Donald Trump attack</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec46adf8f0864e579f14139\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T23:30:49.399Z\">12.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senate confirms Trump appointee to FEC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Senate has confirmed Trey Trainor, a conservative Texas attorney, to the Federal Elections Committee. </p> \n  <p>Trainor, an election law attorney, has pushed for less regulation of money in politics.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are a number of side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Donald Trump signed an executive order encouraging agencies to rollback regulations. \u201cAgencies must continue to remove barriers to the greatest engine of economic prosperity the world has ever known: the innovation, initiative, and drive of the American people,\u201d the order states. The Senate confirmed a Trump appointee to the Federal Elections Committee, giving the agency the four votes needed to regulate federal election campaign finance laws. Trey Trainor, the conservative Texas lawyer who as confirmed to the seat has pushed for less regulation of money in politics. Member states backed the WHO after another attack from Trump, calling for a global show of support. A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there would be an investigation into the global response to the pandemic, but did not endorse a major overhaul, as Trump requested. The president criticized a negative hydroxychloroquine study as a \u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d. A preliminary study of coronavirus patients at US veterans health administration medical centers found that showed those treated with the anti-malaria drug, which Trump has repeatedly promoted, had a higher risk of death. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, said he is not taking hydroxychloroquine. Pence\u2019s admission came one day after Trump told reporters he has been taking the drug in recent days, despite the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s guidance that it should only be used in hospital settings. Trump lashed out against Nancy Pelosi after the House speaker described the president as \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d. Pelosi said she did not think Trump should be taking hydroxychloroquine, particularly considering his age and weight. \u201cPelosi is a sick woman,\u201d Trump said in response. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems.\u201d The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, virtually testified before the Senate banking committee. Mnuchin warned that an extended shutdown could potentially cause \u201cpermanent damage\u201d to the US economy, while Powell suggested Congress may need to approve additional relief funding. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued some thinly veiled criticism of Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tweet your way through this,\u201d Cuomo said during his daily briefing. Patrick Wintour and Julian Borger report: Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday. The US president launched his attack late on Monday, sending a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the WHO had not been sufficiently independent of China, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. The letter accused the WHO of making repeated mistakes, meaning thousands of lives had been lost, and America\u2019s interests not served. \u201cIf the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\u201d Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. His attack was timed to coincide with the start of the two-day World Health Assembly, which on Tuesday finally backed a draft resolution that supported a WHO-established independent and impartial inquiry into the WHO\u2019s conduct over the coronavirus. The resolution, supported by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday and largely drafted by the European Union, stops short of the kind of international inquiry focused on China\u2019s conduct that was first canvassed by Australia and the US. The Chinese foreign ministry claimed the resolution was completely different from the politically motivated inquiry sought by Australia. The Senate has confirmed Trey Trainor, a conservative Texas attorney, to the Federal Elections Committee. Trainor, an election law attorney, has pushed for less regulation of money in politics. He advised the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign during the 2016 election. The confirmation ends longest period in the agency\u2019s history without a quorum. The committee will now have the four votes needed to regulate federal campaign finance laws. Who is Sean Conley, the doctor gave Donald Trump hydoxychloroquine? Conley is US navy veteran and is qualified in osteopathic medicine. Conley, who is from Pennsylvania, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2006 and went on to undertake a medical residency at a navy base in Virginia. He was then deployed to Afghanistan, where he acted as head of a trauma unit at a Nato base. The medical unit at the White House is typically staffed by doctors drawn from the US military and Conley found himself in line to become the president\u2019s own physician after the departure of Ronny Jackson, who had previously raised eyebrows by praising Trump\u2019s \u201cgood genes\u201d and for saying that if the president had had \u201ca healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old\u201d. Jackson had also sparked a short-lived \u201cgirther\u201d conspiracy movement after reporting Trump\u2019s weight as 239lb, just 1lb below a threshold that would class the president as obese. Trump sleeps just four or five hours a night, doesn\u2019t exercise outside rounds of golf and is fond of McDonald\u2019s but is fit enough for a second term, Jackson reported in 2018. Listen: The Guardian\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong explains that before reaching Trump, the hype around hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, had moved from small clinical studies through to influencers in Silicon Valley and then on to prime time shows on Fox News. But rather than being 100% effective as has been claimed, there are serious doubts about the drug\u2019s safety when taken to treat coronavirus. On Monday, thousands of visitors from across the country descended on Yellowstone national park, which opened for the first time since its closure in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sam Gilbert reports for the Guardian: \u201cWe have been cooped up for weeks,\u201d Jacob Willis told the Guardian near a crowd of onlookers at the Old Faithful Geyser. \u201cWhen the parks opened, we jumped at the opportunity to travel,\u201d said Willis, who had arrived from Florida. Yellowstone, America\u2019s oldest national park, and the nearby Grand Teton national park are the most recent to have partially reopened with the support of the Trump administration. \u201cI hope everybody is listening,\u201d Donald Trump announced earlier in May. \u201cThe parks are opening, and rapidly, actually.\u201d While many have celebrated the reopening of the revered landscapes, others have raised health concerns about large, possibly maskless, groups of out-of-state visitors arriving and potentially skirting social distancing guidelines. Republicans are recruiting doctors to promote Trump\u2019s plan to reopen the economy quickly, the AP reports: Republican political operatives are recruiting \u201cpro-Trump\u201d doctors to go on television to prescribe reviving the U.S. economy as quickly as possible, without waiting to meet safety benchmarks proposed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. The plan was discussed in a May 11 conference call with a senior staffer for the Trump reelection campaign organized by CNP Action, an affiliate of the GOP-aligned Council for National Policy. A leaked recording of the hour-long call was provided to The Associated Press by the Center for Media and Democracy, a progressive watchdog group.CNP Action is part of the Save Our Country Coalition, an alliance of conservative think tanks and political committees formed in late April to end state lockdowns implemented in response to the pandemic. Other members of the coalition include the FreedomWorks Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council and Tea Party Patriots. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, confirmed to AP that an effort to recruit doctors to publicly support the president is underway, but declined to say when the initiative would be rolled out. \u201cAnybody who joins one of our coalitions is vetted,\u201d Murtaugh said Monday. \u201cAnd so quite obviously, all of our coalitions espouse policies and say things that are, of course, exactly simpatico with what the president believes. ... The president has been outspoken about the fact that he wants to get the country back open as soon as possible.\u201d Environmental groups are none too pleased. \u201cTrump\u2019s latest order makes about as much sense as drinking bleach,\u201d said Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cHe\u2019s using the pandemic to slash life-saving protections for our air, water, and wildlife when these safeguards have never been more important. It\u2019s astounding that Trump is so out of touch with the majority of people who understand that there can\u2019t be economic recovery on a dying planet.\u201d Trump has signed an executive order encouraging agencies to cut regulations in the name of economic recovery. \u201cAgencies must continue to remove barriers to the greatest engine of economic prosperity the world has ever known: the innovation, initiative, and drive of the American people,\u201d the order states. A new study suggests a connection between crowded polling places and the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin during the state\u2019s 7 April election. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: The study finds a \u201cstatistically and economically significant association between in-person voting and the spread of Covid-19 two to three weeks after the election\u201d. By studying state election and Covid-19 data, researchers concluded that consolidating polling places and decreasing the number of absentee ballots led to an increase in positive Covid-19 tests weeks after the election. The research by economists at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ball State University was published as a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cOur results indicate that Wisconsin counties with higher levels of in-person voting per polling location led to increases in the weekly positive rate of Covid-19 tests,\u201d they wrote. Furthermore, counties with higher absentee voting participation had lower rates of detecting Covid-19 two to three weeks after the election. \u201cState and local officials scrambled in the weeks ahead of the election to prepare amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In Milwaukee, election officials were forced to close 175 of 180 polling places, but other places, such as the city of Madison, were able to keep 66 of 99 polling places open. State health officials said that 52 people who tested positive for Covid-19 participated in in-person voting, but have cautioned they don\u2019t know if people contracted the virus at the polls. Here\u2019s some more on that VA study that the president has described as \u201ca Trump enemy statement\u201d: The study by VA and academic researchers reviewed the cases of 368 male patients treated at government hospitals \u2013 97 treated with hydroxychloroquine, 113 with hydroxychloroquine, and the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 without any hydroxychloroquine. The study found that those who were treated with the antimalarial drug had a higher risk of death. But the research comes with several big caveats. Most significantly, the study is retrospective. Rather than randomly assigning some patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine and others without, researchers looked back on how patients who had and had not taken the drug fared. It\u2019s unclear why doctors gave some patients the drug and not others, and it\u2019s possible that physicians treated the most severe cases with hydroxychloroquine, which could at least partly explain why those patients fared worse. The research was published as a pre-print \u2013 it has not yet gone through a rigorous process of peer review. But there is absolutely no evidence that the researchers behind the study were biased, against the administration or against the use of the drug. In response to growing criticism, the VA said last week that while it wouldn\u2019t halt the use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, it would offer the unproven drug to fewer patients. In documents obtained by the Associated Press, the VA said it never \u201cencouraged or discouraged\u201d its government hospitals to use hydroxychloroquine. But publicly, the VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, has touted the drug and claimed without evidence that it has been shown to benefit younger veterans. Still, it acknowledged that Wilkie had wrongly asserted publicly without evidence that the drug had been shown to benefit younger veterans. The VA, the nation\u2019s largest hospital system, also agreed more study was needed on the drug and suggested its use was now limited to extenuating circumstances, such as last-ditch efforts to save a coronavirus patient\u2019s life. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the west coast. The former veterans affairs secretary, who said he was forced out of the Trump administration, has weighed in on Trump bashing the VA study that found patients who took hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t benefit. David Shulkin, a physician and former hospital executive who served as undersecretary of veterans affairs in the Obama administration, initially helped Trump pass an expansion of the GI Bill for post-9/11 veterans and a law that streamlined the appeals process for veterans seeking disability benefits. But he left the administration amid disagreements between him and more conservative administration officials and after the release inspector general\u2019s report that held Shulkin responsible for \u201cserious derelictions\u201d during an overseas trip . Donald Trump has reignited a controversy over the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after telling reporters he was taking the latter to protect himself against coronavirus. What do we know about these drugs? What is hydroxychloroquine? Hydroxychloroquine, which Trump says he has been taking for about two weeks, was developed as an antimalarial but it is also used to treat conditions like lupus, an anti-immune disease, and arthritis, where it can help combat inflammation. It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine. What\u2019s the state of the current evidence? In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients. A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a French trial also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group. The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial. What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine? There are a number of side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d. Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The president criticized a negative hydroxychloroquine study as a \u201cTrump enemy statement.\u201d A study of hundreds of coronavirus patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed those treated with the anti-malaria drug, which Trump has repeatedly promoted, were no less likely to need a ventilator and actually saw a higher death rate. Vice President Mike Pence said he is not taking hydroxychloroquine. Pence\u2019s admission came one day after Trump told reporters he has been taking the drug in recent days, despite the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s guidance that it should only be used in hospital settings. Trump lashed out against Nancy Pelosi after the House speaker described the president as \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d Pelosi said she did not think Trump should be taking hydroxychloroquine, particularly considering his age and weight. \u201cPelosi is a sick woman,\u201d Trump said in response. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems.\u201d Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed chairman Jerome Powell virtually testified before the Senate banking committee. Mnuchin warned that an extended shutdown could potentially cause \u201cpermanent damage\u201d to the US economy, while Powell suggested Congress may need to approve additional relief funding. New York governor Andrew Cuomo issued some thinly veiled criticism of Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tweet your way through this,\u201d Cuomo said during his daily briefing. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. None of Trump\u2019s cabinet members would say if they are also taking hydroxychloroquine to help prevent coronavirus. \u201cMany of them would take it if they thought it was necessary,\u201d the president told reporters during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged earlier today that he is not taking the anti-malaria drug, but he said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t hesitate\u201d to use it if his doctor recommended it. Once again, there is scant evidence that hydroxychloroqine is an effective coronavirus treatment, and the FDA has said it should only be used in hospital settings due to potential complications, including heart problems. Trump doubled down on his criticism of a hydroxychloroquine study, which showed coronavirus patients who were treated with the anti-malaria drug saw a significantly higher death rate. According to the results of a study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers, 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while the 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. \u201cThat was a false study done, where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was given by obviously not friends of the administration.\u201d Trump went on to falsely claim that evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine does not have negative side effects. \u201cWhat has been determined is it doesn\u2019t harm you,\u201d Trump said. In reality, the Food and Drug Administration has said hydroxychloroquine should only be used as a coronavirus treatment in hopsital settings, due to \u201creports of serious heart rhythm problems\u201d in virus patients who had received the drug. When a reporter mentioned the FDA guidance, Trump said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was told.\u201d Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin showed off the debit cards the Trump administration is producing to distribute coronavirus relief funds. During a cabinet meeting at the White House, Mnuchin said the debit cards would help the federal government get money to Americans \u201ceven quicker in a very safe way.\u201d Mnuchin presented Trump with a debit card with his name on it, jokingly adding, \u201cNow there\u2019s no money for you on it. This is a blank debit card.\u201d The president admired the card and then asked, \u201cDo I sign the letter again?\u201d That comment appeared to be a reference to the gushing letter Trump sent to accompany the direct cash payments from the stimulus package, which sparked accusations that the president was politicizing financial relief. Mnuchin replied to Trump\u2019s question, \u201cThe next time we send money, you\u2019ll get to send another letter.\u201d Senate minority leader takes issue with inaction on coronavirus crisis, rails as president challenges \u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d on hydroxychloroquine. The frustration vibrates off the screen. Here\u2019s New York Democrat and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer railing at Trump goings on on Capitol Hill this afternoon. Trump wants to talk about hydroxychloroquine and how a recent, large study that showed dubious benefits and plenty of dangers in relation to Covid-19 patients and anyone taking it as a prophylactic must be down to bias against him. Schumer wants to talk about something else. This study: Donald Trump announced moments ago that he will sign an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate \u201cunnecessary regulations that impede economic recovery.\u201d He said at a Cabinet meeting, Reuters reports: \u201cI\u2019m directing agencies to review the hundreds of regulations we\u2019ve already suspended in response to the virus and make these suspensions permanent where possible.\u201d Trump also tweeted this. Hand-shaking, back-slapping, not a mask in sight. This as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said any action on a new coronavirus-response bill could be \u201cweeks away\u201d. Republican senators said Trump talked about his polling numbers and upcoming nominations during the Senate lunch today. Senator John Cornyn said the president was \u201cactually pretty proud\u201d of his numbers, even though recent polls show Trump trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Asked if the president is frustrated he can\u2019t hold rallies right now because of coronavirus restrictions, Cornyn said, \u201cOf course he is.\u201d Chuckling, Cornyn added, \u201cThat\u2019s why he comes over here and talks to us.\u201d The vice president\u2019s office distributed his full answer about not taking hydroxychloroquine, even though the president has apparently been using the drug in recent days. \u201cI would never begrudge any American taking the advice of their physician,\u201d Mike Pence told Fox News in an interview at NASA\u2019s Washington headquarters. \u201cHydroxychloroquine is a drug that\u2019s been around for more than 40 years for treatment of malaria. But, early in this process, the FDA approved what\u2019s called off-label use where physicians could prescribe hydroxychloroquine in terms they deemed appropriate. \u201cSo my physician has not recommended that, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take the counsel of my doctor. Any American should do likewise.\u201d But the FDA has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment outside of hospital settings, warning there have been \u201creports of serious heart rhythm problems\u201d in coronavirus patients treated with the drug. Pressed on his admission that he has been using hydroxychloroquine, the president claimed a study indicating the anti-malaria drug was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a \u201cTrump enemy statement.\u201d \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.\u201d The president appears to be referring to a study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers. In reality, that study showed patients treated with hydroxychloroquine were no less likely to need a ventilator and saw a higher death rate. According to the study\u2019s results, 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while the 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. It should also be noted that the president\u2019s claim of the patients being \u201calmost dead\u201d would align with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s guidance that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside a hospital setting. The president\u2019s odd statement that the medical study was a \u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d comes as many of his critics warn he is politicizing science in the middle of a pandemic. Just minutes after saying he would not respond to Nancy Pelosi calling him \u201cmorbidly obsese,\u201d Trump unexpectedly unleashed an attack against the House speaker. \u201cPelosi is a sick woman,\u201d Trump said while answering a reporter\u2019s question about his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems.\u201d The president quickly wrapped up his Q&amp;A with reporters on Capitol Hill without providing much insight about what was discussed during the Senate Republican lunch he attended. When Republican senator Bill Cassidy was asked about the lunch, he told an MSNBC reporter, \u201cThe president was ... the president.\u201d Trump dismissed a critical comment from House speaker Nancy Pelosi about the president\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill after the Senate Republican lunch, Trump said of Pelosi, \u201cI don\u2019t respond to her. I think she\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d Pelosi was asked yesterday about Trump using the anti-malaria drug, which he has touted as a potential coronavirus treatment despite little evidence to support that claim. \u201cHe\u2019s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and his, shall we say, weight group ... morbidly obese, they say,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Vice President Mike Pence said he is not taking hydroxychloroquine. The admission came one day after Trump said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, even though there is scant evidence that the anti-malaria drug can effectively treat coronavirus. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed chairman Jerome Powell virtually testified before the Senate banking committee. Mnuchin warned that an extended shutdown could cause \u201cpermanent damage\u201d to the economy, while Powell indicated Congress should consider approving additional relief funds. New York governor Andrew Cuomo issued some thinly veiled criticism of Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tweet your way through this,\u201d Cuomo said of the government\u2019s response to the crisis. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn recaps New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing: Cuomo appeared to take a swipe at Donald Trump, who faces mounting criticism for his response to the pandemic. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tweet your way through this,\u201d the Democratic governor said. \u201cYou have to be competent.\u201d Cuomo insisted government is more important now than it\u2019s ever been in his lifetime. With 105 deaths confirmed Tuesday, New York state has now reach nearly 23,000 reported deaths from the virus. Still, the state\u2019s Capital Region, which includes Albany in the East, will begin the first phase of its reopening on Wednesday. The area joins the state\u2019s Western region, including Buffalo, which began reopening earlier this week. But when asked about any state cooperation with the federal government, Cuomo mostly reiterated the limits of a state government that \u201cdoes not do borders and customs,\u201d continuing his argument that the lack of an earlier European travel ban fueled the virus\u2019 spread. But Cuomo did urge the US Senate to act on a bill passed by the House of Representatives that would include relief funding for state and local governments. He also contended any coronavirus vaccine must be distributed to everyone once it is developed. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a situation where only the rich and only the privileged get the vaccine because only one company gets the rights and they can\u2019t produce for everyone,\u201d he said. On the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children, the governor confirmed New York now has seen 137 cases of the illness that is linked to coronavirus. Cuomo said he expects things to get much worse before getting better. He then erroneously charged that New York was the first to raise a flag on the illness. Countries in Europe, including the UK and Italy, have recently released studies warning of the outbreak among children. New York state will also start a 2-week pilot program to allow hospitals to admit visitors wearing personal protective equipment, the governor confirmed. The new measures are a relief for patients, many of whom have been gone without seeing family for weeks at a time. Cuomo also announced the state will allow Memorial Day ceremonies with 10 people or less to honor or mourn fallen military personnel. Trump was seen arriving on Capitol Hill for the Senate Republican lunch not wearing a mask, even though most lawmakers have been covering their faces in recent days. The president has been generally resistant to wearing a mask, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended face coverings to limit the spread of coronavirus. Trump is scheduled to tour a Ford Motors plant in Michigan tomorrow, and the company has said it will require him to wear a mask for the visit. Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill, where the president will participate in the Senate Republican policy lunch. Deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump will attend the Senate GOP Policy Lunch in the Hart Office Building to thank senators for their work during this unprecedented crisis, discuss the progress safely opening up America again, and explore the path to economic prosperity for all Americans.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence was on Capitol Hill earlier today to meet with Republican congressional leaders to discuss the next coronavirus relief package, but House minority leader Kevin McCarthy left the meeting saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see the need right now.\u201d According to the Fox News reporter who interviewed the vice president, Mike Pence said he was not taking hydroxychloroquine because his doctor had not recommended it. But Pence added that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t hesitate\u201d to use hydroxychloroquine, even though there has been little evidence that the anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment against coronavirus. In a memo last night, Trump\u2019s physician, Dr Sean Conley, said of the president\u2019s use of the drug, \u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said that he is not taking hydroxychloroquine during a Fox News interview at the NASA headquarters in Washington. The vice president had dodged questions earlier in the day about whether he, like Trump, was using the anti-malaria drug, which the president has touted as a potential coronavirus treatment. But again, the evidence for hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness is very scant, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it should not be used to treat coronavirus outside a hospital setting. Global carbon dioxide emissions dropped 17% last month, according to a new study, as lockdowns imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic shuttered businesses and severely limited travel around the world. Fiona Harvey reports: Daily emissions of the greenhouse gas plunged 17% by early April compared with 2019 levels, according to the first definitive study of global carbon output this year. The findings show the world has experienced the sharpest drop in carbon output since records began, with large sections of the global economy brought to a near standstill. When the lockdown was at its most stringent, in some countries emissions fell by just over a quarter (26%) on average. In the UK, the decline was about 31%, while in Australia emissions fell 28.3% for a period during April. But even though environmental advocates have been pushing to reduce emissions for years, experts said the drop was unlikely to last long after the coronavirus crisis concludes. Carbon emissions similarly decreased by 1.5% for a year during the financial crisis, but emissions then shot back up as if the drop had never occurred. Trump said his team was \u201cgoing after Virginia\u201d during a speech at the White House, which was ostensibly focused on providing financial relief to farmers and ranchers. \u201cWe\u2019re going after Virginia, with your crazy governor, we\u2019re going after Virginia,\u201d Trump told the farmers who were present for his remarks. The president then made a reference to gun rights, saying, \u201cThey want to take your Second Amendment away. You\u2019ll have nobody guarding your potatoes.\u201d Trump attracted scrutiny last month when he tweeted about Virginia\u2019s stay-at-home order, saying, \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d Trump sent similar tweets about Michigan and Minnesota, both of which also have Democratic governors. The president\u2019s critics accused him of inciting violence against the Democratic leaders, considering some of the participants of anti-shutdown protests have been seen carrying firearms as they demonstrate. Fed chair Jerome Powell has indicated he still supports Congress approving additional coronavirus relief funds, although his testimony before the Senate banking committee has been a bit more vague than some of his other recent comments. The central bank chairman told members of the committee, \u201cThis is the biggest shock we\u2019ve seen in living memory. The question that looms in the air is is it enough.\u201d Powell also said, \u201cMy concern has been the risk and possibility of longer-run damage to the economy. ... If we find ourselves in that place, we may have to do more.\u201d The chairman was a bit more explicit on the subject of more relief funding last week, when he said, \u201cAdditional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.\u201d Republican congressional leadership does not appear to have changed their position on the next coronavirus relief bill, after a meeting this morning with the vice president and the treasury secretary. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need right now,\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said of another relief package. House Democrats passed their version of the relief bill last week, but Trump has declared that legislation to be \u201cdead on arrival,\u201d and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he will slow-walk the next package. The closure at the US-Canadian border has been extended for another 30 days, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau confirmed this morning. The announcement means that America\u2019s northern border will be closed to non-essential travel until at least June 21. Trump administration officials have indicated they would move to extend the closure at the US-Mexican border as well. Michigan govenor Gretchen Whitmer said she has had an \u201copening conversation\u201d with Joe Biden\u2019s team about potentially joining the Democratic ticket as his running mate. \u201cI\u2019ve had a conversation with some folks,\u201d Whitmer told the \u201cToday\u201d show this morning. \u201cIt was just an opening conversation, and it\u2019s not something that I would call a professional formalized vetting.\u201d But Whitmer emphasized she was currently focused on her state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Nearly 5,000 people have already died of the virus in Michigan. \u201cI am making a little bit of time to stay connected to the campaign, but the most important thing that I have to do right now is be the governor of my home state,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters to me in this moment.\u201d Whitmer has been included on virtually every news outlet\u2019s list of Biden\u2019s potential running mates, and the governor appeared on the presumptive nominee\u2019s podcast last month. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed chairman Jerome Powell are currently virtually testifying before the Senate banking committee about the economic provisions of the coronavirus relief packages. Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mnuchin about the risks facing essential workers as the president pushes to reopen the economy. Mnuchin initially began his comments by thanking essential workers, but Brown replied that thanks were not sufficient to address the risks those Americans are taking on. \u201cHow many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow Jones by 1,000 points?\u201d Brown asked Mnuchin. The treasury secretary replied, \u201cNo workers should give their lives to do that, Mr Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair.\u201d The Senate intelligence committee has voted along party lines to approve the nomination of congressman John Ratcliffe as the next director of national intelligence, according to reports. As a reminder, Ratcliffe was previously considered for the DNI job last year, but he withdrew from consideration amid concerns about his qualifciations and potential partisan approach to the intelligence role. But Ratcliffe now seems likely to receive approval from Senate Republicans, who expressed some skepticism about his potential nomination last year. The president\u2019s appointment of US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell as the acting director of national intelligence may have eased Ratcliffe\u2019s confirmation, considering Grenell also has few intelligence qualifications and is a staunch Trump ally. Trump is reportedly expected to attend the Senate Republican lunch this afternoon, which did not appear on his initial public schedule for the day. Vice President Mike Pence was on Capitol Hill this morning meeting with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the next coronavirus relief package. Leaving the meeting to virtually testify before the Senate banking committee, Mnuchin said he and Pence received \u201ca good update\u201d and found the meeting \u201cvery helpful.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx ignored a question about whether she had concerns regarding Trump\u2019s apparent use of hydroxychloroquine. A reporter greeted Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, as she arrived at the White House this morning. When the reporter asked Birx about Trump\u2019s disclosure yesterday, Birx said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that it\u2019s not going to rain for the next three days?\u201d Okay then. Again, the Food and Drug Administration has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment outside of a hospital setting. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany confirmed this morning that Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, even though the effectiveness of the anti-malaria drug as a potential coronavirus treatment is very unclear. McEnany was pressed on why the president\u2019s physician was so vague in his memo about the president\u2019s disclosure. In the memo, Dr Sean Conley said, \u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d McEnany claimed the memo was not meant to confirm the president is using the drug and was instead intended to show Conley \u201cagreed with the analysis that the benefit outwighed the risk.\u201d This is Joan Greve, taking over for Martin Pengelly. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy this morning, according to reporters on Capitol Hill. The four Republican leaders are expected to talk about the next coronavirus relief package, which is currently stalled after House Democrats passed their version of the bill last week. Trump has declared the House bill \u201cdead on arrival,\u201d and McConnell has seemed comfortable with slow-walking the next relief package. But with more than 36 million Americans having filed claims for unemployment benefits in the past eight weeks, McConnell (and Trump) may be feeling pressure to act sooner rather than later. Department of Unusual But Telling Reports: NBC News says the traditional portrait unveiling ceremony, in which presidents welcome their predecessor back to the White House for the unveiling of a painting, ain\u2019t happening this year, in short, as presidential historian Michael Beschloss told NBC, because: You\u2019ve got a president who\u2019s talking about putting the previous one in legal jeopardy, to put it nicely. We have not seen a situation like that in history. It takes antipathy of a new president for a predecessor to a new level. How Trump feels about Obama and how Obama feels about Trump is pretty much known. Neither is keen, to put it lightly, and Trump is currently trying to gin up a scandal, \u201cObamagate\u201d, which he says is the worst in US political history, although he doesn\u2019t seem sure quite why. According to NBC, in 2012 Obama told George W Bush: \u201cWe may have our differences politically, but the presidency transcends those differences.\u201d Not at the moment, it doesn\u2019t. Here\u2019s David Smith on how Trump sees Obama: Fifteen Republican state attorneys general have filed a legal brief telling a federal judge they support the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to drop the case against the former national security adviser. According to CNN, which said it had obtained a copy of the legal brief, \u201cthe Republican attorneys general wrote they believed that Judge Emmet Sullivan\u2019s questioning of the justice department was the court \u2018inserting itself\u2019 into \u2018prosecutorial discretion\u2019 and politics. \u201cThey urged Sullivan to dismiss the case, ending Flynn\u2019s legal jeopardy. They also asked him to dismiss Flynn\u2019s charge \u2018without irrelevant or personal comment\u2019.\u201d Flynn, a retired general, was fired by Trump for lying to the vice-president about conversations with the Russian ambassador. He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Obama administration requests to \u201cunmask\u201d him, as an American speaking to surveilled foreign nationals during the investigation of Russian election interference, a routine intelligence practice, are at the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to create a scandal, so-called \u201cObamagate\u201d, to ensnare his predecessor and his challenger at the polls this year, former vice-president Joe Biden. Judge Sullivan has put a hold on attorney general William Barr\u2019s attempt to drop the case against Flynn, and appointed a retired judge, John Gleeson, to argue against the motion to dismiss. The 15 Republican attorneys general are from the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. In an open letter last week, almost 2,000 former justice department figures condemned the move to drop the case against Flynn. \u201cGovernments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics,\u201d they said. \u201cThey are autocracies.\u201d Barr has his own views on that. On Monday, while Senate judiciary chair Lindsey Graham said he wanted to subpoena records from senior Obama administration figures, the attorney general said he expected no criminal investigations would be opened into Barack Obama or Biden. But Barr also claimed he would never use the \u201ccriminal justice system for partisan political ends\u201d. Which as I noted earlier, is the kind of thing which causes comment when you have a record like Barr\u2019s. In Congress, the Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee will today hear from treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, about federal stimulus efforts for the cratering US economy. Short version: Powell wants more spending, Mnuchin doesn\u2019t, and neither do Republicans who control the Senate. The House passed a $3tn bill on Friday but Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows it isn\u2019t going anywhere. The hearing\u2019s at 10am \u2013 Mnuchin, with Vice-President Mike Pence, will also meet Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy on Capitol Hill. Donald Trump, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t have a briefing on his schedule today. But he will deliver \u201cremarks on supporting our Nation\u2019s Farmers, Ranchers, and Food Supply Chain\u201d at 11am and hold a cabinet meeting at 3pm. Precedent suggests that will give the president ample time to comment to the press should he so desire. Fox News hosts reacted in differing ways to Trump\u2019s declaration that he is taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, to guard against the coronavirus despite the FDA saying that is a bad idea. Fox News, you\u2019ll remember, enthusiastically joined the president in touting the drug in the early stages of the pandemic, until trial results came back and did not provide the results for which its proponents had been hoping. Safe to say, Trump\u2019s Monday bombshell set off a few explosions. Anchor Neil Cavuto got out of the gate with a horrified reaction: \u201cThis is stunning \u2026 A number of studies, those certainly vulnerable in the population have one thing to lose, their lives.\u201d \u201cI only make this not to make a political point here,\u201d Cavuto added, \u201cbut a life-and-death point. Be very, very careful.\u201d A medical expert was present to say Cavuto\u2019s assessment was correct and the Fox News website published a cautionary story about the drug. But, unsurprisingly, the opinion hosts who take over in the evenings \u2013 Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity \u2013 didn\u2019t agree. Nor did the president, who, entirely presidentially, retweeted a Twitter user whose biography says his \u201copinions are mine and my stash of lesbian porn proves I\u2019m not homophobic\u201d and who called Cavuto \u201can asshole\u201d. The president also opined: \u201cFox News is no longer the same. We miss the great Roger Ailes. You have more anti-Trump people, by far, than ever before. Looking for a new outlet!\u201d That would be the Roger Ailes who was Fox News chairman and CEO but was credibly accused of sexual harassment by a number of women, resigned in disgrace and died in 2017. To House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who told CNN of Trump\u2019s claim to be taking hydroxychloroquine\u2026 \u201cI would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: \u2018Morbidly obese,\u2019 they say\u201d. Is the president obese, morbidly or otherwise? Not to President Taft Is Stuck In The Bath levels, obviously (key fact, key fact fans: I\u2019m sort of related to Taft by marriage \u2013 sort of). But according to his 2019 physical, he is. This was how Politico put it last year, after the president\u2019s last full examination: \u201cPresident Donald Trump gained 4lbs over the last year, according to a new assessment from his doctor, a weight increase that makes him technically obese. But Trump\u2019s doctor, Sean Conley, nonetheless determined that the president \u2018remains in very good health overall\u2019 in a memorandum released by the White House.\u201d According to that assessment, Trump, 73, is 6ft 3in and 243lbs, which is technically obese and sometimes referred to as morbidly obese. Which doesn\u2019t make me, 42, at 6ft 4in and\u2026 more than that\u2026 feel particularly pleased with myself. About Dr Conley: he released a memo yesterday about Trump\u2019s claim to be taking a drug which the FDA says you shouldn\u2019t take as a guard against the coronavirus: Compare that missive and a White House spokeswoman\u2019s confirmation that Trump is taking the drug to what various prominent doctors were telling the US public last night: \u201cThere is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment or the prevention of Covid-19. The results to date are not promising.\u201d \u2013 Dr Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association People should not infer from Trump\u2019s example \u201cthat it\u2019s an approved approach or proven,\u201d because it\u2019s not \u2013 Dr David Aronoff, infectious diseases chief at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US and the politics around it, the day after Donald Trump claimed to be taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug which the FDA warns should not be taken as a response to the coronavirus threat \u2026 as a response to the coronavirus threat, then threatened to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization. Trump tweeted a letter to the WHO late on Monday night, saying it had 30 days to make \u201csubstantive\u201d changes or his funding freeze would become permanent and he would \u201creconsider our membership\u201d. Early on Tuesday, a WHO spokeswoman had no immediate comment, Reuters said. The Trump administration says the WHO is too close to China, which it blames for the pandemic, and has also started a fight at the world body over the status of Taiwan. Yes, all that happened. And as it did, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, the number of positive cases of Covid-19 in the US passed 1.5m and the number of deaths passed 90,000. As Tom McCarthy reported, hydroxychloroquine \u201cis not approved as a treatment for Covid-19 and Trump has not been diagnosed with the disease, to public knowledge. Trump\u2019s claim to be taking the drug was made as he attacked an administration whistleblower who went before Congress last week and described internal pressure to endorse the drug as an effective coronavirus treatment. The whistleblower, Rick Bright, was the former director of a federal agency in charge of vaccines. \u2026Previously, Trump had endorsed the injection of disinfectants or light into the body to fight coronavirus \u2013 recommendations that were followed by a spike in calls to poison control centers. \u2026Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment in March, a claim that was amplified for weeks on Fox News. But alarming reports in April about the health risks tied to the drug silenced that talk until the Bright episode. Where does one go from there? To widespread shocked reaction, for one thing, and to our explainer of what you need to know about the drug for another, and to Fox News hosts, if not all of them, heralding the president\u2019s supposed actions, for one more. In his testimony before Congress, by the by, Bright warned of \u201cthe darkest winter in modern history\u201d lying ahead if the US economy is reopened too soon, testing is not available as widely as possible and of course a vaccine is swiftly found. The virus, he and other public health experts fear, may come back. But Trump, who dropped his hydroxychloroquine bombshell around a teleconference with governors attempting to manage the pandemic, presses on with his determined attempt to \u201cREOPEN OUR COUNTRY\u201d and thereby \u201cTRANSITION TO GREATNESS\u201d. All this and more to come of course, including developments in Trump\u2019s other current project, the \u201cObamagate\u201d pseudoscandal which some cynical souls suggest might just be an attempt to distract from the administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic and the cratering economy. On Monday night, Senate judiciary chair Lindsey Graham said he wanted to subpoena papers from key Obama administration figures: Clapper, Comey, Brennan and so forth. Earlier, attorney general William Barr said no criminal investigations would be opened into Barack Obama or Joe Biden\u2019s actions in office towards Michael Flynn, the Trump aide who ended up pleading guilty to lying to the FBI before Barr decided to try to drop the case against him and Trump came up with its \u201cscandal\u201d over routine intelligence practices. Barr also said he wouldn\u2019t use the \u201ccriminal justice system for partisan political ends\u201d. Which is, well, the kind of thing which causes comment when you have a record like William Barr\u2019s. Oh, and there\u2019s a real scandal brewing at the Department of State, where Trump fired the official watchdog, who was investigating secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who Trump then seemed to throw somewhere near, if not yet right under, the bus. More to come.",

      "bodyText": "Samoans trapped at sea due to coronavirus have pleaded with their government to allow them to return home. The 321 Samoan seafarers working on commercial and cruise ships around the world have been told by their government to be patient, since Samoa closed its borders in March to all travellers including returning citizens. Thirty-five of the seafarers whose contracts ended at the beginning of the pandemic are concerned for their families as their sources of income have stopped. Twelve of them are stranded on MSC Armonia, a cruise ship moored off the coast of the Bahamas. \u201cIt has been almost three months since we have been stranded. We are no longer working. We have not been paid for almost three months, we merely are just waiting. We do not feel safe on these ships, we need your help,\u201d said Puletiu Taulapapa Sagale, one of the men on MSC Armonia. His plea was posted in a Facebook video viewed more than 90,000 times. In the video he describes a feeling of helplessness and fear among the Samoan seafarers. Samoan seafarer Sagale pleaded with Samoa to make an exception to the border closure and let them return home. In response, Lautimuia Afoa Uelese Vaai, the chief executive officer of Samoa Shipping Services, who is responsible for the contracts of the seafarers, said the men were safe. \u201cWe explained the terms and progress of negotiations with the shipping companies to these 35 sailors, that we will return them home once the pandemic ends.\u201d Vaai, in his public statement, said the men were looked after by the shipping companies who hired them. But Jorge Contesse, law professor and director of the Center for Transnational Law, Rutgers University said the seafarers had the right to return to their home country and were protected under the 2006 maritime labour convention (MLC). \u201cUnder this convention seafarers are entitled to be repatriated at no cost to themselves.\u201d Samoa ratified the convention in 2013. \u201cSamoa has a duty to protect its citizens and therefore it should activate diplomatic communications and legal proceedings if necessary,\u201d said Contesse. The International Labour Organization (ILO) committee responsible for the MLC issued a statement on Covid-19 in April that addressed this issue. \u201cIt has been disturbing to see reports that many port states have imposed local regulations and travel and quarantine restrictions on international seafarers.\u201d An information note issued in April by the ILO to employers, workers and member states including Samoa said they should make every attempt to comply with their obligations under the MLC and ensure the Covid-19 pandemic was not used as an excuse to breach it. In an email to the Miami Herald this month, MSC Cruises company spokesperson Luca Biondolilo said the majority of MSC crew left at sea lived in countries where borders were still closed.",

After nearly a decade of rancorous debate, lustful looks from developers, community protests and a green ban, the work on restoring the pavilion is expected to begin in June. The Construction, Forestry Mining and Engineering union on Wednesday lifted a green ban on work after being convinced that the latest plan by Waverley council will preserve the building for the community. It\u2019s a rare win for community rights over the inexorable forces of development, particularly when one of the most famous views in Sydney is at stake. \u201cIt harks back to the victories of the past,\u201d said a former Waverley mayor, John Wakefield, who as the Bondi ward councillor has led the fight to have the pavilion restored in a way that would keep it for the public. \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for the community, with help from councillors and the union movement.\u201d The Builders Labourer\u2019s Federation leader, Jack Mundey, whose green bans saved much of Sydney\u2019s historic fabric during the 1970s and who died this month, had, in his latter years, lent his support to the cause of preserving the Pav for the people. The heart of the debate over the pavilion\u2019s future has been whether the much-overdue restoration of the deco building should be paid for by including commercial facilities, or whether the community should be able to use the building as they had for decades. Most days there are yoga classes, dance groups, craft workshops and theatre rehearsals in the warren of studios upstairs. The downstairs houses a cafe, a bar on the corner and exhibition space, plus some run-down change rooms for bathers.

Labor and the Greens regained control of Waverley council in 2016 and immediately scrapped the plan in favour of a more modest $34m makeover that concentrated on restoring the bones of the building and retaining its community functions, while enhancing the experience for visitors. The new design, by the architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer, will integrate the outdoor and indoor spaces, connecting Bondi beach to the parklands and Campbell Parade while celebrating the building\u2019s history. The terracotta roof will be restored to its original cordova pattern, there will be a tourist office, a cultural space called the Bondi Story Room where the history of the local area will be on show, an art gallery, pottery studio, new toilets and change rooms and refurbishment of the Pav\u2019s unique existing rooms. David Shoebridge, the Greens MP who has also been involved in the campaign, said: \u201cThe community and the CFMEU worked together to save this iconic part of Sydney\u2019s heritage, a reminder that it is possible to take on the big end of town and win. \u201cThere could not be a more poignant time to be reminded of the power of green bans given the recent passing of Jack Mundey.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary inquiry into domestic and family violence, established in the wake of the murders of Hannah Clarke and her children, has been curtailed months ahead of schedule, without seeking any submissions or holding public hearings. The final report of the committee was labelled an \u201cabject failure\u201d and appalling by the Law Council of Australia, and heavily criticised in an excoriating dissenting report by the crossbench senator Rex Patrick. The inquiry had a broad remit to investigate \u201cimmediate and long-term\u201d measures that could help to prevent domestic and family violence. A report was not due until 13 August. Many groups who support women and children in violent situations had hoped the inquiry might make recommendations to address the sort of coercive controlling behaviour that the Brisbane murders of Clarke and her children had brought to the public\u2019s consciousness. Instead, the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs tabled a report that noted 13 unanswered questions, which it said should be considered when developing a new national plan to reduce violence against women and children, due in 2022. Patrick, in a lone dissenting report, said not seeking to answer these questions, hold hearings or seek submissions had rendered the inquiry a failure. \u201cThe committee recognises a number of questions that need answering ... and yet, in clear dereliction of duty, it did not seek answers to them,\u201d Patrick wrote. \u201cThe committee failed itself, the Australian public, Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful children, Aaliyah, Laianah, and Trey, and all victims of domestic violence, past, present and future. \u201cThe committee ... did not discharge its responsibility to the Senate and, more importantly, the public. \u201cThe committee is reporting three months ahead of time and doing so without seeking a single submission and without holding a single hearing.

      "body": "<p> </p> \n<p>Australia is slowly emerging from Covid-19 lockdowns and every state enforcing physical distancing laws slightly differently.</p> \n<p>Politicians have said these rules are simple, but it is clear the public still has a lot of questions about coronavirus lockdown rules and restrictions.</p> \n<p>In most states enforcement is left up to police officers\u2019 discretion, therefore it is difficult to provide exact information on what is or isn\u2019t allowed.</p> \n<p>Here we try to answer some of the most common questions people have about the new laws based on the information, though these answers should not be treated as legal advice. An asterisk indicates Guardian Australia has sought clarification from the state or territory government and will update when it is received.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can I sit in a park alone?</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>New South Wales</strong> \u2013 Yes. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/what-you-can-and-cant-do-under-rules/changes#what-is-changing-on-15-may\">NSW government\u2019s website</a>, as of 15 May you can go to a park for recreational purposes, such as to have a picnic. You are also allowed to gather in public spaces, like parks, with up to 10 other people. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Victoria </strong>\u2013 Unclear*. Legislation suggests that you would only be allowed in a park for the purpose of exercise, but on 1 April Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton told ABC radio that he thought sitting in a park alone was an acceptable activity as it posed little risk of spreading infection. Guardian Australia has requested clarification from Victoria police and the premier\u2019s office.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>Yes, <strong> </strong>as of Friday 1 May people are allowed to leave the home for recreational activities. This means you are<strong> </strong>allowed to sit in a park even if you aren\u2019t exercising. You can do this alone, with up to 10 guests<strong> </strong> or with all the members of your household.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Tasmania </strong>\u2013 Technically no*, Tasmanian residents are only allowed to leave the house for essential reasons. The essential reasons include exercise, however, sitting in a park for recreational reasons is not allowed. But<strong> </strong>a spokeswoman for Tasmania police said they are unaware of anyone being charged or summonsed in relation to sitting in parks so far.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Australian Capital Territory \u2013</strong> As of 8 May, ACT residents are allowed to gather in groups of up to 10 people indoors and outdoors, and have picnics. Therefore, it is likely to be OK to sit in a park by yourself, or with others,<strong> </strong> as long as you are observing responsible physical distancing. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Western Australia </strong>\u2013 Yes, you are allowed to leave the home for recreational reasons, and are now allowed to meet with up to 20<strong> </strong>people. However, you are not permitted to travel restricted to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>South Australia and Northern Territory </strong>\u2013 Yes. There are currently no fines for leaving the house for non-essential reasons, however unnecessary socialisation is discouraged. In SA gatherings are limited to 10.<strong> </strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Can I visit my romantic partner if we don\u2019t live together?</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland</strong> \u2013 Yes.<strong> </strong>Up to five people are allowed to visit another\u2019s person\u2019s home in all three states.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Tasmania \u2013</strong> Yes. Tasmania has a broad definition of \u201csocial support\u201d which is considered an essential reason for leaving the home. This allows for romantic partners and family members to still visit one another, however social distancing must still be observed and you are not permitted to stay overnight unless you have elected their home to be your primary residence from 31 March on.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Australian Capital Territory \u2013 </strong>Yes, households are allowed to have two additional guests at a time, however, there must be at least four square metres per person indoors. Outdoor gatherings are limited to two, or members of the same household. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Western Australia \u2013 </strong>Yes, up to 20 people are allowed to gather.<strong> </strong>. You are allowed to travelto all but four regional areas. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>South Australia and Northern Territory \u2013 </strong>Yes. There are currently no fines for leaving the house for non-essential reasons, however unnecessary socialisation is discouraged. In SA Gatherings are limited to 10. </p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>All states currently allow you to leave the home and meet with at least<strong> </strong>one person to do exercise. This means you are allowed to meet your partner or a friend in public to exercise with them. Some states have limits on how far you can travel for exercise, however, and the maximum number of people you can meet see.</p> \n<h2>Can I temporarily move in with my partner during the lockdowns?</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>NSW \u2013 </strong>Yes, you are allowed to move house.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Victoria \u2013 </strong>Yes, you are allowed to move house.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>Yes, but there may be restrictions on how far those helping you move are allowed to travel.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Tasmania, ACT \u2013 </strong>Yes, you are allowed to move house. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>WA \u2013 </strong>Yes, you are allowed to move house, but there may be restrictions on crossing some<strong> </strong>regional borders.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>SA and NT \u2013 </strong>Yes, there are currently no fines for leaving the house for non-essential reasons.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Can I take my dog for a walk?</h2> \n<p>Yes, in all states you are allowed to leave your home for exercise, which includes dog walking.

NSW Police <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nswpoliceforce/posts/10157738379496185\">posted on Facebook </a>in April that they \u201cconsider that it would be a reasonable excuse for a person to leave their house to receive driving lessons (either from a driving instructor or a member of their family), given that it is a learning activity that cannot be done from home \u2026 \u201d They also said that learner drivers could drive with a supervising family member under one of the reasonable excuses for leaving the house, such as going to the supermarket.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>You can learn to drive if your instructor is in your household. You are allowed to drive around your local neighbourhoods to gain hours, or anywhere if travelling for an essential reason.

      "bodyText": "Australia is slowly emerging from Covid-19 lockdowns and every state enforcing physical distancing laws slightly differently. Politicians have said these rules are simple, but it is clear the public still has a lot of questions about coronavirus lockdown rules and restrictions. In most states enforcement is left up to police officers\u2019 discretion, therefore it is difficult to provide exact information on what is or isn\u2019t allowed. Here we try to answer some of the most common questions people have about the new laws based on the information, though these answers should not be treated as legal advice. An asterisk indicates Guardian Australia has sought clarification from the state or territory government and will update when it is received. Can I sit in a park alone? New South Wales \u2013 Yes. According to the NSW government\u2019s website, as of 15 May you can go to a park for recreational purposes, such as to have a picnic. You are also allowed to gather in public spaces, like parks, with up to 10 other people. Victoria \u2013 Unclear*. Legislation suggests that you would only be allowed in a park for the purpose of exercise, but on 1 April Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton told ABC radio that he thought sitting in a park alone was an acceptable activity as it posed little risk of spreading infection. Guardian Australia has requested clarification from Victoria police and the premier\u2019s office. Queensland \u2013 Yes, as of Friday 1 May people are allowed to leave the home for recreational activities. This means you are allowed to sit in a park even if you aren\u2019t exercising.

Australian Capital Territory \u2013 As of 8 May, ACT residents are allowed to gather in groups of up to 10 people indoors and outdoors, and have picnics.

Tasmania has a broad definition of \u201csocial support\u201d which is considered an essential reason for leaving the home. This allows for romantic partners and family members to still visit one another, however social distancing must still be observed and you are not permitted to stay overnight unless you have elected their home to be your primary residence from 31 March on.

Can a tradesperson still come into my house to do work? Yes, however only if it is for essential works. If it can wait, it should. Physical distancing practices should be observed. Can I still learn to drive? NSW \u2013 Yes. NSW Police posted on Facebook in April that they \u201cconsider that it would be a reasonable excuse for a person to leave their house to receive driving lessons (either from a driving instructor or a member of their family), given that it is a learning activity that cannot be done from home \u2026 \u201d They also said that learner drivers could drive with a supervising family member under one of the reasonable excuses for leaving the house, such as going to the supermarket. Queensland \u2013 You can learn to drive if your instructor is in your household. You are allowed to drive around your local neighbourhoods to gain hours, or anywhere if travelling for an essential reason. If they are caught doing otherwise, they face a $1300 fine from police. Victoria \u2013 A teenager was fined for learning to drive in early April, but Victoria police have since withdrawn the fine. Deputy commissioner Shane Patton said in early April that, nonetheless, getting driving practice for the sole reason of accruing hours \u201cis not an essential activity \u2026 [except] when driving to purchase food or supplies, or when travelling to work or education\u201d. Western Australia \u2013 A Department of Transport spokesperson has previously said that \u201clearners and supervisors are encouraged to assess their need to continue to practise driving at this time\u201d, and encouraged drivers to have a supervisor from their household. From Monday 18 May, you are only limited from travelling to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. SA \u2013 No specific advice. But there are no restrictions on travel within South Australia. Tasmania \u2013 Driving lessons are considered a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for leaving home, and lessons with an instructor are exempt from the 1.5 metre social distancing rule, meaning trainers can sit in the front seat. Learner drivers should stick to their local area, though. NT, ACT \u2013 No specific advice. Who decides if I am breaking the new laws? Generally, enforcement will be left up to the discretion of police officers. States have expressed different approaches, for example, the ACT says it will be issuing a warning in the first instance, while Victoria has adopted a more hardline attitude to those break social distancing rules. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said he would personally review all physical-distancing fines issued in the state. \u201cIf I think it\u2019s unreasonable, it will be withdrawn immediately and we\u2019ll make personal contact with the individual,\u201d he said. What are my options for challenging a fine? Not all states have specified this, however, it appears these fines can be appealed using the same process as other fines issued by police. Information on how to lodge an appeal should be available on your state or territory\u2019s government website.

      "body": "<p>The director Robert Altman used to tell Peter Gallagher, the suave star of his 1992 movie The Player: \u201cGallagher, you\u2019re so good-looking it makes me sick.\u201d To hear Gallagher impersonating the gruff auteur, it was not quite a compliment. But he was used to that.</p> <p>During a heated rehearsal for The Real Thing, Gallagher\u2019s breakout role on Broadway at the age of 29, another director, Mike Nichols, admitted to not being able to stand the sight of him. \u201cAnd we were close!\u201d says Gallagher cheerfully, speaking over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. He responded by growing an \u201cawful white goatee\u201d until Nichols pleaded for him to shave.</p> <p>Critiques of Gallagher\u2019s performance often linger on his looks. They seem integral to the cocksure ne\u2019er-do-wells he plays: from a vengeful spouse in Altman\u2019s Short Cuts, to a lawyer sleeping with his wife\u2019s sister in Sex, Lies and Videotape, to the braggadocious \u201creal estate king\u201d in American Beauty. Altman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/archives/film-an-actor-in-search-of-elusive-lady-luck.html\">said he cast</a> Gallagher as a shortcut to character, just his face communicating \u201chandsome, vain, sleazy\u201d.</p> <p>Even at 64, Gallagher continues to play bad guys: an absent father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/new-girl-screwball-comedy-gets-funnier-and-smarter-and-is-best-when-binged\">in the sitcom New Girl</a>, a three-time divorcee and white-collar criminal in Netflix\u2019s Grace and Frankie. \u201cIt has a lot to do with how I look,\u201d he agrees. \u201cWhen I was younger, I had the kind of face that if <em>I</em> saw me walking down the street, I\u2019d say: \u2018What an asshole! Look at that rich kid who\u2019s had everything handed to him! Fuck him!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet Gallagher has little in common with his privileged parts. From working-class Irish-Catholic stock, he carved out a 40-year career in show business by \u201cshowing up\u201d, he says. \u201cThe only thing I know is you\u2019ve got to be willing to work harder than everybody else.\u201d Even now, quarantining at home, Gallagher is practising singing daily, so as to \u201cnot completely go to seed\u201d.</p> <p>The character he seems most like is Sandy Cohen, the statesmanly patriarch of the 00s teen-dramedy The OC, one of television\u2019s greatest-ever dads. \u201cAfter Bill Cosby fell a few spots \u2026\u201d he jokes drily. As a father, to film-maker James and musician Kathryn, Gallagher says: \u201cI try to be Sandy Cohen. I never, ever wanted my kids to see me angry, because I know that anger just stops a kid. It chokes everything off.\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher\u2019s own childhood was characterised by that emotional instability. \u201cThe impression was we were always sort of living on the edge.\u201d He was born in New York City in 1955, the unplanned youngest of three. He was close to his mother, a bacteriologist, but for much of his childhood she suffered from social anxiety and depression, which he connects to her parents\u2019 experience of emigrating to the US from Ireland. \u201cShe would be unable to get out of bed, and I had to take care of her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca5e7ffaf759a7b3f875c5c8d11fee694d7b3184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca5e7ffaf759a7b3f875c5c8d11fee694d7b3184/0_0_1536_1001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Kathleen York in The OC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Kathleen York in The OC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gallagher\u2019s parents, both of whom are dead, fought constantly.

That has informed his own marriage, to Paula Harwood, a former producer turned interior designer, whom he met in his first year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. This month they mark their 37th<strong> </strong>wedding anniversary, which is, says Gallagher, \u201cembarrassing for Hollywood\u201d.</p> <p>But his relationship with his father \u2013 a second world war veteran and advertising executive \u2013 casts a long shadow. Gallagher describes a distant, dismissive figure. \u201cI would try my whole life to reach him, just to get him to respond to me. \u2018Dad, what were you in the war?\u2019 \u2018A general. Now go clean the gutters.\u2019 \u2018Dad, what are taxes?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Young Gallagher took his father\u2019s indifference as a personal failing. In his career \u2013 he says, in that cogent way that comes with therapy \u2013 he sought out surrogates such as Nichols, Altman and his co-stars Jack Lemmon and Peter O\u2019Toole. Lemmon gave Gallagher a set of golf clubs. O\u2019Toole took him to a football game.</p> <p>On stage, following a script, Gallagher felt liberated, finally confident he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything wrong\u201d. In fact, he was getting enough right to land the part of Danny Zuko in Grease on Broadway, from an open audition in 1978. Yet he was not immune from the fickleness of show business. He notes the irony of \u201cthe best creative experience I ever had\u201d \u2013 1984\u2019s The Real Thing, alongside Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons \u2013 precipitating his quarter-life crisis of confidence. Despite all his promise, opportunities dried up. Now Gallagher blames his agent; then it coalesced with his \u201cself-loathing, lack of confidence\u201d and childhood trauma. \u201cI started to question every morsel of my being until I couldn\u2019t really function.\u201d</p> <p>Even in his depression, Gallagher recognised he was at a \u201ctransition point \u2026 I could keep banging my head against the wall and have a tragic outcome \u2013 or pay attention to what was going on inside.\u201d He quit the play and started over, with therapy and acting classes. \u201cIt was like a key into a lock.\u201d</p> <p>Focusing on the craft allowed Gallagher to distance himself from the outcome \u2013 for better and worse. What he identifies as his career low, the 1992 Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls, was a critical and commercial hit. But Gallagher felt boxed in by the director, prevented from giving his best; that \u201crough treatment\u201d led him to avoid musicals for 25 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen something works in show business, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d says Gallagher \u2013 so he has little time for big egos making it harder. Seeing someone get fired on a film set \u201cjust for a power thing\u201d made a lasting impression. \u201cOne of the most toxic things in the world is success. I\u2019ve seen people think they have all the answers, like: \u2018If I\u2019ve succeeded at this, then there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t succeed at!\u2019 You want to say: \u2018Dude \u2013 you\u2019re a member of the effin\u2019 lucky club.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Given his consistent career, it could seem surprising that Gallagher never made it as a leading man. In 1993 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/archives/film-an-actor-in-search-of-elusive-lady-luck.html\">the New York Times noted</a> how \u201clady luck\u201d was resistant to his \u201clubricious charm\u201d. Gallagher puts it down to his inability with self-promotion. For years he wanted to prove that \u201cit\u2019s not who you know, it\u2019s how good you are\u201d \u2013 but, he laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s fucking stupid, because [who you know] means a lot. I just don\u2019t have the confidence socially.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, he says: \u201cI think the whole idea of stardom is kind of baloney; I never really bought into it. I wouldn\u2019t have had the skills, the way of thinking \u2026 I\u2019ve seen the people who have achieved it, and what they\u2019ve done to get there.\u201d</p> <p>There is more freedom to being a character actor, he says; more scope to surprise. The benefit to playing bad guys is that the parts were often underwritten. \u201cThey just wanted him to be an asshole \u2026 so it gave me a little elbow room,\u201d says Gallagher. In the 1995 romcom While You Were Sleeping, he resisted the writers\u2019 attempt to zhoosh up his character by making him an \u201cawful person\u201d, instead of just poorly suited to Sandra Bullock. \u201cWhy burden the audience with someone to hate? There\u2019s just more opportunity in playing the character truthfully.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06194627b46afc7ed6b5045f1b3b08f5d8d5aacb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06194627b46afc7ed6b5045f1b3b08f5d8d5aacb/0_0_1780_1185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Laura San Giacomo in Sex, Lies, and Videotape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Laura San Giacomo in Sex, Lies, and Videotape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Virgin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He served as a similar check on The OC. At just 26, the showrunner, Josh Schwartz, was open to his input on \u201cthe parent stuff\u201d, says Gallagher \u2013 so each week he and Harwood would go through the script: \u201cAw, jeez, if I said that, they should just send me to social services.\u201d \u201cMischa [Barton, who played troubled young Marissa Cooper] spends the night with my business partner, and I\u2019m supposed to say: \u2018That\u2019s cool\u2019? No way!\u201d</p> <p>For all the writers\u2019 occasional \u201ccapriciousness\u201d, Gallagher says The OC was successful because of \u201cthe organism of the ensemble\u201d \u2013 and the timing. Post 9/11 the US had \u201crun with the wrong ball\u201d, closing borders and embracing xenophobia, \u201cthe most cowardly, un-American thing\u201d. Sandy Cohen was a corrective: a principled public defender, a New York Jew married to a gentile Californian, \u201cnot afraid to welcome others into his home. I thought that was the perfect story to be telling.\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher sees parallels with his latest project, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist\">Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist</a>, which just concluded its first season on NBC (E4 in the UK). In the whimsical musical dramedy, Zoey hears others\u2019 private thoughts as songs \u2013 highlighting, for Gallagher, the importance of a sympathetic ear \u201cin an era when we\u2019ve been intentionally divided\u201d.</p> <p>The Trump presidency has special significance for born-and-bred New Yorkers, he says sombrely. \u201cWe knew his father was a white supremacist,\u201d he says, but they didn\u2019t take Donald seriously until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">his attacks on the Central Park Five</a>, a group of black teenagers who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman. \u201cWe realised he was no longer funny; there was a darkness, and a willingness to do harm.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to look to Trump for Buddy Kane, Gallagher\u2019s ludicrous character in American Beauty: \u201cI thought, who has the hugest opinion of themselves in real estate?\u201d Gallagher was made heavier and older, and approximated the \u201cpouffey thing going on\u201d with an old wig of Cary Grant\u2019s. \u201cSo when I was in bed with Annette Bening, Cary Grant was on top of her.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years on, it is \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, says Gallagher, to see the country \u201cbamboozled by this con man \u2026 It really feels like they left the back door of the Capitol open.\u201d He mimes a bandit, egging others on. \u201cTake anything you can and get the hell out before they catch on! You want the parks?\u201d</p> <p>And amid coronavirus, the stakes have never been higher. Gallagher winces: \u201cIt\u2019s a little painful, having been raised by a bacteriologist mother, to hear someone blatantly disregarding science.\u201d His mother had helped to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/17/health/17romansky.html\">develop the</a> Romansky formula during the second world war, revolutionising the administration of penicillin. She died in 2004 after a 20-year struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d150f136cb59fa8082c50c2ca39023c43098de80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d150f136cb59fa8082c50c2ca39023c43098de80/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Jane Levy in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Jane Levy in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The experience informed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/04/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-review-musical-dramedy-hits-all-the-wrong-notes\">his role in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist;</a> he plays Zoey\u2019s father, who is paralysed by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a somewhat similar brain disease. \u201cWhat gave me some relief was that PSP doesn\u2019t always find the same expression in people,\u201d says Gallagher. The series creator, Austin Winsberg, whose father died of PSP, was also a check. \u201cI knew that if I was screwing it up, he\u2019d go: \u2018No!\u2019 And if he was leaving because he had to cry, I thought: \u2018I\u2019m in the ballpark.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher has been gratified by praise from people with experience of PSP, or of caring for a parent \u2013 but some criticised his casting, as an able-bodied actor. What is his view: that disabled parts should go to disabled actors? That there is a limit to the experience that can be portrayed by acting? Gallagher flips the question: \u201cI would say, people with disabilities shouldn\u2019t be automatically excluded from playing any role.\u201d He notes that one episode features deaf actors and musical numbers in sign language. And \u201chard and fast rules about who should do what\u201d do not recognise the hurdles a project has to clear in order to get made, he says, with mounting (and somewhat surprising) impatience.</p> <p>The answer, as he sees it, is more, and more diverse stories \u2013 and by that measure progress is fast. He points to Grace and Frankie, in which he plays Jane Fonda\u2019s love interest. \u201cWhat an extraordinarily disruptive notion: people older than 25 have life experience that deserves investigation and sharing!\u201d he says with good-natured sarcasm. \u201cAnd, my God \u2013 there are people 25 and under that want to watch!\u201d</p> <p>It is the chance to be part of those stories that have \u201ca place in the world\u201d that keeps Gallagher singing his scales in quarantine and, he believes, will see show business through the challenge of coronavirus. \u201cBroadway was supposed to be over with 9/11; it turned out to be exactly what the world needed. And what are people doing in quarantine? They\u2019re watching a lot of Netflix. Because these stories are important.\u201d</p> <p>And even the bad guys have a part. Days after 9/11, Gallagher was asked to go to Ground Zero to boost the morale of emergency workers who had missed out on visits from the president and the Yankees. \u201cThe fires were still burning, the smell of death \u2026\u201d Gallagher\u2019s last big picture had been American Beauty. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018What have I done with my life? I\u2019ve got to change jobs, do something that counts.\u201d And all of a sudden, one of the firefighters \u2026\u201d Gallagher erupts in a New-Yoik holler. \u201c\u2018LOOK WHO\u2019S HERE! \u2018FUCK ME, YOUR MAJESTY\u2019, IT\u2019S THE KING!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Buddy Kane was an asshole.

      "bodyText": "The director Robert Altman used to tell Peter Gallagher, the suave star of his 1992 movie The Player: \u201cGallagher, you\u2019re so good-looking it makes me sick.\u201d To hear Gallagher impersonating the gruff auteur, it was not quite a compliment. But he was used to that. During a heated rehearsal for The Real Thing, Gallagher\u2019s breakout role on Broadway at the age of 29, another director, Mike Nichols, admitted to not being able to stand the sight of him. \u201cAnd we were close!\u201d says Gallagher cheerfully, speaking over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. He responded by growing an \u201cawful white goatee\u201d until Nichols pleaded for him to shave. Critiques of Gallagher\u2019s performance often linger on his looks. They seem integral to the cocksure ne\u2019er-do-wells he plays: from a vengeful spouse in Altman\u2019s Short Cuts, to a lawyer sleeping with his wife\u2019s sister in Sex, Lies and Videotape, to the braggadocious \u201creal estate king\u201d in American Beauty. Altman said he cast Gallagher as a shortcut to character, just his face communicating \u201chandsome, vain, sleazy\u201d. Even at 64, Gallagher continues to play bad guys: an absent father in the sitcom New Girl, a three-time divorcee and white-collar criminal in Netflix\u2019s Grace and Frankie. \u201cIt has a lot to do with how I look,\u201d he agrees. \u201cWhen I was younger, I had the kind of face that if I saw me walking down the street, I\u2019d say: \u2018What an asshole! Look at that rich kid who\u2019s had everything handed to him! Fuck him!\u2019\u201d Yet Gallagher has little in common with his privileged parts. From working-class Irish-Catholic stock, he carved out a 40-year career in show business by \u201cshowing up\u201d, he says. \u201cThe only thing I know is you\u2019ve got to be willing to work harder than everybody else.\u201d Even now, quarantining at home, Gallagher is practising singing daily, so as to \u201cnot completely go to seed\u201d. The character he seems most like is Sandy Cohen, the statesmanly patriarch of the 00s teen-dramedy The OC, one of television\u2019s greatest-ever dads. \u201cAfter Bill Cosby fell a few spots \u2026\u201d he jokes drily. As a father, to film-maker James and musician Kathryn, Gallagher says: \u201cI try to be Sandy Cohen. I never, ever wanted my kids to see me angry, because I know that anger just stops a kid. It chokes everything off.\u201d Gallagher\u2019s own childhood was characterised by that emotional instability. \u201cThe impression was we were always sort of living on the edge.\u201d He was born in New York City in 1955, the unplanned youngest of three. He was close to his mother, a bacteriologist, but for much of his childhood she suffered from social anxiety and depression, which he connects to her parents\u2019 experience of emigrating to the US from Ireland. \u201cShe would be unable to get out of bed, and I had to take care of her.\u201d Gallagher\u2019s parents, both of whom are dead, fought constantly. He remembers, at age six, seeing the family\u2019s brand-new television sailing through the air. \u201cI used to pray for them to get divorced, it was just so noisy sometimes.\u201d Later, as an adult, he saw the love between them, and \u201cthat there was grace to be maybe had, if you stayed the course\u201d. That has informed his own marriage, to Paula Harwood, a former producer turned interior designer, whom he met in his first year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. This month they mark their 37th wedding anniversary, which is, says Gallagher, \u201cembarrassing for Hollywood\u201d. But his relationship with his father \u2013 a second world war veteran and advertising executive \u2013 casts a long shadow. Gallagher describes a distant, dismissive figure. \u201cI would try my whole life to reach him, just to get him to respond to me. \u2018Dad, what were you in the war?\u2019 \u2018A general. Now go clean the gutters.\u2019 \u2018Dad, what are taxes?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019\u201d Young Gallagher took his father\u2019s indifference as a personal failing. In his career \u2013 he says, in that cogent way that comes with therapy \u2013 he sought out surrogates such as Nichols, Altman and his co-stars Jack Lemmon and Peter O\u2019Toole. Lemmon gave Gallagher a set of golf clubs. O\u2019Toole took him to a football game. On stage, following a script, Gallagher felt liberated, finally confident he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything wrong\u201d.

The Trump presidency has special significance for born-and-bred New Yorkers, he says sombrely. \u201cWe knew his father was a white supremacist,\u201d he says, but they didn\u2019t take Donald seriously until his attacks on the Central Park Five, a group of black teenagers who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman. \u201cWe realised he was no longer funny; there was a darkness, and a willingness to do harm.\u201d Still, it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to look to Trump for Buddy Kane, Gallagher\u2019s ludicrous character in American Beauty: \u201cI thought, who has the hugest opinion of themselves in real estate?\u201d Gallagher was made heavier and older, and approximated the \u201cpouffey thing going on\u201d with an old wig of Cary Grant\u2019s. \u201cSo when I was in bed with Annette Bening, Cary Grant was on top of her.\u201d Twenty years on, it is \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, says Gallagher, to see the country \u201cbamboozled by this con man \u2026 It really feels like they left the back door of the Capitol open.\u201d He mimes a bandit, egging others on. \u201cTake anything you can and get the hell out before they catch on! You want the parks?\u201d And amid coronavirus, the stakes have never been higher. Gallagher winces: \u201cIt\u2019s a little painful, having been raised by a bacteriologist mother, to hear someone blatantly disregarding science.\u201d His mother had helped to develop the Romansky formula during the second world war, revolutionising the administration of penicillin. She died in 2004 after a 20-year struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The experience informed his role in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist; he plays Zoey\u2019s father, who is paralysed by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a somewhat similar brain disease. \u201cWhat gave me some relief was that PSP doesn\u2019t always find the same expression in people,\u201d says Gallagher. The series creator, Austin Winsberg, whose father died of PSP, was also a check. \u201cI knew that if I was screwing it up, he\u2019d go: \u2018No!\u2019 And if he was leaving because he had to cry, I thought: \u2018I\u2019m in the ballpark.\u2019\u201d Gallagher has been gratified by praise from people with experience of PSP, or of caring for a parent \u2013 but some criticised his casting, as an able-bodied actor. What is his view: that disabled parts should go to disabled actors? That there is a limit to the experience that can be portrayed by acting? Gallagher flips the question: \u201cI would say, people with disabilities shouldn\u2019t be automatically excluded from playing any role.\u201d He notes that one episode features deaf actors and musical numbers in sign language. And \u201chard and fast rules about who should do what\u201d do not recognise the hurdles a project has to clear in order to get made, he says, with mounting (and somewhat surprising) impatience. The answer, as he sees it, is more, and more diverse stories \u2013 and by that measure progress is fast. He points to Grace and Frankie, in which he plays Jane Fonda\u2019s love interest. \u201cWhat an extraordinarily disruptive notion: people older than 25 have life experience that deserves investigation and sharing!\u201d he says with good-natured sarcasm. \u201cAnd, my God \u2013 there are people 25 and under that want to watch!\u201d It is the chance to be part of those stories that have \u201ca place in the world\u201d that keeps Gallagher singing his scales in quarantine and, he believes, will see show business through the challenge of coronavirus. \u201cBroadway was supposed to be over with 9/11; it turned out to be exactly what the world needed. And what are people doing in quarantine? They\u2019re watching a lot of Netflix. Because these stories are important.\u201d And even the bad guys have a part. Days after 9/11, Gallagher was asked to go to Ground Zero to boost the morale of emergency workers who had missed out on visits from the president and the Yankees. \u201cThe fires were still burning, the smell of death \u2026\u201d Gallagher\u2019s last big picture had been American Beauty. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018What have I done with my life? I\u2019ve got to change jobs, do something that counts.\u201d And all of a sudden, one of the firefighters \u2026\u201d Gallagher erupts in a New-Yoik holler. \u201c\u2018LOOK WHO\u2019S HERE! \u2018FUCK ME, YOUR MAJESTY\u2019, IT\u2019S THE KING!\u2019\u201d Buddy Kane was an asshole. But they were still glad to see him.",

      "bodyText": "The capacity of public parks and outdoor facilities to accommodate socially distanced sunbathers is likely to be tested on Wednesday with what is predicted to be the hottest weather of the year so far. The Met Office predicts temperatures could reach 29C in south-east England, topping the year\u2019s previous hottest day when 26C was recorded at Treknow, Cornwall on 10 April. There were people sunbathing alongside the Thames in central London and dozens headed to the beach at Margate, while golfers headed back on to courses and people queued up for outdoor food markets. Coming just over a week after Boris Johnson announced the easing of lockdown restrictions that now permit people across England unlimited exercise outside, travel for exercise and limited outdoor socialising (with Scotland and Wales now also allowing outside exercise more than once a day, along with Northern Ireland where limited outdoor gatherings are permitted too), the warm weather will be a welcome relief to Britons who have been stuck inside for weeks. However, the sunshine is a major test of the social distancing measures enforced by the government in England, which allow meeting up with one person from another household outdoors, as long as two metres distance is maintained. In his announcement of lockdown easing measures \u2013 which came into effect on 13 May \u2013 Johnson said: \u201cYou can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.\u201d Local councils urged the public to keep social distancing, and issued reminders that many facilities, like outdoor pools and public toilets, remain closed. Police were spotted patrolling a number of parks to ensure people were abiding by the guidance. Despite rules in England now stating that people are allowed to travel for exercise, many tourist hotspots have asked people to stay away and warned that attractions will remain closed. Coastal towns also issued warnings reminding people that the majority of beaches are not currently lifeguarded, although sea swimming, paddle boarding, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, kayaking and canoeing are all now permitted as daily exercise in England. HM Coastguard said it was called out nearly 200 times over the weekend, to incidents including inflatables drifting offshore, crashed jetskis and pleasure boats, and people injured while out walking or cycling along the coast. The sunny weather isn\u2019t predicted to last though, with thunderstorms predicted for Thursday. Met Office chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: \u201cIt is across east and south-east England where these are most likely, with frequent lightning, hail and torrential downpours of up to 40mm in a few hours all possible.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to clarify that the easing of restrictions across the UK with respect to exercise did not all follow from Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement, which applied only to England; the three other nations of the UK issued their own adjustments to guidance as health is a devolved matter.",

Efforts have been further complicated by the government\u2019s insistence on deploying a centralised tracing database, which records a user\u2019s contacts and the first half of their postcode if they declare they are ill. The NHS says it wants to be able to monitor for regional outbreaks, but that approach is not favoured by tech giants Apple and Google \u2013 who say contact data should be retained only by a person on their phone. That has forced the NHS development team to develop a string of \u201cworkarounds\u201d to try to make the system run smoothly. A particular concern has been to ensure that the phone remains on \u2013 so the app can track connections \u2013 whilst not draining the battery. Signs of the growing difficulties were acknowledged by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary on Tuesday morning. She conceded that children may start returning to primary school on 1 June before the app was ready. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that\u2019s been set as a condition that\u2019s necessary for the phased reopening of primary schools,\u201d she said. A government source added that the app should be seen as \u201ca support: a digital supplement\u201d to human contact-tracing \u2013 and downplayed the significance of the new technology, insisting: \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit too much focus on the app.\u201d Privacy watchdogs also warned on Tuesday that the tracing app could hand a huge amount of personal information to the government. Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: \u201cGiven the government\u2019s record of sharing health, education and police records with immigration enforcement, it\u2019s alarming that it has chosen an app design that prioritises data collection \u2013 including data not needed for contact-tracing \u2013 over privacy.\u201d Labour MP Harriet Harman, the chair of parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights, called for MPs to be allowed to vote on preventing government from using the data collected for other purposes \u2013 although Hancock has insisted fresh legislation is not required to get started. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 22 May 2020 to more accurately reflect the content of the story.",

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, when Australia\u2019s climate and energy botch-up was still in its infancy, politicians and their advisers used to talk up the virtues of gas as a transitional fuel, and they used to talk about carbon capture and storage (CCS) as technology that governments needed to invest in to drive the transition to low-emissions economies. The great botch-up is now well past infancy, and Australia\u2019s record on climate and energy is a disaster so profound it\u2019s still traumatising backstage protagonists years after the stadium rock wreckers have left the crime scene. Yet people in power are still talking within the same parameters. Gas. CCS. As if these might be new discoveries \u2013 as if the economics of the transition have remained immutable in the decade we spent watching the political class execute inter-generational failure at our expense. Just in case you\u2019ve missed the Morrison government warming up the talking points about Australia\u2019s great gas-led recovery from the economic shock of Covid-19, allow me to bring this winter marketing offensive to your attention. The prime minister, several ministers, and some prominent corporate advisers, like the former Fortescue boss Nev Power, are out, banging that drum. We are told cheap gas will help restart an economy hit for six by coronavirus. Cheap gas will boost flagging growth, create jobs, and make projects considered uneconomic five minutes ago suddenly economic. It is gas nirvana, as far as the eye can see \u2013 except it is unclear to me where this cheap gas will come from. Gas prices have fallen recently, but will these falls be sustained? Are falling gas prices really the environment in which companies will pursue new investments? Won\u2019t they worry about stranded assets? Won\u2019t they worry about carbon risk \u2013 that being a real thing. Ask the Reserve Bank. Or the banking regulator. Or the corporate regulator. Australia\u2019s gas industry needs to be able to extract and sell the resource at a rate of return that justifies any new investments accompanying the opening up of new supply. That\u2019s a basic rule of business, unless there\u2019s some undisclosed fine print. Unless, of course, the real story is taxpayers are going to be saddled with the risks of marginal investments, which makes gas nirvana sound more like a billion-dollar boondoggle dreamed up by a kitchen cabinet of vested interests. But that doesn\u2019t sound nearly as exciting, does it? Just while we are on this, gas nirvana also has another dimension. It is being invoked, in part, to justify the reworking the miserable suite of alleged emissions reduction policies that the Coalition has kept on life support since the Abbott era. If the future is gas and CCS, then the policies will need another tweak to make them fit for purpose, because low emissions are just a matter of definition. The government says we need to look at CCS because all the sensible people are technologically neutral, not ideological. The goal should be emissions reduction, never mind the means. Fine as far as it goes, except that parable lacks some context. The real story is this: Australia has failed to take meaningful action to reduce emissions, because the Coalition has wrecked progress at every turn for more than 10 years. The truth is the Liberal and National parties have blown the critical decade. That failure is now an implicit justification for more taxpayer support for CCS, because the need may become so pressing that all options will have to be on the table to try and stave off the worst-case scenario \u2013 not that the arguments will ever be framed in such frank terms. The talking point says this: Australia can sequester emissions, we can have our fossil fuel cake and eat it too. Cue applause track.

What I\u2019m saying today is two things: resources are finite, and the government has options. Let\u2019s call them option A and option B. Option A sees the Morrison government choose not to make a mockery of the international climate commitments it signed up to, voluntarily, in 2015.

      "body": "<p>Since the pandemic was declared all Australian states wentinto various levels of lockdown.</p> \n<p>On Friday 8 May, the federal government announced a three-stage plan to ease coronavirus restrictions across the country, with the goal of reaching stage three by July. Ultimately, though, it is up to each state and territory to decide when and how far they would be relaxing restrictions in the coming months.</p> \n<p>The states and territories have already announced their plans in response.</p> \n<p>So what are the laws as they currently stand?</p> \n<p>These are the laws as of Wednesday 20 May.<strong> </strong>This article will be updated as new restrictions are implemented or repealed.</p> \n<h2>Queensland</h2> \n<p>Under the current regulations in Queensland, up to five adults from different<strong> </strong>households are allowed to visit another home. These rules come under the first stage of the state government\u2019s three-stage plan to ease restrictions.</p> \n<p>Queenslanders are now<strong> </strong>allowed to shop for non-essential items. Picnics and weekend drives are allowed and national parks have reopened. Residents are now allowed to travel up to 150km from your home for recreational purposes, but cannot enter the \u201cOutback\u201d unless they live there.</p> \n<p>Those who live in Outback Queensland, <a href=\"https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/government-actions/outback-queensland\">defined here</a>, can travel up to 500km within the Outback for recreational reasons, and can stay for multiple nights away from their place of residence given how far they may be travelling.</p> \n<p>As of 3 April, interstate travel is still closed to everyone except residents and essential workers, including freight carriers and emergency workers. Barriers are still erected in the<strong> </strong>Gold Coast suburb of Coolangatta, which straddles both Queensland and NSW. There are some exemptions for those who regularly cross the Queensland-NSW border for work.</p> \n<p>Up to 10 people can gather outside. This means that groups of 10 or less can engage in outdoor non-contact sport, group training and boot camps, and picnics. Queenslanders can also go to the park, playground, skatepark, or national park for recreational purposes.</p> \n<p>Weddings are<strong> </strong>allowed 10 guests, and funerals 20 guests indoors and 30 outdoors.</p> \n<p>Beauty salons can<strong> </strong>open back up, and pubs and cafes in regional or rural areas with no cases are<strong> </strong>able to seat up to 20 people. Open homes will also be allowed.</p> \n<p>The second stage of relaxing restrictions will start on 12 June, and see gatherings of up to 20 people; indoor cinemas, entertainment venues and amusement parks reopening; and greater recreational travel distances allowed.</p> \n<p>Stage three will start on 10 July. While premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said<strong> </strong>details are \u201csubject to further planning and review\u201d, intrastate and interstate travel will be permitted, and a maximum of 100 people allowed to gather in homes, public spaces, and other venues including cinemas, places of worship, and restaurants.</p> \n<p>Queensland police officers are still able to issue on-the-spot fines of $1,334.50 for individuals and $6,672.50 for corporations who breach these laws. The maximum penalties available through the courts are 10 times those amounts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>New South Wales</h2> \n<p> As of Friday 15 May,<strong> </strong>up to five<strong> </strong>adults are allowed to visit another person\u2019s home in NSW. There is no limit the number of guests someone is allowed per day as long as there are no more than five<strong> </strong>at a time.</p> \n<p>There is no limit on how far someone can travel to visit another household under this rule. You are still not allowed to travel to regional or rural areas for a holiday, but this restriction will be lifted on 1 June. </p> \n<p>Art galleries, libraries and museums will also reopen on 1 June.</p> \n<p> From Friday, public gatherings of up to 10 people, or members of the same household, are also<strong> </strong>allowed. Outdoor playground and exercise equipment can also now be used, with caution, and outdoor pools are open.</p> \n<p>Berejiklian has encouraged retail stores to reopen, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Cafes, restaurants and pubs can seat 10 diners at any one time, as long as they allow for four square metres per person. They must also ensure there are 1.5 metres between patrons.</p> \n<p>Weddings can now have up to 10 guests, in addition to those conducting the service, a photographer, a videographer and the couple.

      "bodyText": "Since the pandemic was declared all Australian states wentinto various levels of lockdown. On Friday 8 May, the federal government announced a three-stage plan to ease coronavirus restrictions across the country, with the goal of reaching stage three by July. Ultimately, though, it is up to each state and territory to decide when and how far they would be relaxing restrictions in the coming months. The states and territories have already announced their plans in response. So what are the laws as they currently stand? These are the laws as of Wednesday 20 May. This article will be updated as new restrictions are implemented or repealed. Queensland Under the current regulations in Queensland, up to five adults from different households are allowed to visit another home. These rules come under the first stage of the state government\u2019s three-stage plan to ease restrictions. Queenslanders are now allowed to shop for non-essential items. Picnics and weekend drives are allowed and national parks have reopened. Residents are now allowed to travel up to 150km from your home for recreational purposes, but cannot enter the \u201cOutback\u201d unless they live there. Those who live in Outback Queensland, defined here, can travel up to 500km within the Outback for recreational reasons, and can stay for multiple nights away from their place of residence given how far they may be travelling. As of 3 April, interstate travel is still closed to everyone except residents and essential workers, including freight carriers and emergency workers. Barriers are still erected in the Gold Coast suburb of Coolangatta, which straddles both Queensland and NSW. There are some exemptions for those who regularly cross the Queensland-NSW border for work. Up to 10 people can gather outside. This means that groups of 10 or less can engage in outdoor non-contact sport, group training and boot camps, and picnics. Queenslanders can also go to the park, playground, skatepark, or national park for recreational purposes. Weddings are allowed 10 guests, and funerals 20 guests indoors and 30 outdoors. Beauty salons can open back up, and pubs and cafes in regional or rural areas with no cases are able to seat up to 20 people. Open homes will also be allowed. The second stage of relaxing restrictions will start on 12 June, and see gatherings of up to 20 people; indoor cinemas, entertainment venues and amusement parks reopening; and greater recreational travel distances allowed. Stage three will start on 10 July. While premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said details are \u201csubject to further planning and review\u201d, intrastate and interstate travel will be permitted, and a maximum of 100 people allowed to gather in homes, public spaces, and other venues including cinemas, places of worship, and restaurants. Queensland police officers are still able to issue on-the-spot fines of $1,334.50 for individuals and $6,672.50 for corporations who breach these laws. The maximum penalties available through the courts are 10 times those amounts. New South Wales As of Friday 15 May, up to five adults are allowed to visit another person\u2019s home in NSW. There is no limit the number of guests someone is allowed per day as long as there are no more than five at a time. There is no limit on how far someone can travel to visit another household under this rule. You are still not allowed to travel to regional or rural areas for a holiday, but this restriction will be lifted on 1 June. Art galleries, libraries and museums will also reopen on 1 June. From Friday, public gatherings of up to 10 people, or members of the same household, are also allowed. Outdoor playground and exercise equipment can also now be used, with caution, and outdoor pools are open. Berejiklian has encouraged retail stores to reopen, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Cafes, restaurants and pubs can seat 10 diners at any one time, as long as they allow for four square metres per person. They must also ensure there are 1.5 metres between patrons. Weddings can now have up to 10 guests, in addition to those conducting the service, a photographer, a videographer and the couple. Up to 20 mourners can attend indoor funerals, and outdoor funerals can have up to 30. Religious gatherings and places of worship can also invite up to 10 worshippers inside at a time. Movement is also allowed for the purpose of moving into a new home or inspecting a potential new home, providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person or in an emergency, and undertaking legal obligations, accessing government services, or donating blood. Exemptions also exist for priests or members of religious orders, and where someone is escaping potential injury, illness or harm. People who are learning to drive can continue to learn to drive and get their hours logged. Children who live across two households can continue to switch between houses. Police have been out on the streets enforcing these rules. It has been left to police officers\u2019 discretion who will receive a fine, however all fines are reviewed personally by the police commissioner, Mick Fuller. Victoria Currently, residents can only leave the house for one of five essential reasons. These are: Shopping for food or other essential goods and services Work and education Care and compassionate reasons Exercise Visiting friends and family A full breakdown of these reasons can be found here. Since midnight on Tuesday 12 May, Victorians have been allowed to have up to five guests over to their homes. Up to 10 people can gather outside for recreational purposes and to engage in activities like hiking, jogging and other non-contact sport. Weddings are allowed up to 10 guests. Meanwhile, up to 20 guests are able to attend funerals held indoors, or 30 if held outdoors. Camping is still out of the question, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Monday 10 May that \u201c\u2026Airbnb will not take bookings. There won\u2019t be bookings at hotels\u201d. But there is no limiton how far one can travel throughout the state. Unlike in other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are still unable to seat diners under the current rules. However, Premier Daniel Andrews announced in May that from 1 June, Victorian cafes, restaurants, and the dining areas of pubs and clubs will be allowed to reopen and host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors. Three weeks later, on 22 June, the number of people allowed will increase to 50 patrons, and go up to 100 patrons by mid-July. Premier Andrews said that patrons will still need to abide by physical distancing rules. Police officers are responsible for deciding who will receive penalties. Penalties include on-the-spot fines of up to $1,652 for individuals and $9,913 for businesses. Larger fines and even the possibility of criminal charges are also available. Tasmania From Monday 11 May, the Tasmanian government has eased a number of coronavirus restrictions to allow: 20 people to attend funerals, up from 10 One aged care visit per week, from none National parks to reopen for exercise, but only for people who live within 30km People only allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons and gatherings limited to two people. Exemptions include: Shopping for supplies Undertaking personal exercise Attending medical or healthcare appointments Seeking veterinary services Providing social support or care to another person Attending school or study, if unable to be done at home Attending work or volunteering, if unable to be done at home Performing essential maintenance or security inspections of other premises owned or occupied by the person Attending another location if the person has a reasonable excuse in the opinion of the director of public health An example of a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d given by the premier\u2019s office was clearing out a recently deceased relative\u2019s house. Households are allowed to have two visitors as long as physical distancing requirements can be met, except where \u201csocial support\u201d is being provided. Tasmania has a broad definition of \u201csocial support. As such, families and couples who live apart can visit one another\u2019s homes. However, in public, the two-person gathering limit is strictly applied. From 18 May, Tasmania will move to stage one, which will mean indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, up to five visitors to a home, and up to 10 people inside restaurants, cafe and other venues. The premier confirmed that the state\u2019s strict border controls will remain in place. From 25 May, primary school students will return to school, as well as year 11 an 12 students. From 9 June, high school students from year 7 to 10 will also return to school. And from From 15 June, the state will move to stage 2, subject to health advice. Stage two will kick off on 15 June. Gatherings will increase to 20 people at a time, both indoor at outdoor. This means that up to 20 people will be able to attend religious gatherings and weddings, and up to 50 people will be allowed to attend a funeral. Under stage two, people will be able to move around the state, go camping, and stay in overnight boats and holiday shacks. Gyms and bootcamps will open to 20 people, while beauty services including tattoo parlours would also be allowed. Australian defence force members, the Tasmanian state emergency service and fire service volunteers have been enlisted to help carry out spot checks. Fines could be as much as $16,800 or six months in jail. Tasmania also requires that all non-essential travellers entering the state quarantine for a period of 14 days. Western Australia Western Australian has already seen perhaps the most significant easing of lockdown laws. As of Monday 18 May, up to 20 people are allowed to gather publicly and privately. Residents are allowed to leave their homes for recreational activities including picnics, fishing, boating or camping. Cafes and restaurants \u2013 including dine-in services at pubs, clubs and casinos - are allowed to seat 20 diners, as long as they follow the four sq metres per person rule. Non-contact sport, outdoor and indoor fitness classes, and public swimming pools have been allowed to reopen to up to 20 participants at a time. The number of attendees at weddings and funerals has increased to 20 if held indoors, or 30 if outdoors. Places of worship and community facilities, like libraries, are also allowed up to 20 people inside. Open houses and display villages are allowed to operate, however public playgrounds, skateparks and outdoor gym equipment are closed. Travel to most nearby regions is now allowed. But travel is still restricted to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley. It doesn\u2019t look as though WA will be opening its borders to interstate travellers any time soon, though. As of midnight on 6 April only \u201cexempt travellers\u201d have been allowed in. This includes WA residents. A list of \u201cexempt travellers\u201d can be found here, and includes senior government officials, military personal and a range of essential workers. McGowan said that hard borders \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus\u201d and \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d. Officers can issue on-the-spot fines of $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for businesses who disobey the rules. Australian Capital Territory As of 8 May, gatherings of up to 10 people indoors and outdoors are allowed in the ACT. That includes boot camps, picnics, house inspections and auctions. Indoor funerals will are allowed to have up to 20 attendees, while those taking place outside can have up to 30 attendees. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has advised Canberrans to avoid large crowds, keep 1.5m apart from others, continue to practice good hand hygiene and to \u201cstay home\u201d from work or school of they are sick. He previously urged residents to stay at home, except for certain essential reasons. These are: Shopping for what you need \u2013 food and necessary supplies Medical or healthcare needs, including compassionate requirements Exercise in compliance with the public gathering requirements Work and study if you can\u2019t work or learn remotely ACT police officers would be issuing a warning in the first instance. Guardian Australia understands that police have focused on enforcing the two-person gathering limits, not why people have left their homes. Northern Territory The Northern Territory already commenced its three-stage plan to ease restrictions in the state in early May. The NT currently has a 10-person gathering limit indoors and outdoors. From Friday 8 May these were lifted for outdoor weddings and funerals. An unlimited number of people may attend as long as physical distancing can still be observed. Since 1 May, Territorians have been allowed to use public swimming pools, go fishing with friends and play non-contact sports like golf or tennis and visit waterparks, as long as safe physical distancing can be observed. National parks are also open for camping, swimming and hiking. Since 15 May additional indoor activities have been permitted, as long as they take less than two hours. These include going to the gym, eating at a cafe or restaurant, visiting a museum or undergoing non-facial cosmetic procedures like manicures or tanning. Bars can reopen but alcohol can only be served with a meal. Indoor weddings, funerals and religious activities will also be allowed. From 5 June all businesses will be allowed to reopen as long as they have a Covid-19 plan. The two-hour limit will be lifted allowing night clubs, cinemas, tattoo parlours casinos and pokies to reopen. However physical distancing must still be observed. All sporting activities will be allowed to restart from 5 June and spectators will be allowed to attend. Currently, remote Indigenous communities have protections in place to stop non-essential visitors from entering, and quarantine periods for residents returning from community hubs. The protections will be assessed and potentially lifted on 18 June. Gunner said that opening the NT border would be \u201cdead last\u201d. The Northern Territory currently requires any non-essential travellers to self-quarantine in a hotel for a period of 14 days. As of 3 April, the traveller must pay for the expenses associated with this quarantine period. South Australia South Australia has not formally lifted any physical distancing laws, but the state never imposed the strict lockdowns seen in Victoria, NSW or WA. South Australia opted not to enforce new two-person-gathering laws, but premier Steven Marshall had still urged people to follow these rules. Since Monday 11 May, outdoor dining at restaurants and cafes has recommenced for groups of up to 10 people. From 22 May, restaurants and cafes will be able to serve 10 patrons indoors and 10 outdoors simultaneously. Alcohol will be able to be served to diners. Pubs will be able to serve seated patrons food and alcohol from 5 June, when the state moves to stage two. Cinemas and theatres will also be allowed to reopen under stage two. In addition to those officiating, funerals are now able to have 20 people attend indoor ceremonies, and 30 outdoors. Non-contact sport, house auctions and open inspections have also resumed. The state is also reopening university and Tafe tutorials, public libraries, pools, churches and community halls. The SA government has also already also welcomed students back into classrooms for term two. On-the-spot fines of $1,000 still will only be applied to those who are gathering in groups larger than 10. Marshall has also announced stage two of the state\u2019s plan to ease coronavirus restrictions. From 8 June, South Australia will see the reopening of cinemas and theatres, seated dining, gyms and indoor fitness, galleries and museums, and beauty services. Sporting competition will also start back up, without spectators. Future steps for consideration also include larger gatherings, reopening of nightclubs, pubs and bars, and easing state border restrictions and travel into protected communities. No date was given for when these steps could be implemented, though. Social distancing rules must still be followed, and gatherings must abide by the one person per four square meters rules. All people entering South Australia are required to undertake a 14-day quarantine.

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had said last week that it would be \u201crolling out in mid May\u201d across England. NHS insiders said the deployment of the app being trialled on the Isle of Wight would not take place until next month as developers iron out problems. Hancock said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England. But people recruited to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 have told the Guardian they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/no-one-had-any-idea-contact-tracers-lack-knowledge-about-covid-19-job\">spent days just trying to log into the online training system</a>.</p> \n<p>The capacity of parks and outdoor facilities to accommodate socially distanced sunbathers might be tested today, which is predicted to bring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/20/fears-over-capacity-for-social-distancing-as-england-faces-29c-weather\">hottest weather of the year so far</a> including a possible high of 29C in south-east England. People are allowed to meet up with one person from another household outdoors, as long as two metres\u2019 distance is maintained. Councils have urged the public to remember that many facilities like outdoor pools and public toilets remain closed. Many tourist hotspots have asked people to stay away and said that attractions will remain closed. The majority of beaches are not currently lifeguarded although activities are allowed.

Plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty with a mobile app not expected to be ready until June. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had said last week that it would be \u201crolling out in mid May\u201d across England. NHS insiders said the deployment of the app being trialled on the Isle of Wight would not take place until next month as developers iron out problems. Hancock said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England. But people recruited to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 have told the Guardian they spent days just trying to log into the online training system. The capacity of parks and outdoor facilities to accommodate socially distanced sunbathers might be tested today, which is predicted to bring the hottest weather of the year so far including a possible high of 29C in south-east England. People are allowed to meet up with one person from another household outdoors, as long as two metres\u2019 distance is maintained. Councils have urged the public to remember that many facilities like outdoor pools and public toilets remain closed. Many tourist hotspots have asked people to stay away and said that attractions will remain closed. The majority of beaches are not currently lifeguarded although activities are allowed. Thunderstorms are predicted for Thursday. Brazil has seen its most deadly day since the coronavirus outbreak began, prompting Donald Trump to consider a ban on travel to the US from Brazil, even as he called the large number of US cases a \u201cbadge of honour \u2026 It\u2019s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.\u201d The US has the highest number of cases in the world, at more than 1.5 million with nearly 92,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the US. It has reported a total of 271,628 cases and 17,971 deaths. Keep an eye on our global live blog for updates and here are some of the key developments overnight. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * \u2018Absolved as of today\u2019 \u2013 The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared an end to security cooperation with Israel and the US, citing the threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank. Abbas said the PLO and the state of Palestine \u201cwere absolved, as of today\u201d of all their agreements with the American and Israelis. It was unclear what this would mean in practice \u2013 Palestinian officials have to coordinate with Israeli officers just to move around in the West Bank. The new Israeli government is officially considering the annexations, apparently with Donald Trump\u2019s support. The Israeli ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, is reported to have said in confidential briefings in Washington that \u201cthere is a window of opportunity now, so it must be done now \u2026 we don\u2019t know what will happen in the US presidential elections. Biden could win.\u201d * * * Lifetime surveillance on terror suspects \u2013 Terrorism suspects not convicted of any offence could face expanded and permanent measures to control their lives under counter-terrorism laws proposed by the UK government. Ministers want to weaken the burden of proof for measures known as Tpims to be imposed on people suspected of terrorist activity and remove a two-year limit. The new counter-terrorism bill builds on the response to terrorist attacks in the last 12 months \u2013 at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall in the City of London and Streatham High Road in the city\u2019s south-west \u2013 which led to scrapping of automatic release of terrorist offenders halfway through their sentences. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Super Cyclone Amphan is bearing down on millions of people in eastern India and Bangladesh with forecasts of a potentially devastating and deadly storm surge. Mass evacuation efforts have been hampered by the need to follow Covid-19 precautions. &gt; Norma McCorvey, aka the plaintiff Jane Roe in the 1973 US abortion court case Roe v Wade, left a video before her 2017 death saying she was paid to switch sides and back the anti-abortion movement, it has been revealed. &gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson is to stop selling its talcum-based baby powder in the US and Canada but not elsewhere in the world. Tens of thousands of lawsuits have alleged its talc caused cancer. &gt; BBC Three could return as a broadcast TV channel after a run of hits \u2013 from Fleabag to Normal People \u2013 that have rated with youth audiences. The channel was taken online-only four years ago. * * * Astronaut launch overshadowed \u2013 With Nasa seven days away from the first US launch of American astronauts since the space shuttle, its head of human spaceflight has resigned over an apparent breach of procurement rules. Doug Loverro is being replaced by a deputy who will now overseee the launch, due on Wednesday next week, of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that will carry human beings for the first time. It is due to dock with the international space station. Loverro has said that he resigned because he took a misjudged \u201crisk\u201d related to Nasa\u2019s Artemis programme to return humans to the moon. Coronavirus Extra Thousands of people with cancer could die early because so many hospitals have suspended surgery for the disease during the pandemic, the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) has warned. Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to deny and delay refunds for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to Which?. In our science podcast Nicola Davis asks mathematician Kit Yates how useful global comparisons are when it comes to the coronavirus outbreak, given the huge differences in demographics and public health responses. Today in Focus podcast: Science races to understand Covid-19 In the five months since the world learned about Covid-19 it has killed hundreds of thousands of people. In that time, what have scientists found out \u2013 and what do they still not know? Lunchtime read: Social Distance \u2013 a graphic short story In this touching story for the Guardian, Mark Haddon depicts a solitary man finding isolation no different from normal life \u2013 until he has an unexpected encounter at the Co-op. Sport The Premier League has been buoyed in its attempts to complete the season, after only six of 748 players and staff, including Burnley assistant manager Ian Woan, tested positive for Covid-19. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin has told the Guardian he is suffering from sleepless nights from the coronavirus crisis but is confident \u201cgood old football\u201d will return to normal. Plans to reopen gyms and leisure centres in July across the UK are being discussed in government circles as part of wider proposals to further open up grassroots sport, the Guardian understands. Johanna Konta has cautiously offered her support to the idea of the ATP and the WTA tours merging. The Warrington Wolves chief executive, Karl Fitzpatrick, has insisted the signing of the Australian great Greg Inglis does not fly in the face of rugby league\u2019s economic struggles.

The fate of this year\u2019s British Grand Prix, and the calendar for Formula One\u2019s return to racing in general, is likely to be decided by the end of this week. And Horace Grant, who won three titles alongside Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls, has given a withering assessment of the documentary, The Last Dance, saying \u201cabout 90% of it [was] BS\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Australia has vowed to stand up to China over trade threats amid reports Beijing is planning to widen the trade dispute by targeting other lucrative exports, including wine and dairy. Chinese officials have compiled a detailed list of goods \u2013 also including seafood, oatmeal and fruit \u2013 that could be subjected to stricter quality control checks, increased tariffs, customs delays, or the subject of state media-encouraged consumer boycotts, according to a Bloomberg News report. Separately, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, called on Australia to \u201cchange its course, completely give up its political manoeuvre and return to the broad consensus of the international community\u201d after the World Health Assembly backed calls for a future review of the lessons learned from the health response to Covid-19. The Global Times, a Chinese state media outlet, accused Australia of following in the footsteps of American hawks by pushing for a coronavirus origins inquiry. On Tuesday it quoted an unnamed Weibo user as likening Australia to a \u201cgiant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US\u201d. The tensions come as Australia draws up plans to take China to the global trade umpire aiming to cancel steep new tariffs on barley imports \u2013 although Canberra will first try to seek a diplomatic resolution. Prof James Laurenceson, the director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney, said if Beijing actually pressed ahead with further trade actions it would undermine its claims that it was not deploying economic coercion. \u201cOther countries would be re-evaluating their trading relationships,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe damage to China\u2019s reputation would be immense, far outweighing any gains it might expect from holding up milk powder, or wine imports.\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, responded to the reports of wider actions by saying she \u201cwould be disappointed if there was any process of conflating these issues\u201d. \u201cAustralia will always stand firm in protecting our national interests,\u201d she told ABC\u2019s AM program. Australia-China relations have a number of long-running irritants, but Canberra raised Beijing\u2019s ire by leading international calls for an independent global investigation into the origins and handling of the coronavirus. The souring of ties was laid bare on Tuesday when China\u2019s embassy in Canberra rubbished claims the widespread global support for an independent review at the World Health Assembly this week vindicated Australia\u2019s original calls. An embassy spokesperson said such claims were \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d, prompting the Australian trade minister, Simon Birmingham, to rebuke the diplomatic mission for making \u201ccheap\u201d, \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments. This week, China slapped an 80% tariff on Australian barley imports, alleging Australia was breaching \u201canti-dumping\u201d regulations and subsidising the industry \u2013 claims denied by the Morrison government. Australia\u2019s agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said the government would press Chinese authorities to cancel the tariffs, as the World Trade Organization\u2019s processes required 60 days of bilateral consultations before a dispute was initiated. \u201cIf that fails, then, obviously, we will reserve our right and likely pursue an opportunity to take it to the WTO,\u201d he told Seven\u2019s Sunrise program on Wednesday. China has also barred red-meat imports from four Australian abattoirs on technical regulatory grounds. Beijing will not concede the economic measures are retaliation for Australia\u2019s forthright pursuit of a Covid-19 inquiry but China has a track record of using trade as weapon of diplomatic coercion: South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have all faced such pressure in recent years. China is the leading international destination for both Australian wine and dairy: annual exports grew to $754m and $564m respectively last year. Earlier on Wednesday, the Guardian reported Australian wool producers were \u201cparticularly exposed\u201d by the threat of a further escalation in trade tensions. The Labor opposition stepped up its calls for the Australian government to seek clarity from the United States over the impact of a recent deal between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to increase American agricultural exports to China. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, told the ABC the government needed to \u201cmake sure that Australia, which is a good friend of the United States and a strong ally, is not disadvantaged by that agreement\u201d. Laurenceson, of the Australia-China Relations Institute, said the reports of Beijing assembling a list of Australian goods it could potentially target was one thing, but it was \u201cquite another to actually implement such moves\u201d. \u201cIf China then started to go to wine and to dairy, any credibility China had in suggesting this was not economic coercion would vanish,\u201d Laurenceson said. He said the headline-grabbing diplomatic sparring had become \u201cextraordinarily petty\u201d, but, behind that, there was still a deep and broad trading relationship that benefited both countries. Laurenceson pointed out the value of China\u2019s imports from Australia in the first four months of 2020 was larger than the first four months of 2019, even with the massive economic hibernation enforced to control the Covid-19 pandemic. An independent evaluation of the health response \u2013 to be launched at a later date \u2013 was agreed to without dissent by members of the World Health Assembly. The European Union-drafted motion attracted a wide range of co-sponsors including Australia and ultimately China. Payne said Australia would use its position on the World Health Organization\u2019s executive board to influence the planning. Pressed on her previous claim the WHO could not oversee a review because it was akin to \u201cpoacher and gamekeeper\u201d, she said the body\u2019s independent oversight and advisory committee was \u201can independent organisation drawn from national governments, from NGOs, from the international system with very broad experience in a range of public health areas\u201d. Even before the pandemic, relations between Australia and China were strained by an accumulation of issues. These included the decision of Australia to exclude Huawei from the 5G network rollout; China\u2019s continued incarceration of Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun; a dispute over the South China Sea; concerns over Chinese influence in Australian business, economics and politics resulting in foreign interference laws being passed in 2018; and continuing allegations of espionage.",

Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">men are more likely to die from Covid-19</a>, research by Ipsos Mori and the Fawcett Society found women were disproportionately affected in other ways.</p> <p>Six out of 10 women said they were finding it hard to stay positive day-to-day, compared with just under half of men. Half of women were very concerned about the risk the virus posed to the country, compared with a third of men. Women were also more likely to have their employment impacted, with a third saying their workplaces had been closed, compared with a quarter of men.</p> <p>Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWomen are bearing the brunt of the emotional and financial fallout. Government needs to take a gendered approach as we lift the lockdown and begin to turn our attention to how we emerge from this crisis. One thing is certain, an economy which leaves women and girls behind will fail to recover at all.\u201d</p> <p>Despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 their concerns, the analysis found that women were more likely than men to have helped others during the pandemic. More than four in 10 said they had contacted someone lonely or vulnerable, compared with a third of men. Women were also more likely than men to have checked on friends and family to ensure they were OK and to have delivered supplies to someone self-isolating.</p> <p>They were more likely to be uncomfortable with lifting the lockdown, whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/rushed-and-premature-parents-reveal-fears-over-schools-reopening-amid-covid-19-crisis\">sending children to school</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/train-services-ramped-up-as-coronavirus-travel-restrictions-eased-in-england\">using public transport</a>, shopping or going to large gatherings, and more likely to have adhered to social distancing.

Six out of 10 women said they were finding it hard to stay positive day-to-day, compared with just under half of men. Half of women were very concerned about the risk the virus posed to the country, compared with a third of men. Women were also more likely to have their employment impacted, with a third saying their workplaces had been closed, compared with a quarter of men. Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, said: \u201cWomen are bearing the brunt of the emotional and financial fallout. Government needs to take a gendered approach as we lift the lockdown and begin to turn our attention to how we emerge from this crisis. One thing is certain, an economy which leaves women and girls behind will fail to recover at all.\u201d Despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 their concerns, the analysis found that women were more likely than men to have helped others during the pandemic. More than four in 10 said they had contacted someone lonely or vulnerable, compared with a third of men. Women were also more likely than men to have checked on friends and family to ensure they were OK and to have delivered supplies to someone self-isolating. They were more likely to be uncomfortable with lifting the lockdown, whether sending children to school, using public transport, shopping or going to large gatherings, and more likely to have adhered to social distancing. This was despite three-quarters of women saying that visiting a selection of friends and family would make them feel more optimistic, compared with seven in 10 men. Campaigners say women are more likely to be on the frontline delivering essential services in low-paid and insecure work and caring for children and older relatives, as well as significantly more likely to be put at risk of self-isolating with an abusive partner. In March, more than 50 organisations signed a statement calling on the government to consider the specific challenges faced by women as a result of the crisis. The survey was conducted online among 18- to 75-year-olds between February and May and weighted to reflect the population profile.",

Nine out of 10 diabetics have type 2, and many are obese.</p> <p>Age, however, is the biggest determining risk factor for death among those with either form of diabetes who get Covid-19. Under-40s have a very low risk compared with those over 40, and especially compared with older people, according to new findings collated by NHS England. People with type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood, tend to be younger than those with type 2. </p> <p>Last week, separate findings suggested that a quarter of coronavirus-related deaths were among people with diabetes. The findings have not yet been subjected to peer review but will soon be published in a leading medical journal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/one-in-four-people-who-died-in-uk-hospitals-with-covid-19-had-diabetes\">Quarter of Covid-19 deaths in English hospitals were of diabetics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So far during the pandemic, 7,466 people who died in hospital in England had type 2 diabetes and 365 had type 1. </p> <p>Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for diabetes and obesity and the study\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cThis research shows the extent of the risk of coronavirus for people with diabetes and the different risks for those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, it also shows that higher blood glucose levels and obesity further increase the risk in both types of diabetes.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, said: \u201cBacterial infections are more common and more severe in diabetes.

      "bodyText": "People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to die of Covid-19 than those with type 2, according to NHS research confirming that diabetes significantly increases coronavirus sufferers\u2019 risk of dying. Almost one in three of all deaths from coronavirus among people in hospital in England during the pandemic have been associated with diabetes, according to the study. People with type 1 diabetes \u2013 the autoimmune form of the disease \u2013 are three-and-a-half times more likely to die if they catch Covid-19 than non-diabetics, while type 2 diabetics \u2013 those with the form closely linked to being overweight \u2013 are twice as likely to die as non-diabetics. Nine out of 10 diabetics have type 2, and many are obese. Age, however, is the biggest determining risk factor for death among those with either form of diabetes who get Covid-19. Under-40s have a very low risk compared with those over 40, and especially compared with older people, according to new findings collated by NHS England. People with type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood, tend to be younger than those with type 2. Last week, separate findings suggested that a quarter of coronavirus-related deaths were among people with diabetes. The findings have not yet been subjected to peer review but will soon be published in a leading medical journal. So far during the pandemic, 7,466 people who died in hospital in England had type 2 diabetes and 365 had type 1. Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for diabetes and obesity and the study\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cThis research shows the extent of the risk of coronavirus for people with diabetes and the different risks for those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, it also shows that higher blood glucose levels and obesity further increase the risk in both types of diabetes.\u201d Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, said: \u201cBacterial infections are more common and more severe in diabetes. This has generally not been thought to be such a problem with viral infections such as coronavirus, but any severe infection can cause problems with insulin control so this too will likely contribute to the increased mortality rate in type 1 patients. \u201cSo diabetic patients are probably not at greater risk of catching coronavirus, but do have a greater risk of becoming seriously ill if they do catch it.\u201d The study also found that the overall death rate for people with diabetes doubled in the early stages of the pandemic. Among both type 1 and type 2 patients, men, BAME people and those living in more deprived communities were at higher risk. In both types of sufferer, those with underlying kidney disease or heart failure and/or who previously had a stroke, were also at higher risk. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2020 to amend references to diabetes that did not adhere to house style guidelines.",

In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it\u2019s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are <em>safe enough</em> to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.</p> <p>In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/rushed-and-premature-parents-reveal-fears-over-schools-reopening-amid-covid-19-crisis\">parents</a> alike.

In a <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/05/statement-of-principles-covid-19-contact-tracing/\">statement of principle</a>s on tracing, published on Monday, the ADPH identified 11 key issues including greater responsiveness, local flexibility and effective data-sharing among relevant agencies, expressing \u201cdisappointment at the limited extent that government has involved local government in all aspects of the test, track and trace programme\u201d.</p> <p>De Gruchy is herself director of public health in Tameside, part of the <a href=\"https://www.gmhsc.org.uk/\">Greater Manchester devolution partnership</a>, and she operates de facto across both local government and the NHS. She says this has made it immeasurably easier to organise <a href=\"https://www.tameside.gov.uk/mentalhealthsupport\">integrated responses</a> to the Covid-19 crisis, especially on tracking and tracing, distribution of personal protective equipment, <a href=\"https://public.tameside.gov.uk/pressreleases/f1030pressreleasestory107.asp?story=2138&amp;keyword=\">domestic abuse under lockdown</a> and humanitarian measures. Some of her staff have been seconded to food banks.</p> <p>Elsewhere, however, argument persists over the wisdom of the <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06844\">transfer of public health duties from the NHS in England to local government</a> in 2013. And the crisis has <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">raked over the coals</a>. Would the overall response have been better, some ask, if the function had remained in the health service alongside hospital and community services?</p> <p>De Gruchy insists not. \u201cWe absolutely need to be in local government,\u201d she says. \u201cWe feel strongly that given the range of influences on health and wellbeing \u2013 and remember that healthcare contributes to only<a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-health-care-improvement/the-contribution-of-the-health-and-care-system-to-improving-health\"> 10% to 20% of all our health</a> \u2013 we are in exactly the right place to bring about change.</p> <p>\u201cBut more than that, the NHS is fundamentally just not set up to focus resources on [illness] prevention. Yes it\u2019s one of the best healthcare systems in the world, but its main focus is still on acute hospital care. And that\u2019s where the money goes.\u201d</p> <p>She concedes that the cause of public health in local government in England was not helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/england-public-health-coronavirus-cuts-regional\">cuts totalling \u00a3850m</a> in its earmarked government grant between 2014-15 and 2019-20. Research has suggested that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/05/poorest-hit-hardest-by-cuts-to-public-health-spending-research\">burden of resulting service reductions fell heaviest on deprived inner-city communities</a>. In mid-March this year, just as Covid-19 was taking hold, ministers made an exceptionally late announcement of a real-terms <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/response-to-public-health-grant\">increase of \u00a3145m in grant for 2020-21</a>.</p> <p>While welcoming the boost, De Gruchy reckons the system still needs \u00a3850m to get back to where it was in 2014, after allowing for population change. And she fears the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-crisis-english-councils-funding-shortfall\">impact of the present crisis </a>on local government finances. \u201cThere needs to be proper recognition of the importance of \u2018local\u2019 to really get us out of this crisis \u2013 and if you recognise local, you have to fund local.\u201d</p> <p>Brought up in South Africa, where she qualified as a hospital doctor, De Gruchy moved in the late 1990s to the UK where she found her public health vocation and further trained for the role. She thinks the experience of growing up under apartheid primarily shaped her strong belief in social justice, but she also credits her family background \u2013 she comes, she says, from \u201ca family of theologians\u201d \u2013 and her experience as a gay woman. Covid permitting, she plans to marry her partner next January in a ceremony in South Africa.</p> <p>She thinks the crisis has laid bare the deep inequalities in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s held up a mirror to society,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s people from particular deprived communities who are dying, it\u2019s people from BME communities, it\u2019s older people in care homes which have been calling for improved funding for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to normal after this. There are some things about normal I really liked, like seeing my friends and family, going out for a meal once in a while and, yes, going to the hairdresser. But the normal I don\u2019t want to go back to is hidden inequalities, hidden poverty, hidden discrimination against groups of people. I want us to use this crisis moment to ensure that what comes next is better.\u201d</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age: </strong>55</p> <p><strong>Lives:</strong> Manchester</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Engaged (and hoping wedding goes ahead)</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Westerford high school, Cape Town, South Africa; University of Cape Town (BA English &amp; history, MBChB medicine); Loughborough University (MA sociology &amp; social policy); Nottingham University (MPH public health)</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> 2018-present: director of public health, Tameside council; 2010-18: director of public health, Haringey council/NHS, north London; 2005-10: deputy director of public health, Nottingham NHS; 2000-05: public health training including 12 months at the Department for International Development; 1995-2000: range of clinical roles in UK and South Africa, including co-author of health and human rights study for South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> Swimming, running, cycling, brunch</p>",

      "bodyText": "Inflation in Britain tumbled to 0.8% in April, its lowest level in four years, as the coronavirus lockdown sent petrol prices crashing and cut the cost of items such as clothing and secondhand cars. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said a cap on gas and electricity prices by the UK regulator also depressed average prices, which in March were rising at the annual rate of 1.5%. Brent oil prices fell to a near 21-year low of $16 a barrel on 22 April, pushing down the price of petrol to below \u00a31 a litre in many parts of the country. The ONS said fuel price falls were partially offset by the rising price of recreational goods, such as toys, games and hobbies, and takeaway food, for which there had been high demand during the lockdown. Consumer groups have also reported that the prices of many household goods increased during the lockdown but the ONS said on a month-on-month basis, shop prices stayed level at 0% between March and April. Most stores were closed in April, leaving consumers to purchase the bulk of their non-food items online. Analysts expect prices to fall further over the coming month as shops launch sales to to offload unwanted and old stock as they reopen during the summer. Pressure on the Bank of England to boost the economy and push inflation back to its 2% target is expected to intensify after the price fall. Central bank officials are due to meet next month when City analysts expect them to add at least \u00a3100bn to their stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing, where the bank pumps money into the system by acquiring buys bonds off financial institutions. The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, will also be prompted to write to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to explain why inflation has fallen below the 1% band around the 2% target rate and what the central bank proposes to do about it. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, an economic forecasting group, said the downturn in economic activity after restrictive lockdown measures was exerting downward pressure on prices that would continue for the rest of the summer. He said: \u201cMany people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures, while others may be worried that they may still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends. \u201cAdditionally, many incomes have been negatively affected.

      "bodyText": "Community sport is facing a \u201ccrisis\u201d as Covid-19 restrictions slowly ease, with many clubs facing financial black holes they may not be able to navigate their way out of, according to a sports charity. A nationwide campaign was launched on Wednesday to determine the impact of the shutdown on community sports clubs, amid concern many will be unable to survive the financial hardships brought on by the coronavirus restrictions. The Australian Sports Foundation will attempt to quantify the funding challenges facing community clubs across the country after the outbreak brought sport at all levels to a shuddering halt and caused financial chaos. Where problems are identified, the charity hopes to be able to financially assist clubs to get back on their feet and provide the mental and physical health needs communities rely on in more normal times. An initial pilot survey conducted by the organisation, which says it has distributed hundreds of millions of dollars to thousands of Australian sporting clubs over the past 30 years, revealed major concerns. \u201cThere is a crisis in Australian community sport, which presents a real risk to the physical and mental health of our communities,\u201d said Patrick Walker, chief executive of the foundation. \u201cTo the general public it may seem like the crisis is coming to an end with mooted openings of community sports clubs across Australia, but there are issues ahead that haven\u2019t been addressed yet. \u201cTrying to reopen and get members back onto sports fields is where the crisis for grassroots clubs will really start.\u201d Since the shutdown of sport, clubs have suffered not only from a loss of income from decreasing member subscriptions and local sponsorships, but also from additional costs the virus has thrown up, such as the implementation of new cleaning and sanitisation protocols. With a resumption of winter sport seasons on the table \u2013 should the current trend of decreasing numbers of Covid-19 cases continue \u2013 some clubs may still be unable to reopen their doors given the unsustainability of their post-virus financial models. Once the scale of the problem is identified, the foundation aims to lobby the government and channel philanthropic funding to those clubs in need. \u201cWe will use the information to raise funds and advocate for more support for community clubs,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSport has the power to bring communities together, to break down social barriers and to improve the health and mental wellbeing of everyone. \u201cIt will play a vital role as our communities recover from this crisis, and we want to make sure that our community sports clubs are able to survive and help that process.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With Australia tentatively easing its state lockdowns after flattening the curve, attention has turned to tourism, flights and reopening state borders. While most state premiers seem cautious, the federal tourism minister and airlines are keen to see flights back up and running. But is it safe to fly? What precautions should you take? Is there even anywhere to travel to? Here we try to answer the most pressing questions when it comes to air travel and holidays during the pandemic. These answers are based on comments from politicians, experts and industry stakeholders and should not be treated as medical or legal advice. Where can I fly? As of 20 May, the majority of state and territory border closures are still in place, so interstate holidays are unlikely in the immediate future. Here are the current travel restrictions: New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT \u2013 There have been no border closures in Victoria, NSW or the ACT throughout the entire pandemic. You can fly into them without trouble and legally travel between without having to isolate. But if you are coming from any other state or territory, chances are you will need to quarantine when you arrive back. Queensland \u2013 There is currently a hard border closure in Queensland, meaning unless it\u2019s for essential reasons you are not allowed to enter the state. You can return if you are a Queensland resident, but if you have been to a \u201cCovid-19 hotspot\u201d in the last 14 days you must quarantine for two weeks. These hotspots consist of a considerable number of local government areas in Victoria and NSW. A full list can be found here. Western Australia \u2013 Some of the country\u2019s strictest border closures are in place in WA. You are not permitted to enter the state unless you have been granted a special exemption and, if you are a WA resident, you must apply for an exemption before you leave the state, and must isolate for 14 days when you return. South Australia \u2013 While SA has closed its border, it\u2019s a softer closure than Queensland or WA. You are allowed in but you must self-isolate for 14 days unless you are an essential traveller. Tasmania \u2013 Similar to SA, all non-essential travellers to Tasmania must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, including returning residents. Northern Territory \u2013 All non-essential travellers entering the NT, including returning residents, must undergo 14 days mandatory quarantine and pay a \u2018quarantine fee\u2019 of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families. Which airlines are flying? Currently Qantas, Virgin and Region Express airlines are flying extremely limited domestic schedules. Qantas and its budget arm Jetstar are preparing to ramp up domestic services when border restrictions ease, with the company\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, urging travellers to begin planning their trips. Rex also appears to be preparing for increased regional travel. It\u2019s unclear if and when Virgin will begin regular interstate flights as the company is currently in voluntary administration. This includes the company\u2019s low-cost offshoot TigerAir. Will there be physical distancing on flights? No. The Qantas chief executive has stated the airline will not be observing physical distancing aboard planes, either by spacing out passengers or leaving middle rows free. Joyce said that doing so would drastically inflate ticket prices and, given the seemingly low rates of transmission on aeroplanes, would not be economically justifiable. \u201cThis idea of the middle seat [being left free] isn\u2019t social distancing, it\u2019s a 60cm difference between two people. To get the full [1.5 metres] squared, you will end up with 22 people on an aircraft of 180 seats and the airfares are nine to 10 times as much,\u201d he told ABC radio. Regional Express has said it will try to allocate alternating occupied and unoccupied seats where possible, however, it will still fill planes to capacity if need be. Are planes safe when it comes to Covid-19? There is no simple answer to this. As Joyce and other airline executive are quick to point out, there have been very few known or suspected cases of Covid-19 transmission on aeroplanes. When announcing plans to ramp up domestic flights, the Qantas medical director, Dr Ian Hosegood, said due to the physical arrangement of planes they were safer than other forms of public transit. \u201cThat\u2019s due to a combination of factors, including the cabin air filtration system, the fact people don\u2019t sit face-to-face and the high backs of aircraft seats acting as a physical barrier. As far as the virus goes, an aircraft cabin is a very different environment to other forms of public transport,\u201d he said. \u201cIn-flight transmission\u2019s just not something that we\u2019ve seen, and that was even during the peak of the pandemic. At this point and into the coming weeks the likelihood of anyone travelling domestically with Covid is extremely low, and those other factors mean that the risk is infinitesimal.\u201d But a number of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts do not agree. Prof Raina MacIntyre, a virologist at the University of NSW, told ABC she would not be flying until vaccinated for Covid-19. The infectious disease expert and epidemiology professor Marylouise McLaws told Guardian Australia that, like other densely populated enclosed spaces, planes were likely \u201cbrilliant amplification environments\u201d for the virus. \u201cPerhaps there haven\u2019t been confirmed cases from flights, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be careful, and it could just mean we haven\u2019t identified them as a risk factor yet \u2026 There are still a significant amount of cases that are under investigation,\u201d she said. Many planes have advanced air filtration systems that refresh the air in the cabins every few minutes and remove virus particles, but multiple epidemiologists have said this likely won\u2019t protect you if someone in your immediate area is infectious. Should I wear a mask on a flight? Yes, unless you have a medical reason not to. Regardless of whether an airline mandates wearing a mask, McLaws said it is a vital step in protecting yourself and others on flights. \u201cPreventing Covid-19 is a bundle of many things \u2026 When you can\u2019t have one of those, such as social distancing, you need to protect yourself from inhaling or exhaling the virus with a mask.\u201d Even if you are not directly seated near other people, wearing a mask is still important as people are regularly moving around the cabin, through narrow aisles. It may be difficult for those with respiratory illnesses such as emphysema to wear a mask, but if you are medically able, McLaw highly recommends you do so at all times while flying.

Any refund would be considered on a case by case basis. Is it too soon to be planning an interstate holiday? It depends on who you ask, but currently, no states or territories are actively encouraging travellers to come to visit. The national cabinet guidelines have suggested 10 July as the time to review interstate travel, however, it\u2019s unclear which states are likely to follow this. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has said the state\u2019s borders would be reviewed at the end of each month, with September floated as a \u201crealistic\u201d timeframe by the state\u2019s chief health officer. Previously, the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, said the state border would be lifted \u201cdead last\u201d and Western Australia appears to be on a similar trajectory. On the other hand, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has urged other states to reopen sooner rather than later, and holiday travel inside the state will be allowed from 1 June. The federal tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said he would like to see restriction relaxed in time for the winter tourism boom. \u201cThose states who\u2019ve got border controls in place, assuming we\u2019ve continued to see very low rates of transmission of Covid-19, ought to be looking at opening up their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need people moving across this country again when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d Unsurprisingly, airlines are also keen to see travel begin again. \u201cWe look forward hopefully to seeing a lot of you on our flights in July for a holiday,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cI encourage you to do your research now and to look at some of the very attractive airfares we\u2019re going to have \u2026 If you need to visit family and friends, now\u2019s the time to start planning.\u201d",

The tracer notifies and interviews each contact, tells them to quarantine for two weeks, and monitors them by text to see if they are showing symptoms.</p> <p>Dr Kelly Henning, who leads Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 public health programme, which is assisting in the hiring process, said the initial interview with the person who has tested positive is key.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise that it won\u2019t be 100% [effective] but the goal is to get as many contacts identified and pulled into the system as quickly as possible to break those chains of transmission.\u201d</p> <p>And if people refuse to cooperate? Henning said with a good rapport, ongoing contact and education, she has found \u201ccompliance is very high\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Sung-il Cho, a professor of epidemiology at Seoul National University, who is on the consultation committees of Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and Seoul city\u2019s coronavirus responses, said: \u201cIn the Korean legal system, the police give great help tracking credit card usage, transportation paths, mobile communication signals and CCTV analysis, just as any criminal investigation.\u201d</p> <p>But in the US, digital tracing technology such as the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-google-start-to-win-over-europe-to-their-virus-tracking-technology-11589716800\">initiative by Apple and Google</a> has prompted data privacy fears. On Thursday, five Democrats introduced a bill to protect the health data of consumers using contact tracing technology.</p> <p>Katharina Kopp, deputy director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said: \u201cHistory has taught us that the deployment of technologies is often driven by forces that tend to risk privacy, undermine fairness and equity, and place our civil rights at risk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a65b999dfec1f6a186e5acb18614b95dbd81c345\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a65b999dfec1f6a186e5acb18614b95dbd81c345/0_89_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman displays her phone to doorman, to conform using a mobile application to help contact-tracing at the entrance to the upmarket shopping mall Siam Paragon in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman displays her phone to doorman, to confirm using a mobile application to help contact-tracing at the entrance to the upmarket shopping mall Siam Paragon in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Friday\u2019s hearing, Dr Mitch Katz, president and chief executive officer of Health and Hospitals, said they are working on an app, but that \u201cwe are absolutely committed that none of the data that is collected will be shared.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about quarantine enforcement, he said: \u201cWe believe that carrots are much better than sticks.\u201d</p> <p>Bloomberg has said the public health non-profit Vital Strategies, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, is developing three smartphone apps for New York state. But Henning said initially the focus would be on using human contact tracers and that all information would be kept \u201cfully private\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe idea of using humans is the tried and true public health strategy so we have confidence that that will be a successful model \u2013 assuming we have the right number of contact tracers and they\u2019re well-trained and well-supervised.\u201d</p> <p>Amid record unemployment, there has been no shortage of applications. New York City said it had had more than 10,000 people apply and the state has had over 30,000.</p> <p>The online course, which takes five hours to complete and is open to anyone, had 150,000 enrolments in its first week.</p> <p>Student Shernidane Romelus applied to both the state and city to be a contact tracer.

Adding: \u201cMoving it to an agency that has no experience with it, no legal mandate to do it, no institutional memory of how to do it, will make something that\u2019s very difficult even harder.\u201d Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said it was done to \u201cprioritise continuity, speed and the ability to break down bureaucratic barriers\u201d by \u201chousing testing, tracing and isolation under a single, streamlined entity\u201d. New York state, which is working with the former New York mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has specified that every region must have at least 30 tracers for every 100,000 residents in order to reopen. It said all tracer applicants will take an online introductory Covid-19 contact tracing course, devised by Johns Hopkins University and available free on Coursera, for which they will have to score at least 85. The contact tracing process will begin in labs, which will report Covid-19 cases to contact tracers, who will then interview the positive patient to identify everyone they may have had contact with over the past two weeks. The tracer notifies and interviews each contact, tells them to quarantine for two weeks, and monitors them by text to see if they are showing symptoms. Dr Kelly Henning, who leads Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 public health programme, which is assisting in the hiring process, said the initial interview with the person who has tested positive is key. \u201cWe recognise that it won\u2019t be 100% [effective] but the goal is to get as many contacts identified and pulled into the system as quickly as possible to break those chains of transmission.\u201d And if people refuse to cooperate? Henning said with a good rapport, ongoing contact and education, she has found \u201ccompliance is very high\u201d. Dr Sung-il Cho, a professor of epidemiology at Seoul National University, who is on the consultation committees of Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and Seoul city\u2019s coronavirus responses, said: \u201cIn the Korean legal system, the police give great help tracking credit card usage, transportation paths, mobile communication signals and CCTV analysis, just as any criminal investigation.\u201d But in the US, digital tracing technology such as the initiative by Apple and Google has prompted data privacy fears. On Thursday, five Democrats introduced a bill to protect the health data of consumers using contact tracing technology. Katharina Kopp, deputy director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said: \u201cHistory has taught us that the deployment of technologies is often driven by forces that tend to risk privacy, undermine fairness and equity, and place our civil rights at risk.\u201d At Friday\u2019s hearing, Dr Mitch Katz, president and chief executive officer of Health and Hospitals, said they are working on an app, but that \u201cwe are absolutely committed that none of the data that is collected will be shared.\u201d When asked about quarantine enforcement, he said: \u201cWe believe that carrots are much better than sticks.\u201d Bloomberg has said the public health non-profit Vital Strategies, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, is developing three smartphone apps for New York state. But Henning said initially the focus would be on using human contact tracers and that all information would be kept \u201cfully private\u201d. She said: \u201cThe idea of using humans is the tried and true public health strategy so we have confidence that that will be a successful model \u2013 assuming we have the right number of contact tracers and they\u2019re well-trained and well-supervised.\u201d Amid record unemployment, there has been no shortage of applications. New York City said it had had more than 10,000 people apply and the state has had over 30,000. The online course, which takes five hours to complete and is open to anyone, had 150,000 enrolments in its first week. Student Shernidane Romelus applied to both the state and city to be a contact tracer. The 24-year-old is now waiting to hear back. \u201cIt\u2019s safe. It\u2019s also a way to help, so I feel like it\u2019s a good job for people to do at home and then still earning some money,\u201d she said.",

In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany.

About \u00a3213m of that figure was the stock writedown and other costs related to the pandemic. The company has scrapped its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/marks-and-spencer-considers-temporary-store-closures-wetherspoons-coronavirus\">final dividend</a> and told shareholders not to expect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/marks-spencer-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic\">payouts in 2021 either</a>.</p> \n<p>The turmoil created by the coronavirus has added to the upheaval at the 136-year-old retailer, which Rowe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/m-and-s-archie-norman-chairman-marks-spencer\" title=\"\">Archie Norman</a>, its chairman of three years, are restructuring after a long sequence of falling sales and profits. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s been a lost year financially, it\u2019s not going to be lost year for the business,\u201d said Norman, who claimed the crisis management of the last two months had forced the business to change more rapidly than it would otherwise have done.</p> \n<p>In the six weeks to 9 May, clothing and home sales dropped 75%, while sales in its food halls, excluding its restaurants, fell 4.6%. The company said even though its website had continued to operate, demand for clothing in the initial weeks was low, although it had begun to improve, with sales up 20% in the last three weeks. Plans to close up to 120 stores remain unchanged, it said, adding that it was also trying to negotiate rent reductions with landlords given the scale of the downturn.</p> \n<p>M&amp;S\u2019s food business has not seen the same pickup as the major supermarket chains, because many of the outlets are near office blocks or in transport hubs, which have been deserted during lockdown. However, it is set to benefit from the huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/uk-consumers-big-weekly-shops-lockdown-stores\">shift to online grocery shopping</a> seen in recent weeks when its groceries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/27/marks-and-spencer-agrees-750m-food-delivery-deal-with-ocado\">replace Waitrose</a>\u2019s in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado\">Ocado</a> vans at the end of the summer.</p> \n<p>The retailer said its online food range would be 50% bigger than the Waitrose range, at 6,000 products. Some clothing, including staples such as schoolwear, would also be stocked on the Ocado site. M&amp;S said it was also in talks with other clothing brands that it wanted to sell via its own website as well as in its big stores; however, Rowe said it had no plans to become an online department store similar to rival Next.</p> \n<p>Shares closed up 11% at 95p. Joe Healey, an analyst at the Share Centre, said investors were optimistic about the Ocado partnership: \u201cThe acquisition of 50% of Ocado Retail is a valuable investment in online grocery. We all know, particularly throughout this virus, how critical the shift to online has been for consumers. I think investors will be satisfied with the results today. The business has clearly adapted well to changing market dynamics.\u201d</p>",

M&amp;S had \u00a3500m of clothes and homewares sitting in its stores and warehouses when the lockdown began \u2013 and another \u00a3560m ordered for the autumn/winter season. \u201cAs the lockdown eases, a large proportion of current season stock will remain unsold,\u201d Rowe explained. The UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer was able to cancel \u00a3100m of late-summer stock orders. while about \u00a3400m was year-round clothing basics \u2013 such as T-shirts, leggings and tights \u2013 that it hopes to sell eventually. It is putting \u00a3200m of summer dresses and tops into storage facilities for next spring. However, it still took a one-off charge of \u00a3145m for the handling, clearance, storage and write-off of the \u201cstock bulge\u201d. Publishing its annual results for the year to 31 March, M&amp;S made a pre-tax profit of \u00a367.2m, compared with \u00a384.2m last year, after \u00a3336m in one-off costs. About \u00a3213m of that figure was the stock writedown and other costs related to the pandemic. The company has scrapped its final dividend and told shareholders not to expect payouts in 2021 either. The turmoil created by the coronavirus has added to the upheaval at the 136-year-old retailer, which Rowe and Archie Norman, its chairman of three years, are restructuring after a long sequence of falling sales and profits. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s been a lost year financially, it\u2019s not going to be lost year for the business,\u201d said Norman, who claimed the crisis management of the last two months had forced the business to change more rapidly than it would otherwise have done. In the six weeks to 9 May, clothing and home sales dropped 75%, while sales in its food halls, excluding its restaurants, fell 4.6%. The company said even though its website had continued to operate, demand for clothing in the initial weeks was low, although it had begun to improve, with sales up 20% in the last three weeks. Plans to close up to 120 stores remain unchanged, it said, adding that it was also trying to negotiate rent reductions with landlords given the scale of the downturn. M&amp;S\u2019s food business has not seen the same pickup as the major supermarket chains, because many of the outlets are near office blocks or in transport hubs, which have been deserted during lockdown. However, it is set to benefit from the huge shift to online grocery shopping seen in recent weeks when its groceries replace Waitrose\u2019s in Ocado vans at the end of the summer. The retailer said its online food range would be 50% bigger than the Waitrose range, at 6,000 products. Some clothing, including staples such as schoolwear, would also be stocked on the Ocado site. M&amp;S said it was also in talks with other clothing brands that it wanted to sell via its own website as well as in its big stores; however, Rowe said it had no plans to become an online department store similar to rival Next. Shares closed up 11% at 95p. Joe Healey, an analyst at the Share Centre, said investors were optimistic about the Ocado partnership: \u201cThe acquisition of 50% of Ocado Retail is a valuable investment in online grocery. We all know, particularly throughout this virus, how critical the shift to online has been for consumers. I think investors will be satisfied with the results today. The business has clearly adapted well to changing market dynamics.\u201d",

in several jurisdictions, including 24 cases in the last 3 days across 2 jurisdictions, the risk of introduction across an interstate border remains. The current quarantine restrictions ensure that such cases are isolated and unable to spread the disease further within the community. </p> \n   <p>While AHPPC provided no specific advice on interstate borders, closure has been an effective mechanism in reducing the introduction of disease in several jurisdictions, including South Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. </p> \n   <p>As Western Australia increases the size of mass gatherings in the hospitality, community and sports sectors in Phases 2 and 3, the re-introduction of Covid-19 back into the community from travellers could lead to substantial outbreaks that may require either delay in easing of further restrictions or re-introduction of social distancing and mass gathering measures.</p> \n   <p>Until community spread is eliminated in the affected jurisdictions, which will require at least a month to confirm (two 14-day incubation periods), opening of the interstate borders is not recommended. If the community spread is controlled, relaxation of the interstate borders could be considered after the introduction and assessment of the impact of Phase 4.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:58:57.360Z\">at 8.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec4d32f8f08a1782fa7df97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:25:12.923Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Anaesthetists will have access to telehealth to do pre-operative consultations, the Australian Society of Anaesthetists said. </p> \n  <p>The expansion is a \u201cmajor win,\u201d ASA president <strong>Dr Suzi Nou</strong> said, and will \u201censure anaesthetists can identify patient factors that could significantly increase the risk for complications\u201d.

Some Australian politicians, including Australia\u2019s foreign minister <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and Minister for Home Affairs <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, have been in a bullish mood, as some media reports said, in criticizing China for its lack of transparency, and vowed to stand up for their values. <br><br>Some Australian media outlets see this as a move aimed at further pressuring China and seeking to hold Beijing accountable for the outbreak, calling on Beijing to face overwhelming global pressure at the WHA meeting. <br><br>\u201cThis is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,\u201d <strong>Zhao Lijian</strong>, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community.

It\u2019s a win for the international community, and Australia, as a strong and active part of that international community, would certainly see it that way. Do you have any comment?</p> \n  <p><strong>Zhao Lijian:</strong> First and foremost, China supports a comprehensive evaluation of global Covid-19 response to ensure experience gained and lessons learnt after the pandemic is brought under control, which should be led by WHO and conducted in a science-based, professional, objective and impartial manner. China has been consistent and clear about this all along. The draft resolution on Covid-19 being discussed at this year\u2019s WHA is consistent with China\u2019s position and reflects the widespread consensus of other countries. China, along with other parties, has actively participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and the co-sponsoring of the draft resolution.</p> \n  <p>Second, the above-mentioned draft resolution is entirely different from what the Australia called \u201cindependent international review\u201d. For example, the draft resolution proposes to initiate at the appropriate moment an evaluation rather than to launch an \u201cindependent international review\u201d instantly, which confirms WHO\u2019s leading role instead of adopting another mechanism. The draft resolution calls for an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting certain country. We hope Australia will read the text carefully instead of making conclusions based on assumptions.</p> \n  <p>Lastly, I want to stress that we welcome it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvere and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:44:10.234Z\">at 3.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494eb8f08a1782fa7de65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:28:04.951Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Beijing calls on Australia to 'completely give up its political manoeuvre'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to theWorld Health Assembly motion (which was led by the EU) and recommended Australia \u2018changes its course\u2019.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The spokesperson highlighted the differences between the WHA resolution and Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review <strong>and stressed that China welcomes it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political </strong><strong>manoeuvre</strong><strong> and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:39:46.283Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494a38f0864e579f141fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:54.889Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Covid crisis, and the trade situation, has resulted in this announcement from the government:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following broad industry consultation and further consideration of the impacts on industry, the Australian government has made the decision not to proceed with the Onshore Biosecurity Levy. </p> \n   <p>The department undertook a co-design process with industry to develop a levy model that was practical for industry and the government. </p> \n   <p>This process highlighted that a levy could not be implemented without significant regulatory impacts on industry and proposed levy payers. </p> \n   <p>This decision has also been made in consideration of the ongoing impacts of drought, bushfires and Covid-19 on the Australian economy and the rapidly changing global trade environment. </p> \n   <p>The department would like to thank the Industry Working Group and other stakeholders who provided valuable input and feedback on the proposed levy design. </p> \n   <p>A levy will not be progressed and this decision will not impact on the overall biosecurity budget. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s biosecurity system will continue to be funded through existing arrangements. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:26:16.972Z\">at 3.26am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494418f0886ce4f5d6bff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:06.199Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Penny Wong </strong>also spoke to the ABC radio this morning (in Adelaide) where she repeated Labor\u2019s stance on the government\u2019s relationship with China:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think on the inquiry, if that\u2019s the question, this is the inquiry into the pandemic, I\u2019ve made very clear from the start we supported it.<br></p> \n   <p>And we welcome the resolution at the World Health Assembly to have an inquiry, a European Union-led resolution that has many countries signed up to it, including Australia.<br></p> \n   <p>It does differ from what <strong>Marise Payne</strong> announced on Insiders, in that the World Health Organisation is doing the inquiry.

They serve in their personal capacity, they are not, if you like, part of the WHO structure.

Here\u2019s what you may have missed today: New South Wales will allow residents to holiday across the state from 1 June. Victoria is the first state to reveal it has used the Covidsafe app data for contact tracing. China has called for Australia to back down on its political manoeuvring over the investigation into Covid-19. Western Australia\u2019s chief health officer has defended its hard border while federal medical officers dispute the need for state border closures. Retail spending fell 17.9% in April. South Australia will move to stage 2 restrictions from Friday. A woman tested positive for Covid-19 two months after returning from overseas. If you want to follow the latest developments, please check out our international live blog. Until tomorrow, stay safe. South Australia police report more than a dozen people have been fined $1,000 each for breaching gathering restrictions. There was a large fight in Whyalla Norrie on Saturday night, and police found between 30 and 40 people there. They weren\u2019t fined, but later at the same location police found a large group of people celebrating a birthday. Thirteen people, including seven women and six men aged between 20 and 67, were fined. Gatherings of more than 10 people are currently prohibited in South Australia and the total number of people present in a gathering must not exceed one person per four square metres. My colleague Elias Visontay has this story on why the pandemic call was delayed. Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales who also sits on the WHO\u2019s health emergencies program experts advisory panel for Covid-19, said it was a disagreement between WHO member nations, and not the response of the WHO\u2019s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that ultimately slowed down the international escalation of the response to the virus. There has been much criticism levelled at the WHO for failing to declare a pandemic earlier. She said that when the committee met on 22 January, members did not all agree to declare a public health emergency of international concern \u2013 a move that requires all 194 WHO member nations to begin preparations and initiate a response to the emergency. My colleague Mike Hytner has this report on the problems facing community sport once they\u2019re allowed to return from lockdown. The NSW district court will allow for the resumption of some in-person court appearances. In the criminal jurisdictions, other than jury trials which remain off the table, in person appearances will be allowed for: Appeals from the Local Court. Matters for sentence. Judge-alone trials. Pre-trial argument. Contested applications for bail or contested changes in bail conditions. In the civil jurisdiction, it will no longer be the court\u2019s policy that parties and witnesses in contested hearings have to give evidence over videolink. The Western Australian chief health officer, Dr Andrew Robertson, has just put out this statement on WA\u2019s hard closed border. He says no change until other states get their numbers down: With continued Covid-19 outbreaks in several jurisdictions, including 24 cases in the last 3 days across 2 jurisdictions, the risk of introduction across an interstate border remains. The current quarantine restrictions ensure that such cases are isolated and unable to spread the disease further within the community. While AHPPC provided no specific advice on interstate borders, closure has been an effective mechanism in reducing the introduction of disease in several jurisdictions, including South Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. As Western Australia increases the size of mass gatherings in the hospitality, community and sports sectors in Phases 2 and 3, the re-introduction of Covid-19 back into the community from travellers could lead to substantial outbreaks that may require either delay in easing of further restrictions or re-introduction of social distancing and mass gathering measures. Until community spread is eliminated in the affected jurisdictions, which will require at least a month to confirm (two 14-day incubation periods), opening of the interstate borders is not recommended. If the community spread is controlled, relaxation of the interstate borders could be considered after the introduction and assessment of the impact of Phase 4. Anaesthetists will have access to telehealth to do pre-operative consultations, the Australian Society of Anaesthetists said. The expansion is a \u201cmajor win,\u201d ASA president Dr Suzi Nou said, and will \u201censure anaesthetists can identify patient factors that could significantly increase the risk for complications\u201d. The organisation has been advocating for their inclusion in telehealth since March. During the Covid-19 crisis, telehealth consultations in anaesthesia will allow patients with major medical problems or those undergoing major surgical procedures to be anaesthetised safely, and they will also help in the conservation of our personal protective equipment. Many of our patients are already anxious about coming to hospital for surgery and this will allow them to avoid coming in for a consultation that can instead be done in the safety of their homes. I will hand over to m\u2019colleague Josh Taylor, who will take you through the evening. Stay well, and listen to scientists. The chair of the disability royal commission, Ronald Sackville, has released a statement on the death of an Adelaide woman, Ann Marie Smith, who died in April from a serious illness that developed while she was under full-time care. Sackville said commissioners were appalled and \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d by the circumstances surrounding her death: The circumstances of Ms Smith\u2019s death are the subject of multiple investigations, including a major crime investigation by the South Australian Police. It is inappropriate for the Royal Commission to initiate an immediate inquiry into events where that might prejudice an ongoing criminal investigation or a possible future prosecution. For that reason, the Royal Commission will not at this time commence an inquiry into the specific circumstances surrounding Ms Smith\u2019s death. It is, however, open to the Royal Commission to undertake such an inquiry at a later stage and it will follow the progress of the other investigations. Sackville said many of the issues surrounding the treatment and death of Smith would be considered by the royal commission as part of its broader inquiry, including ways to improve accountability through stronger safeguards and monitoring provisions. These investigations will expose many of the underlying issues that are pertinent to the circumstances of Ms Smith\u2019s death. Many farmers are worried about the consequences of Australia\u2019s deteriorating relationship with China, according to Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon. The comments come amid reports Beijing may be planning to widen the trade dispute by targeting other lucrative exports, including wine and dairy. Chinese officials have compiled a detailed list of goods \u2013 also including seafood, oatmeal and fruit \u2013 that could be subjected to stricter quality control checks, increased tariffs, customs delays, or the subject of state media-encouraged consumer boycotts, according to a Bloomberg News report. Fitzgibbon told Guardian Australia it was in both countries interests to have a productive trading relationship. He said the government needed to show leadership \u201cnot only for our barley and beef exporters but for other agricultural commodities that might be affected\u201d by the dispute. He said it was concerning that the relationship was now so bad that the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, had been unable to speak with the Chinese counterpart: Our trading interests are our national interest. We can chew gum and walk at the same time. For decades, as China has emerged, governments have been able to balance the interests and maintain a good relationship with China while robustly defending our national interest. This government hasn\u2019t been able to do that over the course of the last three years, and many of our farmers are very concerned about what may be the consequences. You can read more on the fallout from the trade tensions here: The National Tertiary Education Union has endorsed a deal to save academic jobs in exchange for pay cuts of up to 15%. In a statement this afternoon, the NTEU says the national jobs protection framework was put to a vote before 107 national councillors and 80% voted in support. Its national president, Dr Alison Barnes, said it had been a \u201cdifficult but necessary decision\u201d: We have been guided by the urgent need to save as many careers and livelihoods as we possibly can. Now is the time for union members to unite to pressure the Federal Government and universities to support the framework. The University of Melbourne this week said it would opt out of the deal, and it\u2019s believed other group of eight universities will follow suit, Anne Davies reported: It is unclear whether Melbourne University believes it will not need to cut staff, or whether it wants freedom to respond to the financial crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic to restructure their staff and shed casuals. Why is Australia committed to listening to the experts and being guided by the science in its response to Covid-19 but not in its response to the climate emergency? Taylor says Australia does take an \u201cenormous amount of advice from scientists\u201d. He says he listens to the chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, and then sites his development of the national hydrogen strategy and \u201ctechnology roadmap\u201d. Karvelas says if Taylor was listening to the scientists on global heating he would commit to Australia reaching net zero emissions by 2050, instead of reiterating this week that it is not the Australian government\u2019s policy to meet that target. The difference between the climate emergency and the pandemic, Taylor says, is that the response to the climate emergency needs to be a \u201cglobal effort\u201d. Karvelas points out that the pandemic is also global. And in that case, Australia led rather than waiting for its trading partners to move first. Taylor: The nature of the problem is different. Because the problem you\u2019ve got to solve with climate change is how you coordinate across the whole globe. Everybody to reduce emissions. Because there\u2019s \u2013 CO2 knows no boundaries. Emissions know no boundaries. Karvelas: Neither does Covid-19, it seems. Taylor: Well, except that the \u2013 the contagion happens at a local level, of course. So that is a difference. But the important point here is this must be a global effort. And that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking. It\u2019s why technology is the way through it. See? One is a global problem that knows no boundaries and the other is too. Completely different. Karvelas says that regardless of the moral rightness of the fall in emissions, Australia will count it towards its 2020 targets. Taylor says Australia was already, in December, on track to meet its 2020 emissions reductions targets. As we have extensively reported, Australia\u2019s emissions reductions targets are both pretty low and helped along by carryover credits, which Australia refuses to drop despite being accused of cheating on the international stage. Also, between December and February a significant part of the country went up in smoke. The energy and emissions reductions minister, Angus Taylor, is on the ABC talking to Patricia Karvelas about global CO2 emissions being down 17% since the start of the coronavirus crisis, with Australia\u2019s emissions down 28% at the peak of the shutdown in April. This is not good news, Taylor says, because it occurred because of a global shutdown of the economy: Look, this is not the way we want to reduce emissions, Patricia. The way we want to reduce emissions is by deploying technologies that drive structural reductions in emissions across critical sectors ... that\u2019s the way to do it, and that\u2019s the government policy. I mean, we are seeing that, if you slow economic growth, if you in fact turn it backwards, it reduces emissions. And there are people who, over time, have advocated that way of reducing emissions. We think there\u2019s a better way, which is to deploy technologies in sensible ways across those critical industries for countries like Australia. Pedantic point, but I suspect when Taylor refers to people advocating for an economic shutdown to reduce emissions, he is actually referring to the push for a carbon tax. Which ain\u2019t a shutdown. It\u2019s just a tax. You can read Ketan Joshi\u2019s critique of the tech not taxes argument here. The education minister, Dan Tehan, has announced a further $13m to patch up the free childcare system, with most assistance targeted at providers that are ineligible for the jobkeeper wage subsidy. On Tuesday Tehan foreshadowed that free childcare will expire in June as Australians go back to work, after releasing an education department report finding that one quarter of centres found the new system is not helping their financial viability. On Wednesday Tehan announced: $12m for childcare services that have more than 30% of full-time equivalent staff ineligible for jobkeeper payments; and $800,000 to increase the level of funding for in-home care providers. Tehan said: Our government has made further improvements to the early childhood education and care relief package in response to circumstances identified in the four-week review published yesterday. The relief package was designed to work in conjunction with the jobkeeper payment, because staff wages account for about 60% of a provider\u2019s costs. The changes announced today will provide further financial support to childcare services that have more than 30% of staff not eligible for jobkeeper, as well as more financial security for in-home care providers. The government continues to review and assess the relief package in light of our success at flattening the curve and other issues raised by the new system. We need to consider how the package can best support economic recovery, help parents to get back to work and study, and ensure children\u2019s early childhood education and wellbeing. New South Wales has authorised the reopening of indoor swimming pools for swimming squads, under a public health order signed by health minister Brad Hazzard yesterday. The order says that indoor swimming pools that are at least 25m long, or longer, can be opened only for the purpose of swimming squad training. Only one swimmer is allowed per lane, and no more than 10 people are allowed in the pool at any one time. Outdoor pools are already permitted to open in NSW, provided social distancing is observed and swimmers are in groups of 10 or less. The headline numbers from that national health update are: There are 650 active Covid-19 cases in Australia. 45 of those cases are in hospital, nine in intensive care, and seven on ventilators. The death toll remains at 100 5.9m people have downloaded the app. Kelly said the app was \u201cworking as designed\u201d and that both Victoria and NSW are now using it as part of their contact tracing processes. But, he says, because some of their new cases have been travellers in hotel quarantine, the app is not always necessary. We\u2019ve had discussions today in the last 24 hours with both Victoria and NewSouth Wales and they confirm that they have used the app and they are using it as part of their contact tracing exercises. The Digital Transformation Agency has undertaken comprehensive testing on a technical nature and can confirm the functionality of the app on a range of devices, operating systems and manufacturers of phones. On the issue of Qantas announcing it will fill Australian flights to capacity and make the wearing of masks optional, Kelly says there are \u201cvery specific engineering things that happen in relation to the ventilation on aircraft and so forth which can make it safer than a closed room\u201d. It will not, he says, be as safe as an outdoor cafe. But, look, we live in a very big country. We do need our aircraft to get around this big of ours for all sorts of reasons, whether that\u2019s [for] family or other reasons. And we do want to see our airline industry get back on their feet. We had a discussion last week with Qantas and worked through the sort of things they might want to look at but we made it very clear that like all other industries in Australia, they needed to do their own risk assessment and come up with their own way of mitigating that risk. There is no medical justification for the continued closure of state borders, Kelly says. Western Australia, Queensland, SA, the NT and Tasmania have been adamant they will not reopen their borders just yet. This is on the back of Queensland saying it will keep borders closed until September, and WA premier Mark McGowan saying he will not give into the \u201cbullying\u201d of NSW on opening borders. Kelly says: At that time [when borders were closed] we were seeing large numbers of cases starting to develop, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. And so I can understand why those decisions were made. But I would really stress at the national level and in the National Cabinet or in the Australian Health Protection Committee, we made no decisions or advice in relation to that... From a medical point of view I can\u2019t see why the borders are still closed but, as I said, that\u2019s for the states and territories themselves to decide when that time is right for them. On McGowan\u2019s comments, Kelly says that he is from WA \u2014 so he\u2019s not just giving his views as an eastern stater. Just to let Mr McGowan know, I\u2019m a proud West Australian. I grew up in that state, so I hope I\u2019ll be claimed. Kelly said he spoke to WA\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Andrew Robertson, \u201cat least daily\u201d and he knew McGowan was also meeting with Robertson every day. Happy to meet him [McGowan] any time. It might be a while for now depending on the border closures. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, is giving an update in Canberra. He is talking about the World Health Assembly, which has been meeting overnight this week via zoom. \u201cSo a very empty room which is usually full of people giving their advice to the World Health Organisation,\u201d Kelly said. Health minister Greg Hunt made a speech on Monday night, Australia time, calling for an \u201cindependent, impartial and comprehensive examination of the World Health Organisation\u2019s approach to the pandemic, so that we can really learn the lessons of the origins of the virus, the source of the virus and what has happened over the last few months in relation to the spread around the world and our global response\u201d. That\u2019s the one that has angered China. Another 136 countries signed on. Australia really welcomes that unanimous support that came from all of those co-sponsors and we look forward to that, the findings of that as it happens in the coming months as would be necessary so that we can really look at the entire response. Meanwhile, in Queensland: People who rely on the Centrelink office in Abbotsford are very critical of its sudden closure. You can see how big the queue was on 23 March, when the first round of hospitality closures due to the lockdown were announced. I am going to hand you over to the wonderful Calla Wahlquist for the next little bit. She will bring you the latest on the national Covid front, with Professor Paul Kelly due to give an update in the next 30 minutes. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow (and hopefully over this cold) and as usual, you can catch me here and here if you have any more questions. I\u2019m working through the backlog, so if you haven\u2019t received a response, you should soon. As always, take care of you The National Farmers Federation is not happy with the government\u2019s handling of the bio-security levy, which it very quietly announced it was scrapping this morning. From the NFF\u2019s statement: Today\u2019s announcement by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment that the government would not be proceeding with a long-awaited levy to bolster the national biosecurity system comes as a blow to Australia\u2019s farmers. The levy was first proposed in a 2017 independent review, which found that the national biosecurity system was underfunded, and recommended the introduction of a levy on imports to generate revenue for important biosecurity functions that couldn\u2019t be cost recovered. National Farmers\u2019 Federation CEO Tony Mahar said the farm sector strongly supported the levy as an important new source of funding for an overstretched system, and was frustrated by today\u2019s announcement. \u201cBiosecurity is absolutely critical \u2013 not only for primary industries, but for the environment and the health of the community. This has certainly been brought home by the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe need a firm and clear commitment from government that they are serious about maintaining the biosecurity of this country. \u201cBiosecurity is absolutely fundamental to agriculture, and the way biosecurity levy proposal has been handled is of concern to Australia\u2019s farmers.\u201d Mahar said the biosecurity levy proposal had consumed a significant amount of time and effort from industry and governments over a number of years, and that today\u2019s decision had put that effort to waste. Mark McGowan says the WA government won\u2019t give into the \u201cbullying\u201d of NSW or anyone else, as the domestic border debate rages on. And when I say debate, I mean NSW and the federal government versus pretty much the rest of the country. The ABC has chopped up McGowan\u2019s response in a handy video you\u2019ll find here, which includes this salvo New South Wales had the Ruby Princess \u2014 I mean, seriously? And they are trying to give us advice on our borders, seriously?\u201d he said. As we pointed out earlier, Services Australia has announced it is closing a Centrelink office in inner Melbourne. The centre, in Abbotsford, is in the vicinity of several public housing estates and it will shut its doors from tomorrow. The Greens leader Adam Bandt attacked the minister, Stuart Robert, for the \u201cdecision to close one of the country\u2019s busiest Centrelink offices ... with just 24 hours notice\u201d. \u201cIn the middle of the biggest ever demand on Centrelink, in an area with more public housing than almost anywhere in the country, the minister gives just over 24 hours\u2019 notice that people will be left without a local service,\u201d said Bandt, who represents Abbotsford and surrounding suburbs. In a statement issued on the Services Australia website, spokesman Hank Jongen blamed the \u201coutcome of comprehensive lease negotiations with the Yarra Service Centre landlord\u201d. He said this had resulted in Services Australia being \u201crequired to vacate the building before the lease expiry date of 22 May 2020\u201d. The agency pointed people to face-to-face services at a Centrelink and Medicare at South Melbourne, which is about six kilometres away and on the other side of Melbourne\u2019s CBD. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making rapid improvements to support the many Australians who need our help and we know people are increasingly taking advantage of online options to manage their Centrelink and Medicare needs,\u201d Jongen said. \u201cIn fact, all Medicare related claims, changes or inquiries can now be done online or over the phone.\u201d But Bandt claimed the government\u2019s excuse they \u201ccouldn\u2019t negotiate a lease extension or find an alternative site is simply not credible\u201d. The Global Times (China state media reserved for some of its most hawkish opinions) has published another editorial on the world health assembly passing the EU motion, detailing why it believes Australia is a \u201closer\u201d of the process. It\u2019s quite in depth, and long, and includes quite a bit of snark (some of which is lost in translation, but you get the idea). The third loser was Australia, which has been actively pushing for a so-called independent inquiry into the origins of the crisis in recent days, aimed at China. Australia\u2019s act was widely believed to be instigated by Washington. Some Australian politicians, including Australia\u2019s foreign minister Marise Payne, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, have been in a bullish mood, as some media reports said, in criticizing China for its lack of transparency, and vowed to stand up for their values. Some Australian media outlets see this as a move aimed at further pressuring China and seeking to hold Beijing accountable for the outbreak, calling on Beijing to face overwhelming global pressure at the WHA meeting. \u201cThis is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,\u201d Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community. Along with other countries, China has been actively taking part in the negotiations on this resolution, which clearly recognizes and supports the leadership of the WHO amid the pandemic, he noted. Some Chinese netizens also mocked Australia\u2019s attempts as it has been trying to become a \u201cmartyr\u201d for defending so-called independence and transparency while its ideas were denounced by the global community. By following the steps of some US hawks who harshly attack China over coronavirus, \u201cit seems that Australia, this giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US, will hit a deadlock with China on trade disputes in sectors like coal and beef. Hopefully, the US will compensate it!\u201d one netizen said in a Weibo post on Tuesday. As mentioned earlier, this is something students will have to get used to. Even at the fanciest of fancy schools. The attorney-general Christian Porter spoke to 6PR Perth radio\u2019s Gareth Parker this morning where he was asked whether the border closures were unconsitutional: Porter: Well, someone famously said that everything\u2019s constitutional until it\u2019s challenged, and then you need to be ... Parker: Till it\u2019s not? Porter: ... Well, you need to be very careful about the border closures, and they served a very important purpose for a considerable period of time, and that may well still be the case now. But these are state government decisions and they obviously need to consider the health impact - like what is it that it is creating or achieving in terms of slowing the spread of the virus. That has to be weighed against the economic impact, that has to be considered in context of the constitutional issues, and they\u2019re real issues. But state governments will be getting their own advice and making their own decisions. I think ultimately, the big question here though is the practical question about the economy. You know, we\u2019re going to have many, many months of low passenger movements internationally, and that could go on for some considerable period of time. So, if you want Australian tourism, retail, hospitality sector to thrive, you\u2019re going to have to pivot on to a domestic market, and that will mean West Australians going to Cairns who might have otherwise gone to Bali, and it will mean people from the East Coast going to Margaret River who otherwise might have gone to New Zealand, or wherever. And I think we need to keep in mind that there\u2019s a massive economic cost for keeping the borders closed. But state governments will make these decisions, they\u2019ll balance the competing criteria - not easy calls to make. Two healthcare workers from the Kyabram District Health service, in regional Victoria, tested positive to Covid-19. The cases were discovered as part of regular screening of residential aged care workers, and Victoria\u2019s public health team said neither had worked while infectious. A number of other health service staff who had contact with the pair have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, but the public health team has not identified any of their patients or residents under their care as close contacts.In all 75 people were tested in the screening, and 73 returned negative results. The number of cases linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak in Melbourne has risen to 103, with the addition of one case diagnosed overnight and two other cases, which were first reported on Monday and have since been traced back to the meatworks. There have been no new reported cases related to the outbreaks a three Melbourne aged care facilities (each outbreak has only one case), and no new positive cases connected to the Maccas outbreak. All told there are eight new cases of Covid-19 in Victoria and the total sits at 1,580, of which 1,465 have recovered and 18 died. The deputy chief medical officer in Victoria, Annaliese van Diemen, says there has been eight new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in the last 24 hours. Two have been linked to the Cedar Meats cluster, and another two have been linked to the Kyabram District Health Service (they weren\u2019t at work while infectious) One has been traced back to a known case, while the rest are under investigation. This morning, NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed our story from last night that NSW has had issues with accessing data from the Covidsafe app. Chant said there were \u201cteething problems\u201d in particular with the iPhone version of the app, and the ongoing Bluetooth handshake issue we have reported earlier. She said the department was still evaluating the app, and it could be used in future cases where contact tracing was required. There seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes in the federal department of health today to try to play down this story. Yesterday evening when we asked the Victorian department of health for information on the use of the app, we were informed it was too early and to check back in next week. Suddenly after the NSW story was published last night, Victoria this morning was able to confirm a user of the app tested positive for coronavirus and the app\u2019s data would be used in contact tracing. The federal health department insisted last night it was \u201cunaware\u201d of the problems NSW was facing, but has this morning so far not responded to questions on why it was unaware of the issues Dr Chant raised this morning. Federal health minister Greg Hunt also seemed unaware of the NSW issues, despite both Dr Chant and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian facing questions on it this morning. Asked about the cuts to research and development under this government by the Canberra Time\u2019s Katie Burgess (a very good point) Karen Andrews says: So, you\u2019re referring to the R and D tax incentive. So there are a number of things that I\u2019d like to say about the R and D tax incentive. Some of them I actually covered in my speech, which actually discussed the other parts of innovation which is not recognised and does fall under the R and D tax incentive. And that is the work being done every single day in the manufacturing businesses. We also know, too, that with research and development, business investment has been declining for a number of years. If I speak to the university sector and the researchers, it\u2019s that they\u2019re keen to engage with businesses and industry, to ensure that we increase the research industry engagement. We actually, as a government, want businesses to start looking at research and investment opportunities in innovation, because we know that when they do that, the outcomes are going to be better for them. So the R and D tax incentive - I understand, has had a lot of criticism. That software developers have been particularly concerned. My department has actually worked hard to make this a more user friendly process for them to give some guidance up-front as to what is going to be likely accepted under... What would likely fall outside it. And then it\u2019s up to the individuals to make the determination as to whether or not they\u2019re going to proceed. I understand that research and development is very critical to this nation, and that we need to work hard to lift that investment. From AAP: Australia and other countries have agreed to cooperate in the fight against hackers targeting hospitals and medical services during the coronavirus pandemic. Australia has joined an international fight against cyber criminals launching hacking attacks on hospitals across the world. The foreign affairs department and cyber security centre are concerned hackers are attempting to exploit the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOf particular concern are reports that malicious cyber actors are seeking to damage or impair the operation of hospitals, medical services and facilities, and crisis response organisations outside of Australia,\u201d they said in a joint statement on Wednesday. Australia and other countries at the United Nations have agreed to cooperate on cyber crime and not knowingly allow their territory to be used for \u201cinternational wrongful acts\u201d. \u201cThe Australian government calls on all countries to cease immediately any cyber activity \u2013 or support for such activity \u2013 inconsistent with these commitments,\u201d Australia\u2019s cyber affairs ambassador, Tobias Feakin, said. \u201cWe also urge all countries to exercise increased vigilance and take all reasonable measures to ensure malicious cyber activity is not emanating from their territory.\u201d The New Zealand Herald is reporting Air New Zealand will lay off more than 1300 staff. Asked about the Coalition\u2019s (until recently) never-ending criticism of Labor\u2019s GFC response, by Mark Kenny, Karen Andrews says: I\u2019m probably a person that tries to stay out of the politics of undermining other political parties, because I don\u2019t see that it\u2019s a particularly worthwhile strategy. I would think that today had the opportunity to really approach a new way of looking at Australian industry. What I will say is that there have been some issues in the past, specifically related to manufacturing. And that has been across-the-board. It\u2019s been decades long that has got us to this. I could spend a lot of time, if I wanted to \u2013 but I don\u2019t \u2013 raking over the coals of the past. I\u2019d prefer to look forward. If I speak specifically about the jobkeeper payment, I do believe that it was necessary. We understood when we were doing it quickly, that there would be issues as a result of that. But we believed at the time that it was an important thing for us to be doing. And every day, I have businesses approach me and say, \u2018we were only able to stay afloat because of the jobkeeper payments\u2019. So I would say in response to your question \u2013 let\u2019s not go back to politics and let\u2019s be forward-focusing in what we\u2019re trying to do. Let\u2019s actually try to keep together the united approach as long as we possibly can, and focus on, in this case, developing a strong Australian manufacturing sector. GPs are reporting that Australians aren\u2019t getting their usual check-ups. If this is you, please go to your doctor. Those niggles should not be ignored: Tens of thousands of Australians with chronic diseases are putting themselves at risk by missing vital visits to their GP and skipping potentially life-saving cholesterol tests to manage and prevent heart disease. New data from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) reveals a 10 per cent drop in GP visits for the management of chronic disease in March 2020, equating to 96,000 less visits compared to the same time last year. Alongside the impact of Covid-19 on the fall in chronic disease visits, pathology data from NSW reveal a 28% drop in cholesterol tests being processed in March compared to the same time in February 2020. Heart Foundation chief medical adviser and cardiologist Prof Garry Jennings, said the data also showed an 18% drop in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health checks in March 2020 compared to the same time last year. Pulled up on that point, by David Crowe, (although not as bluntly) Karen Andrews again says Australian businesses need to change the way they do business. ie: don\u2019t go for the lowest cost. I look forward to governments no longer going with the lowest tender, then. Andrews: What I\u2019m saying to our businesses is that we need you to look at the value proposition. We need you to look at the value of those goods. Now, clearly, there will be times when each and every one of us, businesses included, will need to buy on a cost, on a price basis, that they will be looking for the lowest cost. But what those businesses have experience is that they actually had some difficulties with supply during the crisis, because they could not get the materials that they needed. When they look at their longevity as a manufacturer, look at how you\u2019re going to shore up your own supply chains. And look as to whether or not you can source that product from Australia. And by doing so, you have reliability of supply in a crisis. Karen Andrews has given a very nice speech about the need to reinvigorate the Australian manufacturing industry (let\u2019s all ignore what happened with the car industry under Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, though) but at the end of the day, it all means diddly squat without some sort of government assistance to bring down costs. Here is what Andrews says on that: From my portfolio point of view, I\u2019m at the consumer end. So for Australian manufacturers, I want to make sure that they get the best energy price that is they can. So price and reliability are important. It\u2019s also important that we start to shift the mindset so that we\u2019re not trying to compete on cost. Given that we are a high-wage nation, given that we don\u2019t mass-produce many goods. And in fact, our niche is our capability to transit really quite quickly to change our manufacturing to be very agile and nimble in what we\u2019re doing in manufacturing. So we don\u2019t have the long runs that the likes of other countries overseas have. So for us to be competitive, we have to start looking at manufacturing on value \u2013 not on cost. So price is a part of the value equation, but it is not the only part of it. When you look at value, we also look at the longevity of the product. We look at economic indicators. We look at freight. We look at costs of manufacturing here in Australia and the benefits of that. The shift needs to be from cost to value.\u201d So the answer is apparently to change how capitalism works. Cool beans. She is the most popular prime minister in recent New Zealand history for a reason. Leading epidemiologists are expecting a second wave of Covid-19 infections as Australians fully return to offices and schools, but believe the amount of infections can be smaller than what has been experienced so far if physical distancing is maintained. Addressing an Australian Science Media Centre webinar on Wednesday, Australian National University professor of infectious diseases Peter Collignon said crowding indoors as a result of winter\u2019s colder temperatures could spread infections during the second wave in a way not experienced so far. He also warned the likely sources of second wave infections will be Australians in their 20s and 30s who are asymptomatic and return to normal life without knowing they are spreading the virus. \u201cI actually think we will get a second wave but I think it will be less than our first wave if the vast majority of people keep on doing the right thing. Winter is more of a risk of spreading viruses than is summer so we may have been lucky \u2026 We\u2019re going to get a second wave but I think we can keep it small this winter if we keep on doing the things we know work to stop droplets being transmitted, and that means we won\u2019t have crowds of tens of thousands on street parades or at football matches.\u201d Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales, said to lessen the impact of a second wave, younger Australians who will likely be asymptomatic should be \u201cmindful and reflective\u201d of how they feel and get tested for Covid-19 if their sense of taste and smell is not normal so they can be diagnosed and not spread the virus. \u201cOne of the big problems is of course getting people back to work. And these three steps of getting people to work by July, if we\u2019re not very careful, we\u2019ll have this second wave. Whether it\u2019s doubling every three days or a spike. We will get it, unless we\u2019re very careful about social distancing.\u201d Karen Andrews is wrapping up her press club speech: There\u2019s a real sense that in a post-Covid world, where norms have indeed been disrupted, there will be an adjustment of our fast, disposable, retail approach. A return to quality over quantity. This sort of disruption would indeed be a great opportunity for Australian manufacturing to compete on value, not cost. It\u2019s also important to recognise that our manufacturing sector has evolved and looks very different to what it did 30, 20 or even 10 years ago. Manufacturing consists of a number of specialty processes along the production chain \u2013 from design through to marketing. There are high-paid and skilled jobs at each step along the process \u2013 and the modern factory floor is home to designers, engineers, scientists and tradespeople. Parents, educators and our young people need to know that old stereotypes of production line labour are not an accurate reflection of Australia\u2019s vibrant manufacturing sector. Our manufacturers are innovators, having adapted to many challenges \u2026 in fact, they have a lot in common with the proud disruptors of the tech sector. This is a good read \u2013 and helps explain the \u201cwhy don\u2019t they just go home\u201d. This is sure to help calm everything down. Karen Andrews is delivering her national press club address. It is obviously, on manufacturing. Specifically, what will happen with the sector in Australia in a post-Covid world. Gladys Berejiklian said, when announcing that students would go back to on-site learning on 25 May said it would not be unusual for schools to be closed due to Covid. This is the whole text, from the English translation on the Chinese embassy website: China Daily: Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said on May 18 that the input of so many parties in the EU-sponsored COVID-19 draft resolution at the WHA is a real signal of the importance of the call for an independent, international review proposed by Australia. It\u2019s a win for the international community, and Australia, as a strong and active part of that international community, would certainly see it that way. Do you have any comment? Zhao Lijian: First and foremost, China supports a comprehensive evaluation of global Covid-19 response to ensure experience gained and lessons learnt after the pandemic is brought under control, which should be led by WHO and conducted in a science-based, professional, objective and impartial manner. China has been consistent and clear about this all along. The draft resolution on Covid-19 being discussed at this year\u2019s WHA is consistent with China\u2019s position and reflects the widespread consensus of other countries. China, along with other parties, has actively participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and the co-sponsoring of the draft resolution. Second, the above-mentioned draft resolution is entirely different from what the Australia called \u201cindependent international review\u201d. For example, the draft resolution proposes to initiate at the appropriate moment an evaluation rather than to launch an \u201cindependent international review\u201d instantly, which confirms WHO\u2019s leading role instead of adopting another mechanism. The draft resolution calls for an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting certain country. We hope Australia will read the text carefully instead of making conclusions based on assumptions. Lastly, I want to stress that we welcome it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvere and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to theWorld Health Assembly motion (which was led by the EU) and recommended Australia \u2018changes its course\u2019. The spokesperson highlighted the differences between the WHA resolution and Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review and stressed that China welcomes it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvre and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution. The Covid crisis, and the trade situation, has resulted in this announcement from the government: Following broad industry consultation and further consideration of the impacts on industry, the Australian government has made the decision not to proceed with the Onshore Biosecurity Levy. The department undertook a co-design process with industry to develop a levy model that was practical for industry and the government. This process highlighted that a levy could not be implemented without significant regulatory impacts on industry and proposed levy payers. This decision has also been made in consideration of the ongoing impacts of drought, bushfires and Covid-19 on the Australian economy and the rapidly changing global trade environment. The department would like to thank the Industry Working Group and other stakeholders who provided valuable input and feedback on the proposed levy design. A levy will not be progressed and this decision will not impact on the overall biosecurity budget. Australia\u2019s biosecurity system will continue to be funded through existing arrangements. Penny Wong also spoke to the ABC radio this morning (in Adelaide) where she repeated Labor\u2019s stance on the government\u2019s relationship with China: I think on the inquiry, if that\u2019s the question, this is the inquiry into the pandemic, I\u2019ve made very clear from the start we supported it. And we welcome the resolution at the World Health Assembly to have an inquiry, a European Union-led resolution that has many countries signed up to it, including Australia. It does differ from what Marise Payne announced on Insiders, in that the World Health Organisation is doing the inquiry. But leaving that aside, I think it is a very good outcome, so we\u2019ve supported that. I think you asked would we do something differently. I think I\u2019d have a little bit less George Christensen leading the debate on China. I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of backbenchers engaging quite inflammatory language about China from the Coalition. People are entitled to their view. We\u2019re a democracy. Their views can be put respectfully. But I do think we\u2019ve seen a lot of inflammatory language, which doesn\u2019t help. They aren\u2019t happening every day any more, but the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, will be holding a national health update at 3.30pm today. National cabinet, for those who missed it, won\u2019t be held until 29 May. There is no meeting this week. There is, however, a National Press Club address from Scott Morrison on Tuesday. Yesterday, Simon Birmigham and David Littleproud said quite explicitly Australia would be looking to diversify its trading base, naming India as one of those potential markets. AAP has followed that up and reports that the virtual summit Scott Morrison is due to hold with Narendra Modi (the original planned trip was scrapped because of the bushfire crisis) will have trade as a big agenda item: Australia has been looking to complete a defence agreement on reciprocal access to bases and cooperation on military technology projects. A new education partnership is also on the cards, as are Australian plans to export more goods to India, including agricultural products. \u201cAustralia and India are natural partners with deep people-to-people links,\u201d a spokesman for Morrison told AAP. \u201cThe prime minister looks forward to holding a virtual summit with Indian prime minister Modi in the near future as another step to advance our India economic strategy and cement India in the top tier of Australia\u2019s partnerships.\u201d The reason for this is apparently the lease ended, and the department couldn\u2019t negotiate a new one. Still tho. Marise Payne has had to overcome her career-long aversion to the media in her role as foreign minister, but in the last two weeks she has had to really step up in front of the cameras in order to explain what is happening with Australia\u2019s relationship with China. Simon Birmingham, as trade minister, has done the bulk of the messaging on this, but Payne has had to get out more than she would be comfortable with, because she is, after all, the foreign minister, and it is important as the head and face of that portfolio to explain to Australia what is happening on the world stage. Particularly when it is a situation like this. This morning, Payne spoke to Sabra Lane on ABC radio about what happened in the World Health Assembly overnight, and why Australia was OK with it (despite previously pushing for more). Lane: I\u2019m going to pick you up on those points. You, at the outset, said that WHO couldn\u2019t oversee this as it would be a case of poacher turned gamekeeper, but all of those entities that you just mentioned are all part of WHO. Payne: Well, the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee is, in fact, an independent organisation drawn from national governments, from NGOs, those from the international system with very broad experience in a range of public health areas. They serve in their personal capacity, they are not, if you like, part of the WHO structure. But we\u2019re at the very beginning of this process and we have to step through that with the WHO, with the members of the WHO as to what this will look like. Lane: What about the timing? The resolution says the inquiry will happen at the earliest appropriate moment, China says when the peak has passed. Given that there might be a second wave, how long before this inquiry begins and will you lobby G20 partners over this? Payne: In terms of the timing of the review, we\u2019ve been very clear, and particularly in our discussions with international counterparts, that for many countries which are still dealing with the absolute most critical aspects of response to the pandemic, this is still a very difficult time. So, the timing will be determined by the international community and I do think that\u2019s appropriate and that\u2019s a point we\u2019ve made all along. Victoria\u2019s parliament will sit again from next month. As AAP reports: Parliament last sat on 23 April to pass emergency legislation in response to the deadly virus. On Wednesday, it was announced both houses will sit from 2 to 4 June and 16 to 18 June. Parliament will then break for the previously scheduled winter recesses before returning on August 4. But restrictions will be in place: additional cleaning will be done, reduced numbers of MPs will be allowed in the chambers, and staff numbers will be reduced to aid social distancing. Sitting dates are subject to change, depending on the spread of coronavirus and the advice of the chief health officer. The ABS has released its latest figures on the Covid impact \u2013 this time on retail spending. It fell 17.9% in the last month, which is the biggest recorded fall \u2013 and follows the biggest rise in March, when everyone was panic buying. Turnover was down 9.4% when compared to April 2019. These preliminary figures, which will be subject to revision, show falls in every industry, with particularly strong falls in food retailing, cafes, restaurants and takeaways, and clothing, footwear and personal accessories. The food retailing industry, which saw a strong rise in March due to unprecedented demand, fell 17.1 per cent from March 2020. Additional analysis indicates that the majority of products which rose substantially in March recorded falls in April 2020, however they remained at higher levels than April 2019. While March saw a mix of impacts related to COVID-19 across industries, these impacts were overwhelmingly negative in April, as regulations regarding social distancing measures limited the ability of businesses to trade as normal for the entire month. Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services, clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, and department stores fell heavily in April and there were no offsetting rises in the other industries. Turnover in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, and cafes, restaurants and takeaways is around half the level of April 2019. Penny Wong and Chris Bowen have responded on behalf of Labor to the World Health Assembly passing the EU motion to set up \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d an investigation into the origins and original response to Covid-19. Labor welcomes the passage and formal adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution overnight to enact a review coordinated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Member States into the Covid-19 pandemic. Labor has consistently supported an impartial inquiry into the virus to ensure we learn the lessons from Covid-19 and improve pandemic prevention, preparedness and response capacity across the globe. The European Union led motion, supported by the Australian government and over 130 countries, shows the kind of international cooperation we need in a crisis like this pandemic. Labor believes it is in every country\u2019s interest to get to the bottom of this and ensure it never happens again. The Australian government now needs to clarify how the proposed review will work and explain how Australia will constructively engage as a member state to ensure the kind of independent investigation it had called for occurs. The government should also explain what it will do to ensure this review will deliver real results, unlike previous pandemic reviews which have not been well supported by WHO member states. Throughout the Covid-19 health emergency Labor has supported the government\u2019s efforts wherever possible and provided constructive feedback whenever necessary. Labor will continue to support Australia\u2019s role in this review, and will hold the government to account to ensure they productively contribute to the high-quality, comprehensive and independent review process that is needed. The federal court has removed the last bit of personal liability hanging over the administrators of stricken airline Virgin Australia after a deal was struck with the Taxation Office. ATO lawyers had been concerned about a request to the federal court from the administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, that meant they wouldn\u2019t be personally liable for overpayments under the jobkeeper scheme. Administrators are normally personally on the hook for every debt they run up while in charge of a company, but the Virgin administrators have asked the court to excuse them from liability so that they can keep the airline running while trying to sell it. At a hearing last week Judge John Middleton approved the request in relation to most of the debts Virgin incurs, but kicked deciding the jobkeeper issue to a hearing this morning after the ATO said they wanted more time to discuss the issue with the administrators. This morning, Middleton said he would approve orders agreed to by the two sides. South Australian premier Steven Marshall says the state can relax some of its restrictions ahead of schedule: From Friday this week, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy a meal and a glass of wine indoors up to 10. So we\u2019re going to be changing the arrangements we announced almost two week ago. And now, instead of only 10 outside the cafes and restaurants, it will be 10 indoors, 10 outdoors, including alcohol service for all cafes and restaurants in South Australia. And the second announcement today is that we will be moving to Stage 2 restrictions from Friday, June 5 \u2013 not Monday, June 8. So we\u2019re bringing that forward. We\u2019ve listened to what the people of South Australia have said. We want to move to stage 2 sooner than the Monday of the long weekend. Speaking with Sky News a little earlier today, Anthony Albanese wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether or not he agreed with his Victorian state colleague Tim Pallas\u2019s comments, only saying that federal Labor was as one with the federal government on that issue. But he said there were more questions to be asked about the US deal with China on barley, so Australia knows what it is dealing with: Well, we clearly need not just to engage with China. We need to engage with the United States as well, given the reports that are there about the deal between the US and China. And the example whereby it may well be that the US is stepping in to fill the gap that will be created by the imposition of tariffs on Australian barley. We need to operate our trade system on the basis of laws. Laws that apply to everyone. Which is why we\u2019ve also supported the Australian Government taking China over this issue to the WTO. Australia doesn\u2019t subsidise our barley. And we need to support our farmers. Clearly, we need to look at diversifying markets as well, as much as possible. But there is no reason why hardworking Australian farmers should suffer during this period as a result of a decision by the Chinese Government. ...We are good friends with the United States. And clearly the government should be in a position to pick up the phone and to at least explore what the facts are here about the US China deal and on agricultural and whether it has any implications for Australia. The Liberal senator James Paterson ramped up his criticism of the Victorian Labor state treasurer, Tim Pallas (and by proxy Daniel Andrews), for what he said was \u201ceffectively do[ing] their [the CCP] bidding for them\u201d after Pallas blamed the federal government for the 80% tariff on Australian barley exports going to China. Victoria signed up to the Chinese government belt and road initiative, which bucked the Australian advice (which is also given to Pacific Island nations). Asked on Melbourne radio 3AW why the Victorian government appeared to \u201ckowtow\u201d to the Chinese government, Paterson replied: It\u2019s really strange to me. I mean, I think it\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation from our politicians state or federal that when we\u2019re engaged in a trade dispute with a foreign government, and particularly when it is a foreign authoritarian government, as the Chinese Communist party is, that the default is to back your own country, the default is to be loyal to your own country. And if you\u2019re not capable of doing that, then I think it\u2019d be much better if you keep your thoughts to yourself. It\u2019s very clear to me that the Victorian government has no understanding and no expertise in foreign policy. They\u2019ve got no responsibility for it. They should stick to their own task at hand. They\u2019ve got a fair bit on their plate. Which led to this exchange: Neil Mitchell: Are you saying Tim Pallas and Daniel Andrews are being disloyal to Australia? Paterson: Well, they\u2019re certainly not being helpful to Australia\u2019s national interests, whether it\u2019s the comments Tim Pallas made yesterday, whether it\u2019s them signing up to the belt and road initiative, which in my view has undermined Australia in a critical area of our national security. Greg Hunt says universities, which are not eligible for jobkeeper and have had their research capacity slashed with the loss of international students, have been working with the states \u201cin putting forward proposals for careful, cautious, quarantine-based resumption of international students\u201d: A number of the premiers have talked about that, and we remain very open and very welcoming to proposals that they are likely to put forward. Greg Hunt, in announcing $400m for medical research, says there have been 1.1m Covid-19 tests across the nation and 5.9 million people have downloaded the Covidsafe app. Deloitte also thinks it could take some of the hardest hit industries \u2013 including the arts \u2013 at least six years to recover. And industries which escaped the most immediate hit \u2013 like finance \u2013 could see some delayed impacts, as people begin to default on loans: At a broad industry level, the key losers in terms of jobs losses in the short term (seeing greater than 50% declines) are expected to be accommodation, arts, recreation and other services \u2013 and they may take five or six years to recover all the job losses seen. Sectors such as property and professional services, education and telecommunications are less impacted now, and may be back in a solid growth phase by early 2022. However, a couple of sectors have a moderate decline now, but may take an extended period to return to early 2020 employment levels. Key here is the finance sector, which may see a longer period of weak performance than other key office-intensive industries. The finance sector is part of the defence against the COVID-19 downturn, with many loans being deferred. But over time banks can expect to see a sharp rise in non-performing loans, while it may be some time before businesses are ready to invest again at significant scale, implying a sharp hit to credit demand. Deloitte Access Economics has released its latest analysis of the employment data, and has looked ahead to what a post-Covid work life might look like: The COVID-19 emergency has given both employers and employees time to observe the costs and benefits of working remotely, while businesses have been forced to overcome previous barriers by investing in technologies and rapidly developing new work methods. At least during the period that we continue to live with COVID (prior to a vaccine for example), it is likely that the tendency to work from home will remain above pre-crisis levels. The post-COVID era however becomes more difficult to predict, meaning that office demand cannot be automatically assumed to align with the white collar employment base which is the traditional driver. Over the balance of 2020, social distancing will undoubtedly restrict office density as restrictions begin to lift, reversing the decades long trend towards smaller workspaces and increasing the required levels of office space for some businesses. Importantly however, businesses are unlikely to completely abandon the office. Both employers and employees recognise the advantages of in person collaboration and the wellbeing benefits of social interaction with colleagues more generally, especially after months of social distancing and isolation. Underpinning these shifts will be economic momentum. Employment growth in Australia\u2019s metropolitan areas will continue to positively underpin future office demand. Given that we will be hearing about barley and China for the next 60 days at least, this explainer from Daniel Hurst may prove useful: Speaking of Queensland, Bob Katter wants to call off the Queensland bid for the 2032 Olympics \u201cas it\u2019s a waste of money and resources while the economy tanks from the Coronavirus and thousands try to survive without work\u201d: If it was a stupid idea to sink Billions into a Brisbane Olympic games before Covid-19, then it is infinitely more stupid now. Should we spend the next decade restarting a manufacturing sector, commencing nation building infrastructure and getting Australians back to work? Or should we spend the next ten years preparing for a two week sporting event? The strange capitalisation of billions is his own. Just to be clear, NSW may be opening up for travel from 1 June but Queensland is still saying no. Victoria also didn\u2019t close its borders but it still has physical distance restrictions in place, so you need a reason to travel in Victoria and a holiday, at this point, isn\u2019t one of them. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, told the state\u2019s tourism industry to aim for September but warned that was not a guaranteed either: The very, very earliest, and only if everything went absolutely perfectly, we might be able to think about opening up our border in July. If the tourism industry wants a more realistic scenario they should be preparing for September \u2026 Having said that, I can\u2019t even commit that September will be possible. It depends what happens between now and then. Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory are all saying the same thing. But it is only Queensland which is getting heat for it. It\u2019s almost as if there\u2019s a state election around the corner. It\u2019s been an awful 24 hours in Brazil. The country still doesn\u2019t have a health minister, after the previous one resigned one month ago. Dr Jeannette Young says the border closures were necessary to protect the state\u2019s population, and people need to remember that the coronavirus is different to other pandemics the world has seen, given it is contagious and potentially fatal. She says that means the border closures will be assessed but she won\u2019t be rushing to advise the government to reopen them: This is a really new way of managing a pandemic, so I was here in 2009 managing the swine flu pandemic, and that was totally different. We did not have the testing capacity back then. We did not have the ability to quarantine. Our borders remained open. There were so many different variables. We\u2019ve got totally different levers to protect Queensland today, and that\u2019s a very, very good thing, because this is a very different pandemic to a flu pandemic. We know the mortality is higher. We know the consequences are worse. So it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019ve got all these extra levers. But there are a couple of things that will protect Queensland. The first is the testing capacity. The second is our ability to contact-trace. We have got enormous resources in this state to contact-trace. And please, could everyone download that Covidsafe app? Because that\u2019s another tool that we now have that technology has given us that we didn\u2019t have back in 2009, and we need to use it. But it will only be effective if the vast majority of people download it. It will help. Every single person who downloads it helps, but it will be most effective if the majority of people do it. The Queensland chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, is also holding firm in her advice that Queensland maintain its border closures: I believe one of the things that has protected Queenslanders the most, as we\u2019ve been managing our response to Covid-19, is the closure of the international border, and the requirement that anyone coming from overseas goes into 14 days\u2019 quarantine. That has been absolutely critical. Then, when we started to see increased cases coming across the border from, in the main, New South Wales and Victoria, closing our border to those two states was incredibly important. We have not seen, since that decision was made, any further cases here in Queensland due to people from New South Wales or Victoria coming into Queensland, which is good. But we need to hold firm, and we need to manage our domestic borders very, very carefully. I know - I see the exemption requests every single day from people who live in other states who want to come to Queensland and, whenever there are compassionate reasons \u2013 a relative is dying or there\u2019s an awful situation \u2013 of course I grant those exemptions, and people come and they\u2019ve been very good at quarantining here in Queensland. We need to remain firm, and make sure that we manage our borders as we go forward, because Queenslanders have done a fantastic job. All the 77 residents in the Rockhampton aged care home where a worker tested positive for Covid-19 have been tested for the virus \u2013 and all have returned negative results. As have all the employees. The residents have been moved into private rooms as a precaution. In Queensland, the chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says a Brisbane woman has been diagnosed with Covid-19 after developing symptoms two months after returning from overseas travel: So one new case confirmed overnight in Queensland \u2013 a lady in her 70s, who lives in Metro North. She returned from India via Singapore two months ago and has now tested positive after developing some mild respiratory symptoms. At this stage, we\u2019re not sure whether that is a persistent case, or whether she\u2019s acquired it here. We think it most likely that she acquired the case in India, but we\u2019ll now have to do a lot of work to work through that, some additional testing and also we\u2019ll have to talk to her and look at contact-tracing. So all that work has started. Yesterday, Simon Birmingham said it was for others to determine if the Chinese government decision to level the tariffs was in retaliation to Australia\u2019s call for an independent inquiry into the origins and first response to the coronavirus pandemic. He can do that \u2013 acknowledge it at least \u2013 because he is a more senior minister. David Littleproud, is still holding on to the \u201ctotally unrelated\u201d line. David Koch: Right. OK. Well, we\u2019ve angered the Chinese with some pretty blunt remarks in the past. You said yesterday we shouldn\u2019t read it to the fact that the barley tariffs have come at the same time as the increased diplomatic tensions with China over coronavirus. Do you honestly, hand on heart, scout\u2019s honour, believe they\u2019re unrelated? Littleproud: Yeah, Kochie. I do. Koch: Really? Littleproud: I mean this has been in place for 18 months. And in fact, we extended this a further six months and that was the extent to which we could extend it. The juncture at the point in time has come at a critical point in terms of Covid-19, we respect that, but I think to speculate outside of that is dangerous. We\u2019ve got to keep to the course and look at each one of these cases on an individual basis. And you alluded to the beef situation, those four abattoirs. Let me just put into perspective, one of those abattoirs is in fact partially Chinese owned, so they\u2019ve imposed this temporary ban on one of their own companies here in Australia. So I think we just need to take a calm look at these and look at them individually and make determinations from that. David Littleproud was on the morning interview circuit again this morning. He said Australia would keep working with Beijing, using the 60-day time period nations have to try and appeal decisions such as the one China has imposed to place an 80% tariff on Australian barley, at a local level, before heading to the World Trade Organisation. This is what he told the Seven Network: We are working within Beijing at the moment. I have agricultural councillors and trade officials from Simon Birmingham\u2019s office in Beijing working with officials now. So we\u2019ll work constructively through a set process and it\u2019s important to respect that process. We\u2019re fair traders, we\u2019re a fair nation within the global community and it\u2019s important we live up to responsibilities, we\u2019ll stick to the process. But that\u2019s only 60 days and then once that\u2019s completed, we\u2019ll make a determination at the WTO. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce spoke on ABC radio this morning, confirming the airline would turn people away from flights if they are displaying symptoms of Covid-19. \u201cIf you are not feeling well you wake up for your flight there will be no cost of changing your ticket and we will be asking people to do that,\u201d he said. Joyce defended the airline\u2019s decision not to enforce social distancing onboard its flights. Other airlines have opted to leave middle seats in economy class free to allow space between travellers, but Joyce said this wasn\u2019t being considered. \u201cThis idea of the middle seat and the middle seat taking around isn\u2019t social distancing. It\u2019s a 60cm difference between two people. To get the full metre squared, you will end up with 22 people on an aircraft of 180 seats and the airfares are nine to 10 times as much.\u201d However, epidemiologist has slammed the decision not to make mask wear compulsory, saying it \u201cfails the test of logic\u201d. You can read the full report below. [continued from previous post] The statement continued: The number of women in Australia who have died at the hands of a current or former partner persists without any significant reduction since 2010. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare noted that one in 6 women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or previous partner since the age of 15. One woman was killed every nine days and one man every 29 days by a partner between 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed additional dangers for the victims of domestic violence, with a dramatic increase in demand for services. Eleven women have been killed in domestic violence incidents since lockdown was implemented in early March. The Law Council has welcomed the government\u2019s announcement of $20 million earmarked to support people affected by domestic violence as well the Help is Here campaign, and the rolling out of extra measures to ensure people experiencing domestic, family and sexual violence know where to get help during the coronavirus pandemic. But a valuable opportunity to examine and improve the programs that are working well to support and protect the vulnerable members of society, has been lost. Chronic underfunding of the family law system by successive governments over many years, continues to leave vulnerable families in crisis. The Law Council of Australia has been absolutely scathing in its assessment of a bipartisan Senate committee inquiry into domestic violence in Australia. Before the pandemic hit, the deaths of Hannah Clarke with her three children, Trey, Aaliyah and Laianah in February brought the nation to a standstill. The parliament responded with another committee \u2013 there have been many, many inquiries over the years into domestic violence in Australia, but this one was supposed to carry all that work forward. The Law Council president, Pauline Wright, says it failed: The Law Council of Australia is appalled at the lack of commitment shown by the majority report of the bipartisan Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee in tackling domestic violence. The release of the committee\u2019s majority report Inquiry into domestic violence with particular regard to violence against women and their children represents a sad failure of regard for the lives of those Australians lost to domestic violence, and those who will be in danger in the future. The Law Council commends senator Rex Patrick on the substance of his dissenting report and for calling out the failings of the committee in meeting its responsibilities, both as a committee of the parliament and to the people of Australia. The majority report was delivered three months ahead of schedule, without the committee accepting submissions or holding public hearings. As a result, the report amounts to little more than a literature review, posing a number of obvious and often stated questions. This demonstrates a lack of commitment by decision-makers to address a serious community problem and a significant cause of death in Australia. NSW reported four new cases of coronavirus from more than 7,000 tests in the last 24 hours. All four people who were diagnosed with Covid had recently returned from overseas travel and were in quarantine. NSW never closed its borders (neither did Victoria) unlike the rest of the nation. But it did restrict travel within the state. That was loosened, slightly, when the definition of care allowed for travel to a family or friend\u2019s house. The 1 June announcement now means you don\u2019t need a reason to travel throughout the state, and can once again, book a holiday spot. It might just take a little more planning: Gladys Berejiklian: So whilst it\u2019s good news, please treat the good news with caution, be extra organised, plan ahead, book ahead, do things online, as far as possible, make sure that you are \u2013 you keep your family safe and those around you safe. Whilst it\u2019s great news for people across the state, and of course, New South Wales is always open to welcome people from other states. We intend to keep our borders open. We think that\u2019s best for New South Wales but also best for Australia. We\u2019ll play our part as the largest state, traditionally the economic powerhouse of the nation, to make sure we engage as much economic activity as possible. We don\u2019t want to see job numbers to crash as they did in April. We want people to be realistic, a Covid-safe environment will look and feel very different. The NSW premier says it is time to reopen the state: We\u2019re pleased to say from 1 June, there will be no travel restrictions in New South Wales. You can go on a holiday with your family and friends, but know the holiday you\u2019re taking from 1 June will be different to a holiday you have taken before. Please take extra care in planning ahead, booking online, and making sure you keep away from large crowds, and protect your friends and your family as you are holidaying. We want people to enjoy themselves, to feel free, but nothing we do is the same during a pandemic. You need to book ahead, think about opportunities to enjoy the environment in a different way, but please make sure you\u2019re safe. From that date, many of our cultural institutions, our art galleries, museums, libraries, will be able to open their doors. But again, they\u2019ll have special qualifications. It may involve having a special time to allow the most vulnerable to use the facilities, it does mean booking ahead, but making sure you leave a record if you are visiting one of places, if something happens unexpectedly, if there\u2019s a case, we can follow up quickly. We want people to enjoy the extra freedom, but it means you need to think ahead and plan ahead, and accept that nothing we did before the pandemic will be quite the same during the pandemic. Josh Taylor, who brought you this story on NSW being unable to use the Covidsafe app for contact tracing: Followed up to see what Victoria was doing. That state only used it on Monday. From their response to Josh: On Monday evening, Victorian Public Health team identified a Covid-19 positive patient who had the Covidsafe app registered on their phone. The patient consented to Victoria using data on their phone which has been downloaded to look for potential contacts. Victoria has signed an agreement on access to information and our public health officials have been trained on how to access and use the close contact information. Access is strictly limited to trained public health officers carrying out contact-tracing functions. Victoria has legislated privacy obligations when handling citizens\u2019 private data or health data and these obligations will be adhered to. With only a small number of cases in Victoria, there have been few opportunities to use the app so far. We hope this continues. We urge Victorians to download the app to augment our contact tracing tools to stop the spread of the virus. This will be increasingly important as restrictions are eased and people are more mobile. Meanwhile, while NSW is going to open itself up to travelers, the rest of the nation, excluding NSW and Victoria, is looking at ways to open its own travel bubble in a post-restrictions world: Katharine Murphy has a story on the latest government vs ABC issue: The Morrison government has put the national broadcaster on notice that it expects the ABC to embark on a six-month wage freeze to bring it in line with other taxpayer-funded agencies during the Covid-19 crisis. The warning follows the government\u2019s decision in early April to defer general wage increases for commonwealth public servants for six months. The public service commissioner followed up that directive by writing to all non-public service agencies \u2013 including the ABC \u2013 informing them the government expected them to adopt the same practice. With no clear response from the ABC to the 9 April missive, Guardian Australia understands the communications minister Paul Fletcher wrote to the national broadcaster this week flagging his expectation that the organisation would defer a 2% increase for all employees scheduled to take effect in October under the ABC\u2019s enterprise agreement. The Fletcher letter to the ABC\u2019s managing director David Anderson notes the Covid-19 pandemic has again threatened the viability of Australian media organisations, with some commercial companies requiring their staff to take pay cuts of more than 20%. Marise Payne and Greg Hunt have issued a joint statement welcoming the World Health Assembly\u2019s support of the EU\u2019s motion, co-sponsored by member states, including Australia and China, to hold an independent investigation (spearheaded by the WHO) into the origins and response to the coronavirus pandemic. It includes a little \u201cwe won\u2019t back down or apologise\u201d message to Beijing at the end, with a line you just know was diplomatically worked shopped into the early hours: The Australian government today welcomes the adoption of a landmark resolution on the global Covid-19 response at the 73rd session of the World Health Assembly, which was EU-led and cosponsored by over 130 WHO member states. The resolution commits to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation into Covid-19, at the earliest appropriate moment, to review the lessons learned from the international health response coordinated by the World Health Organisation (WHO). There is also a clear mandate to identify the source of the Covid-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans, which will be necessary to prevent and reduce the risks of the emergence of new diseases that pass from animals to humans. Australia has been clear and transparent in calling for an independent review into Covid-19, which is an unprecedented global health and economic crisis. Australia will continue to be a consistent and constructive voice in the international community to advance and protect our national interest and the global interest. Greg Hunt has also announced a further $400m in funding for medical research: A total of 237 new projects will receive funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), with a further 30 grants to be funded through the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) Priority Round. Funding will support research in the areas of: \u00b7 Cancer: $87.1m \u00b7 Cardiovascular disease: $46.5m \u00b7 Mental health: $54m \u00b7 Indigenous: $19.4m \u00b7 Infectious diseases: $84.7m Paul Fletcher, who looks after the arts, as well as communications (given the arts have been left out of so many government assistance programs, I thought you might need a reminder), has announced a $1.7m regional touring program. It is broken into three categories: Playing Australia $1,167,654 in funding will support 10 organisations to tour across all states and territories, including 84 regional and rural locations. Successful initiatives include Hit Production\u2019s Isaiah Live, Regional Arts Victoria\u2019s double bill Stardust and The Mission, and the Australian Theatre for Young People\u2019s Follow Me Home. Contemporary Music Touring Program $335,389 will fund 17 groups of artists to perform at metropolitan and regional locations across the country, including more than 110 regional and remote towns, featuring country, folk, Indigenous, jazz, pop, rock and children\u2019s music. Funding recipients include Tralala Blip\u2019s Eat My Codes If Your Light Falls Tour, a differently abled electronic pop band from northern NSW who will tour to locations including Wagga Wagga, Bermagui and Gunnedah. Contemporary Touring Initiative $257,861 in funding will provide three contemporary visual artists the opportunity to tour their exhibitions to 17 regional centres as well as cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart. The funding will enable the Museum and Galleries NSW\u2019s Centre of the Centre, a major new commission by internationally recognised Australian artist Mel O\u2019Callaghan, to visit nine galleries and art centres across five states from 2021-23. Not coronavirus related, but timely \u2013 the Association of Market and Social Research Organisations, or Amsro, has released an interim discussion paper into what went wrong with polling at the last election. It has made 23 recommendations for polling companies, ahead of its final report in October. They are mostly about sample size, and transparency, but you can find them all here. What does an independent inquiry, set up by the World Health Organisation, which Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne last month said was the last thing Australia wanted, as it would resemble a \u201cpoacher and gamekeeper situation\u201d? Well, at \u201cthe appropriate time\u201d the WHO will set up an inquiry, forming a team from the member states, who will carry out the investigation. The \u201cappropriate time\u201d will be when the pandemic is over. That was China\u2019s main, public contribution, to the debate. Gladys Berejiklian is getting serious about restarting tourism. After telling her state colleagues \u2013 mainly Queensland \u2013 that it was time to reopen the borders again, and for now, being ignored, the New South Wales premier has announced she\u2019ll be opening up her own state for travel from 1 June. As AAP reports: New South Wales residents will be able to head to the state\u2019s regions for holidays in less than a fortnight under a relaxation of Covid-19 travel restrictions. Recreational regional travel within the state will be allowed again from 1 June, according to multiple media reports. Under current NSW public health orders, regional travel for holidays is banned. Queensland has flagged border closures with southern states could remain until at least September due to the coronavirus pandemic, prompting despair from tourism groups. \u201cEven if some states don\u2019t let us travel there we\u2019ll invite the other states here,\u201d Berejiklian told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIf people are spending their dollars locally that has huge opportunities for us. The key is keeping people in jobs.\u201d The announcement will be confirmed by Berejiklian at her 8am press conference this morning, which we\u2019ll bring you live. The EU motion at the World Health Assembly, to investigate the origins and response to the coronavirus pandemic, passed overnight without incident. It will be enacted at \u201cthe appropriate time\u201d, which was the key phrase in getting the motion up. That phrase got China on board with co-sponsoring the move, which, even if it was last minute, took down quite a few diplomatic barriers. We\u2019ll bring you all the day\u2019s reactions and more as we continue our coronavirus coverage. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As part of the deal the cost will rise to \u00a315 from 22 June.

There are also concerns surrounding player welfare despite a provisional agreement that at-risk employees, or anyone with vulnerable family members, can sit out matches if they wish.</p> <p>With Premiership club owners discussing whether to proceed with plans to restart the league behind closed doors in early July, the Rugby Players\u2019 Association\u2019s chief executive Damian Hopley said many of his members are worried about their own futures and the wider outlook for their sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on calls to some clubs where there is a very genuine concern the club might not last the year based on the current financial projections,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/19/who-will-get-a-kick-out-of-champions-cup-silence-when-rugby-returns\">Who will get a kick out of Champions Cup silence when rugby returns? | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cJob security has to be the No 1 concern. We\u2019ve been talking to players up and down the country and some clubs are in a far more stable financial position than others. We don\u2019t want to have a sport where there are only six clubs left at Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>With some owners desperate to slash costs and others lobbying for the salary cap and marquee player allowance to remain at existing levels, there is concern in dressing-rooms that divisions and contrasting priorities could make it harder to reach a clear consensus. \u201cWithin the investor group there is a difference of opinion as to the future direction of travel,\u201d Hopley said. \u201cFrom the players\u2019 perspective there has to be alignment about what they want to do.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had one club owner come out and say he wants to retain the salary cap, we\u2019ve got others who want to reduce it quite significantly. If the financial problems in rugby are the end product of a sausage-waving contest, the players shouldn\u2019t be responsible for that. We\u2019ve got this extraordinary scenario where the top players are earning stratospheric money and the squeezed middle are getting contract renewals at 20-30% below what they\u2019re currently on. We need to have some very robust and transparent discussions with the league about where to go from here.\u201d</p> <p>Players at the majority of Premiership clubs have been required to take wage cuts until training or matches resume but the arrangements have varied from team to team. While Hopley believes his members \u201chave to be credited massively\u201d for trying to help out in a crisis, it would appear further significant wage reductions will be contested.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone recognises that the world is a very different place to three months ago but the most important thing a player has is his contract,\u201d Hopley said. \u201cAny suggested changes need to be done properly and a robust process followed. There also needs to be real leadership around formulating a plan for the next five years that everyone can buy into.

      "bodyText": "Premiership players are calling for clearer leadership from rugby\u2019s top administrators amid fears some clubs could go bust by Christmas, prompting widespread job losses. There are also concerns surrounding player welfare despite a provisional agreement that at-risk employees, or anyone with vulnerable family members, can sit out matches if they wish. With Premiership club owners discussing whether to proceed with plans to restart the league behind closed doors in early July, the Rugby Players\u2019 Association\u2019s chief executive Damian Hopley said many of his members are worried about their own futures and the wider outlook for their sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on calls to some clubs where there is a very genuine concern the club might not last the year based on the current financial projections,\u201d he said. \u201cJob security has to be the No 1 concern. We\u2019ve been talking to players up and down the country and some clubs are in a far more stable financial position than others. We don\u2019t want to have a sport where there are only six clubs left at Christmas.\u201d With some owners desperate to slash costs and others lobbying for the salary cap and marquee player allowance to remain at existing levels, there is concern in dressing-rooms that divisions and contrasting priorities could make it harder to reach a clear consensus. \u201cWithin the investor group there is a difference of opinion as to the future direction of travel,\u201d Hopley said. \u201cFrom the players\u2019 perspective there has to be alignment about what they want to do. \u201cWe\u2019ve had one club owner come out and say he wants to retain the salary cap, we\u2019ve got others who want to reduce it quite significantly. If the financial problems in rugby are the end product of a sausage-waving contest, the players shouldn\u2019t be responsible for that. We\u2019ve got this extraordinary scenario where the top players are earning stratospheric money and the squeezed middle are getting contract renewals at 20-30% below what they\u2019re currently on. We need to have some very robust and transparent discussions with the league about where to go from here.\u201d Players at the majority of Premiership clubs have been required to take wage cuts until training or matches resume but the arrangements have varied from team to team. While Hopley believes his members \u201chave to be credited massively\u201d for trying to help out in a crisis, it would appear further significant wage reductions will be contested. \u201cEveryone recognises that the world is a very different place to three months ago but the most important thing a player has is his contract,\u201d Hopley said. \u201cAny suggested changes need to be done properly and a robust process followed. There also needs to be real leadership around formulating a plan for the next five years that everyone can buy into. It is absolutely essential just to restore some of the credibility that rugby has undoubtedly lost in the last six months.\u201d A collective bargaining agreement would be the RPA\u2019s preferred long-term option but navigating the crisis remains the union\u2019s overriding priority. \u201cThese are young men and women with a very limited career span who have to optimise their earnings while they can,\u201d Hopley said. \u201cWe have to find a solution and, for the RPA, that\u2019s retaining as many jobs as possible in the Premiership, protecting their contracts as much as possible and, ultimately, keeping rugby clubs in business.

Hopley added: \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is that the players have confidence in their training facilities and don\u2019t feel they\u2019re being put into a difficult position. \u201cThe fear we have of someone contracting the virus and, worst-case scenario, passing it on to a vulnerable family member \u2013 with all the human issues and potential liability that go with that \u2013 is front and centre.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, The White House has backed up Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he is taking a daily dose of hydroxychloroquine to protect himself against the coronavirus. The FDA has warned against using the anti-malarial drug for such a purpose, saying it could cause heart problems, but the president\u2019s official physician, Sean Conley, wrote a memo stating that, following discussions with the president, they concluded that the \u201cpotential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks\u201d. On Tuesday Trump said he was considering imposing a ban on travel to the US from Brazil, which endured its biggest daily Covid-19 death toll so far. The US remains the country with by far the largest number of confirmed cases, a statistic the president described as a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d: You know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else. It\u2019s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done. Do the drugs work? Peter Beaumont weighs up the risks and supposed \u2013 though unproven \u2013 benefits of taking hydroxychloroquine. New York\u2019s contact tracing plan will be harder than it sounds Contact tracing is a key pillar of New York\u2019s strategy for safely reopening after lockdown, and the state is busy recruiting thousands for its new test and trace corps. But experts say pulling off the plan in a densely packed city of 8.6 million people will be a major challenge. As the former CDC director Tom Frieden, who is now working on New York state\u2019s contact tracing effort, tells Miranda Bryant: \u201cAll the things that we love about New York City \u2026 make it more susceptible and more challenging to do contact tracing.\u201d Across the country in California, a first-in-the-nation plan to offer $125m in coronavirus relief to undocumented workers has got off to a chaotic start, with the website crashing and phone lines overwhelmed. Meanwhile, more than 3,200 of the state\u2019s prison inmates have contracted Covid-19, with their families and other advocates saying they fear mass fatalities. Elsewhere in the US \u2026 Officials in Detroit say they have restored residents\u2019 water supply to allow for basic hygiene amid the pandemic, but some families claim they are still cut off from clean running water. Thousands of visitors have flocked to Yellowstone national park after it reopened on Monday, while a new report has found that millions of Americans lack access to quality green spaces. People with type 1 diabetes face a higher risk from Covid-19 People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to die of Covid-19 than those with type 2, according to figures from the UK\u2019s National Health Service. The NHS study found that almost a third of all the coronavirus deaths in English hospitals were associated with diabetes, and that those with type 1 diabetes were three and a half times more likely to die if they caught Covid-19 than non-diabetics. The coronavirus crisis won\u2019t slow down climate change The world\u2019s daily carbon dioxide emissions have dropped more dramatically during the global coronavirus lockdowns than at any other moment since records began \u2013 a fall of more than 17% by early April compared with last year. But experts say the temporary hiatus from fossil fuel consumption will likely make little difference to the world\u2019s ability to stave off catastrophic levels of global heating. Renewable energy growth is slowing. The pandemic has not just curtailed fossil fuel consumption, it has also caused a slowdown in the growth of clean energy, according to the International Energy Agency. In other news \u2026 The plaintiff in Roe v Wade says her later anti-abortion stance was \u2018all an act\u2019. Norma McCorvey, known as Jane Roe for the landmark 1973 supreme court case, made the confession shortly before her death in 2017, saying she had been paid by conservative groups to come out against abortion in the 1990s. Palestine is ending its security cooperation with the US and Israel. The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, made the declaration on Tuesday, citing the imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank. A top Nasa official has quit days before a historic space mission. Doug Loverro, the agency\u2019s human spaceflight chief, reportedly resigned over a breach of procurement rules \u2013 just as two astronauts prepare to head for space from US soil for the first time since the space shuttle programme ended in 2011. Singapore sentenced a man to death via Zoom. Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, faces capital punishment for his role in a 2011 drug deal, in the city-state\u2019s first case in which such a sentence has been delivered remotely. Great reads Social Distance: a graphic short story by Mark Haddon The award-winning author has been inspired by the lockdown to write this affecting short story about solitude, accompanied by his own distinctive illustrations.

There\u2019s something disturbing about Cuomo being hailed as the hero of the pandemic when he should rightly be one of the villains.

      "body": "<p>Rolls-Royce is to cut 9,000 jobs, almost a fifth of its workforce, as the coronavirus crisis takes its toll on the aviation industry.</p> <p>The jet engine manufacturer said it was targeting \u00a31.3bn in annual cost savings to weather the protracted downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that has grounded much of the world\u2019s airlines. Head count cuts will account for about half the savings target.</p> <p>Derby-based Rolls-Royce, which employs 52,000 staff globally, said the job losses would be felt worst in its civil aerospace business, with about 8,000 of the 9,000 roles being made redundant coming from that division. The company also makes fighter jet and ship engines as well as reactors for nuclear submarines, but it said there would be no job losses at its defence business.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, Warren East, indicated that the UK would be heavily affected. The group\u2019s civil aerospace division employs almost 16,000 people in the UK.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that of our civil aerospace business, approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that\u2019s probably a good first proxy.\u201d</p> <p>In total, Rolls-Royce employs 23,700 staff in the UK, where nine of its approximately 17 main manufacturing locations are based.

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is to cut 9,000 jobs, almost a fifth of its workforce, as the coronavirus crisis takes its toll on the aviation industry. The jet engine manufacturer said it was targeting \u00a31.3bn in annual cost savings to weather the protracted downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that has grounded much of the world\u2019s airlines. Head count cuts will account for about half the savings target. Derby-based Rolls-Royce, which employs 52,000 staff globally, said the job losses would be felt worst in its civil aerospace business, with about 8,000 of the 9,000 roles being made redundant coming from that division. The company also makes fighter jet and ship engines as well as reactors for nuclear submarines, but it said there would be no job losses at its defence business. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, Warren East, indicated that the UK would be heavily affected. The group\u2019s civil aerospace division employs almost 16,000 people in the UK. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that of our civil aerospace business, approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that\u2019s probably a good first proxy.\u201d In total, Rolls-Royce employs 23,700 staff in the UK, where nine of its approximately 17 main manufacturing locations are based. The company has a presence in over 50 countries around the world. \u201cThis isn\u2019t only going to be a UK phenomenon,\u201d said East, referring to the cuts programme. The company has currently furloughed 4,000 UK staff, which East said was only a short-term measure to save cash this year. East said the aim was to make \u201cmore than half\u201d the job cuts this year. \u201cWe need to get on with it because we know it is a harsh reality about our future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to make a very good start on this in 2020, more than half at any rate.\u201d East said he expected new aeroplane engine production to be about a third less than last year, and it would take several years to fully recover, in line with demand from aeroplane producers. The International Air Transport Association does not expect air travel to recover to 2019 levels until 2023, which will affect demand for airline tickets, plane orders and the engines that Rolls-Royce makes for those jets. A key proportion of Rolls-Royce\u2019s civil aerospace profits comes from aircraft owners paying regular engine service fees to the company. A global grounding of airline fleets has hit those revenues significantly. Pre-lockdown, Rolls-Royce engines carried millions of airline passengers around the world every week. The company makes engines for the Airbus A330, A340, A350 and A380 jets, as well as the Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliner. \u201cGovernments across the world are doing what they can to assist businesses in the short term, but we must respond to market conditions for the medium term until the world of aviation is flying again at scale,\u201d said East. \u201cGovernments cannot replace sustainable customer demand that is simply not there.\u201d When asked about what the government would do to help Rolls-Royce employees, the British justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said: \u201cClearly we will have to go to work with the employer to look at the options. \u201cAll of us will be looking not just at Rolls-Royce but at the whole sector and the implications of this for the supply chains as well, let\u2019s not forget them, to make sure we are doing everything we can in terms of plans and action to support what is a very high skilled part of our economy,\u201d East indicated that the company could also turn to the government\u2019s taxpayer-backed Covid corporate financing facility, which lets big companies borrow up to \u00a31bn. \u201cWe will discuss that with the government,\u201d said East. \u201cIn reality it would be a relatively small amount of funding.\u201d Rolls-Royce said its defence business, based in the UK and US, had been robust during the pandemic and would be unaffected by the cuts programme. \u201cThe world on the other side of this pandemic will need the power that we generate to fuel economic recovery,\u201d said East. \u201cWe are one of a very small number of companies that can do what we do.\u201d",

It has kept six million people in work, and backfilled seven and a half million jobs. Without it, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e2c0615-f2af-4885-a9bf-78deeb94bc80\">one in three businesses</a> say they would have had to lay off staff; and many workers would have felt compelled to try to continue to work, despite public health guidance requiring them not to.</p> <p>No one imagines that the scheme can continue in its present form indefinitely. While a worthwhile investment to support the economy and ensure millions aren\u2019t without a wage, it is a very costly scheme. It is also inflexible, requiring workers to completely remove themselves from work. And the \u201cmissing\u201d 20% of earnings for those who have been furloughed has pushed many below even the minimum wage.</p> <p>So the question is not whether the furlough scheme should change, but what that change should look like \u2013 especially in a context where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/britain-is-at-risk-of-returning-to-80s-levels-of-unemployment\">unemployment is heading up to at least 9%</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor has been slow to take decisions in this area. Since the beginning of the scheme, we have urged him to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-rescue-plan-labour-britain-economy\"> allow part-time working</a> \u2013 but now learn that this will not be introduced until the start of August. This sets the UK scheme apart from those in continental Europe, which allow part-time working.</p> <p>Briefings to the press suggest that from the beginning of August, those covered by the scheme will need to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">their employer contribute 40% of their previous wage</a>, or support will be discontinued. If these rumours are correct, this again sets the UK\u2019s scheme apart from other countries, where support has often been linked to the lifting of the lockdown.</p> <p>The practical impact of a uniform employer contribution, in the absence of other forms of support for different sectors, is clear. By the time we get to 1 August, social distancing requirements may still be in place. While it is possible that some restaurants, for example, may be opening by then, they may well need to operate substantially under capacity in order to enforce social distancing. This could mean that the employer could not afford a 40% contribution, and would be forced to lay off staff. And as another example, many manufacturers may still have heavily disrupted supply chains, either in the UK or beyond, by then \u2013 again, preventing them from generating revenue sufficient to pay a 40% contribution. The implications are also clear for those staff who are furloughed because they are shielding for medical reasons, whose employers may no longer wish to support them.</p> <p>Adopting an identikit approach to all workers and all businesses from August neglects these challenges. Above all, it risks creating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/britain-is-at-risk-of-returning-to-80s-levels-of-unemployment\">second, massive wave of unemployment</a>, at a time when the jobs market will be unable to absorb it. This is particularly the case given that jobs in hospitality, catering and tourism are often one of the first routes out of unemployment, especially for the young.</p> <p>A more differentiated approach would, admittedly, pose challenges for the government. Hard choices would need to be made, including how to deal with difficult boundary issues between sectors, timing problems in relation to changes in social distancing, and more conditionality on the scheme to ensure it genuinely support\u200bs employment.</p> <p>However, these political and administrative difficulties are just that \u2013 political and administrative. A far less tractable kind of difficulty would be how to aid those who might become long-term unemployed. \u200b</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/rwss/docs/2011/chapter2.pdf\">Studies following the previous recession</a> in the US indicated how those who became unemployed following the global financial crisis saw their future earnings permanently hampered as a result. The government has perhaps become blas\u00e9 about the impact of unemployment in the UK, given its comparatively low levels recently. However, it\u2019s arguable that a decade of sluggish growth in wages, coupled with above-average inflation, helped insulate us from unemployment \u2013 conditions that are unlikely to persist in this form into the future.</p> <p>Failing to engage with redesigning the furlough scheme, and opting instead for administratively \u201ceasy\u201d options, could leave our country with much higher unemployment, with all the human and economic costs that implies. These hard times require our government to be willing to face up to hard choices, and to show the courage to govern in the country\u2019s long-term interest.</p> <p>\u2022 Anneliese Dodds is the shadow chancellor of the exchequer</p>",

The implications are also clear for those staff who are furloughed because they are shielding for medical reasons, whose employers may no longer wish to support them. Adopting an identikit approach to all workers and all businesses from August neglects these challenges. Above all, it risks creating a second, massive wave of unemployment, at a time when the jobs market will be unable to absorb it. This is particularly the case given that jobs in hospitality, catering and tourism are often one of the first routes out of unemployment, especially for the young. A more differentiated approach would, admittedly, pose challenges for the government. Hard choices would need to be made, including how to deal with difficult boundary issues between sectors, timing problems in relation to changes in social distancing, and more conditionality on the scheme to ensure it genuinely supports employment. However, these political and administrative difficulties are just that \u2013 political and administrative. A far less tractable kind of difficulty would be how to aid those who might become long-term unemployed. Studies following the previous recession in the US indicated how those who became unemployed following the global financial crisis saw their future earnings permanently hampered as a result. The government has perhaps become blas\u00e9 about the impact of unemployment in the UK, given its comparatively low levels recently. However, it\u2019s arguable that a decade of sluggish growth in wages, coupled with above-average inflation, helped insulate us from unemployment \u2013 conditions that are unlikely to persist in this form into the future. Failing to engage with redesigning the furlough scheme, and opting instead for administratively \u201ceasy\u201d options, could leave our country with much higher unemployment, with all the human and economic costs that implies. These hard times require our government to be willing to face up to hard choices, and to show the courage to govern in the country\u2019s long-term interest. \u2022 Anneliese Dodds is the shadow chancellor of the exchequer",

The winding queue is a sign of the desperation that has gripped the populous township of Chitungwiza, on the outskirts of Harare, since Zimbabwe enforced national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, which has seen 46 cases and four deaths. The queues have become a common sight in Seke Unit A, where Murozoki prepares porridge in the mornings for children and supper later in the day for hungry families. With a makeshift stove, a couple of large pots and a few cooking utensils, the mother of two has been winning the respect of thousands who pass by her kitchen daily and is gathering volunteers who help her keep track of the children.

In urban areas, 2.2 million people are in urgent need of food aid as many struggle to put enough on the table. Government lockdown relief of US$4 per family is yet to be distributed at a time vulnerable families are failing to earn a living amid skyrocketing inflation. As more urban Zimbabweans go hungry every day, Murozoki sees herself feeding more people, especially during lockdown. \u201cEven if the lockdown is lifted, I might continue for a month or so until everyone gets back on their feet.

Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has thus far taken a far more traditional approach, with an app and organizing events that point more to the list-building approach common among federal and statewide campaigns. It allows for voters that aren\u2019t necessarily hardcore Democrats or Biden supporters.</p> <p>In a campaign where door-to-door knocking is limited because of the coronavirus, strategists are having to explore new online ways of rallying voters and collecting information on potential supporters.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t want you to knock on their door any more. Digital does that now. They haven\u2019t wanted to go to events. Only old people want to go to events. Well, you\u2019ve seen digital solve all that with Zoom. You\u2019ve seen digital solve that with an app,\u201d said Republican strategist Jim McIntosh. \u201cCoronavirus has sped up the natural cycle of things.

You\u2019re on our team. You\u2019re with us,\u2019\u201d said Democratic digital strategist Stefan Smith, former online engagement director for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cSo you become this sort of under-siege political minority \u2026 because that\u2019s the language they\u2019re using, even though they\u2019re winning.

Both campaign apps offer updated lists of events, but the Trump campaign app also offers other ways to help it. You can help registering voters, become \u201ca bundler\u201d for fundraising, \u201cHost a Maga meet-up\u201d, join the campaign\u2019s election day team, or \u201cBecome a Trump team leader\u201d. There\u2019s also a point system on the app for rewards.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about energizing the base and getting more out of the same people,\u201d said Republican strategist and ad maker Will Ritter.</p> <p>For the Biden campaign app, there are standard links to make calls, send texts, volunteer and donate, and a list of campaign events. But there is no point system. And the variety of ways to engage with the campaign is smaller.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar situation with supporter events online. Both campaigns send out fundraising and supporter emails. Both campaigns have migrated mostly to holding events online with surrogates. For Biden, it\u2019s often himself and other elected officials or leaders of various wings of the Democratic party; for Trump, it\u2019s minor icons within the larger Trump movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb/0_113_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden in San Diego last year.

      "body": "<p>Andrew Cuomo may be the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/politics/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-poll/index.html\">most popular politician</a> in the country. His approval ratings have hit <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/04/27/cuomos-response-covid-19-gives-him-highest-approval-rating-siena-poll/3030888001/\">all-time highs</a> thanks to his Covid-19 response. Some Democrats have discussed him as a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/10/democrats-want-to-drop-joe-biden-for-andrew-cuomo-poll-finds/\">possible replacement</a> for Joe Biden, due to Biden\u2019s perceived weakness as a nominee. And there have even been some <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/personality/personality/glorification-andrew-cuomo.html\">unfortunate tributes to Cuomo\u2019s alleged sex appeal</a>.</p> <p>All of which is bizarre, because Cuomo should be one of the most loathed officials in America right now. ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/two-coasts-one-virus-how-new-york-suffered-nearly-10-times-the-number-of-deaths-as-california\">recently released a report outlining catastrophic missteps</a> by Cuomo and the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, which probably resulted in many thousands of needless coronavirus cases. ProPublica offers some appalling numbers contrasting what happened in New York with the outbreak in California. By mid-May, New York City alone had almost 20,000 deaths, while in San Francisco there had been only 35, and New York state as a whole suffered 10 times as many deaths as California.</p> <p>Federal failures played a role, of course, but this tragedy was absolutely due, in part, to decisions by the governor. Cuomo initially \u201creacted to De Blasio\u2019s idea for closing down New York City with derision\u201d, saying it \u201cwas dangerous\u201d and \u201cserved only to scare people\u201d. He said the \u201cseasonal flu was a graver worry\u201d. A spokesperson for Cuomo \u201crefused to say if the governor had ever read the state\u2019s pandemic plan\u201d. Later, Cuomo would blame the press, including the New York Times for failing to say \u201cBe careful, there\u2019s a virus in China that may be in the United States?\u201d even though the Times wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgearangure/status/1255180205678886919\">nearly 500 stories</a> on the virus before the state acted. Experts told ProPublica that \u201chad New York imposed its extreme social distancing measures a week or two earlier, the death toll might have been cut by half or more\u201d.</p> <p>But delay was not the only screw-up. Elderly prisoners <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-new-york-medical-parole-20200507-i7tr6ginbnfupizijzp5lmykjm-story.html\">have died</a> of coronavirus because New York has failed to act on their medical parole requests. As Business Insider documented:</p> <p><em>\u201cTesting was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/slow-start-for-rapid-coronavirus-tests-frustrates-states-11586597401\">slow</a>. Nonprofit social-service agencies that serve the most vulnerable <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-coronavirus-social-services-covid19-federal-support-bailout-2020-3\">couldn\u2019t get answers either</a>. And medical experts like the former CDC director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1247184873615433729\">Tom Frieden</a> said \u2018so many deaths could have been prevented\u2019 had New York issued its stay-at-home order just \u2018days earlier\u2019 than it did. On March 19, when New York\u2019s schools had already been closed, Cuomo said \u2018in many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.\u2019\u201d</em></p> <p>The governor has failed to take responsibility for the obvious failures, consistently blaming others and at one point even saying \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-bugle-coronavirus.html\">governors don\u2019t do pandemics</a>\u201d. (Actually, some governors just don\u2019t read their state\u2019s pandemic plans.) But much of the press has ignored this, focusing instead on Cuomo\u2019s aesthetic presentation: his poise during press conferences, his dramatic statements about \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d (even when he obviously hasn\u2019t), and his invisible good looks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cuomo\u2019s record was shameful long before coronavirus began</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/04/29/andrew-cuomo-new-york-mural-donated-masks-ny-then-social-media-weighed/3048534001/\">mask mural</a> is yet another publicity stunt mistaken by the press as a sign of leadership. On 29 April, Cuomo unveiled a wall of handmade cloth masks that had been sent to his office by concerned citizens all over America. He called it \u201ca self-portrait of America. You know what that spells? It spells love.\u201d Since the arrangement of masks doesn\u2019t form words, the mural doesn\u2019t actually spell anything, but it is a perfect symbol of Cuomo\u2019s leadership failures. Handmade cloth face coverings are not as effective as N95 masks, of course, but if unsuitable for healthcare workers they would still have been perfectly appropriate to distribute to New Yorkers (some of whom have been brutally <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mom-arrested-after-confrontation-with-nypd-officers-over-face-mask/2416440/\">arrested</a> for not wearing masks). But Cuomo, rather than putting the needs of New Yorkers first, chose to tack hundreds of cloth masks on a wall as a monument to himself.</p> <p>Cuomo\u2019s record was shameful long before coronavirus began. He enabled the IDC (Independent Democratic Conference), a group of conservative Democratic state lawmakers, in allying with the Republican minority to block progressive legislation. (Cuomo denies any role in the IDC, but <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/05/another-cuomo-noninterference-story-falls-apart-049022\">that stretches credulity</a>.) Before the pandemic, he pushed through <a href=\"https://www.uticaod.com/news/20190310/hospitals-warn-against-cuomos-proposed-medicaid-cuts\">Medicaid cuts</a> which shut down necessary hospital space in the name of \u201cefficiency\u201d despite the warnings of medical professionals. And on 3 April, as 3,000 New Yorkers already lay dead from the virus and hospitals like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-elmhurst-queens.html\">Elmhurst</a> in Queens were overwhelmed with cases, Cuomo forced through further Medicaid cuts, slashing <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/budget/medicaid-cuts-make-state-budget-some-tweaks.html\">$400m</a> from hospital budgets.</p> <p>As the state now staggers to its feet, Cuomo has partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/05/06/cuomo-questions-why-school-buildings-still-exist-says-new-york-will-work-with-bill-gates-reimagine-education/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to \u201creimagine education\u201d (which almost certainly means <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/schools/2020/05/critics-slam-gov-cuomos-plan-to-reimagine-schools-with-bill-gates-foundation.html\">privatization</a>), and with the ex-Google chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Eric Schmidt</a> to \u2013 as Naomi Klein puts it \u2013 \u201cpermanently integrat[e] technology into every aspect of civic life\u201d. All of this has happened without the democratic input of New Yorkers, who would likely prefer that the progressive legislators they elected could govern without interference, that their hospitals have enough money to function and that billionaires don\u2019t infiltrate and control every element of civic life.</p> <p>There\u2019s something disturbing about Cuomo being hailed as the hero of the pandemic when he should rightly be one of the villains. As Business Insider notes, he is now only able to attain praise for his actions because his earlier failures made those actions necessary. He\u2019s lauded for addressing a problem that he himself partly caused. Of course, part of this is because Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/04/notes-on-a-nightmare-4-the-criminality-of-donald-trump\">bungled the coronavirus response even more badly</a>, so that Cuomo \u2013 by not being a complete buffoon \u2013 looks like a capable statesman by contrast. But this is the problem: for too long, Democrats have measured their politicians by \u201cwhether they are better than Republicans\u201d. This sets the bar very low indeed, and means that Democrats end up settling for incompetent and amoral leaders who betray progressive values again and again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lyta Gold is the managing editor and amusements editor of Current Affairs.

The continued water shutoffs are causing fear and pain in a community with one of the highest rates of Covid-19 deaths, the majority being African American. \u201cCommon sense says it is racism,\u201d said Bouier, noting that most of those who have had their water shut off are black and poor. The fatality rate of Covid-19 in Michigan is 7% of confirmed cases, but while African Americans make up only 14% of the state\u2019s population, they make up 40% of the state\u2019s deaths. The city of Detroit has a bad record when it comes to accessing clean running water, with historic problems over lead poisoning, too. In 2017, it was found that 9% of children in Detroit tested positive for lead poisoning, higher than in Flint \u2013 including one zip code where 22% of children were found to have lead poisoning. Asked what state of mind her clients are in, Bouier said: \u201cThey are terrified. They are in such panic and in a state of despair because water is still being shut off in real time.\u201d About the recent extension announcement that the areas with the highest rates of Covid-19 deaths will have shutdown orders extended, Bouier said it is a death sentence. \u201cThe reality is: if you ask people to stay at home without running water, you are conscripting people to die. \u201cIt is such a clear response that\u2019s needed: turn the water on. Keep the water on.\u201d",

UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Wednesday the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with more than 320,000 deaths worldwide. Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo are full. New Zealand PM flags four-day working week New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. High schools open in South Korea South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. WHO assembly passes resolution to investigate global pandemic response Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified changes or lose out on US funding. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The resolution backs the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the pandemic.",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe first thing I asked for was a tour around the island state to visit key places where the virus might make an entry: air and sea ports, the road causeway with its heavily used link to Saudi Arabia, the main prison, public health laboratories and each of the hospital estates, as well as housing projects for migrant workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cTogether with members of the Covid task force that had been set up in early February, I spoke to all those in leadership positions to seek out weaknesses in the chain of epidemic control and to assess the capacity for an effective public health response.</p> \n<p>\u201cAmong other things, we were exploring forensically for weak spots where the virus could get hold, replicate and spread. At this early stage we were able to identify that a lack of testing capacity was an issue, and in mid-February I was able to advise the crown prince, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and the Supreme Health Council to urgently order more supplies and equipment, a recommendation that was immediately acted on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe result is that although Bahrain has a population of under 2 million, the Bahrainis are doing far more testing now per head of population than say, Wales, which has double its population. In practical terms, at Bahrain airport, where screening and triaging of all arriving passengers has been in place for three months, up to 1,000 passengers coming from affected parts of the world, or who might be manifesting early symptoms of infection, have been routinely tested for coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has been followed up by a systematic approach to isolation, quarantine, contact tracing and treatment with a large measure of success.

Fran\u00e7oise Girard, president of the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, said Barsa\u2019s letter was \u201cvery worrisome\u201d. \u201cThreatening to cut funding would be a terrible blow to the WHO and the global health response to Covid-19. It\u2019s the only global agency tasked with [dealing with] pandemic health emergencies. \u201cSo the USAid letter has kind of taken off the mask, which is that ultimately they have been gunning for the WHO for years,\u201d she said. \u201cSexual and reproductive health and rights has been in concept documents for more than 25 years at the UN so to say there is no consensus or agreement is just false.\u201d Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the Global Justice Centre, said the letter was \u201ca disgraceful and dangerous attack on essential health services at the worst possible time\u201d. \u201cNo matter what the US government says, abortion is a fundamental human right and reproductive care is always essential, including during a pandemic. At a time when countless lives are at risk, the US has yet again decided to put its efforts into restricting healthcare instead of expanding it.\u201d She said Guterres should be commended rather than \u201cbullied\u201d by the US administration. Michelle Nunn, the CEO of Care International, said she was dismayed by the letter. \u201cSexual and reproductive health is and has always has been a critical part of any humanitarian response. Lives depend upon it.\u201d The Trump administration has lobbied hard to remove key language around reproductive rights from UN documents and succeeded in April 2019 after threatening to veto a UN security council resolution on ending wartime rape. This story was updated on 21 May 2020 to include a comment from the UN secretary-general\u2019s spokesman.",

HC-One, the UK\u2019s largest care homes company, faced being stripped of its licence to run the Home Farm care home on Skye after a regulator said last week it had \u201cserious and significant concerns\u201d about its management. A sheriff ruled on Tuesday that HC-One could continue running the site until at least 10 June after it reached an agreement with NHS Highlands and other agencies that would minimise disruption and allow management issues to be addressed. The regulator Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (SCSWIS) applied to the court to cancel HC-One\u2019s licence to run Home Farm, in Portree, after 30 residents and 29 staff tested positive for coronavirus. The outbreak led to all affected staff being sent home and their families asked to self-isolate for 14 days, and the army set up a mobile rapid testing centre on Skye to do community-screening. Last Thursday, the Care Inspectorate announced it wanted the courts to strip HC-One of its licence after its inspections uncovered serious problems at the home. The local MSP, Kate Forbes, said she had been told NHS Highland had effectively taken over running the home. Sheriff Eilidh MacDonald, sitting in a virtual court hosted by the Inverness sheriff court, was told by Roddy Dunlop QC, the lawyer for the SCSWIS, that all parties had agreed to avoid \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d of evicting HC-One to minimise disruption.

      "body": "<p>There was a rare moment of relative unity in the UK at the start of April when <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/coronavirus-uk-public-opinion/\">nine out of 10 people</a> said they supported the lockdown. However, as the government seeks to ease the lockdown, a polarised landscape is starting to re-emerge, the fault lines reflecting attitudes toward Brexit. A recent <a href=\"https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oygox62yaw/YouGov%20Covid%20Lockdown%20Results%20May%202020.pdf\">YouGov survey</a> found that 47% of leavers supported the government\u2019s easing of the lockdown compared with 26% of remainers.</p> <p>Remainers and leavers both indicated high levels of support for letting people exercise outside more than once a day, but YouGov found that leavers showed more support than remainers for allowing people to play tennis or golf, visit garden centres, meet one friend, sit and sunbathe in public areas like parks, and encourage people to return to work.</p> <p>Why would support for Brexit correlate with attitudes towards easing the lockdown? One might think this is simply due to confirmation bias. Brexit supporters who backed Boris might be motivated to look out for evidence that their candidate is doing a good job. I suspect, however, the factors driving polarised responses to coronavirus run deeper than that. To understand these factors, it\u2019s helpful to look back on some of the psychological characteristics of people who supported leave or remain.</p> <p>Two of these differences can be explained by what American social psychologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/22/righteous-mind-jonathan-haidt-review\">Jonathan Haidt</a> describes as \u201cthe moral intuitions\u201d, the underlying values that shape how we think about politics. Remainers <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/casp.2386\">placed more emphasis</a> on the value of care and the need to minimise harm, whereas leavers placed more emphasis on the value of personal liberty. When evaluating an action or a policy, remainers would ask \u201cwill this cause harm?\u201d, whereas leavers would be inclined to ask \u201cwill something restrict our<strong> </strong>freedom?\u201d.</p> <p>This emphasis on care/harm versus liberty has quite logical consequences in terms of how opinions divide on easing from the lockdown. The emphasis on care and minimising harm puts the focus on reducing the spread of the disease at all costs. Interestingly, the care/harm reasoning is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116962/\">stronger among women</a>. This might help to explain the gender difference in <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200426/Women-more-concerned-about-COVID-19.aspx\">concern around coronavirus</a>, and why male and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">female leaders</a> have responded differently to the first wave of the virus. We also know that endorsement of liberty is associated with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0256-5\">vaccine hesitancy</a>, so we can expect those who are opposed to further lockdown to also be more likely to oppose a mandatory vaccine.</p> <p>We might disagree with the values underlying people\u2019s political beliefs, but understanding the depth of moral sentiment that shapes these different responses could provide a more effective basis for communication or persuasion. Neglecting to do so risks getting us back to a position where people stop listening to the other side \u2013 not because they don\u2019t have good ideas, but simply because they are in the \u201cother\u201d camp.</p> <p>In other domains where we critically need collective action in order to avert further crisis, a deeper understanding of the moral values underpinning politically polarised positions has resulted in more <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612449177\">persuasive communication</a>. Indeed, American sociologist Robb Willer and colleagues <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/opinion/sunday/progressive-candidates-conservative-values.html\">have argued</a> that the left in particular needs to learn how to better engage with moral intuitions of the right in communications designed to tackle challenges like climate change. A lesson adopted by centre-left leaders like Barack Obama, who framed the investment in renewables as an issue of national security.</p> <p>Finding a policy response that reconciles the tension between concerns for liberty and care was actually at the heart of the original formulation of the idea of a \u201cnudge\u201d. The concept has got something of a bad press after it was associated with herd immunity, so let\u2019s set the record straight, nudge theory has nothing to do with herd immunity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/07/patterns-of-pain-covid-19-psychotherapy-susie-orbach-bodies\">Patterns of pain: what Covid-19 can teach us about how to be human</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chicago University economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein originally developed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)\">concept of nudge</a> as a reconciliation between \u201cpaternalistic\u201d state intervention and the liberty of the individual. One of their key insights is that providing people with information regarding the right thing to do, is often not sufficient to change behaviour. It is sometimes necessary to make structural changes to people\u2019s environments to make the desired behaviour easy. Hospital staff, for example, know that washing their hands is important, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26088769/\">but are still more likely to do so</a> if hand sanitiser is easily available and visible in the hospital.</p> <p>As we explore how to safely restore some personal freedoms while minimising the harm caused by the spread of the virus, we will need people to engage in a range of behaviours, from social distancing to washing their hands, wearing masks, download tracing apps, and (hopefully one day) getting vaccinated.

      "bodyText": "There was a rare moment of relative unity in the UK at the start of April when nine out of 10 people said they supported the lockdown. However, as the government seeks to ease the lockdown, a polarised landscape is starting to re-emerge, the fault lines reflecting attitudes toward Brexit. A recent YouGov survey found that 47% of leavers supported the government\u2019s easing of the lockdown compared with 26% of remainers. Remainers and leavers both indicated high levels of support for letting people exercise outside more than once a day, but YouGov found that leavers showed more support than remainers for allowing people to play tennis or golf, visit garden centres, meet one friend, sit and sunbathe in public areas like parks, and encourage people to return to work. Why would support for Brexit correlate with attitudes towards easing the lockdown? One might think this is simply due to confirmation bias. Brexit supporters who backed Boris might be motivated to look out for evidence that their candidate is doing a good job. I suspect, however, the factors driving polarised responses to coronavirus run deeper than that. To understand these factors, it\u2019s helpful to look back on some of the psychological characteristics of people who supported leave or remain. Two of these differences can be explained by what American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes as \u201cthe moral intuitions\u201d, the underlying values that shape how we think about politics. Remainers placed more emphasis on the value of care and the need to minimise harm, whereas leavers placed more emphasis on the value of personal liberty. When evaluating an action or a policy, remainers would ask \u201cwill this cause harm?\u201d, whereas leavers would be inclined to ask \u201cwill something restrict our freedom?\u201d. This emphasis on care/harm versus liberty has quite logical consequences in terms of how opinions divide on easing from the lockdown. The emphasis on care and minimising harm puts the focus on reducing the spread of the disease at all costs. Interestingly, the care/harm reasoning is stronger among women. This might help to explain the gender difference in concern around coronavirus, and why male and female leaders have responded differently to the first wave of the virus. We also know that endorsement of liberty is associated with vaccine hesitancy, so we can expect those who are opposed to further lockdown to also be more likely to oppose a mandatory vaccine. We might disagree with the values underlying people\u2019s political beliefs, but understanding the depth of moral sentiment that shapes these different responses could provide a more effective basis for communication or persuasion. Neglecting to do so risks getting us back to a position where people stop listening to the other side \u2013 not because they don\u2019t have good ideas, but simply because they are in the \u201cother\u201d camp. In other domains where we critically need collective action in order to avert further crisis, a deeper understanding of the moral values underpinning politically polarised positions has resulted in more persuasive communication. Indeed, American sociologist Robb Willer and colleagues have argued that the left in particular needs to learn how to better engage with moral intuitions of the right in communications designed to tackle challenges like climate change. A lesson adopted by centre-left leaders like Barack Obama, who framed the investment in renewables as an issue of national security. Finding a policy response that reconciles the tension between concerns for liberty and care was actually at the heart of the original formulation of the idea of a \u201cnudge\u201d. The concept has got something of a bad press after it was associated with herd immunity, so let\u2019s set the record straight, nudge theory has nothing to do with herd immunity. Chicago University economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein originally developed the concept of nudge as a reconciliation between \u201cpaternalistic\u201d state intervention and the liberty of the individual. One of their key insights is that providing people with information regarding the right thing to do, is often not sufficient to change behaviour. It is sometimes necessary to make structural changes to people\u2019s environments to make the desired behaviour easy. Hospital staff, for example, know that washing their hands is important, but are still more likely to do so if hand sanitiser is easily available and visible in the hospital. As we explore how to safely restore some personal freedoms while minimising the harm caused by the spread of the virus, we will need people to engage in a range of behaviours, from social distancing to washing their hands, wearing masks, download tracing apps, and (hopefully one day) getting vaccinated. Governments have a huge role to play in structuring our daily environments to make it easy to engage in the behaviours we need to engage in. Telling people to follow \u201ccommon sense\u201d is likely to prove a lot less effective than making masks easily available, or making hand sanitisers more widespread in public buildings. There is no quick fix to Get Corona Done. However, behavioural science can help create new habits to slow the rate of infection until a vaccine is created \u2013 and a little bit of understanding of the values behind people\u2019s beliefs will go a long way to avoid the spread of further division. \u2022 Lee de Wit is a lecturer in political psychology at Cambridge University",

Warning there was little evidence of the downturn ending soon as Covid-19 brings the world economy to an effective standstill, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall \u201cprecipitously\u201d in the first half of 2020. The WTO\u2019s quarterly goods trade barometer, which provides real-time information on the trajectory of world merchandise trade relative to recent trends, slumped to 87.6 on a scale where anything below 100 indicates a downturn. Suggesting a sharp contraction in world trade extending into the second quarter of 2020, the reading was the lowest value on record since the indicator\u2019s launch in July 2016. Shipments of automotive products were the weakest of all, owing to collapsing car production and vehicle sales in major economies. There were also declines in container shipping and air freight across the board, as demand for traded goods fades and supply chains are disrupted by closed factories and ports running at reduced capacity. The downturn follows weaker levels of global activity last year amid the US-China trade war, triggered by the world\u2019s two biggest economies imposing punitive trade tariffs on imports. Experts said the coronavirus crisis could accelerate the unpicking of globalisation after decades of ever closer integration between countries. Set in motion in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the trend comes against a backdrop of rising concern over the impact of trade liberalisation for jobs and the environment. Exposing the dependence of national economies on sprawling global supply chains, the crisis could encourage businesses to choose suppliers closer to home, helping to avoid future disruption while also promoting the creation of local jobs and cutting carbon emissions. Geraldine Sundstrom, a managing director at the bond fund manager Pimco, said: \u201cAs restrictions are lifted, economies will ultimately recover from the pandemic-induced recession, but it is questionable to assume that everything will go back to the way it was. \u201cAs old inefficiencies are identified and new preferences developed, the changes that the Covid crisis has led to might be more permanent than we think and have more consequential implications.\u201d",

The business secretary, Alok Sharma, agreed earlier this week to allow the planning inspectorate to extend its deadline for a decision until 12 October, and called on the authority to \u201cmake best efforts\u201d to complete the process as soon as possible. The inspectorate promised to hold \u201cvirtual events\u201d to allow interested parties to participate remotely. The delay comes amid an increase in calls from energy economists, business groups and energy companies for the UK to commit to a green economic recovery after the coronavirus crisis. Graham Davey, the project manager for the Norfolk Boreas windfarm, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s understandable that some delay to the examination process is inevitable due to the Covid-19 restrictions, adding up to five months to the timetable is regrettable.\u201d . Vattenfall plans to build the Norfolk Boreas alongside a twin windfarm project, the Norfolk Vanguard, to add 3.6 GW of clean energy capacity to its UK renewables portfolio, enough to power 3.9m UK homes. \u201cIn our view, all of the substantive issues in the process have already been resolved. Yet we\u2019re now in a position where potentially the final consent decision may not be known until April next year,\u201d Davey said. \u201cDelays on this scale influence plans and investment decisions, send the wrong signal to the offshore wind sector as a whole, and call into question Britain\u2019s commitment to acting quickly to reduce emissions.\u201d The International Energy Agency said global renewable energy growth is likely to slow this year for the first time in 20 years, unless governments make decisions in the next months which support renewable energy to boost economics growth while tackling the climate crisis. The International Renewable Energy Agency said last month that globally, renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring GDP gains of almost $100tn (\u00a380tn) between now and 2050, compared with business as usual.",

The council leader, Graeme Millar, said: \u201cOur stance is clear, we cannot expect teachers \u2013 or children \u2013 to be in a school environment in Sunderland unless they know that it is safe for them, and there are serious question marks about that presently, based on the localised health picture in the north-east.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Liverpool </strong><strong>city </strong><strong>council</strong> suggested risk assessment work would begin only after half-term and that it was unlikely schools would be ready before the <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/every-merseyside-council-stands-schools-18278974\">middle of June</a>. \u201cWe will only support the schools reopening when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Sefton council</strong> in Merseyside said schools were <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/every-merseyside-council-stands-schools-18278974\">unlikely to be ready</a> before 15 June. \u201cWe therefore do not expect childcare providers or schools to adhere to government guidance in terms of timescales, or the suggested year groups, if they judge this not to be in the best interest of children.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Solihull council</strong>, in the West Midlands, said its schools would <a href=\"https://www.solihull.gov.uk/news/ArtMID/820/ArticleID/2939/19-May-Message-from-Councillor-Ian-Courts-Leader-of-Solihull-Council\">not be ready</a> by the government\u2019s deadline: \u201cThe government has the ambition of a 1 June return, but the reality in Solihull is that schools will need to use that first week in June to ensure they are completely ready for more pupils to attend.

MPs have only been called to speak if listed.</p> \n<p>Rees-Mogg said if schools and other businesses were reopening on 1 June, MPs should too when the Commons returns the day after.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to recognise that if we persist with the present arrangement it will become harder to make progress in a timely fashion,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is why, in line with government advice for those who cannot do their jobs from home, I am asking members to return to their place of work after Whitsun,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Opposition MPs failed in an attempt to take control of the Commons agenda to enable a vote on how the chamber operates after the Whitsun recess.</p> \n<p>Their amendment to the Wednesday timetable motion was not selected, although they continued to raise their opposition.</p> \n<p>The Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael, who represents Orkney and Shetland, said he found the virtual arrangements \u201cstilted and artificial\u201d, but added: \u201cIf it\u2019s a choice between that and putting the safety of members, their families and staff of the house at risk, then that is no choice at all and it should only end when safe to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said it has been reported the motivation for the MPs\u2019 return is to \u201cget a support act\u201d behind Boris Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> \n<p>Opposition MPs forced a vote on the original timetable motion but it was approved by 350 votes to 258.</p> \n<p>Karen Bradley, the Conservative chair of the procedure committee, said the Commons \u201cneeds to be in agreement\u201d with the way it conducts business and asked Rees-Mogg to \u201creflect\u201d on the issue.</p> \n<p>Some MPs wrote on Wednesday to the Speaker saying Rees-Mogg\u2019s proposals could create a two-tier House of Commons.</p> \n<p>A letter signed by 35 MPs, including the Conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee, Caroline Nokes, and the Labour MP Stella Creasy, argued that a return to a \u201cphysical\u201d parliament could mean that those in high-risk categories including BAME MPs, older MPs or those who are pregnant will be disproportionately restricted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/unions-set-to-clash-with-rees-mogg-over-call-to-end-virtual-parliament\">Unions set to clash with Rees-Mogg over call to end 'virtual' parliament</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cAs social distancing measures are reduced in a phased manner this summer, we are concerned that there is a risk of creating two tiers of MPs: those who are able to attend and those who mostly cannot given the ongoing challenges of lockdown and their own personal circumstances.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven what is known about the nature of this virus, and who is a high risk, it is likely that this will mean those MPs who are BAME MPs, older MPs or who are pregnant will be disproportionately restricted,\u201d the letter says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rees-Mogg has agreed that MPs\u2019 staff and parliamentary workers can continue to work from home, amid concerns they would be put at risk, following a meeting of the Commons commission on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Unions expressed their concern about Rees-Mogg\u2019s proposals.</p> \n<p>Garry Graham, the Prospect deputy general secretary, said: \u201cIt is incredibly disappointing that the government has chosen to ignore the voice of staff and impose a full return to parliament in two weeks, including physical voting, that will mean hundreds of people packed into parliament\u2019s narrow corridors putting MPs and staff at risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>.</p>",

After the leader of the house confirmed the government planned to end the virtual parliamentary proceedings and force MPs to return to Westminster in early June, the former minister Robert Halfon said the proposals would discriminate and threaten the lives of some MPs. \u201cIs it really morally just to say in effect to MPs, because you are not Tarzan-like and able to swing through the chamber, beating your chest shouting to your constituents: \u2018Look, I am here!\u2019 that you are effectively euthanised from the Commons? \u201cMPs who are disrupted by this awful pandemic are not just old horses to be sent to the knackers\u2019 yard,\u201d he said. Parliament is due to go into recess for two weeks for the Whitsun holiday on Wednesday. Since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced in mid-March, members have been encouraged to work virtually, with only 50 MPs in the chamber being treated the same as up to 120 MPs appearing virtually. MPs have only been called to speak if listed. Rees-Mogg said if schools and other businesses were reopening on 1 June, MPs should too when the Commons returns the day after. \u201cWe have to recognise that if we persist with the present arrangement it will become harder to make progress in a timely fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why, in line with government advice for those who cannot do their jobs from home, I am asking members to return to their place of work after Whitsun,\u201d he said. Opposition MPs failed in an attempt to take control of the Commons agenda to enable a vote on how the chamber operates after the Whitsun recess. Their amendment to the Wednesday timetable motion was not selected, although they continued to raise their opposition. The Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael, who represents Orkney and Shetland, said he found the virtual arrangements \u201cstilted and artificial\u201d, but added: \u201cIf it\u2019s a choice between that and putting the safety of members, their families and staff of the house at risk, then that is no choice at all and it should only end when safe to do so.\u201d He said it has been reported the motivation for the MPs\u2019 return is to \u201cget a support act\u201d behind Boris Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions. Opposition MPs forced a vote on the original timetable motion but it was approved by 350 votes to 258. Karen Bradley, the Conservative chair of the procedure committee, said the Commons \u201cneeds to be in agreement\u201d with the way it conducts business and asked Rees-Mogg to \u201creflect\u201d on the issue. Some MPs wrote on Wednesday to the Speaker saying Rees-Mogg\u2019s proposals could create a two-tier House of Commons. A letter signed by 35 MPs, including the Conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee, Caroline Nokes, and the Labour MP Stella Creasy, argued that a return to a \u201cphysical\u201d parliament could mean that those in high-risk categories including BAME MPs, older MPs or those who are pregnant will be disproportionately restricted. \u201cAs social distancing measures are reduced in a phased manner this summer, we are concerned that there is a risk of creating two tiers of MPs: those who are able to attend and those who mostly cannot given the ongoing challenges of lockdown and their own personal circumstances. \u201cGiven what is known about the nature of this virus, and who is a high risk, it is likely that this will mean those MPs who are BAME MPs, older MPs or who are pregnant will be disproportionately restricted,\u201d the letter says. Rees-Mogg has agreed that MPs\u2019 staff and parliamentary workers can continue to work from home, amid concerns they would be put at risk, following a meeting of the Commons commission on Tuesday. Unions expressed their concern about Rees-Mogg\u2019s proposals. Garry Graham, the Prospect deputy general secretary, said: \u201cIt is incredibly disappointing that the government has chosen to ignore the voice of staff and impose a full return to parliament in two weeks, including physical voting, that will mean hundreds of people packed into parliament\u2019s narrow corridors putting MPs and staff at risk.\u201d .",

The RMT rail union bulletins have explained <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/section/44\">section 44</a> of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which gives workers the right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions, making it clear that anyone refusing to work on those grounds who sees push-back from management will be supported by legal representation. \u201cIf the managers kick off,\u201d Jay says, \u201call I have to do is speak to a rep.\u201d</p> <p>His workforce has a long history of strong unionisation. Biyu and her colleagues are in the early days of organising their workplace with the GMB (which represents workers across all sectors).

But at least the food factory employees are now building collectively to fight for pay and protection. It is difficult to imagine what those without unions can do.

In recent years the story told about them has not been a happy one, focusing on their haemorrhage of power and members: from more than 13 million in 1979 to 6.2 million today. Members who stay, union critics say, are trapped in toothless institutions bound by state-imposed legislation and self-imposed bureaucracy.</p> <p>Now those apparently toothless unions have started to bite. The TUC began lockdown by negotiating state support for millions of workers through the furlough scheme and, vitally, union power appears to be waking up in workplaces across the UK. The National Education Union (NEU) reports that its membership grew by 7,500 over one weekend, and traffic on the TUC\u2019s joining page is up 300%. Public support for union demands is also growing: 400,000 people have signed the NEU\u2019s petition against the unsafe opening of schools.</p> <p>But online outrage won\u2019t be enough to sustain power. The union movement now has a once-in-a-generation chance to reverse decline and write itself a happier story, but to do so, it must look carefully at what has changed in the past months. The key ingredients \u2013 of clever online organising, working across unions, mass and dynamic worker involvement, and a willingness to refuse to work unless demands are met \u2013 were missing at scale before now, aside from notable exceptions, such as the Unison Birmingham <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/its-over-victory-birmingham-home-16287725\">care-workers strike</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.scottishleftreview.scot/equal-pay-victory-how-weegie-women-won/\">Glasgow Equal Pay campaign</a>, and the radical effectiveness of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IWGBunion?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">IWGB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/\">UVW</a>.</p> <p>It is to those examples and others that the movement must now look.

      "bodyText": "Peru seemed to be doing everything right. Its president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, announced one of the earliest coronavirus lockdowns in Latin America on 16 March. In stark contrast to his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who has deliberately undermined social distancing and quarantine measures \u2013 Peru\u2019s leader strictly adhered to the World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus recommendations and mobilised the police and army to enforce a stringent quarantine. But more than two months later the country is one of the region\u2019s worst-hit by Covid-19 and has been unable to flatten the curve of infections. Peru now ranks second only to Brazil in Latin America with 104,020 confirmed cases and a death toll of 3,024 according to official figures on Tuesday. Vizcarra said on Friday that Peru had carried out 600,000 coronavirus tests \u2013 \u201cmore than any other country in the region\u201d. But while Peru\u2019s numbers could reflect increased and better targeted testing rather than an underlying trend, the jump in new cases is undeniable. In the past week, the number of new Covid-19 cases logged each day rose from more than 3,000 to above 4,000 a day, hitting a record 4,550 new cases on Tuesday. \u201cPeru\u2019s response was right on time,\u201d said Elmer Huerta, a Peruvian doctor and trusted broadcaster on public health matters for Latin American audiences. \u201cIt was the first country in Latin America to respond with a lockdown. \u201cBut the problem was people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that on the eighth week of confinement you have thousands of people who are positive [for Covid-19] means that those people got the virus while the country was in lockdown \u2013 which means they did not respect the law.\u201d Deadly outbreaks on Peru\u2019s northern coast and Amazon regions \u2013 where social distancing was routinely flouted \u2013 laid bare the gaping holes in Peru\u2019s chronically underfunded healthcare system. Covid-19 hit Peru\u2019s largest Amazon city, Iquitos, with deadly force before spreading to Pucallpa, on the country\u2019s eastern border with Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s just heartbreaking,\u201d said Miguel Hilario-Manenima, a local university professor, who said Pucallpa\u2019s public hospitals had shut down and speculation had quintupled the price of an oxygen cylinder. \u201cWe feel abandoned by the central government and ignored by the local government,\u201d said Hilario-Manenima, an indigenous Shipibo-Konibo leader. \u201cFor the communities further in the forest, it\u2019s as if they were sentenced to die,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the poorest of the poor, what can they do?\u201d As elsewhere, the coronavirus has hit the poorest hardest.

Del Naja hopes the project can raise awareness about food poverty and the vulnerability of the food supply chain. \u201cWe all have a slightly superficial understanding of food vulnerability, and local supplies are always competing with the bigger supermarkets and franchises,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an emergency situation these things are more acute.\u201d Del Naja, who was a prominent graffiti artist before co-founding the band Massive Attack, called for sustained government support as the Covid-19 lockdown continues. \u201cI\u2019m very aware that public charity contributions are not a solution to this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking blue-sky solutions, I\u2019d love to see the introduction of universal basic income, so that everyone can afford to eat and put money back into this consumer society we\u2019re all part of.\u201d Both the Trussell Trust, the UK\u2019s biggest food-bank network, and Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan) have reported record numbers of demand for their services. In late March, the Trussell Trust issued 50,000 food parcels in a single week, which is almost double its usual volume, while Ifan recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March. The full impact of the coronavirus outbreak on food bank use is yet to be established, but in November 2019 the Trussell Trust reported that it had distributed a record 823,145 food parcels between April and September, a 23% increase on the same period in 2018. Del Naja also called for more local authority support for projects like the Bristol Food Union, countering criticism that they create dependency. \u201cIn an emergency situation,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople need to be fed and looked after. I can\u2019t buy that argument at the best of times.\u201d In late 2019, Del Naja and Massive Attack pledged to work with the University of Manchester\u2019s Tyndall Centre to map the carbon footprint of tours in a bid to understand how touring contributed to the climate emergency. In an article for the Guardian, Del Naja said the research could be used as a \u201croadmap to decarbonisation\u201d and would be shared with other touring acts, promoters, festival organisers and venue owners to \u201cassist swift and significant emissions reductions\u201d.",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The message that Boris appeared to have been given was for him to be more himself. The downside to this, though, is that the real Boris is actually rather unpleasant. The popular, fun-loving image has only ever been a veneer. Deep down, Boris is needy and insecure. Character traits that he hates in himself and finds impossible to accept, so his first instinct when cornered is to lash out. So that was the Boris we got at this week\u2019s PMQs. Pugnacious, ungracious, blustering, and not totally coherent.</p> \n<p>For the extra Tory backbenchers who had been bussed in for the occasion \u2013 the party high command feel Boris performs best when there is a home audience \u2013 this was an undoubted improvement on what had gone before when only a surly incompetence had been on view. But it was still a long way short of what most people in the country would have wanted from their leader at such a time. Even when he is being himself, Boris just isn\u2019t that good when up against someone like Keir Starmer, who is used to building a case based on the evidence.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader began on care homes. How did the government square its insistence that it had \u201cthrown a protective ring around care homes\u201d with the evidence given to the health select committee by the chief executive of Care England that countless patients had been booted out of hospital without any testing for the coronavirus?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs he knows full well, er, the, er, dist \u2026 \u201d Boris began, struggling to complete a meaningful sentence. We never did get to find out what the \u201cdist\u201d was. His language was as much of a mess as his hair. But just as it seemed the prime minister was reverting to one of his other default settings of winging it, he glanced at his notes for a better line of attack.</p> \n<p>Aha, he said. No one had been released into care homes without a clinician signing them out. Here we got a first view of the government\u2019s defence in the coming public inquiry. The government had never intended the wrong people to be released from hospitals and if they had been, then it was all down to doctor error. In five years\u2019 time it will turn out that all the excess care home deaths were down to one doctor who has also conveniently died of the coronavirus, and nothing to do with any decisions the government had made.</p> \n<p>There were times during the following exchanges when Starmer appeared rather unsettled by this new bullish, sollipsistic Boris \u2013 it was the height of cheek to accuse Starmer of feigning ignorance, when the prime minister was so busy feigning intelligence. At one point Matt Hancock started joining in \u2013 \u201cand you bought your mum a \u00a310m donkey sanctuary, so there\u201d \u2013 before the Speaker invited him to either shut up or sod off. Matt slumped into a five-year-old\u2019s strop and stared angrily at the ground.</p> \n<p>Not that Boris appeared particularly grateful for the health secretary\u2019s intervention \u2013 he dislikes toadies as much as those who stand up to him \u2013 as he promptly threw him under a bus by insisting that the test and trace programme would be fully operational by 1 June. There was no word on whether Matt\u2019s App would also be up and running, but given that the government has missed almost every deadline it has set for itself \u2013 and lied about the ones it has met \u2013 no one was holding their breath. Boris had yet again set himself and his health secretary up to fail.</p> \n<p>Although Starmer wasn\u2019t getting things all his own way, there was no doubt he was still getting the better of every argument. There\u2019s something about the poise and command of the Labour leader that seems to get under the prime minister\u2019s skin. As if he knows that he will never come close to having his integrity or intellect. At one point Boris nearly lost it completely by demanding that Keir stop being so negative. How about some applause for the people who hadn\u2019t died?</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but 34,000 dead is negative,\u201d Starmer observed. Especially as the real figure was north of 50,000, many of which were totally avoidable.</p> \n<p>One could forgive a lot if Boris was even able to come close to an apology, but now he can\u2019t even admit that there is a correlation between an effective test-and-trace system and a further easing of lockdown measures. There again, he can\u2019t bring himself to say how many children he has, so what hope is there?</p> \n<p>It was with the last two questions that Starmer left Boris hopelessly exposed. How did the government justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/uk-government-urged-to-scrap-624-nhs-charge-for-migrant-care-workers-helping-combat-coronavirus\">the \u00a3624 visa surcharge on so many overseas workers</a> who had done so much to keep the NHS running more or less smoothly?</p> \n<p>Boris merely shrugged. They were a useful source of revenue. Besides, they were lucky to have a job in which some of them could say they had been able to save the life of the prime minister. Put that way, Luis and Jenny should have been thanking him for fleecing them for more cash rather than the other way round.

      "body": "<p>Amid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic\u2019s role in boosting the global heft of China.</p> \n<p>The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration\u2019s US ambassador to the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/samantha-power-former-us-ambassador-un-interview\">Samantha Power, </a>was <a href=\"https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c56cb6a6-8d09-462a-84e3-b668ecdeb54c\">asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee</a> to assess Covid-19\u2019s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China\u2019s rise.</p> \n<p>Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/belt-and-road-forum-xi-jinping-promises-transparency-to-ease-concerns\">belt and road\u201d strategies</a>, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China\u2019s \u201cwolf-warrior\u201d diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump\u2019s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3244f1ab-a9c6-4121-a57f-aff4fc353640\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wS_uXk9Pmbo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For proof of this, look no further than what happened at the World Health Organization assembly in Geneva this week. On the one hand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/donald-trump-and-xi-jinping-meet-the-new-cold-warriors\">Trump spent the week slagging off the WHO</a>, threatening to withdraw all US funding, promoting quack medical remedies and attacking China. On the other, Xi addressed the assembly, donated $2bn to the WHO for the coronavirus battle, called for a vaccine to be made available to all, and successfully watered down the planned post-pandemic international investigation into Covid-19. Having done that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/why-has-china-slapped-tariffs-on-australian-barley-and-what-can-australia-do-about-it\">Xi slapped a punitive 80% tariff </a>on Australian barley to punish Canberra for pressing for a fuller, more independent Covid-19 probe. Stand by, if it takes place, for a similar Xi approach at the postponed Cop26 climate conference.</p> \n<p>As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump\u2019s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.</p> \n<p>At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power\u2019s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government\u2019s <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/225/the-fco-and-the-integrated-review/\">\u201cintegrated review\u201d </a>of Britain\u2019s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain\u2019s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review\">Tony Blair </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review\">could write</a> that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/us-message-to-britain-in-bilateral-trade-talks-its-us-or-china\">US message to Britain in bilateral trade talks: it's us \u2013 or China</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/some-people-never-convince-david-cameron-reflects-brexit-legacy\">David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic \u201clong game\u201d with China </a>that would give Britain greater political leverage \u201cto bring China into the rules-based international system \u2013 through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.\u201d Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain\u2019s leverage in that or any other global order?</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach \u2013 an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war \u2013 that the American diplomat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/19/guardianobituaries.usa\">George Kennan</a> crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century.

      "bodyText": "Amid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic\u2019s role in boosting the global heft of China. The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration\u2019s US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, was asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee to assess Covid-19\u2019s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China\u2019s rise. Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the \u201cbelt and road\u201d strategies, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China\u2019s \u201cwolf-warrior\u201d diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump\u2019s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network. For proof of this, look no further than what happened at the World Health Organization assembly in Geneva this week. On the one hand, Trump spent the week slagging off the WHO, threatening to withdraw all US funding, promoting quack medical remedies and attacking China. On the other, Xi addressed the assembly, donated $2bn to the WHO for the coronavirus battle, called for a vaccine to be made available to all, and successfully watered down the planned post-pandemic international investigation into Covid-19. Having done that, Xi slapped a punitive 80% tariff on Australian barley to punish Canberra for pressing for a fuller, more independent Covid-19 probe. Stand by, if it takes place, for a similar Xi approach at the postponed Cop26 climate conference. As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump\u2019s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate. At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power\u2019s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government\u2019s \u201cintegrated review\u201d of Britain\u2019s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain\u2019s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too. Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since Tony Blair could write that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own. But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic \u201clong game\u201d with China that would give Britain greater political leverage \u201cto bring China into the rules-based international system \u2013 through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.\u201d Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain\u2019s leverage in that or any other global order? Johnson\u2019s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach \u2013 an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war \u2013 that the American diplomat George Kennan crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen \u2013 and partly sees itself \u2013 as an alliance breaker. China in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat, now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power. Yet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman Stephen Kinnock made clear this week. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises. The answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Troy Deeney was one of several Watford players who chose not to take part in small-group training on Wednesday, the day after three members of the club\u2019s playing and coaching staff, including the centre-back Adrian Mariappa, were found to have tested positive for Covid-19. Four groups of players, each of no more than five, trained at the club\u2019s Hertfordshire base. Excluding Mariappa, who is isolating for seven days and will be retested before returning to training, Gerard Deulofeu, who moved into his physiotherapist\u2019s house in Spain before that country imposed its lockdown in an effort to accelerate his recovery from a serious knee injury, and those on loan when league football was paused, the club have 26 senior professionals, including three goalkeepers. Those who chose not to attend were given details of the exercises their teammates were being put through and asked to do them alone. They are under no pressure to come to the training ground before they are comfortable to do so. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that they feel that they\u2019re able to make a decision like that,\u201d the Watford manager, Nigel Pearson, told Sky Sports. \u201cI think one of the key factors in this is that there are still a few unanswered questions. Wherever there is an element of doubt, and if players feel that there are too many question marks, then we respect their decision.\u201d Watford have been one of the most outspoken clubs regarding plans to restart the Premier League in June. Deeney had said he would not participate in group training and over the weekend Pearson raised concerns about the possibility of a coronavirus\u2011related death in the league. \u201cI\u2019ve made my position very clear, in terms of what I think about the overall situation, but having said that my job still is to support the people I work alongside, and that\u2019s what I will do,\u201d Pearson said on Wednesday. \u201cOnce the decision had been made to restart it was very important that we try to create an environment in which the players feel safe.\u201d Watford, like other clubs, will decide whether to support the protocols designed to allow contact training once those are put forward. The government hopes to approve guidelines this week. Mariappa revealed he was the Watford player who tested positive for coronavirus but said he was asymptomatic and had not breached any guidelines. \u201cIt was a big surprise because I haven\u2019t really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids,\u201d he told the Telegraph. \u201cI\u2019ve mainly just been homeschooling and keeping fit.

Ramakrishnan said that while that was possible in some instances, with physical distancing for example, when evidence of the benefits were clear, it was not always so simple. \u201cThe science is complicated and putting it into policies also complicated and so you can\u2019t just say you\u2019re following the science in every case,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what ministers should say is, \u2018we\u2019re heeding the science, we\u2019re heeding the science advice, we\u2019re considering it when we make our decisions\u2019 \u2013 that would be a more honest thing.\u201d A member of Sage, who did not want to be named, also stressed that decisions were ultimately the responsibility of ministers. \u201cPoliticians are in charge, and they decide what advice they get,\u201d they said. \u201cScientists like me are invited to give advice and have no power to enact any decisions. They don\u2019t have to accept the advice, and indeed should take a wider view than the science when making decisions \u2013 they are elected by the population to take decisions on our behalf.\u201d Alex Stevens, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Kent, who quit the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which reports to the Home Office, last year over the alleged \u201cpolitical vetting\u201d of panel members by the government, wrote a paper published in the Nature journal last week arguing the government was not following the science, which is not always set in stone, but it was \u201c\u2018survival of the ideas that fit\u201d. He told the Guardian: \u201cScience just isn\u2019t like that and so the idea that they were following the science was wrong. And now that they\u2019ve been criticised for their steps they have taken, it is bizarre that they\u2019ve tried to say that it was wrong science that led them astray rather than their own decisions.\u201d Stevens said that, during his time advising the government on drugs policy, he had seen civil servants \u201ctell ministers the story they want to be told\u201d. He highlighted comments by Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises Sage on infectious modelling, saying they did not carry out detailed modelling for a lockdown originally \u201cbecause it didn\u2019t seem to be on the agenda\u201d, as \u201cpolitics leading the science rather than the other way around\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The governor of the Bank of England has refused to rule out introducing negative interest rates in the UK. Andrew Bailey told MPs that his views have changed in the light of the coronavirus pandemic - the BoE is reassessing all its tools, as it tries to fight the worst downturn in centuries. Bailey was speaking shortly after the UK sold government debt at negative yield for the first time. Investors effectively paid for the chance to lend to Britain -- perhaps partly because the BoE has pledged to buy the gilts under its stimulus programme. The pandemic is pushing inflation down across the globe. In the UK, the Consumer Price Index dropped to just 0.8% last month, down from 1.5% in April - with fuel and clothing prices dropping last month. Eurozone inflation fell to 0.3%, while in Canada the inflation rate turned negative for the first time since 2009. The WTO warned that world trade in goods has fallen dramatically this year, as the economy contracts. Despite this concern, global stock markets have risen today on hopes of economic recovery later this year. And there\u2019s deep gloom in Derby tonight as Rolls-Royce announces thousands of job cuts. But McDonald\u2019s has cheered some of its fans, by reopening 33 drive-through outlets. Goodnight. GW Optimism that the world economy will start to recover from the Covid-19 recession soon has lifted shares across Europe. The main indices have closed around 1% higher tonight, as global markets hit their highest levels in 10 weeks. Stoxx 600: up 3.5 points or 1.05% at 343.4 FTSE 100: up 64 points or 1% at 6067 German DAX: up 170 points or 1.5% at 11,245 French CAC: up 40 points or 0.9% at 4,498 Italian FTSE MIB: up 178 points or 1% at 17,213 Stocks are also higher in New York, with the Dow gaining around 1.7%. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains that investors are shrugging off rising tensions between Washington and Beijing: The Dow Jones was keen to rebound on Wednesday, shaking off the Moderna vaccines doubts that plagued it on Tuesday. Rising close to 400 points, the Dow returned to 24600, pretty much reversing the losses incurred last night thanks to some solid earnings, persistent optimism regarding a vaccine and the hopes of some more Fed stimulus down the line. That meant the Dow ignored Donald Trump\u2019s latest inflammatory comments towards China, the President claiming it was the \u2018incompetence\u2019 of Beijing that caused the virus to spread. And finally.... Treasury committee chair Mel Stride returns to the issue of negative interest rates, which governor Andrew Bailey refused to rule in or out. Q: What criteria need to be met for the Bank to go for negative rates? Governor Andrew Bailey replies that he has changed his position on negative interest rates a little, given recent events. We need to reassess our tools, and keep them (negative interest rates) as an option, he tells the committee. But there are lot of issues to consider -- including how it would affect the stability of the financial system, and how an interest rate cut below 0% would be transmitted through the system. We also need to consider any other measures that Bank would take alongside it, Bailey adds, cautioning that there are \u201csome pretty mixed reviews\u201d about how negative rates have worked elsewhere. Conservative MP Steve Baker has challenged the Bank of England over its QE programme. Isn\u2019t it \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d that we have one major borrower (the UK government), and one major buyer (the Bank) in the market, giving bond traders the confidence to buy gilts because they know they can sell them onto Threadneedle Street? We are facing a \u201cquite extraordinary situation\u201d, governor Andrew Bailey replies. But he doesn\u2019t accept that the Bank is simply monetising government borrowing. Instead, he argues, the Bank is reacting to economic conditions by expanding its QE programme -- just as the government is reacting to economic conditions by issuing more debt..... Q: What impact will Covid-19 have on the UK property market? Elisabeth Stheeman, a member of the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, replies that commercial property - particularly offices outside London - will be hit as companies reassess how much office space they need. Back at the Treasury committee e-hearing, Bank of England policymaker Jonathan Haskel has warned that self-employed workers, younger people, and those with fewer skills will be most hurt by the recession. These workers, such as those in the hospitality sector and hotels, will be reliant on a pick-up in aggregate demand in the economy, Haskel adds. Breaking away from the Bank of England hearing... a former US Green Beret soldier and his son have reportedly been arrested over Carlos Ghosn\u2019s shock escape from Japan last December. Reuters has the details: U.S. authorities on Wednesday arrested a former special forces soldier and another man wanted by Japan on charges that they enabled the escape of former Nissan Motor boss Carlos Ghosn out of the country. Former U.S. Green Beret Michael Taylor and the other man, Peter Taylor, are expected to appear by video conference before a federal judge in Worcester, Massachusetts, according to court records. The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam points out that the Bank of England has helped to push UK borrowing costs below zero today. The BoE has pledged to buy \u00a3200bn of gilts through its asset purchase scheme, lifting its QE total to \u00a3645bn. That means investors feel confident buying UK gilts, as they can sell them onto the Bank. Andrew Bailey\u2019s comments on negative interest rates are very timely - just hours after the UK borrowed for free for the next three years. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Britain has sold a government bond with a negative yield for the first time after plunging inflation raised the prospect of the Bank of England cutting official interest rates below zero. In a development that effectively means investors have to pay to lend money to fund the government\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, investors bought gilts knowing they would get back less than they paid for them when the bonds mature in three years\u2019 time. The debt management office (DMO) said it had sold \u00a33.8bn of three-year gilts at a yield of -0.003%, with the result that Britain has joined a small group of countries \u2013 such as Germany and Japan \u2013 that have persuaded investors to accept a negative return. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent denies that the Bank is anticipating a V-shaped recovery from the pandemic. He tells MPs that in the Bank\u2019s latest scenario, the economy shrinks by around 25% in the April-June quarter, and doesn\u2019t return to its pre-crisis levels until 2022. There\u2019s no doubt that in our scenario, the recovery takes a lot longer than the downturn, Broadbent insists, saying it doesn\u2019t really sound like a V.... MPs then press the Bank of England on its decision to force UK banks to scrap their dividends back in March. Andrew Bailey insists this was a sensible business decision, not good politics. It strengthens the banks\u2019 balance sheets - and if the economy recovers faster than hoped, they can reassess dividend policy. Andrew Bailey seems to be keeping his options open, on whether to impose negative interest rates on the UK economy in an attempt to stimulate the economy. Here\u2019s some reaction: The Treasury committee moves onto monetary policy -- and asks whether the Bank of England could cut rates below zero: Q: Would you contemplate negative interest rates and buying riskier assets? We do not rule things out as a matter of principle - that would be foolish, replies governor Andrew Bailey smoothly. He explains that the MPC has a history of keeping the \u2018lower bound\u2019 of monetary policy under review -- ie, how low it can actually cut rates. [UK interest rates are currently just 0.1%, a record low]. We are keeping our tools under active review in the current situation, Bailey adds. Bailey says it is \u201clooking carefully\u201d at the experience that other central banks have had with negative interest rates, where it has been \u201cquite a nuanced policy tool\u201d. He doesn\u2019t name them -- but one obvious candidate is the European Central Bank. The ECB imposes -0.5% interest rates on commercial bank deposits to encourage them to lend to the real economy, rather than leave money in its vaults. As he puts it: We\u2019re not ruling it in, and we\u2019re not ruling it out. The governor insists that this is the \u201cright time\u201d to assess all the Bank\u2019s tools, including the purchase of riskier assets, as the BoE may need to \u201cmove rapidly\u201d in the future. He also explains that communication would be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d, if there was any move on negative interest rates. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is testifying, remotely, to the UK parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee. He\u2019s \u201caccompanied\u201d by deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, and external policy members Elisabeth Stheeman and Jonathan Haskel. Q: Are Britain\u2019s banks as well-capitalised as they should be to trade through the Covid-19 crisis, given the slump in their share prices? (as economist Sir John Vickers fears)? Bailey argues that it makes more sense to assess the value of a bank\u2019s assets (the book value), when stress-testing them. If you had used banks\u2019 share price in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, for example, you\u2019d have been given a wildly erroneous view of their strength. The better question, Bailey says, is why are bank shares so low? It\u2019s partly because the market has doubts about some banks\u2019 business model, he reckons - rather than on the value of their assets. In a landmark development, investors have paid for the opportunity to lend money to the UK government. Britain auctioned off \u00a33.75bn of three-year bonds this morning, at an average yield (or interest rates) of -0.003%. That means that investors paid more than the face value of the bonds - meaning they are guaranteed a very small loss if they hold the debt until it matures in 2023. Back in 2016, the UK did sell some short-term debt at below zero -- but City experts say this is the first time a three-year bond has been sold at a negative yield. This shows that investors are pessimistic about the prospects for UK inflation, and anticipating further stimulus measures to support the economy. It also shows that there\u2019s still demand for UK debt - the auction was more than two-times oversubscribed, so investors had accept this small negative yield in order to win a slice of the auction. Here\u2019s the official results: Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Britain sold a government bond that pays a negative yield for the first time on Wednesday - meaning that Britain\u2019s government is effectively being paid to borrow as investors agreed to be paid back slightly less than they lent. The bond, which matures in July 2023, sold at an average yield of -0.003%. While investors will receive an annual interest payment of 0.75%, they paid above face value for the bond so the actual return in cash terms is less than they have lent. The Financial Times reckons investors are expecting the Bank of England to launch further stimulus moves soon: The UK has sold bonds with a negative yield for the first time, with a fall in inflation heaping further pressure on policymakers to take new action to prop up the economy. The sale effectively means that investors are paying for the privilege of lending to the UK government, reflecting growing investor expectations that the Bank of England may need to take additional steps to push inflation back to its 2 per cent target. The BoE has so far resisted cutting its main interest rate below zero but other central banks, such as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan had already pushed their rates into negative territory even before the Covid-19 crisis. The UK sold \u00a33.8bn of three-year gilts at a yield of minus 0.003 per cent, according to the Debt Management Office. The slightly negative yield suggests investors who hold the debt to maturity will get back less than they paid, when accounting for regular interest payments and the return of principal. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the WTO\u2019s trade slowdown warning: International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures revealing the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Warning there was little evidence of the downturn ending soon as Covid-19 brings the world economy to an effective standstill, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall \u201cprecipitously\u201d in the first half of 2020. The WTO\u2019s quarterly goods trade barometer, which provides real-time information on the trajectory of world merchandise trade relative to recent trends, slumped to 87.6 on a scale where anything below 100 indicates a downturn. Suggesting a sharp contraction in world trade extending into the second quarter of 2020, the reading was the lowest value on record since the indicator\u2019s launch in July 2016. This is the first time Canada\u2019s inflation rate has turned negative since the financial crisis over a decade ago: Newsflash: Canadian inflation has fallen below zero as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to grip the global economy. The annual Consumer Prices index across Canada fell by 0.2% in April, according to Statistics Canada. That\u2019s down from a 0.9% year-on-year rise in March. In April alone, the CPI dropped by 0,7% in April after a 0.9% monthly drop in March. As in the UK, fuel and clothing both became cheaper under the lockdown - although food prices did jump. Statistics Canada explains: Compared with April 2019, consumers paid less for transportation (-4.4%), clothing and footwear (-4.1%), and recreation, education and reading (-0.7%). In contrast, the growth in food prices (+3.4%) accelerated in April 2020 and recorded the largest year-over-year increase of any major component. Gasoline price slumped by 39.3% on a year-over-year basis in April, the largest year-over-year decline on record. Clothes and food prices fell 5.9% during April, which is the biggest monthly drop on record. But food became significantly more expensive; including rice (+9.2%), eggs (+8.8%) and margarine (+7.9%) as consumers scrambled to stock up. Higher sales and supply issues, including a slowdown in cross-border shipping due to COVID-19, contributed to higher prices for pork (+9.0%) and beef (+8.5%), Statistics Canada adds. My colleague Joanna Partridge has travelled to Bushey, near Watford, to meet some of the McDonalds customers keen to buy fast food again: An hour after reopening for the first time in 8 weeks, a queue of cars containing customers hungry for Big Macs and Happy Meals has formed outside the McDonald\u2019s drive-through in Bushey, east of Watford. A McDonald\u2019s employee in a high-vis jacket is marshalling the queue of vehicles as the line stretches beyond the restaurant\u2019s waiting area onto the A41. Ruby Hibbitt, 18, and her housemate Paige Bush, 19, had been told by a friend that the restaurant was open and had got straight in the car to buy lunch. They\u2019d both been dreaming of a burger and diet coke, they said. The Bank of England\u2019s new governor, Andrew Bailey, must write to the UK chancellor to explain why inflation is just 0.8%, far from its target of 2%. But what might he say? Our economics editor Larry Elliott has some ideas: He might start by saying that the shuttering of much of the economy meant the April inflation rate had to include a bit of informed guesswork on the part of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) \u2013 because the usual field surveys that go into collecting prices were impossible during lockdown \u2013 but that the main reason for the drop in inflation was the collapse in oil prices, owing to a mismatch between global demand and supply. But Bailey will also tell Sunak that underlying inflationary pressures are also weak. Clothing prices fell sharply because retailers were desperate to get rid of excess stock. The cost of travel goods were also down because nobody is travelling. Greece\u2019s finance minister has warned that its economy will probably shrink by at least 10% this year. The Covid-19 pandemic is crushing Athens\u2019 hopes of economic recovery in 2020, after years of extremely painful austerity. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to outline his plans to revive the economy later today. Reuters has the details: Greece\u2019s economy may shrink 10 to 13% this year following a lockdown imposed to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, but the government will take steps to mitigate the impact, the country\u2019s finance minister said on Wednesday. Finance Minister Christos Staikouras told Greek radio Real FM that the economy, which emerged from a decade-long debt crisis and three international bailouts in 2018, can withstand a possible second wave of infections in autumn. The conservative government will support businesses and protect jobs, he said, and plans to take measures that could contain the estimated recession by as much as 8 points. \u201cWe aim for the economy to gradually return to the dynamic it had before the health crisis, in February,\u201d Staikouras said. Fast food chain McDonald\u2019s has taken another step towards normality by resuming drive-through services at nearly 40 restaurants in the UK and Ireland. All the UK restaurants are in the South East of England - including in Luton, Peterborough, Chelmsford, Ipswich, Watford, Medway, Harrow and West Sutton. Six sites in Dublin are also reopening. McDonalds says it expects high demand. It has introduced new safe working measures to prevent Covid-19 spreading, but warns that sites could close again if necessary to protect staff. World trade volumes are likely to \u201cfall precipitously\u201d in the first half of 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic batters the global economy. That\u2019s the latest warning from the World Trade Organisation, which says its goods barometer is now \u201cflashing red\u201d as trade volumes fall. This index of trade volumes has slumped to 87.6, the lowest since it was launched in July 2016 - and some way below the 100 points baseline. The WTO warns that there is \u201cno sign of the trade decline bottoming out yet\u201d. Today\u2019s figures are consistent with the WTO\u2019s April forecast that world merchandise trade could decline by between 13% and 32% in 2020, depending on how long the pandemic lasts - and how effective governments are at combating it. Shipments of new cars have fallen particularly dramatically, the WTO adds, although technology products are holding up better. The automotive products index (79.7) was weakest of all, due to collapsing car production and sales in major economies. The sharp decline in the forward-looking export orders index (83.3) suggests that trade weakness will persist in the short-run. Declines in the container shipping (88.5) and air freight (88.0) indices reflect weak demand for traded goods as well as supply-side constraints arising from efforts to suppress COVID-19. Only the indices for electronic components (94.0) and agricultural raw materials (95.7) show signs of stability, although they too remain below trend. City analyst Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has spotted some interesting trends in the this morning\u2019s UK inflation report: Newsflash: Inflation across the eurozone has slumped to its lowest level in almost four years - just like in the UK. Consumer prices in the euro area only rose by 0.3% annually in April, Eurostat reports. That\u2019s the lowest reading since August 2016, down from 0.7% in March. It says: In April 2020, a month marked by COVID-19 containment measures in all countries, the euro area annual inflation rate was 0.3%, down from 0.7% in March. A year earlier, the rate was 1.7%. As in Britain, lower energy prices pulled CPI down - thanks to the glut of crude oil caused by the pandemic and the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. But, eurostat also found that food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose last month: In April, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.67 percentage points, pp), followed by services (+0.52 pp), non-energy industrial goods (+0.09 pp) and energy (-0.97 pp). My colleague Zoe Wood explains how M&amp;S\u2019s sales have deteriorated under the lockdown: In the six weeks to 9 May, clothing and home sales dropped 75%, while sales in Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s food halls, excluding its restaurants, were down 4.6%. The company said even though its website had continued to operate, demand for clothing in the initial weeks was very low, although it had begun to improve. Over the last three weeks online sales were 20% higher than last year. Just in: UK house prices picked up in March, just before the pandemic forced the housing market to freeze. The ONS says: UK average house prices increased by 2.1% over the year to March 2020, up from 2.0% in February 2020. Average house prices increased over the year in England to \u00a3248,000 (2.2%), Wales to \u00a3162,000 (1.1%), Scotland to \u00a3152,000 (1.5%) and Northern Ireland to \u00a3141,000 (3.8%). London\u2019s average house prices increased by 4.7% over the year to March 2020; this is the largest 12-month growth London has seen since December 2016. Here are more details of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s plan to ride out the pandemic, via the BBC\u2019s Emma Simpson. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s inflation report: Looking ahead... Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, warns that inflation could spike once the pandemic is over He points out that the huge stimulus measures launched by central banks and governments could ultimately push up the cost of living: \u201cThe drop in inflation to its lowest level since 2016 reflects a fall in petrol costs as well as the impact of lower end demand on factory gate prices. \u201cIn the short term, disinflationary pressures will mount as the economy slows under lockdown, consumers become more cautious and companies start to prepare for life beyond furlough support by reducing their workforces. Further out, there is a growing fear that monetary and fiscal policy choices could lead to higher inflation, perhaps significantly so. \u201cInvestors have started to prepare for a more inflationary environment by adding to their holdings of gold, the traditional hedge against rising prices. The precious metal is trading close to a seven-year high.\u201d But in the short-term, the trend is clearly downward: High street chain Marks &amp; Spencer has outlined how the lockdown will hurt its business - and it\u2019s an alarming picture. Under M&amp;S\u2019s Covid-19 scenario, the current government guidelines continue for a period of at least four months - resulting in a 70% drop in clothing and home sales in April-July, and a 20% drop in food sales (compared to previous forecasts). M&amp;S has already been hit by the pandemic, telling shareholders: The Covid-19 crisis started to have an impact on the business in the first week of March with reductions in UK Clothing &amp; Home sales which declined by 6.2% and 26.9% the week after. With the onset of lockdown, the effect on sales, colleagues and customers in both businesses has been dramatic. Clothing sales at the low point dropped to 16% of their level a year ago The firm also reported that costs and stock write downs for Covid-19 have cost \u00a3212.8m. This helped to push pre-tax profits down by a fifth in the last financial year, to \u00a367.2m from \u00a384.2m. Retailers are expected to slash prices in the months ahead, to shift the huge stockpiles of unsold clothes which they\u2019ve not been able to sell. That would continue the drop in clothing prices seen in April\u2019s inflation report, keeping the cost of living lower. British justice secretary Robert Buckland says the government will try to hep Rolls-Royce and its staff. Asked about the firm\u2019s plan to axe 9,000 job cuts, Buckland replied: \u201cClearly we will have to go to work with the employer to look at the options. \u201cAll of us will be looking not just at Rolls Royce but at the whole sector and the implications of this for the supply chains as well, let\u2019s not forget them, to make sure we are doing everything we can in terms of plans and action to support what is a very high skilled part of our economy.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Grim news: The Covid-19 pandemic is forcing Rolls-Royce to slash 9,000 jobs - or nearly a fifth of its workforce. Rolls-Royce, one of the jewels in UK manufacturing\u2019s crown, is wielding the axe after seeing slumping demand for its jet engines due to the pandemic. With airlines suspending flights and mothballing planes, the Derby-based firm faces a serious crisis. Warren East, the chief executive, told the City: \u201cThis is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and we must deal with it. Our airline customers and airframe partners are having to adapt and so must we. \u201cBeing told that there is no longer a job for you is a terrible prospect and it is especially hard when all of us take so much pride in working for Rolls-Royce. \u201cBut we must take difficult decisions to see our business through these unprecedented times.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Britain\u2019s economy has a lot of problems right now, but inflation doesn\u2019t appear to be one of them. With CPI almost halving last month, Equals Group chief economist Jeremy Thomson-Cook says weak economic demand will keep prices low: With headline consumer inflation at 0.8% and producer price inflation \u2013 simply price rises at the beginning of a supply chain \u2013 falling 5.1% in April alone courtesy of the recent declines in oil prices, we are more likely to hear concerns about deflation from central bankers. As we have noted in the past, you need to have demand to create inflation and, for now, there is little demand. Some will return as employees earnings recover and more businesses reopen allowing consumers to spend more on different sectors but, similar to the pace of the economy reopening, is likely to be slow.\u201d Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics has spotted that this is the biggest drop in inflation in over a decade: The slump in CPI inflation from 1.5% in March to 0.8% in April (consensus 0.9%; CE 0.8%) was the biggest drop since December 2008 and left inflation at its lowest since August 2016. This was largely due to energy effects, as fuel inflation slipped from -2.4% to -12.2% and utility inflation dropped from 3.9% to -6.8% (due to the decline in Ofgem\u2019s price cap). There was a partial offset from food price inflation, which rose from 1.1% to 1.3%, reflecting higher inflation for fresh fruit, meat and fish. The games, toys, hobbies and computer software categories provided also provided further upward pressure. The slump in inflation will intensify speculation that the Bank of England could cut interest rates below zero (their currently 0.1%, a record low), says Chris Bailey, European Strategist at wealth managers Raymond James: \u201cTalk of negative interest rates has been doing the rounds in recent weeks, but with inflation now trailing expectation, falling from 1.5% to 0.8%, that debate has become very real. All eyes now turn to the Governor of the Bank of England\u2019s comments later today for signs of further action to boost economic activity. The Bank of England does have room to move, if it wishes, and Governor Bailey has already laid out the red carpet for lower interest rates, so we can be sure it\u2019s at the front of his mind. Did your lockdown takeaway feel a little pricier this month? If so, you\u2019re not alone. Prices at fast food outlets and takeaway services rose last month, the Office for National Statistics reports. The largest monthly price increases came from takeway and delivery pizzas (up 7.3%) and takeaway burgers (up 4.6%). Although food prices fell slightly, vegetable became pricier - possibly due to a switch to British potatoes. The inflation report explains: Food prices overall fell by 0.1% between March and April this year.... The largest upward contribution came from vegetables (including potatoes and tubers), where prices rose between March and April this year but fell between the same two months a year ago. This month\u2019s price movements for vegetables could be a consequence of switching from internationally to domestically grown produce. Sky\u2019s Scott Beasley points out that this partly eroded the benefits from cheaper oil. The slump in the oil price has also driven down producer price inflation (basically, how much companies charge for their goods charge) to -0.7%. That means goods at the factory gate are actually cheaper than a year ago, suggesting consumer price inflation will remain low in the coming months. The ONS says: The price for materials and fuels used in the manufacturing process displayed negative growth of 9.8% on the year to April 2020, down from negative growth of 3.1% in March 2020. Petroleum products made the largest downward contribution to the change in the annual rate of output inflation. Crude oil provided the largest downward contribution to the annual rate of input inflation. Although overall inflation fell, the cost of games rose in April -- as families scrambled to find interesting things to during the lockdown. The ONS explains: There was an upward contribution (of 0.11 percentage points) from games, toys and hobbies where prices for items like computer games consoles, preschool activity toys, craft kits, dolls, construction toys, and sit and ride toys overall rose by 0.5% in the month compared with a fall of 5.8% a year ago. There were further upward contributions of 0.07 percentage points from data processing equipment, principally computer software, and 0.05 percentage points from recording media, including CDs and DVDs purchased online and music downloads. Stock shortages drove up wool prices rose last month -- perhaps due to isolating Brits taking up knitting? The ONS says: For other clothing and accessories, most of the upward movement came from balls of knitting wool, where there were recoveries from sales and higher price comparable items as a result of stock shortages in some stores. Petrol prices hit their lowest level in four years, today\u2019s inflation report shows: Petrol prices fell by 10.4 pence per litre between March and April 2020, to stand at 109.0 pence per litre, and diesel prices fell by 7.8 pence per litre, to stand at 116.0 pence per litre. In comparison, between March and April 2019, petrol and diesel prices increased by 3.8 and 2.3 pence per litre to stand at 124.1 and 133.0 pence per litre, respectively. Petrol prices were last lower in May 2016 (when a litre cost 108.7 pence), and the 10.4 pence per litre drop in petrol prices is the largest monthly fall since the current ultra-low sulphur or unleaded petrol series began in 1990. Good news for drivers! But there is a proviso. With millions of employees working from home, and non-essential driving curbed, few will have actually benefited much from cheaper fuel prices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to its lowest rate in over three and a half years last month, due to a drop in energy prices and discounting by shops desperate to sell stock during the Covid-19 lockdown. The Consumer Price Index plunged to just 0.8% year-on-year in April, the Office for National Statistics reports, down from 1.5% per year in March. That\u2019s its lowest rate since August 2016. In April alone, prices fell by 0.2%, bringing some relief to struggling households and firms. Cheaper energy bills and petrol prices has a downward impact on the cost of living. That\u2019s due to falling crude prices as the coronavirus outbreak hits demand, and the cap on UK energy bills. Gas prices, for example, fell by 3.5%. The ONS says: Falling energy and fuel pump prices resulted in the largest downward contributions to the change in the inflation rate between March and April 2020. Rising prices for recreational goods resulted in a partially offsetting upward contribution to change. Discounting was also a factor -- with clothes prices dropping last month during the lockdown: The ONS explains: For garments, prices overall fell by 2.3% between March and April 2020 compared with a small increase of 0.4% a year ago. There were a greater number of items recorded as being discounted this year, when compared with April 2019, with reductions across a range of women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothing items. The larger number of items recorded as being on sale could reflect retailers\u2019 efforts to encourage online purchases or potential difficulties as a result of the current economic situation. More to follow.... Also coming up today Inflation data from the eurozone and Canada are expected to also show a sharp slowdown last month. David Madden of CMC Markets has the details: Eurozone CPI for April is anticipated to fall from 0.7% in March to 0.4% in April. The core update is anticipated to be 0.9%, and that would be a fall from the 1% registered in March. The figures will be announced at 10am (UK time). Canadian CPI will be released at 1.30pm (UK time). The report is expected to be -0.1% and that would be a huge drop from the 0.9% posted in March. UK high street chain Marks &amp; Spencer is reporting results, updating the City on its performance during the lockdown. And there could be queues at your local McDonalds outlets, as the fast food chain reopens around 40 outlets across the county.

Henry Ford once reportedly said: \u201cWhy do I have to employ people when I only want their hands?\u201d Since then, permanent workers have fought for their right to decent treatment. The same must happen for seasonal workers. If that means changing the whole way that food is grown and paid for, then so be it. If the problem is market forces, then the market must be rebalanced \u2013 one reason poorer people can\u2019t afford fresh food is because many are paying rents of up to half their income. The current crisis could be an opportunity to stop regarding other people as resources and move to a less unequal, and therefore happier, society. Jenny Tillyard Seaford, East Sussex \u2022 Joel Golby doesn\u2019t realise that the long hours and low pay he is ranting against is the daily experience of farmers and growers across the UK, year after year. It will do this country good to experience shortages of fruit and vegetables this summer. Then we might begin to appreciate farming for the highly skilled, essential industry that it is. It\u2019s more than 40 years since food production was decently paid. Since the 1970s, government policy has driven down the price of food, supported by cut-throat supermarket supply chains. The surprise isn\u2019t that people aren\u2019t prepared to put up with conditions in horticulture. The surprise is that horticulture in the UK has kept going all! If we are ever going to get food security, there will have to be significant increases in farm incomes \u2013 higher prices in supermarkets and consumer acceptance of wonky veg. Jo Steranka Clacton-on-Sea, Essex \u2022 A relative of mine came to England to help with the harvest because the locals would not do it. That was my great-grandfather in the 1850s. Nothing changes.

      "body": "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On Tuesday\u2019s Late Show, Stephen Colbert addressed the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s latest shocking distraction tactic: his claim to reporters on Monday that he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">taking the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine</a> \u2013 a drug the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/trump-hydroxychloroquine-study-coronavirus\">Food and Drug Administration</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/trump-hydroxychloroquine-study-coronavirus\"> (FDA) has specifically advised</a> <em>not</em> to take for coronavirus as it has potentially lethal side-effects \u2013 as protection.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care how you feel politically, we have to protect the president of the United States. There\u2019s just no way to dismiss the seriousness of death,\u201d Colbert said, then cut to a clip of Trump telling reporters off-handedly: \u201cDeath is death.\u201d \u201cI stand corrected,\u201d said Colbert.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWPKPRC3B7g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pWPKPRC3B7g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s claim alarmed several public health officials, as well as the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/nancy-pelosi-fears-for-morbidly-obese-trump-after-hydroxychloroquine-admission\">told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper</a> she was concerned the president would take an unrecommended, potentially dangerous drug \u201cespecially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group \u2013 what is morbidly obese, they say\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that is a very polite way to say a mean thing,\u201d said Colbert, imitating Pelosi. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the president because he is, shall we say, 20lb of pudding in a 10lb sack. What I\u2019m saying is, your president is so fat that when he sits around the White House, he \u2013 shall I put this diplomatically? \u2013 sits around the White House, which is a very, very large building indeed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/19/trevor-noah-obama-commencement-late-night-tv\">Trevor Noah on Obama's commencement speech: 'The world's loudest subtweet'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pelosi\u2019s comments were panned by many, and \u201cit\u2019s important to point out that fat-shaming is wrong\u201d, Colbert noted. \u201cPlenty of wonderful people are old and fat and beloved, like Santa. But guess what? Santa shouldn\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine either.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about Pelosi\u2019s comments by a reporter, Trump retorted: \u201cI don\u2019t respond to her, I think she\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d</p> <p>Trump should know, Colbert said, as \u201che is the world\u2019s leading authority on wasting time. This one time, there was this huge, deadly global pandemic and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">didn\u2019t do anything about it</a> for like two months! It was a personal best in being just the worst.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>\u201cAre you serious? Trump has been experimenting with hydroxychloroquine?\u201d Trevor Noah said on the Daily Show on Trump\u2019s explosive comments. \u201cAt this point, what unhealthy thing isn\u2019t Trump doing?\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine, he eats fast food every day, and yet he is still alive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day we find an ancient cave painting and right in the middle of all the cavemen we find Trump, \u2018fake news\u2019, \u2018I never touched that dinosaur\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1262937457575723012\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump claims he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine, but let\u2019s remember: it\u2019s not what goes into his mouth that makes him an a**hole, it\u2019s what comes out. <a href=\"https://t.co/CM0xcm0g12\">pic.twitter.com/CM0xcm0g12</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1262937457575723012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>No one knows if Trump is telling the truth about taking the drug, Noah continued. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s trying to distract from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/pelosi-trump-steve-linick-firing-retaliation-unlawful\">inspector general story</a>, or from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html\">all the coronavirus deaths</a>, or from the fact that his most trusted adviser is actually one of those South Korean soccer dolls,\u201d said Noah, referring to Jared Kushner. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know.</p> <p>\u201cSo Trump is either taking a dangerous, ineffective drug or he\u2019s lying about doing it just for the LOLs,\u201d Noah added.</p> <p>As for Pelosi\u2019s comments on the matter, Noah could only facepalm. \u201cMocking the president\u2019s weight also makes a lot of people who aren\u2019t Trump feel like shit too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo please, just remember: Trump\u2019s not an asshole because of what goes into his mouth. He\u2019s an asshole because of what comes out of it.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2> <p>\u201cYou have to hand it to Trump \u2013 just when you think it can\u2019t get any crazier, he starts popping FDA-disapproved drugs and telling everyone else to try it, too,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on the hydroxychloroquine fiasco. \u201cOur president is a hydroxymoron. It\u2019s hard to process but are we surprised that the guy who thought windmills caused cancer thinks a lupus drug kills coronavirus?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwBIBrJMVCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NwBIBrJMVCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>To be fair, Kimmel continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump has any idea what drugs he takes every day. He\u2019s like a dog \u2013 Mike Pompeo just puts the pills in peanut butter and feeds it to him.\u201d So why say he\u2019s taking an unproven drug? Kimmel thought about it for awhile, he said, and came to the \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion: he\u2019s trying to kill himself.</p> <p>\u201cRemember how we all said he didn\u2019t really want to be president?\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWell guess what, I think we were right.\u201d Kimmel joked that Trump is trying to end his presidency with the dangerous drug, since \u201che\u2019s done everything possible to make sure no one would ever want to vote for him again: he colluded with Russia, he extorted Ukraine, he declared his love for Kim Jong-un, he made fun of John McCain, he threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans, he paid off a porn star, in the middle of a pandemic, he wants to reopen the mall.</p> <p>\u201cThe man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/22/not-too-bright-trump-trolled-for-staring-at-the-eclipse-with-no-eye-protection\">stared directly into an eclipse</a>, and none of it worked \u2013 he\u2019s still popular, and he\u2019s still trapped in that White House, and there\u2019s only one way out now: a big glass of bleach with a hydro and Z-pack chaser.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqPZ42isWbE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OqPZ42isWbE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers traced Trump\u2019s hydroxychloroquine comments back to his long history of shilling scammy products, such as Trump Vodka and Trump University. Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he\u2019s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it\u201d as evidence.</p> <p>\u201cYour evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Trump\u2019s gonna say and do crazy shit,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cHe failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he\u2019s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don\u2019t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it\u2019s a chess move or a planned distraction \u2013 the guy doesn\u2019t play chess. He doesn\u2019t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.\u201d</p> <p>The drug\u2019s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. \u201cSo either Trump\u2019s lying about taking it \u2026 or he\u2019s been taking it for 73 years.\u201d</p>",

Trump\u2019s claim alarmed several public health officials, as well as the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper she was concerned the president would take an unrecommended, potentially dangerous drug \u201cespecially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group \u2013 what is morbidly obese, they say\u201d. \u201cOh, that is a very polite way to say a mean thing,\u201d said Colbert, imitating Pelosi. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the president because he is, shall we say, 20lb of pudding in a 10lb sack. What I\u2019m saying is, your president is so fat that when he sits around the White House, he \u2013 shall I put this diplomatically? \u2013 sits around the White House, which is a very, very large building indeed.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s comments were panned by many, and \u201cit\u2019s important to point out that fat-shaming is wrong\u201d, Colbert noted. \u201cPlenty of wonderful people are old and fat and beloved, like Santa. But guess what? Santa shouldn\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine either.\u201d Asked about Pelosi\u2019s comments by a reporter, Trump retorted: \u201cI don\u2019t respond to her, I think she\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d Trump should know, Colbert said, as \u201che is the world\u2019s leading authority on wasting time. This one time, there was this huge, deadly global pandemic and he didn\u2019t do anything about it for like two months! It was a personal best in being just the worst.\u201d Trevor Noah \u201cAre you serious? Trump has been experimenting with hydroxychloroquine?\u201d Trevor Noah said on the Daily Show on Trump\u2019s explosive comments. \u201cAt this point, what unhealthy thing isn\u2019t Trump doing?\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine, he eats fast food every day, and yet he is still alive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day we find an ancient cave painting and right in the middle of all the cavemen we find Trump, \u2018fake news\u2019, \u2018I never touched that dinosaur\u2019.\u201d No one knows if Trump is telling the truth about taking the drug, Noah continued. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s trying to distract from the inspector general story, or from all the coronavirus deaths, or from the fact that his most trusted adviser is actually one of those South Korean soccer dolls,\u201d said Noah, referring to Jared Kushner. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know. \u201cSo Trump is either taking a dangerous, ineffective drug or he\u2019s lying about doing it just for the LOLs,\u201d Noah added. As for Pelosi\u2019s comments on the matter, Noah could only facepalm. \u201cMocking the president\u2019s weight also makes a lot of people who aren\u2019t Trump feel like shit too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo please, just remember: Trump\u2019s not an asshole because of what goes into his mouth. He\u2019s an asshole because of what comes out of it.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel \u201cYou have to hand it to Trump \u2013 just when you think it can\u2019t get any crazier, he starts popping FDA-disapproved drugs and telling everyone else to try it, too,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on the hydroxychloroquine fiasco. \u201cOur president is a hydroxymoron. It\u2019s hard to process but are we surprised that the guy who thought windmills caused cancer thinks a lupus drug kills coronavirus?\u201d To be fair, Kimmel continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump has any idea what drugs he takes every day. He\u2019s like a dog \u2013 Mike Pompeo just puts the pills in peanut butter and feeds it to him.\u201d So why say he\u2019s taking an unproven drug? Kimmel thought about it for awhile, he said, and came to the \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion: he\u2019s trying to kill himself. \u201cRemember how we all said he didn\u2019t really want to be president?\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWell guess what, I think we were right.\u201d Kimmel joked that Trump is trying to end his presidency with the dangerous drug, since \u201che\u2019s done everything possible to make sure no one would ever want to vote for him again: he colluded with Russia, he extorted Ukraine, he declared his love for Kim Jong-un, he made fun of John McCain, he threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans, he paid off a porn star, in the middle of a pandemic, he wants to reopen the mall. \u201cThe man stared directly into an eclipse, and none of it worked \u2013 he\u2019s still popular, and he\u2019s still trapped in that White House, and there\u2019s only one way out now: a big glass of bleach with a hydro and Z-pack chaser.\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers traced Trump\u2019s hydroxychloroquine comments back to his long history of shilling scammy products, such as Trump Vodka and Trump University. Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he\u2019s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it\u201d as evidence. \u201cYour evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cLook, Trump\u2019s gonna say and do crazy shit,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cHe failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he\u2019s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don\u2019t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it\u2019s a chess move or a planned distraction \u2013 the guy doesn\u2019t play chess. He doesn\u2019t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.\u201d The drug\u2019s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. \u201cSo either Trump\u2019s lying about taking it \u2026 or he\u2019s been taking it for 73 years.\u201d",

The agency has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Still suffering from a fall in donations from the public in the UK because of the Haiti sex abuse scandal, and heavily dependent on its shops in a number of European countries \u2013 to the tune of \u00a35m a week \u2013 Oxfam\u2019s other sources of funding had also begun drying up. Oxfam Australia had already made deep cuts earlier this month, while cuts in the UK to Oxfam GB were also foreseen. Oxfam currently operates in 66 countries and 20 affiliates. It will retain a physical presence in 48 countries, six of which it will explore as new independent affiliate members.

Although the international organisation had begun a 10-year strategic review in late 2018, the charity finances have been pushed to the brink by the coronavirus pandemic which has shuttered Oxfam shops in the UK, Belgium and Germany and seen fundraising events cancelled. Sources at the organisation said the announced cuts were seen as a first step to securing its survival but more were expected in the coming weeks and months. A statement issued by the organisation said the changes would enable Oxfam to be more effective in working with partners and communities to tackle global poverty and inequality and help people to survive humanitarian crises.

The first five deaths from the cyclone \u2013 three in the Indian state of West Bengal and two in neighbouring Bangladesh, were reported on Wednesday afternoon.</p> \n<p>More than 2 million people were evacuated from their homes in Bangladesh, and a further half a million people in West Bengal and Odisha were moved from vulnerable low-lying areas to shelters. The Indian navy was put on high alert to be ready to offer humanitarian assistance to those caught up in Cyclone Amphan, which is only the second \u201csuper-cyclone\u201d to form in the Bay of Bengal since records began.</p> \n<p>The director general of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), SN Pradhan, said the situation was \u201cfast-transforming\u201d as the cyclone moved across West Bengal and Odisha.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is another form of new normal, we have to handle disasters considering the pandemic too.

      "bodyText": "The Bay of Bengal\u2019s fiercest storm this century, super-cyclone Amphan, slammed into the coast of eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday afternoon, bringing heavy gales and the threat of deadly storm surges and flooding. The super-cyclone made landfall at 4pm local time with winds of about 120mph (190km/h), causing storm surges of up to 5 metres (17ft), before moving northwards towards Kolkata, one of India\u2019s biggest cities. The first five deaths from the cyclone \u2013 three in the Indian state of West Bengal and two in neighbouring Bangladesh, were reported on Wednesday afternoon. More than 2 million people were evacuated from their homes in Bangladesh, and a further half a million people in West Bengal and Odisha were moved from vulnerable low-lying areas to shelters. The Indian navy was put on high alert to be ready to offer humanitarian assistance to those caught up in Cyclone Amphan, which is only the second \u201csuper-cyclone\u201d to form in the Bay of Bengal since records began. The director general of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), SN Pradhan, said the situation was \u201cfast-transforming\u201d as the cyclone moved across West Bengal and Odisha. \u201cIt is another form of new normal, we have to handle disasters considering the pandemic too. In view of the prevailing Covid-19 scenario, all teams are equipped with PPE [personal protective equipment],\u201d said Pradhan. Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh\u2019s Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said. Embankments were also breached in West Bengal\u2019s Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge could inundate land up to 15km inland. Evacuation efforts had been hampered by the need to follow strict physical distancing precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, with infection numbers still soaring in both countries. Many people had also refused to leave their homes and be moved to shelters for fear of contracting the virus. Authorities in both India and Bangladesh said they were using extra shelter space to reduce crowding, while also making face masks compulsory and providing extra soap and sanitiser. \u201cEarlier we had around 5,000 cyclone centres and this time we will have more than 12,000: this is how we will maintain social distancing in the shelters,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, Bangladesh\u2019s junior disaster management minister. The Catholic Relief Services aid group said people faced \u201can impossible choice\u201d of braving the cyclone by staying put, or risking coronavirus infection in a shelter. In the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camps in Bangladesh, 306 Rohingya were moved from Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, where the government had controversially begun to house some of the refugees, to cyclone centres. Amnesty International urged governments to keep watch for up to 1,000 Rohingya refugees who may be stranded at sea in makeshift vessels. \u201cThey are in rickety boats, these are fishing trawlers that they use to take a very dangerous route in the hope of a better life. The Bangladesh government and others must do everything to save their lives,\u201d said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International\u2019s south Asia campaigner. There are also fears the storm will do large-scale damage to the Sundarbans forest reserve, a Unesco world heritage site across the India and Bangladesh border, which is home to 96 protected tigers and other endangered species. Storm surges of 5 metres could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and railway lines. Bangladesh\u2019s low-lying coast, home to 30 million people, and India\u2019s east are regularly battered by cyclones that have killed hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades. In 1999, the eastern state of Odisha was hit by a super-cyclone that killed nearly 10,000 people. Eight years earlier, a typhoon, tornadoes and flooding killed 139,000 in Bangladesh. Bangladesh authorities fear Amphan will be the most powerful storm since Cyclone Sidr devastated the country in 2007, killing about 3,500 people. Although outside the predicted direct path of the storm, there are fears for the safety of almost a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in south-eastern Bangladesh \u2013 most living in vast camps and housed in flimsy makeshift shacks. The first coronavirus cases were reported there last week, and by Tuesday there were six confirmed infections.",

      "bodyText": "More than 3,200 prisoners in California have contracted Covid-19 and at least 16 inmates have died, in a public health catastrophe that advocates say was both predictable and preventable. Inmates and advocates told the Guardian that at six prisons and jails with rapidly escalating outbreaks, basic protocols to prevent the virus from spreading are being ignored, and that they fear imminent mass fatalities and hospitalizations. Interviews with prisoners, their families and attorneys, along with internal records, reveal that: Some prisoners sick with coronavirus have complained that they aren\u2019t getting enough food and water while quarantined, and that they don\u2019t have access to doctors, temperature checks, basic medicine, phone calls, regular showers, outdoor time or sanitary supplies. Inmates have reported being reprimanded for wearing face coverings. At least one inmate was formally disciplined for trying to use bleach to help clean a prison. In one facility, prisoners assigned to make masks for others allegedly contracted Covid-19 in the process. Some prisoners with Covid-19 have been unable to talk to loved ones, who have been left uncertain if their relatives are still alive. Nationwide, more than 25,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 inside state and federal prisons, and at least 57 federal prisoners have died since that start of the pandemic. However, the true scope of the crisis is unknown given testing gaps, opaque reporting and a lack of data on county jails. California has released 3,500 prisoners early because of coronavirus, and reduced the population in its daily jails. But the state\u2019s prison system remains one of the largest in the world, and is still dangerously overcrowded. April Harris, 44, was recently placed in a roughly 10ft by 8ft cell with no windows at the California Institution for Women (CIW), located east of Los Angeles, after she contracted Covid-19. More than 100 inmates at the facility have tested positive for the virus. \u201cThe minute I toughen up and convince myself that everything will be OK, I\u2019ll hear crying or fear coming through the walls from other rooms,\u201d Harris told the Guardian through a prison email service last week. \u201cI feel like we are being punished.\u201d Experts warn that the rising rates of infections among California inmates could impede broader efforts to reopen the state, given the number of people employed by the prison system, the movement of prisoners and the scale of the outbreaks. The state\u2019s inability to protect prisoners, they warn, foreshadows how the US mass incarceration crisis will exacerbate America\u2019s botched coronavirus containment. Getting Covid-19 inside: \u2018Please help us\u2019 The prisons hardest hit are in southern California, the state\u2019s major Covid-19 hotspot, and are generally located in remote communities outside of Los Angeles, with relatively limited healthcare capacities. There are large outbreaks in two federal prisons \u2013 Lompoc, just north of Santa Barbara, where 1,078 prisoners have tested positive, and Terminal Island, in south LA county, where 686 prisoners have tested positive and eight have died. Just east of LA, two adjacent state prisons also have major outbreaks \u2013 there have been 593 Covid-19 cases inside the California Institution for Men (CIM) and 105 in CIW, the women\u2019s prison. In the surrounding region, 660 inmates in LA county jail have tested positive. The high infection rates have hit facilities where hundreds live in close quarters, unable to maintain distance while sharing bathrooms and sometimes sleeping in rows of bunkbeds. Prisoners who have long complained of unsanitary conditions and inadequate healthcare say the staff have failed to minimize the risks of Covid-19 transmission and ignored their medical needs and requests. As Covid-19 spread inside Terminal Island, Lance Wilson, a 35-year-old prisoner, sent his brother Jacque increasingly distressed messages in short letters, their only mode of communicating outside of infrequent five-minute calls. 18 April: \u201cWe are confined in these units and people are sick. All they are doing is spreading it to everyone.\u201d 21 April: \u201cHey bro \u2013 Things are getting so bad here. They are setting us up for a death sentence. Please help if you can. I know there is so many more people that have it but they are not testing us.\u201d 29 April: \u201cThere is 570 inmates that have tested positive. People are sick all around me. The likelihood of becoming infected is enormous.\u201d 1 May: \u201cI got my results back from the Covid-19 test and it came back positive. I have been having migraine headaches and body chills.\u201d 5 May: \u201cAnother inmate died. They don\u2019t know what to do. They just keep moving people.\u201d \u201cTo get that letter and not be able to talk to him, to not know if he is dead, the helplessness and hopelessness is so hard,\u201d Jacque told the Guardian. Lance, serving time for a non-violent drug offense, has asthma and was diagnosed with hypertension while in prison, said Jacque, who works as a public defender in San Francisco and has tried numerous legal efforts to get his brother released in recent weeks, so far without success. At Terminal Island, a low-security facility that incarcerates people with medical and mental health conditions, authorities have failed to isolate sick people or allow for distancing and have declined to allow home confinement for eligible prisoners, according to an ACLU lawsuit, which alleges \u201cunconscionable delays, blunders, and failures\u201d. Lance\u2019s 85-year-old father, a Vietnam war veteran, collapsed in a panic attack after reading his son\u2019s letters from prison, Jacque said: \u201cHe\u2019s saying, \u2018Why me? Why are they trying to kill my kids? I fought for my country.\u2019 To see my dad on the floor, you never forget that shit, never. My brother got Covid and they\u2019re not fucking doing anything. \u201cI\u2019m trying to save my brother\u2019s life. When Lance went into jail, he was healthy, and now he may not ever come out.\u201d Lance\u2019s condition hasn\u2019t worsened, as far as Jacque knows, but he hasn\u2019t heard from him in days and he has not seen a doctor. The US Bureau of Prisons, which oversees Terminal Island, declined to comment on Lance\u2019s case or the ACLU complaint, but said the facility has implemented \u201caggressive testing and an effective quarantine strategy\u201d and has begun to restore inmate telephone calls. The prisoners fighting to survive: \u2018You get retaliation\u2019 At CIW, the state women\u2019s prison, guards refused to wear masks when Covid-19 first broke out, and women would get threatened with write-ups for wearing their own face coverings, according to Colby Lenz, an advocate with the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, who is in regular contact with CIW inmates.

      "bodyText": "Virgin Australia\u2019s fast-dwindling cash reserves have rekindled union calls for a government bailout of the stricken airline ahead of a meeting of key creditors on Thursday. The administrators, partners at big accounting firm Deloitte, say they are likely to require \u201cinterim funding\u201d from the end of next month and have been discussing options with the federal government. They have also spent the past week obtaining court approval to avoid personal liability for the debts the airline continues to run up under their stewardship, in a bid to keep it alive long enough to sell it. In late March, as passenger bookings plunged due to the coronavirus crisis, Virgin Australia sought $1.4bn in government funding to stay alive until the end of the pandemic. But on Friday, the lead administrator, Vaughan Strawbridge, told Guardian Australia he had more than $100m on hand, which would be enough to see the airline through to a sale by mid- to late-June. \u201cCash has been unlocked within the business and cost reductions have been achieved,\u201d a Deloitte spokesman said on Wednesday. He said the administrators expected that \u201cthere will likely be a need for interim funding from the end of June, to when the new owner takes control of the business, and they have been developing a range of options accordingly and continue to keep the federal government informed\u201d. Michael Kaine, the national secretary of Virgin Australia\u2019s biggest union, the Transport Workers Union, said he would use a meeting of the airline\u2019s committee of inspection on Thursday to renew his calls for government intervention. He also raised concerns about cash outflows at bigger rival Qantas, which has raised billions by mortgaging its fleet and on Tuesday alarmed health experts by announcing it would reopen domestic flights without social distancing. He said some Virgin Australia workers had concerns \u201cabout any gaps in cashflow\u201d. \u201cCashflow is an urgent problem for any airline in the current environment where government restrictions have brought a halt to usual flying schedules,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cFor Virgin, the administrators are confident that there are cash reserves to see the airline transition to its next phase. \u201cBut the government needs to step in to do more to guarantee Virgin\u2019s survival and the future of aviation.\u201d On Wednesday, the federal court granted Strawbridge and the administrators orders exempting them from personal liability for overpayments under the jobkeeper scheme. The administrators told the court that more than 8,000 of Virgin\u2019s 10,000 employees appeared to be eligible for jobkeeper but they were concerned that there might be errors in the airline\u2019s system that created overpayments for which they would be personally liable. Wednesday\u2019s orders were the last in a series absolving the administrators of responsibility for most of the debts the airline continues to rack up despite the almost complete grounding of its fleet due to the pandemic. The administrators sought the court orders to try to maximise the sale price of the airline by keeping as much of it operational as possible. Virgin Australia\u2019s board appointed administrators on 20 April, after the federal government rebuffed a final plea for $200m in assistance. Four groups lodged bids to buy the airline before a deadline of 6pm on Friday: US investment group Bain Capital; private equity group BGH Capital, run by Australian Ben Gray; specialist aviation investor Indigo Partners; and Cyrus Capital Partners, a $4bn fund that specialises in investing in companies in financial distress. As part of the bidding process, they have been asked to set out what assistance from government they will be seeking. They have also been asked to explain how they propose to deal with a debt pile totalling almost $7bn. Kaine will represent the TWU at a meeting on Friday of a 36-strong committee of inspection formed by the airline\u2019s creditors to liaise with the administrators. Other members include pilot and engineer unions, airports, aircraft leasing companies and representatives of unsecured noteholders owed $2bn. Kaine said the federal government lacked a policy to ensure that Australia continued to have two airlines. \u201cOther aviation businesses are struggling with cashflow while Qantas is running to the markets every few weeks to mortgage its planes,\u201d he said. \u201cAviation is not an industry which the government can simply choose to let die and yet there is a stark absence of any policy to ensure its survival. \u201cA government plan must address immediate cashflow issues and develop a plan based on equity stakes, regional routes, decent jobs and ensuring that aviation can move away from the erratic boom-and-bust mode which for too long has defined it.\u201d",

Jade Costello, co-founder of the agency Melbourne Rental Search, said she was seeing something \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen before\u201d with landlords willing to negotiate on the price upfront. \u201cYou might see somewhere for $500 but the landlord will be willing to drop it because they just don\u2019t want places to be vacant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tenant\u2019s market for sure. For the time we\u2019re seeing tenants having the power of negotiation. They are going in with the rent they want to pay and landlords and agents, who used to have so many potential tenants to choose from, are saying whatever we can get we will take it.\u201d A couple were moving to Melbourne from interstate and were offered a place for $800 a week, she said. But they asked for a $20 reduction per week and it was granted straight away despite the listing having been up only a few days. The potential for the weakness in the rental market to spread into the housing market remains significant. In the latest sign that prices are under pressure, the research firm CoreLogic said on Wednesday that it was suspending the daily online publication of its closely watched index of house values due to the Covid-19 crisis. CoreLogic blamed \u201cmaterial reductions\u201d in transactions which had in turn created \u201cadditional volatility in the daily reading\u201d. \u201cA robust volume of timely sales evidence is a critical component of accurately estimating the value of residential properties,\u201d it said. \u201cThe monthly results of the index will continue to be reported, but should be interpreted with some caution until transactional activity returns to more normal levels.\u201d Louis Christopher, founder of SQM, said the economic uncertainty, rising unemployment and closure of the international border due to the pandemic would continue to put pressure on the housing market. Some investors might come back into the market despite falling rents, but there was a lot of doubt about how soon the normality could be restored after the current shock. \u201cIts hard to see it coming back to normal and hard to see a full V-shaped recovery in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is that international border opening again? You\u2019re looking at zero net migration and with 170,000 dwellings being completed in Australia this year, the domestic demand is only 70-80,000 so without migration there\u2019s a 100,000 surplus. That\u2019s a reality for builders.\u201d",

The increase in jobs for younger workers is likely to be linked to an increase in jobs in the accommodation and food services sector. This is mostly the result of a slight easing of restrictions and also just a bit of a rebound from an incredible drop. Accommodation and food, and the arts and recreation sectors were two of the industries that saw the best job growth in the first week of May but they are also the two which have suffered the biggest overall job losses. Even with a 5% increase in jobs in the first week of May, there are still 27% fewer job in the accommodation and food services industry than was the case at the end of February. That more than one in four jobs in the industry have gone in a month remains utterly shattering to contemplate, and also explains why the job losses are so decidedly varied across the regions. In New South Wales, for example, the Blacktown region has seen the smallest drop in jobs \u2013 down 4% (still astonishingly large), and yet it pales in comparison to job losses on the tourist friendly mid-north coast, which has had nearly 12% of jobs disappear: Across the country there is a clear sense that the areas that are suffering the most are those most dependent upon tourism \u2013 such as the Gold Coast (down 9%), the Sunshine Cost (down 10.2%) the SA Barossa region (down 9.6%) and Coffs Harbour-Grafton (down 11.2%): The erratic level of job losses looks set to continue as we move from shutdown to soft reopenings. The latest preliminary retail trade figures highlight just how far we have to go before things get back to \u201cnormal\u201d. In March total retail trade surged a record 8.5% off the back of panic buying and stockpiling of home goods to use during the shutdown. But in April came the hangover of that splurge and it was a killer. The ABS estimates that retail trade in April plunged nearly 18%: So great was the fall that the spending in April was the lowest it has been in any month since 2015 \u2013 when Australia\u2019s population was some 1.5 million smaller. And while of course there was the big spendathon in March, the combined retail trade in March and April was 1% below the combined amount spent in January and February. What this all means in the context of shopping centres reopening across the country is hard to say. Yes, there may be shops open, but will there be people spending money in them? It is not enough to announce that the economy is open \u2013 the economy actually has to open \u2013 and given how dependent we are on exports, that means open internationally. Tourism looks set to suffer for a long time yet. Domestic travel will help, but as one who last year had booked a holiday to Queensland for July and is now in the process of trying to get refunds, it is clear the snapback is not going to be fast. Anecdotally, people do seem to be frequenting retail shops in good numbers since the easing of restrictions (at least from my experience in the Australian Capital Territory), but it is all dependent on there not being another spike in cases, which would see people isolate themselves quickly and the job losses fall sharply yet again. But that means easing the restrictions will need to be done slowly \u2013 and that, by extension, slows the ability for the economy to return to any type of pre-virus level. There are some OK-ish signs in the latest job figures, but only compared with the worst period of the past two months.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has paved the way for negative interest rates in a dramatic move that illustrates concerns inside the central bank that the impact of the coronavirus lockdown will be longer and deeper than expected. Bailey said central bank officials were actively considering all options to help see the economy through a deep recession and told MPs that it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to rule out cutting the cost of borrowing to below zero. The move came after Britain sold a government bond with a negative yield for the first time. A negative yield effectively means investors have to pay to lend money to fund the government\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In searching for a safe haven for their money they bought gilts knowing they would get back less than they paid for them when the bonds mature in three years\u2019 time. The \u00a33.8bn gilt auction by the debt management office (DMO) sold three-year government bonds with a yield, which indicates the interest paid, of -0.003%. Only last month Bailey in effect ruled out cutting the Bank\u2019s own lending rate from 0.1% to below zero. However, the deepening crisis has persuaded the Bank that it needs to consider all tools available to make credit cheaper for embattled businesses and households. The move would be unprecedented in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history and would leave only the US Federal Reserve among major central banks to rule out negative rates. Japan\u2019s central bank and the European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 19-member eurozone, have already adopted negative interest rates to stimulate borrowing and discourage saving. Donald Trump has implored the US central bank in a series of tweets to cut rates to below zero as a way to boost the ailing US economy. More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April to take the unemployment rate above 14%. Bailey, who took over from Mark Carney in March, said the Bank was keeping the outlook for how low UK rates could go \u2013 and other monetary policy tools available \u2013 under \u201cactive review\u201d. \u201cWe do not rule things out as a matter of principle.

But that doesn\u2019t mean we rule things in either.\u201d He said the Bank believed the benefits weaken as rates approach zero and could even be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d when negative. Policymakers are \u201clooking carefully\u201d at the experience of other central banks that have cut rates into negative territory, he said, adding that the reviews were \u201cmixed\u201d. His comments come as official figures showed inflation plunging to a near-four-year low of 0.8% in April. Bailey is under pressure to use all the Bank\u2019s tools to stimulate the economy and bring inflation back to an annual target of 2%. After the 2008 banking crash, the Bank refused to adopt negative rates, arguing that building societies and other financial institutions would become unprofitable and could go bust if they were forced to pay to keep funds with the central bank. It is understood that officials remain concerned that negative rates would undermine the profitability of the banking and building society sector, though substantial increases in reserves of the last 10 years would provide a cushion, at least in the short term. The DMO is holding frequent gilt auctions to pay for the extra government borrowing resulting from the effective shutdown of the economy. Yields on gilts with a short maturity date are sensitive to City expectations about the future path of interest rates, and the drop in the annual inflation rate from 1.5% to 0.8% fuelled speculation that the Bank would act soon to cut rates.

The infection rate has been growing rapidly in Latin America, with Brazil becoming the country with the third most confirmed cases after it surpassed the UK on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, in Germany, open-air swimming pools began to reopen on Wednesday, as virologists said they were confident chlorine levels in the water would exterminate Covid-19. Authorities in the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia granted the 340 lidos in the region permission to open as long as they abide by new hygiene rules that include an online-only booking system and a daily cap on visitors.

      "body": "<p>The body that represents local authorities across England has set out serious concerns over proposals to reopen primary schools on 1 June, as ministers appeared to row back on the idea after sustained criticism from councils and school leaders.</p> \n<p>With just 11 days until the government\u2019s schools deadline, the Local Government Association, which represents most local authorities in England, said councils should be given access to local coronavirus testing data in order to safely reopen schools. </p> \n<p>\u201cAs there are different Covid-19 infection rates around the country, schools and councils must be able to work together to decide how and when schools open to more children. Some areas may want to work faster than others,\u201d said Judith Blake, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board.</p> \n<p>\u201cCouncils also need crucial testing data to be shared with them, to help enable greater confidence for teachers and parents around school openings, and powers to manage outbreaks in places like schools, care homes, businesses and communities if new Covid-19 clusters emerge.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government had said it wanted children in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 to begin a phased return to schools from 1 June, with other years following soon after, so that primary children have a month of school before the summer holidays.</p> \n<p>But the LGA\u2019s intervention came as more councils in England distanced themselves from the government\u2019s self-imposed target. Staffordshire county council, which includes the education secretary, Gavin Williamson\u2019s, constituency of South Staffordshire, was among those saying they would leave decisions on reopening to headteachers.</p> \n<p>The Conservative-dominated West Sussex county council also said it did not feel bound by the 1 June target, saying in a statement: \u201cIt is our view that any phased return to schools needs to be managed safely and the practicalities of that phased return need to be considered carefully against each individual school\u2019s risk assessment of what can be managed safely.\u201d</p> \n<p>Graeme Miller, a Labour councillor and leader of Sunderland council, was more emphatic: \u201cOur stance is clear: we cannot expect teachers, or children, to be in a school environment in Sunderland unless they know that it is safe for them, and there are serious question marks about that presently, based on the localised health picture in the north-east.\u201d</p> \n<p>Miller said the country \u201cwas on a knife-edge in our fight against Covid-19 at this moment in time\u201d, with only a limited understanding of whether, and how rapidly, children could pass on the virus.</p> \n<p>The government is now saying 1 June is not a fixed date and that ministers need to listen to the concerns of councils and teachers, with the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, striking a conciliatory note during a series of media interviews.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">guidance on face masks</a> has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the minister emphasised that the government was in listening mode: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to listen to what we are being told and also to engage and to persuade and to make sure the necessary arrangements are in place.

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Record number of tests conducted</strong></p> \n  <p>A record 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. The figures were announced after Johnson restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. The figures have often been criticised as misleading. Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests to see if people have had the disease. These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK death toll rises by 363</strong></p> \n  <p>A further 363 Covid-19 deaths were announced in the UK, taking the total to 35,704. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</p> \n  <p><strong>Government wants tourism to resume in July</strong></p> \n  <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government plans to allow tourism to begin in July. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefin he said: \u201cI would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We\u2019ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Dowden also announced plans to up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</p> \n  <p><strong>Bereavement scheme extended</strong></p> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus will be granted indefinite leave to remain. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. Announcing the move, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cWe are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set to track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence in the evidence \u2013 on Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 1,238.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit</strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. Labour said the breach raised serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T18:07:14.222Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec56ac18f0886ce4f5d74b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T17:40:44.222Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bereavement scheme extended</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give indefinite leave to remain to families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The move follows criticism that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/07/foreign-nationals-nhs-indefinite-leave-remain-coronavirus-covid-19\">care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme</a>, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers.</p> \n  <p>The extension of the scheme \u2013 which was originally announced last month \u2013 to include cleaners, porters, social care staff and care home workers will be effective immediately and retrospectively, the Home Office confirmed.</p> \n  <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others.</p> \n   <p>When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support.

But these figures have often been criticised as misleading.

Dowden said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sounded like an attempt to counter the impression conveyed by some ministerial messages that the government is in a rush to end the lockdown.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he was setting up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1#block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1\">5.21pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he wanted tourism to resume in July.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can.

Also very little independent study or research about how the app might function seems to be in place to understand the use patterns as they unfold. Technology use generally brings in unintended consequences, and it is difficult to know what these will be.</p> \n   <p>Manual tracing alone is too slow, and if there is a second spike it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to locate the contacts faster than the rate of new contacts are becoming exposed. The rapid transmission of the virus between people, is faster than the time it takes to do the needed detective work and phone calls to alert all exposed individuals. However, an app will not work on its own either, so best way forward would be a combined approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Joshua Moon, research fellow at the University of Sussex Business School, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have my doubts that this target will be met, given the issues with the app and the need to train contact tracers. Even then, 1 June is delayed at best - this is a system which should have been in place before the pandemic even started. Accounting even for this, the system is delayed in its scale up.</p> \n   <p>On top of this, the system needs an additional component: isolate. Testing, tracking, and tracing contacts and patients is not going to stop this pandemic unless patients are isolated, and contacts are tested and isolated. This system is going to have to develop as we go along, we need to pay attention to how well it works and adapt as we go along.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science, University of Edinburgh, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any voluntary use of the app would have to be supplemented by traditional contact tracing employing large numbers of people. As it is expected that all of these people will be newly trained, one should expect teething problems and therefore a considerable lag time before the contact-tracing programme is as effective as it could be and when surveillance and testing will therefore play its biggest role in ensuring that infection numbers stay low.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:57:14.743Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54e768f0886ce4f5d7349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:49:20.843Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier says 'new dynamism' needed to stop UK-EU trade talks ending in failure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday No 10 released the text of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886168/Letter_to_Michel_Barnier_19.05.20.pdf\">a letter (pdf)</a> sent by <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, to <strong>Michel Barnier</strong>, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in which Frost complained that the EU was just offering the UK \u201ca relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Barnier has now released<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/brexit_files/info_site/uktf-20203060790-mb-reply-to-df-wd.pdf\"> the text of his reply (pdf)</a>. In it, he confirms that Frost has proposed aiming for a less ambitious trade deal than originally envisaged, giving up on the aim of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement. (Barnier objects, saying this might take more time, and would not resolve the level playing field dispute anyway.) He says \u201cnew dynamism\u201d is needed to avoid the talks ending in stalemate.</p> \n  <p>And he restates the longstanding EU claim that the UK wants to \u201ccherry pick\u201d - to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, but not the obligations. Barnier says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Regardless of what your letter suggests, there is no automatic entitlement to any benefits that the EU may have offered or granted in other contexts and circumstances to other, often very different, partners. </p> \n   <p>Every agreement that the EU has concluded is unique, with its own balance of rights and obligations, tailored to the partner and era in which it is concluded.

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more fatalities from coronavirus, taking the death toll in Wales to 1,238. </p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit </strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year. </p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000.

As the Guardian reports today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-plans-for-contact-tracing-in-doubt-as-app-not-ready-until-june\">rolling out the app has been hit by some setbacks.</a> Yesterday the health minister Lord Bethell told peers the government would begin with the tracing rather than with the app. Asked about this comment, the spokesman said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the ONS was planning to publish more information about R, the reproduction number, tomorrow.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government had no plans to reconsider the two-metre rule. </strong>This morning <strong>Prof Robert Dingwall</strong>, a government adviser who sits on Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) told <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8339837/Government-scientist-says-2m-social-distancing-rule-based-fragile-evidence.html\">the BBC that the evidence for this was \u201cvery fragile\u201d</a> and that other countries adopted a different approach.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, will take the government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. </strong>He will appear with Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A source said that the Conservative party was still making plans for its autumn conference to go ahead</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/lib-dems-urged-to-axe-party-conference-and-switch-to-virtual-format-due-to-coronavirus\">Labour has abandoned its normal conference</a>, and instead plans an online event.

At first he resorted to bluster, accusing Starmer of ignorance and quoting broad-brush testing statistics to avoid the more specific question about why care homes are still not routinely able to access the level of testing that is supposed to be available. Challenging Starmer on fact is normally a grievous error, but instead of pressing him repeatedly on this, the Labour leader moved on to contact tracing. Johnson had a moderately effective retort when he claimed that Starmer was asking about matters which he had already been briefed on privately (which may well be true, although there is merit in Starmer forcing the PM to put these matters on the record), but what worked best for Johnson was that he was able actually announce something: that contact tracing will be up and running on 1 June, and able to trace 10,000 contacts a day. </p> \n  <p>Starmer did not seem to have anticipated this, allowing Johnson to accuse him of not listening. For the final two questions, on the NHS surcharge, Starmer was on stronger ground, and his point about a care worker on the minimum wage having to work 70 hours to pay for this was a powerful one. Johnson\u2019s defence was glib, but it did not feel like a decisive exchange.</p> \n  <p>So Johnson got through this without the humbling he endured last week. But to do so, he had to make quite a specific promise. When he first said that a contact tracing scheme capable of tracking 10,000 contacts a day would be up and running by 1 June, he made a firm commitment. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c#block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c\">12.38pm.) </a>Later in the exchanges he was a bit more conditional, telling Starmer:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What he heard is that we have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place, it will be in place by June 1.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, gave what may turn out to be a more realistic assessment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81#block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81\">7.48am)</a>, saying that although he hoped to see a contact tracing system in place by 1 June, \u201cit won\u2019t necessarily be as developed and full blown as we\u2019d like\u201d. At the next PMQs, in a fortnight, Starmer may well be asking Johnson why the promise made today has not been delivered.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dfb4aa49-4dbc-49bd-b530-86b788a0b359\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ux-vtBsVwqY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T17:46:34.761Z\">at 6.46pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec51bcc8f0864e579f14665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stevenmorris\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T12:01:05.692Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Welsh</strong> education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school.</p> \n  <p>She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40#block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40\">8.06am.) </a>Buckland was speaking in particular in relation to testing, but the statement has a wider application; in recent days there has been increasing focus on the consequences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1#block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1\">the government\u2019s decision to get elderly patients out of hospitals and into care homes to free up bed space.</a> Buckland\u2019s statement was not, in substance, very surprising \u2013 it has been obvious for some time that this is what has happening \u2013 but, given that most ministers find it near-impossible to admit anything that might look like a mistake, his candour was striking.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago Prof Martin Green, chief executive of<strong> Care England</strong>, which represents care providers, welcomed what Buckland said. Green told the programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s very significant because it\u2019s probably the first time that we\u2019ve had an admission that there was a priority for the NHS. We knew that from the very start of the pandemic, and in fact part of that challenge was that the priority for the NHS led to things like the disruption of PPE supplies for care homes.</p> \n   <p>In many ways I can understand why the government prioritised the NHS. I can understand why they wanted to make sure there was enough capacity, because if the pandemic had gone in the way that it was projected to go there would have been a huge need for hospital beds. So I\u2019m not trying to criticise them.</p> \n   <p>But I think with hindsight what we\u2019ve seen is that care homes are very much at the epicentre of this pandemic. But it\u2019s good to have government ministers acknowledging where we came from, that the NHS was the priority, and now I hope ... they will have learnt from that experience and start shifting their focus on to care homes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Green was more critical of the government\u2019s record in evidence to MPs yesterday. He told the Commons health committee that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52727221\">care homes were planning for coronavirus \u201cwith their hands tied\u201d</a> because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96456cde2e79bc93754ebc34823756fb1ea1e5c7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96456cde2e79bc93754ebc34823756fb1ea1e5c7/77_0_1763_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Martin Green\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Martin Green</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T09:42:25.762Z\">at 10.42am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec4f2ad8f0864e579f14440\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T09:13:46.448Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The travel industry is one of the most heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

She says the government has world-leading measures to combat extremism. There will be an independent review of the Prevent programme, she says.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Around 1,000 migrants are said to have arrived across the Channel since the lockdown. What are you doing about that?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is doing a lot. Border Force officers and others are working night and day on this, she says. People are being arrested and returned, she says. Drones and helicopters are being used. But the amount of beach space being used in France is \u201cvast\u201d, she says.</p> \n  <p>She says after the UK has fully left the EU at the end of the transition, it will no longer be bound by EU law. That will help, she claims.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: How?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel implies asylum rules will change. The UK will find it easier to return people who have come through a safe country before arriving in the UK to claim asylum, she says.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: You are passing an immigration bill. But haven\u2019t circumstances changed? You want to exclude some of the people we are clapping on Thursday nights?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel does not accept that. She says this is about opening up immigration to people from around the world.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: But you don\u2019t value these people?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel does not accept that. She claims that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about salaries at all\u201d. It is about skills, she says.</p> \n  <p>She claims the salary threshold \u201cis not the end determinator at all\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Do you think the scientific advice about care homes should be published?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, will be publishing its advice.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What work have you been doing on setting up a quarantine system?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says the government is still developing the policy. The Home Office is working with Sage on this, she says. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you be confident sending your child to primary school in June?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she would be. Children\u2019s education is vital, she says. She says this does not amount to rushing back to a full school day.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sanctions be taken against councils that don\u2019t cooperate?</em></p> \n  <p>No, says Patel. She says government and councils need to work together.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What happens if a teacher does not turn up?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she has seen some teachers do heroic work keeping schools open for the children of key workers and for vulnerable children.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sentences be increased for people who cough at police officers, threatening them with coronavirus?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is looking at that.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a closing summary of the main developments today: Johnson pledges UK-wide coronavirus tracing by 1 June Boris Johnson has pledged to have a UK-wide tracing operation to tackle coronavirus in place by 1 June run by 25,000 contact tracers. His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d Record number of tests conducted A record 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. The figures were announced after Johnson restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. The figures have often been criticised as misleading. Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests to see if people have had the disease. These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total. UK death toll rises by 363 A further 363 Covid-19 deaths were announced in the UK, taking the total to 35,704. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March. Government wants tourism to resume in July The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government plans to allow tourism to begin in July. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefin he said: \u201cI would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We\u2019ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Dowden also announced plans to up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again. Bereavement scheme extended The government has bowed to pressure to give families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus will be granted indefinite leave to remain. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. Announcing the move, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cWe are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively.\u201d EU response chief warns of second wave The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic. Northern Ireland set to track and trace for at least a year Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494. Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence in the evidence \u2013 on Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 1,238. Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday. UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year. Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. Labour said the breach raised serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence. MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby. The government has bowed to pressure to give indefinite leave to remain to families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. The extension of the scheme \u2013 which was originally announced last month \u2013 to include cleaners, porters, social care staff and care home workers will be effective immediately and retrospectively, the Home Office confirmed. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others. When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support. Today we are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively. Here are the main points from the government press conference. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said that 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. That is the biggest daily headline tally so far, and was announced after Boris Johnson at PMQs restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. But these figures have often been criticised as misleading. As the detailed statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website show, although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests (which show if you have had the virus, not if you have it now). These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total. Dowden said for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people the new government \u201cstay alert\u201d advice means they should stay at home. The \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan only applies to England, because the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations have not adopted it. Dowden said: Staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. This sounded like an attempt to counter the impression conveyed by some ministerial messages that the government is in a rush to end the lockdown. Dowden said he was setting up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again. (See 5.21pm.) Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March. Dowden said he wanted tourism to resume in July. He said: I would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We\u2019ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Clearly, we can only do it if it\u2019s safe to do so because I think the worse thing for our tourism sector would be to start, then see the R rate rise out of control, see a second peak that overwhelms the NHS that we then have to slam on the brakes again. Powis said Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, was keeping the two-metre rule under review. He said: The current advice is two metres. I\u2019m sure that, along with a whole host of other things, that will constantly be kept under review as new evidence emerges. This morning Prof Robert Dingwall, a government adviser who sits on Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) told the BBC that the evidence for the two-metre rule was \u201cvery fragile\u201d. Dowden said the policy on indefinite leave to remain for the families of migrant NHS workers who have died from coronavirus will be kept under review following complaints that care workers and cleaners are excluded. He said the birthday honours list was being delayed to allow for the inclusion of \u201cheroes\u201d who have contributed during the crisis. He urged the BBC to reconsider its plan to give up giving all over-75s free TV licences from August. The number of prisons with confirmed cases of Covid-19 has risen after a fresh outbreak was recorded, daily figures from the Ministry of Justice have shown. The number of prisons with confirmed instances of coronavirus had remained at 74 for two weeks but new cases were recorded at a 75th prison on Tuesday. As at 5pm on Tuesday, 432 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19, an increase of 10 or 2% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison workers rose 2% to 555 workers across 73 prisons in the same period. The total combined confirmed cases among prisoners and staff now exceed 1,000. There are about 80,300 prisoners in England and Wales in 117 prisons, while about 33,000 staff work in the public-sector prisons. At least 21 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died, as well as nine prison staff, including one worker in prisoner escort and custody services. So many people have headed to the north Devon coast that traffic wardens are running out of tickets, police said. Barnstaple police tweeted: The police said there was heavy traffic caused by people heading to the popular surfing beaches of Saunton and Woolacombe. Q: What is the government doing to prepare areas like Middlesbrough for future spikes? And in the north-east there is a high rate of infection. Does a one-size-fits-all policy work for the whole of the UK? Dowden says the government is under no illusion about the challenges facing the economy. He says he really hopes that the country can move forward at the same time. The new track and trace system should make a real difference, he says. Powis says it is usual in epidemics to see variation by geography. If the UK gets to the stage where individual outbreaks occur, then there will have to be very local responses. He says that is normal with managing infectious diseases. Increasingly these tactics will be used, he says. Q: And what will the government do to make towns like Middlesbrough a priority? Dowden says the PM is passionate about this. And Dowden says, as culture secretary, he wants to make sure cultural events are available outside London. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: If Premier League matches are played again this summer, should they be shown on free-to-air TV? Dowden says we have to respect the rights broadcasters have. But there is some flexiblity, he says. He says matches are not shown on Saturday afternoons, when people could be watching in a stadium. That won\u2019t apply. So he thinks there is some opportunity for getting matches on free-to-air TV. Q: Would you recommend that people use antibody tests that are commercially available? Powis says he would caution people about using them. He says it is important to know what they are like. And he says that he would not want people to think that if they test positive for the antibody, they do not need to take precautions. He says at this stage it is not clear what immunity people have. Q: Does that mean everyone will be able to get them on the NHS? Powis says the NHS will be using its test first for health and social care staff. Q: Are you happy for over-75 to lose their free TV licences later this year? Dowden says the government was clear the BBC should not take away free TV licences from all over-75s. The decision to postpone that until August was the right one. If we are in the same situation then, he says hopes the BBC will rethink Q: Should the two-metre rule be reviewed? Powis says matters like this are always being kept under review. Q: When will tourism return? Dowden says he is working hard to get tourism back up and running. But that can only be done when it is safe. He says the worst thing would be to open it up, and then have to put the brakes on again. Q: Why have NHS staff like cleaners been left out of a scheme giving the families of migrant healthcare workers who have died from coronavirus indefinite leave to remain? Dowden says that policy is being kept under review. Q: According to Public Health England, there have been zero new cases in the last 24 hours. Does that mean schools will open in London? Dowden says those figures are encouraging. And testing figures are encouraging too. He says there were 177,000 yesterday. We should try and open schools if possible, he says. Q: So will you let schools open in London first? Dowden says it would be best to move as one nation. Q: At PMQs the PM said patients were only discharged into care homes on clinical advice. It sounded like he was blaming doctors. Are you happy with that? Powis says his medical colleagues would have only discharged patients if that was the right thing to do. Q: At PMQs the PM seemed to gloss over mistakes with care homes. Is that the government\u2019s views. Or will you be open about mistakes you have made? Dowden says the government is not glossing over care homes death. Every single death is a death too many. The government has published a plan, he says. And deaths are coming down. Q: But Robert Buckland admitted this morning that things could have been done differently. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to follow Emmanuel Macron\u2019s example, and admit there have been mistakes? Dowden says, in any crisis, there will be a time for lessons to be learnt. But at the moment the public wants the government to focus on managing the crisis. Q: Are you confident a new contact-tracing system will be up and running by the time lockdown measures are relaxed, as Prof Dame Angela McLean argued yesterday? Powis says it is vital to get the R number down. Track and trace will be part of this, he says. But it is just one of several measures needed. In response to a question from a member of the public about when NHS staff will be able to return to their normal jobs, Dowden says the government has ensured the NHS was not overwhelmed. But now staff can start going back to other tasks, he says. In his opening remarks Dowden said he was setting up a taskforce \u201caimed at helping getting the country\u2019s recreation and leisure sector up and running again\u201d. Dowden will chair it himself. The culture department has released the names of other members. They are: Tamara Rojo (English National Ballet) Alex Scott (former England international and Arsenal footballer and now a sports broadcaster) Sir Nicholas Serota (Arts Council England chair) Edward Mellors (Mellors Group Events) Neil Mendoza (commissioner for cultural recovery and renewal, entrepreneur, publisher and philanthropist) Lord (Michael) Grade of Yarmouth (TV executive and former chair of BBC and ITV) Baroness (Martha) Lane-Fox of Soho (founder of LastMinute.com) Mark Cornell (Ambassador Theatre Group) Powis is going through the slides. Here are the figures for testing and cases. Even though the number of tests is increasing, the number of cases is stable or falling, he says. And here are the hospital figures. Powis says that for the first time since March, there are fewer than 10,000 people in hospital with coronavirus. Dowden says \u00a370m has been raised for charities on the front line from the BBC\u2019s Big Night In. Dowden says the birthday honours list is being delayed until the autumn, so that it can include honours for NHS staff and others who have contributed during the coronavirus crisis. Dowden is now summarising the government\u2019s strategy. He says for the vast majority of people \u201cstaying alert\u201d still means staying at home. Dowden starts with the latest death figures. He says there have been a further 363 UK deaths, taking the total to 35,704. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is taking the UK government press conference this afternoon. It is starting imminently. He will be with Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England. Raoul Ruparel, a Europe adviser to Theresa May when she was PM, has posted a useful Twitter thread on the Northern Irish protocol. It starts here. And here are two of his conclusions. Experts have raised questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to have a UK-wide tracing operation in place by 1 June and cast doubt on his claim that it would be \u201cworld-beating\u201d. In comments published by the Science Media Centre, Eivor Oborn, professor of healthcare management at Warwick Business School, said: We still have not seen convincing evidence that the technical features associated with the app will work as intended. Also very little independent study or research about how the app might function seems to be in place to understand the use patterns as they unfold. Technology use generally brings in unintended consequences, and it is difficult to know what these will be. Manual tracing alone is too slow, and if there is a second spike it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to locate the contacts faster than the rate of new contacts are becoming exposed. The rapid transmission of the virus between people, is faster than the time it takes to do the needed detective work and phone calls to alert all exposed individuals. However, an app will not work on its own either, so best way forward would be a combined approach. Dr Joshua Moon, research fellow at the University of Sussex Business School, said: I have my doubts that this target will be met, given the issues with the app and the need to train contact tracers. Even then, 1 June is delayed at best - this is a system which should have been in place before the pandemic even started. Accounting even for this, the system is delayed in its scale up. On top of this, the system needs an additional component: isolate. Testing, tracking, and tracing contacts and patients is not going to stop this pandemic unless patients are isolated, and contacts are tested and isolated. This system is going to have to develop as we go along, we need to pay attention to how well it works and adapt as we go along. Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science, University of Edinburgh, said: Any voluntary use of the app would have to be supplemented by traditional contact tracing employing large numbers of people. As it is expected that all of these people will be newly trained, one should expect teething problems and therefore a considerable lag time before the contact-tracing programme is as effective as it could be and when surveillance and testing will therefore play its biggest role in ensuring that infection numbers stay low. Yesterday No 10 released the text of a letter (pdf) sent by David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in which Frost complained that the EU was just offering the UK \u201ca relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions\u201d. Barnier has now released the text of his reply (pdf). In it, he confirms that Frost has proposed aiming for a less ambitious trade deal than originally envisaged, giving up on the aim of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement. (Barnier objects, saying this might take more time, and would not resolve the level playing field dispute anyway.) He says \u201cnew dynamism\u201d is needed to avoid the talks ending in stalemate. And he restates the longstanding EU claim that the UK wants to \u201ccherry pick\u201d - to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, but not the obligations. Barnier says: Regardless of what your letter suggests, there is no automatic entitlement to any benefits that the EU may have offered or granted in other contexts and circumstances to other, often very different, partners. Every agreement that the EU has concluded is unique, with its own balance of rights and obligations, tailored to the partner and era in which it is concluded. There is no model, no uniform precedent to follow in EU trade policy. Neither is there a right to what you admit are unprecedented UK proposals in a number of areas. Just as we do not accept selective benefits in the single market without the corresponding obligations, we also do not accept cherry picking from our past agreements. The EU is looking to the future, not to the past, in these negotiations. We have already covered the DUP response to the government announcement about how it will implement the Northern Ireland protocol (the Brexit deal keeping Northern Ireland in the single market). See 2.23pm. Here is some more reaction. Claire Hanna, the Social and Democratic Labour party MP for South Belfast, said Michael Gove had \u201cfinally confirmed there will be a large increase in the amount of red tape\u201d for businesses and warned that \u201ccastles in the air\u201d such as trade deals with the US would lead to increased checks in the Irish Sea. Sinn F\u00e9in said the checks showed the \u201cforked tongue\u201d approach of the UK government after months denying that trade barriers would be erected. Seamus Lehany, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said it was a \u201cpositive step that the UK confirms there will be some controls\u201d but that the language was so \u201cloose\u201d in areas that it was effectively putting the ball back in the EU\u2019s court. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it was a good start but questions remained. He explained: The UK government has acknowledged the need to deliver upon their obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. This acceptance of the hurdles that need to be overcome is a good starting point but there are still many questions that are left unanswered. This week on our Politics Weekly podcast, Jonathan Freedland and Kate Proctor, ask: why does the government keep setting itself targets it simply can\u2019t keep? They also discuss the hypocritical stance of ministers on the immigration bill. Plus, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, explains the case for decentralising government. No 10 has hinted at a tightening up of security for the UK technology sector in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The national security and investment bill is due to be brought forward in the coming weeks, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman has said. The announcement follows an exchange at PMQs where Richard Drax, a member of the defence select committee, said that France was reviewing its defence supply chain over concerns China is buying up defence companies on the brink of collapse because of coronavirus. He asked if it might be wise to row back on the plans to use Huawei to roll out the 5G network in the UK. The prime minister said Drax was right to be concerned about the buying up of UK technology now by countries \u201cthat may have ulterior motives\u201d and he would announce measures on how the country is protecting its tech base shortly. The PM\u2019s spokesperson said the Huawei decision is not being revisited but on the national security and investment bill he said Johnson\u2019s \u201cwords give you a good idea of some of the things we are thinking about. It has been an issue that attracted a lot of interest and a lot of concern in recent months and you won\u2019t have too long to wait for the legislation.\u201d More local authorities have expressed doubts about the government\u2019s plan to reopen primary schools for reception and year 6 pupils on 1 June. Kirklees council, in West Yorkshire, says it will be guided by the evidence not politics. Richard Watts, the leader of the London borough of Islington said: \u201cWe don\u2019t support rushing to hit an arbitrary target set by ministers.\u201d North Yorkshire county council says it is up to schools to decide whether it is safe to reopen. Waltham Forest council takes a similar approach. Campsites are experiencing a surge in bookings after health officials indicated they could be lower-risk holiday destinations than hotels, PA reports. The incoming 14-day quarantine for people arriving in the UK means many people are considering a domestic break instead of a foreign trip this summer. Campsite booking website Cool Camping said that Sunday was its strongest day for revenue since it began operating in 2006. It also recorded a fivefold increase in the number of bookings during the week after Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement about easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions on 10 May compared with the previous seven-day period. The prime minister said 4 July was the earliest date for hospitality businesses reopening. The deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said at a Downing Street press briefing that it was a \u201cbiological truism\u201d that being outdoors was safer than being in an enclosed space with people potentially carrying coronavirus. He promised to give \u201ccareful thought\u201d to what steps would be needed to allow campsites and caravan parks to reopen. Cool Camping marketing manager James Warner Smith said: The demand for camping is clearly there, and with foreign holidays on the backburner for the time being, people appear to be looking closer to home for their holidays this year. We also expect to see a lot more first-time campers in 2020. The Camping and Caravanning Club has urged the government to provide \u201cgreater clarity\u201d on how campsites can be safely reopened \u201cwith additional measures in place\u201d. The new public appetite for camping partly explains this bizarre front page from the Daily Star. Labour has criticised the data breach by Serco after the outsourcing firm revealed the details of hundreds of contact tracers who have signed up to work on the government\u2019s programme (see earlier). Helen Hayes, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: The government\u2019s contact tracing programme will rely on people having the confidence to pass on sensitive personal data to contact tracers. This data breach raises serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence. It is concerning that the government has so far failed to publish any information about the contract it has awarded to Serco. Far greater transparency will be needed if the public are to have faith in the companies entrusted to deliver key elements of the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Here\u2019s a summary of the main developments so far today: Johnson pledges UK-wide coronavirus tracing by 1 June Boris Johnson has pledged to have a UK-wide tracing operation to tackle coronavirus in place by 1 June run by 25,000 contact tracers. His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d EU response chief warns of second wave The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic. Northern Ireland set track and trace for at least a year Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494. Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more fatalities from coronavirus, taking the death toll in Wales to 1,238. Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February.

A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday. UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn.

The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby. The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job description fresh to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment. Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, is as Teutonically frank as one might expect in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began. \u201cLooking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges in from the different countries in terms of population immunity \u2013 which isn\u2019t all that exciting between 2% and 14%, that leaves still 85% to 90% of the population susceptible \u2013 the virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February \u2026 I don\u2019t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. Here are the main points. Unlike other lobby briefings, the post-PMQs one includes briefing from a source able to comment on political matters, as well as briefing from the PM\u2019s civil service spokesman (the official spokesman). The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the PM\u2019s commitment to have the contact-tracing system up and running by 1 June was a firm pledge - even though at one point in PMQs Johnson only said he had \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d on this point. (See 1.07pm.) But the spokesman also refused to back what Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, said yesterday about it being essential for a contact-tracing system to be in place before any further lockdown measures could be lifted. Asked if the PM agreed, the spokesman said that the government would be guided by the best scientific advice and that it would only open schools when it was safe to do so. He also stressed that, in the Commons this afternoon, the PM said a contact-tracing system would be in place by 1 June. The spokesman said the contact-tracing system would launch before the NHS contact-tracing app was ready to be rolled out nationwide. The app is supposed to be one element of the new contact tracing system. But the government now talks about \u201ctest and trace\u201d, not \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d. As the Guardian reports today, rolling out the app has been hit by some setbacks. Yesterday the health minister Lord Bethell told peers the government would begin with the tracing rather than with the app. Asked about this comment, the spokesman said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.\u201d The spokesman said the ONS was planning to publish more information about R, the reproduction number, tomorrow. The spokesman said the government had no plans to reconsider the two-metre rule. This morning Prof Robert Dingwall, a government adviser who sits on Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) told the BBC that the evidence for this was \u201cvery fragile\u201d and that other countries adopted a different approach. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, will take the government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. He will appear with Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England. A source said that the Conservative party was still making plans for its autumn conference to go ahead. Labour has abandoned its normal conference, and instead plans an online event. Asked about the Tory one, a source said that planning for it continued but that this was being kept under review. He said any final decision about whether to go ahead with it would be taken on the basis of the latest scientific and medical advice. A source defended the government\u2019s decision to try to install Sir Bernard Jenkin as chair of the liaison committee. The liaison committee comprises all select committee chairs, and its most prominent job is to take evidence from the prime minister several times a year. Johnson has still not appeared before it at all, even though he became PM 10 months ago. This evening MPs will be asked to vote on a government motion setting up the committee, with Jenkin as chair, even though Jenkin does not currently chair a select committee. Labour MPs are backing an amendment saying only a serving committee chair should be eligible to chair the liaison committee. They think No 10 wants Jenkin in the post because he will be soft on the PM. Asked why No 10 wanted Jenkin, a source said Jenkin was \u201ca distinguished backbencher\u201d with \u201ca long track record of holding governments to account\u201d. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland has risen to 494 after five more deaths were reported by the Department of Health. Meanwhile, Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced that the contact-tracing programme to track the spread of coronavirus in Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Swann said the estimate R number in Northern Ireland was between 0.7 and 0.8. Giving evidence to the Stormont health committee later, he said: \u201cWhilst we are by no means through the storm, the situation in our care homes has greatly stabilised, especially when compared to the ongoing situation in care homes across the rest of the United Kingdom.\u201d The minister described the contact tracing programme as a \u201cmajor commitment\u201d, adding that he expected the service to be in place for the next year at a minimum. This work is designed to break the chain of transmission of the virus by identifying people with Covid-19, tracing people who have been in close contact with them and supporting those people to self-isolate so that if they have the disease they are less likely to transmit it to others. Support from the public will be absolutely critical to the success of this strategy as we will be relying on citizens to report symptoms, be tested and to follow self isolation advice if recommended. Public Health Wales, has announced 14 more fatalities from coronavirus taking the death toll in Wales to 1,238. It also said that a further 110 people had tested positive for the virus taking the number of cases in Wales to 12,680. Even though the DUP opposed Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, and the way it created separate customs arrangements for Northern Ireland from those applying to Britain, the DUP has welcomed the way the government intends to implement this aspect of the deal (the Northern Ireland protocol). It has particularly welcomed the four key commitments stressed by Michael Gove. Here are the Gove commitments. There will be unfettered access for Northern Ireland\u2019s producers to the whole of the UK market and this will be delivered through legislation by the end of the year. No tariffs will be paid on goods that move and remain within the UK customs territory Implementation of the protocol will not involve new customs infrastructure - with any processes on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland kept to an absolute minimum so that the integrity and smooth functioning of the UK internal market is protected. Northern Ireland\u2019s businesses will benefit from the lower tariffs delivered through our new free trade agreements with countries like the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan - ensuring Northern Ireland firms will be able to enjoy the full benefits of the unique access they have to the GB and EU markets. And here is the full DUP response. NHS England has announced that a further 166 people have died with coronavirus in hospital, taking the total number of hospital deaths in England to 25,079. Those who died were between 33 and 99 years old, and NHS England said all but five had underlying health conditions. The full details are here. Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. The row came after last week\u2019s BBC Scotland\u2019s Disclosure programme revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. Sturgeon defended the decision not to inform the public about where these patients were infected. She said: \u201cThe cases from the Nike conference where all reported in the normal way through our daily figures. The reason that we didn\u2019t say where these people got the virus was down to patient confidentiality.\u201d She said as so few people were infected at the time, revealing the link to the conference would have risked revealing patient identities. Carlaw insisted that the public should have been told. He accepted there was a balance to be struck between patient confidentiality and public health, but he added: \u201cFor coronavirus that balance must clearly sit in favour of protecting the public\u2019s health. We do have a right to know.\u201d He said the contact tracing that followed the conference didn\u2019t happen at the appropriate scale. Sturgeon rejected this. She pointed out that 60 people in Scotland an a further 50 people in England were contacted after the conference. She said: \u201cLet\u2019s not engage in ridiculous language of secrecy are covered up to cover. It doesn\u2019t impugn my integrity, but it actually starts to impugn the integrity of the experts who managed this outbreak, including, I have to say Public Health England, who were part of the expert management team.\u201d Sturgeon confirmed that she would set out details on Thursday about how Scotland proposes to ease its lockdown measures. She said she was encouraged by the latest data showing a slower rise in the death rate from the disease. She said: The trends we are seeing do matter, and they provide further grounds for encouragement, in particular the number of Covid-19 deaths has fallen for the third week, and are almost half the level three weeks ago. Deaths in care homes and excess deaths have also fallen.\u201d Tomorrow, I\u2019ll make a statement and publish our route map about the steps we take the order in which we might take to carefully and cautiously return to some form of normality. The government has confirmed for the first time there will be Brexit checks on animals and food goods entering Northern Ireland from next January. In a statement to MPs Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that such a step would be necessary to ensure the entire island of Ireland maintained \u201cdisease-free status\u201d, with border inspection posts for agri-food arrivals at Belfast Port, Belfast international airport, Belfast City airport and Warrenpoint Port. There would also be \u201cexpanded infrastructure\u201d needed at some of these sites with Larne Port, where checks on live animals area already carried out, designated the principal port for livestock post Brexit. Details of the checks were disclosed in a 23-page document released by the government. (See 1.44pm.) They will provide reassurance to some business and political leaders opposed to the checks, primarily the Democratic unionist party but are likely to spark a fresh row over the Irish border is with the EU. The government has just published a document setting out how it intends to implement the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the withdrawal agreement that will allow Northern Ireland to stay in the EU\u2019s single market. There is a Cabinet Office summary here and the full report is here (pdf). In the Commons, in response to an urgent question, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, confirmed that MPs will abandon their mostly-virtual proceedings when they return on Tuesday 2 June after the half-term recess. He told MPs: Under the hybrid proceedings the time this house is able to spend debating legislation faces being cut by around two-thirds - I am sure all members will agree that each and every one of the 36 bills put forward by the government in the Queen\u2019s speech deserves the proper level of scrutiny. We have to recognise that if we persist with the present arrangement it will become harder to make progress in a timely fashion. That is why, in line with government advice for those who cannot do their jobs from home, I am asking members to return to their place of work after Whitsun. He said that the Speaker had tested a new voting system that would allow MPs to vote while remaining six feet apart. He also said that arrangements would be made to protect MPs who need to shield because they are extremely vulnerable. He said: I would finally like to reassure those members with underlying health conditions who have been told to shield or are receiving specific government advice about their health - we are working with the house authorities to see how they can continue to contribute to proceedings within the house. Rees-Mogg also said that, when MPs return after the recess, they will start sitting again regularly on Thursdays too. During the lockdown the Commons has only been sitting on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. After two weeks when Sir Keir Starmer broadly had the field to himself, this felt much more like a return to normal parliamentary service - a contested exchange, with no obvious victor, and both principals scoring points. Boris Johnson seemed to have put more preparation in than he did ahead of last week\u2019s PMQs and on the first four questions, on care homes, he got through reasonably comfortably. At first he resorted to bluster, accusing Starmer of ignorance and quoting broad-brush testing statistics to avoid the more specific question about why care homes are still not routinely able to access the level of testing that is supposed to be available. Challenging Starmer on fact is normally a grievous error, but instead of pressing him repeatedly on this, the Labour leader moved on to contact tracing. Johnson had a moderately effective retort when he claimed that Starmer was asking about matters which he had already been briefed on privately (which may well be true, although there is merit in Starmer forcing the PM to put these matters on the record), but what worked best for Johnson was that he was able actually announce something: that contact tracing will be up and running on 1 June, and able to trace 10,000 contacts a day. Starmer did not seem to have anticipated this, allowing Johnson to accuse him of not listening. For the final two questions, on the NHS surcharge, Starmer was on stronger ground, and his point about a care worker on the minimum wage having to work 70 hours to pay for this was a powerful one. Johnson\u2019s defence was glib, but it did not feel like a decisive exchange. So Johnson got through this without the humbling he endured last week. But to do so, he had to make quite a specific promise. When he first said that a contact tracing scheme capable of tracking 10,000 contacts a day would be up and running by 1 June, he made a firm commitment. (See 12.38pm.) Later in the exchanges he was a bit more conditional, telling Starmer: What he heard is that we have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place, it will be in place by June 1. This morning Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, gave what may turn out to be a more realistic assessment (see 7.48am), saying that although he hoped to see a contact tracing system in place by 1 June, \u201cit won\u2019t necessarily be as developed and full blown as we\u2019d like\u201d. At the next PMQs, in a fortnight, Starmer may well be asking Johnson why the promise made today has not been delivered. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Having a \u201crobust\u201d test and trace regime up and running was an important factor in the return of more pupils. \u201cI will not set an arbitrary date for when more children will go back to Welsh schools,\u201d she said. Williams said thousands of teachers in Wales were already going to school to look after the children of critical workers and vulnerable children. She added that teachers across Wales had been coming forward with ideas for the next steps and said the Labour-led government\u2019s relationship with the teaching unions was positive. Asked about the safety of teachers, she said: \u201cAt the forefront of my mind is the health and emotional wellbeing of staff and children.\u201d She said it was impossible to give 100% guarantees about safety but said: What is incumbent on me is that we manage these risks as much as possible and create an environment that is as safe as it can possibly be. Williams has published a resilience plan for post-16 learning, setting out how the Welsh government will work with colleges, universities and training providers. This is what Boris Johnson said to Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs when he committed to having a contact tracking system in place by 1 June. Johnson said: I can tell him also that by June 1, already we have recruited 24,000 trackers and by June 1 we will have 25,000. They will be capable of tracking the contacts of 10,000 new cases a day. The union representing the majority of workers in the meat and poultry processing industries in Northern Ireland has warned of a \u201cgrowing number of clusters\u201d of Covid-19 around factories in County Tyrone. Unite claimed that the localised spikes in workers infected were in areas close to Foyle Meats in Omagh and Linden Foods in Dungannon. Political leaders at the devolved assembly at Stormont were challenged to have the factories closed temporarily while coronavirus checks are carried out on all workers there. Davy Kettyles, lead Unite organiser in the region said there should be no repeat in the meat processing/packaging industry of what was happening in the care home sector. He said: In the USA more than 10,000 meatpackers have caught Covid-19, with at last 45 deaths. We are determined to avoid a similar crisis. We need to see sites where clusters are being identified shut down immediately but temporarily while tests are completed for all workers. Those workers need to be fully paid for the duration of the testing period. Lucy Allan, a Conservative, asks if young people will be prioritised in the recovery. Johnson says a new national skills fund worth \u00a32.5bn will prioritise the interests of the young. The rise in the number of deaths from Covid-19 in Scotland has slowed for the third successive week, with 332 fatalities recorded last week, although care homes are again the source of a majority of deaths. The latest weekly data from National Records of Scotland shows that the number of Covid-19 deaths in all settings, such as hospitals, care homes or in the wider community, has continued to decline. The total number of people in Scotland now recorded to have died from Covid-19 stands at 3,546, compared to 3,214 the week ending 10 May. NRS said that to date, 46% of all registered Covid-19 deaths occurred in care homes, compared to 47% in hospitals, with 76% aged 75 or over. Overall, Covid-19 accounted for just 23% of all deaths recorded in Scotland last week, compared to a peak of 36% in one week in late April. The number of Covid-19 deaths in care homes fell by 54 compared to the previous week, to 184 but those accounted for 55% of the total last week. NRS said 1,415 deaths were registered in Scotland in the week from 11 May, 33% more than the average in that week in the previous five years. Of the 351 excess deaths recorded last week, Covid-19 was given as the underlying cause of death. The SNP\u2019s Marion Fellows asks about reports that the furlough scheme will be ended even if the lockdown continues in Scotland. Johnson says he is happy with the level of cooperation between Scotland and the UK government. The SNP\u2019s Allan Dorans asks Johnson to condemn Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, for making a 700-mile round trip today just to be in the chamber for PMQs. He could have contributed virtually. Johnson says he won\u2019t. He says Jack does an admirable job. Labour\u2019s Rosie Duffield says there should be more women at the top of government and on Sage. Only one woman has led the daily press conferences in the last few weeks, he says. Johnson says he agrees with this. Dido Harding is now in charge of testing, he says. And he says Kate Bingham has been put in charge of the vaccine taskforce. The SDLP\u2019s Colum Eastwood says the government is pressing ahead with a no-deal Brexit that will damage Northern Ireland. Johnson does not accept this. Implying a trade deal is possible, he says he spoke to the Irish PM recently and they agreed on much. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says the UK should follow France, and buy up technology companies at risk of being bought up by China. Johnson says the government is bringing forward measures to protect its technological base. It will say more on this in the coming weeks. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says MPs will be thinking about the cyclone hitting India and Bangladesh. He turns to the NHS, and praises the contribution of migrant workers. Acknowledging Starmer has raised this already, he asks whether Johnson is embarrassed about the fact that this government does not value low-paid workers. Johnson says the reason for the bill is not to keep out people who help the NHS. People want an immigration system under the government\u2019s control. Blackford says the harsh reality is that NHS and care staff are not even paid the real living wage. He says the cruel NHS surcharge should be removed immediately. Will the PM promise that? Or will he clap on Thursday hoping no one will notice he is clapping with one hand, and raking it in with another. Johnson says the value of the living wage has gone up under this government. And the SNP would put a border at Berwick, he says. Johnson says funding for town centres will continue. He quotes what is available for Hyndburn. Starmer asks about the NHS surcharge that foreign migrants have to pay. Johnson says this raises \u00a3900m for the NHS. He does think it is the right way forward. Starmer says the fee is \u00a3400 a year. It will go up to \u00a3625 a year. He says a care worker on the minimum wage would have to work 70 hours to pay this off. Labour will table an amendment to the immigration bill to exempt NHS and care workers, he says. Will the government support it? Johnson says he has addressed this. But he does want to see frontline workers paid properly. He is putting record amounts into the NHS, he says. Starmer says that 30,000 deaths is a serious matter. Of course he has to ask about this. This will be the last PMQs for two weeks. Will an effective track and tracing system be in place on 1 June? Johnson says Starmer was not listening. He says he has \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d that the UK will have a world-beating system, and it will be in place by 1 June. There will be 25,000 trackers, able to trace 10,000 contacts a day, he says. He urges Starmer to support the government as it goes forward, so that they can work together. Starmer says the Care England boss told MPs that routine testing was not happening. He is not putting his own view. The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, reprimands Matt Hancock for heckling. Starmer says Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific adviser, said yesterday that we should follow South Korea. He says for 10 weeks there has not be a testing system in place. Johnson says Starmer has been briefed on this in private. He accuses of Starmer of \u201cfeigned ignorance\u201d. A contact tracing system will be in place, he says. He says 24,000 contact tracers have now been hired (up from 21,000, the figure announced on Monday.) He urges Starmer not to adopt this tone. Starmer says Johnson missed the point. He says he asked about why patients weren\u2019t tested when being discharged into care homes. And he quotes the Care England boss again saying that the care sector does not know when full testing for residents and staff will take place. He say a government paper promised this for early June. Why is this not happening? Johnson says Starmer is ignorant of the facts. He quotes figures for how many tests have been carried out. He says testing will hit 200,000 a day by the end of this month. He says the UK is testing more than any other country in Europe. Sir Keir Starmer says Matt Hancock said on Friday that the government had tried to throw a \u201cprotective ring\u201d around care homes from the start. Yesterday the Care England chief executive contradicted that. (See 10.40am.) Johnson says no one was discharged into a care home without the express authorisation of a clinician. And the number of people being discharged into care homes in March was 40% down on January. He says the number of deaths in care homes has fallen by 31% since he was last in the Commons. Labour\u2019s Claudia Webbe asks what the government is doing to protect BAME people from coronavirus. Johnson says a \u201crapid review\u201d is being conducted. Steps will be taken to protect vulnerable groups, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying that 181 NHS staff and 131 social care workers have now died from coronavirus. From the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley PMQs is about to start. Here is the \u201ccall list\u201d (pdf) showing which MPs are down to ask a question. Ahead of PMQs, Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, had some advice for Boris Johnson. It was also advice for Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, but it is particularly relevant to PMQs. In an interview on Sky News Davidson was asked whether she thought the UK government or the Scottish government had handled the coronavirus crisis better. She pointedly refused to answer (although she did praise Sturgeon as a communicator: \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, the comms strategy in Scotland has been very good. I think the problem has been the delivery.\u201d) But she said both government\u2019s needed to show more humility. She said: I do think that people want to see an element of humility from both our governments. And they want to see where mistakes happen. They will forgive them ... if people are honest about it. She particularly welcomed what Robert Buckland said earlier. (See 8.06am.) She said: I\u2019m really pleased that we saw the justice secretary down south saying \u2018Actually, we did prioritise the NHS over care homes and now we\u2019re learning from that\u2019 because it shows learning at the same time. I think people would be a lot more sympathetic if both governments showed their workings more and were able to say \u2018We got that one wrong, but we know why we got it wrong and we\u2019re not going to get it wrong again.\u2019 British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed, our colleague Richard Adams reports. During his candour tour of the broadcast studios this morning, as well as giving fairly straight answers on contact tracing (see 7.48am), care homes (see 8.06am) and schools reopening (see 8.40am), Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, also admitted the government did not have comprehensive information about coronavirus in February. He made the point as he delivered the strongest rebuke we\u2019ve heard from the government so far to what Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, said about scientists yesterday. To recap, Coffey told Sky News: You can only make judgments and decisions based on the information and the advice you have at the time ... If the science was wrong, if the advice at the time was wrong, I am not surprised if people think we made the wrong decision. Saying that wrong science advice would have led to bad decisions being taken is not quite the same as saying that, if wrong decisions were taken, that must have been because the scientific advice was flawed. But it is coming close to saying that, and since Coffey\u2019s interview yesterday morning, Downing Street has been distancing itself from her stance. Asked about Coffey\u2019s comment this morning, Buckland said: I think we should all be ... working together. I think pointing fingers and blaming people is extremely unproductive. I think it is important we acknowledge this is an evolving picture. What we knew about the virus in February or March is a world away from what we know about it now. And, of course, in June and July we will know even more about its characteristics and what it does ... It would be very difficult now to judge what happened in March, bearing in mind the change in our knowledge. McDonald\u2019s has announced 33 UK restaurants will reopen for drive-through customers from 11am today, including six in Peterborough, four in Ipswich and three in Luton, PA Media reports. Customers will be allowed a maximum spend of \u00a325 per car and be encouraged to use contactless payments, while staff will be temperature checked on arrival at work, operate in smaller teams and provide a reduced menu, the company said. This morning Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, said government policy as the coronavirus pandemic struck was to prioritise the NHS ahead of care homes. (See 8.06am.) Buckland was speaking in particular in relation to testing, but the statement has a wider application; in recent days there has been increasing focus on the consequences of the government\u2019s decision to get elderly patients out of hospitals and into care homes to free up bed space. Buckland\u2019s statement was not, in substance, very surprising \u2013 it has been obvious for some time that this is what has happening \u2013 but, given that most ministers find it near-impossible to admit anything that might look like a mistake, his candour was striking. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, which represents care providers, welcomed what Buckland said. Green told the programme: I think it\u2019s very significant because it\u2019s probably the first time that we\u2019ve had an admission that there was a priority for the NHS. We knew that from the very start of the pandemic, and in fact part of that challenge was that the priority for the NHS led to things like the disruption of PPE supplies for care homes. In many ways I can understand why the government prioritised the NHS. I can understand why they wanted to make sure there was enough capacity, because if the pandemic had gone in the way that it was projected to go there would have been a huge need for hospital beds. So I\u2019m not trying to criticise them. But I think with hindsight what we\u2019ve seen is that care homes are very much at the epicentre of this pandemic. But it\u2019s good to have government ministers acknowledging where we came from, that the NHS was the priority, and now I hope ... they will have learnt from that experience and start shifting their focus on to care homes. Green was more critical of the government\u2019s record in evidence to MPs yesterday. He told the Commons health committee that care homes were planning for coronavirus \u201cwith their hands tied\u201d because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April. The travel industry is one of the most heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. But the head of the pilots\u2019 union, the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), has told MPs that airlines are \u201cexaggerating\u201d the scale of the problem so they can cut jobs. Brian Strutton, Balpa\u2019s general secretary, told the Commons transport select committee: I believe that airlines are exaggerating the problem. The predictions that some of the airline leaders are saying, of up to a five- or six-year recovery, is not in line with industry standard predictions. The planemaker Airbus is among the companies making apocalyptic warnings about the future of the travel industry. It said last month that aviation could take as long as five years to recover to pre-coronavirus levels. Leading companies including British Airways and, just this morning, Rolls-Royce have announced plans to cut thousands of jobs. But Balpa, which represents more than 10,000 pilots in the UK (85% of all commercial pilots), said the concerns were being overplayed. Strutton said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a trough at the moment, we will be coming out of it over the next two and a half years, and I think that airlines are egging the pudding too much to take advantage of the crisis to make changes and downsize their workforce unnecessarily.\u201d The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby. Described by the MoD as the Covid support force, these troops have been held ready since 18 March. The Liberal Democrats are to hold a leadership election this summer to choose a replacement for Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the general election. The contest was originally due this spring, but was then postponed until next year after the coronavirus crisis struck. But yesterday the party\u2019s federal board agreed the contest will take place this year, with nominations opening on 24 June and closing on 9 July. The ballot will then open on July 30 and close on August 26, after which the party will announce its next leader. Sir Ed Davey, the acting leader, and Layla Moran, the education spokeswoman, are seen as the main candidates. Here are the items on the agenda for today. 9.30am: Unions, air industry officials and Kelly Tolhurst the transport minister give evidence to the Commons transport committee about aviation and coronavirus. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily coronavirus briefings. After 12.30pm: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, responds to an urgent question about how the Commons will operate after next week\u2019s recess. Rees-Mogg would like it to return to operating relatively normally, not virtually. After 1pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is due to make a statement in the Commons about how the government intends to implement Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement effectively putting a customs border down the Irish Sea. 1.30pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2pm: Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, holds a press conference. 2.30pm: The Equality and Human Rights Commission gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee on coronavirus. 5pm: The UK government is due to hold its daily press conference. Q: What do you say about reports that in some jails extremists are running their own version of sharia law? Priti Patel, the home secretary, tells LBC she is aware of many things. She says the government has world-leading measures to combat extremism. There will be an independent review of the Prevent programme, she says. Q: Around 1,000 migrants are said to have arrived across the Channel since the lockdown. What are you doing about that? Patel says she is doing a lot. Border Force officers and others are working night and day on this, she says. People are being arrested and returned, she says. Drones and helicopters are being used. But the amount of beach space being used in France is \u201cvast\u201d, she says. She says after the UK has fully left the EU at the end of the transition, it will no longer be bound by EU law. That will help, she claims. Q: How? Patel implies asylum rules will change. The UK will find it easier to return people who have come through a safe country before arriving in the UK to claim asylum, she says. Q: You are passing an immigration bill. But haven\u2019t circumstances changed? You want to exclude some of the people we are clapping on Thursday nights? Patel does not accept that. She says this is about opening up immigration to people from around the world. Q: But you don\u2019t value these people? Patel does not accept that. She claims that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about salaries at all\u201d. It is about skills, she says. She claims the salary threshold \u201cis not the end determinator at all\u201d. Q: Do you think the scientific advice about care homes should be published? Patel says Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, will be publishing its advice. Q: What work have you been doing on setting up a quarantine system? Patel says the government is still developing the policy. The Home Office is working with Sage on this, she says. Q: Would you be confident sending your child to primary school in June? Patel says she would be. Children\u2019s education is vital, she says. She says this does not amount to rushing back to a full school day. Q: Should sanctions be taken against councils that don\u2019t cooperate? No, says Patel. She says government and councils need to work together. Q: What happens if a teacher does not turn up? Patel says she has seen some teachers do heroic work keeping schools open for the children of key workers and for vulnerable children. Q: Should sentences be increased for people who cough at police officers, threatening them with coronavirus? Patel says she is looking at that. She says she would like to double the sentences available. (Currently a common assault of this kind aimed specifically at an emergency worker is punishable by up to a year in jail.) Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce \u2013 amid the continuing coronavirus crisis, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, its chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic. Our business correspondent, Mark Sweney, has written more about the cuts here. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is about to give an interview to LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari. Despite being one of the most senior ministers in cabinet, she is rarely put up for interviews by No 10. She is talking about government plans to allow terrorism suspects to be subject to terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) indefinitely, not for just two years, as now. My colleague Jamie Grierson has the story here. He\u2019s the hero of the hour, \u201ca beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus,\u201d in the words of the prime minister: Captain Tom Moore is to be knighted. The 100-year-old veteran, who raised an incredible \u00a332m for the NHS by walking laps of his back garden, will officially be titled Captain Sir Thomas Moore under Ministry of Defence protocol. His knighthood has been approved by the Queen and will be announced formally later today. Captain Tom was on sparkling form on BBC Breakfast this morning, telling viewers he was \u201ccertainly delighted and I am overawed by the fact that this has happened to me\u201d. Watch some of the interview below. The justice secretary Robert Buckland has repeated in his morning interviews that the 1 June date for reopening primary schools is not a fixed date. It now seems extremely likely that not all primary schools will be retuning in under a fortnight \u2013 and that the government will not force schools to open. \u201cThe 1st of June was a conditional date, the five tests [more on those here] still apply, testing and tracing is clearly our priority \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve recruited so many volunteers and we\u2019re still working on the pilot app in the Isle of Wight,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said the government would not dictate that all primary schools should reopen by 1 June and that it was listening to the concerns of teachers, while also trying to \u201cengage and persuade\u201d. But he added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend we\u2019ll have a full system by the end of this month.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Norman Smith adds: Cambridge has become the first university to move all \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d online for the full 2020-21 academic year. The institution said that it was \u201clikely\u201d social distancing would continue to be required. The university said lectures would continue virtually until summer 2021, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it \u201cconforms to social-distancing requirements\u201d. All teaching at the university was moved online in March. Exams are being carried out virtually. Read the full story here. Outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers, the BBC reports. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. The BBC says it understands that at least one employee has complained to the information commissioner about the breach. They report: The error did not involve patients\u2019 data but will be unhelpful for a contact tracing project that is set to ask many thousands of people who have fallen ill to share the details of their friends and acquaintances. Serco wrote the email to tell new trainees not to contact its help desk looking for training details. But the staff member who sent it put their email addresses in the CC section of the email, rather than the blind CC section - revealing them to every recipient. On Sky News, the justice secretary Robert Buckland confirmed that government policy was to protect the NHS ahead of care homes due to the limited testing capacity available in March and April. Asked by Kay Burley whether the government focused on the NHS \u201cto the detriment of care homes,\u201d Buckland said: I think we needed to make a choice about testing and we did decide to focus upon the NHS. The issue with care homes is that we\u2019ve got many thousands of different providers, different settings, there have been lots of examples of care homes that have mercifully stayed infection free, but sadly far too many cases of infection and then death. Pointing out that deaths in care homes represented 40.4% of all coronavirus fatalities in England and Wales in the week to 1 May, Burley again asked Buckland to confirm that government policy was to protect the NHS first and foremost. He replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right and I think that was essential. Now is not the time to blame people, I think that would be wholly counter productive.\u201d The justice secretary Robert Buckland is doing the broadcast round for the government this morning. On BBC Breakfast, he was repeatedly asked about the concerns around primary schools reopening on 1 June. Buckland said he\u2019s \u201cnot going to sit here and pretend that on 1 June everything will be uniform \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s my hope\u201d. He said the government was \u201cvery much in listening mode, talking to the relevant bodies, we\u2019re not trying to dictate things,\u201d adding: We\u2019ve said we hope it see schools open on 1 June and that\u2019s still our hope as the situation continues to evolve. Buckland was pressed on when the NHS test and trace app would be ready. He said he was \u201cconfident over the next several weeks we\u2019ll see the tracing system develop\u201d. Asked whether it would be ready by 1 June, given that the deputy chief scientific adviser said yesterday that an effecting tracing system was crucial to lifting the lockdown, he replied: I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll see the tracing system start to work by that time. It won\u2019t necessarily be as developed and full blown as we\u2019d like ... it\u2019s still very much a work in progress. The leader of Leeds city council, Judith Blake, has just told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the government should \u201cmove away from an arbitrary date\u201d for reopening all primary schools. Blake, one of the most influential local authority figures in the country, said teachers had been working \u201cflat out\u201d to support vulnerable children and those of key workers but that there remained outstanding concerns about social distancing, staffing and the rate of local infection. She said the government\u2019s handling of the reopening of schools had \u201creally led to a loss of confidence\u201d and added: What we\u2019re asking for is flexibility. Schools want to open, they want to be teaching their children, so let\u2019s move away from an arbitrary date and work with our schools. Government needs to understand that they need to take local factors into account [and] if they\u2019d done that from the start I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be in the position we\u2019re in today. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of all the UK developments on the coronavirus epidemic. Leading the bulletins this morning is the growing resistance from councils in England to reopen primary schools for some students from 1 June. Eleven local authorities, overseeing more than 1,500 maintained schools, have now expressed opposition to the plan, including the Conservative-controlled Solihull council. Teaching unions have said they\u2019re not convinced sending pupils back is safe. Meanwhile, the mobile tracking app that had been considered crucial to the lifting of the lockdown will not be ready until June, it has emerged, only a week after Matt Hancock said it would be \u201crolling out in mid May\u201d. The deputy chief scientific adviser, Professor Angela McLean, said at the daily Downing Street press conference last night that running a rapid and reliable testing system was critical to ensure the UK safely eases lockdown restrictions. Asked whether she was confident that this system is currently in place, she said: \u201cI think it\u2019s getting better.\u201d",

After complaints about the woman\u2019s behavior to the flight attendants were allegedly ignored, the harassment \u201cintensified\u201d into sexual assault with the female passenger \u201cgrabbing and groping his quads and then stroking her hand across his lap towards the inside of his leg near his genitals,\u201d the suit reads. \u201cFearful of the perception of being a male victim and the racial stigma of being a young African American male, John Doe 1 patiently pleaded for assailant to stop and removed her hand,\u201d the complaint states. When the player left his seat to complain to a flight attendant after the assailant allegedly grabbed his penis, the woman moved to the middle seat and grabbed John Doe 2\u2019s leg and \u201cgroin area\u201d. When the flight attendants finally approached the belligerent woman, who admitted she was drinking alcohol and had taken pills, she was moved to another seat, the complaint states. The lawyers for the player and the other passenger, Darren Darwish and Benji Azizian, said the lawsuit \u201cis about accountability\u201d on Wednesday in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cOur goal is to shine a light on how assaults can, and are, being made on men, and not just women,\u201d the attornies said. \u201cThis is significant because assault is assault, regardless of the gender, race, and physical attributes of the victim.\u201d A spokesperson for United Airlines said \u201cthe safety and well-being of our customers is always our top priority.\u201d \u201cIn this instance, the customer involved was moved to a different seat,\u201d the airline said. \u201cBecause litigation is now pending, we\u2019re unable to provide further comment.\u201d According to a 2018 report from the FBI, the number of sexual assaults reported during commercial airline flights is climbing \u201cat an alarming rate\u201d, having increased by 66% from fiscal year 2014 to 2017. The majority of the incidents take place on overnight flights of three hours or more where cabin lights may be darkened or alcohol is being consumed, the bureau said.",

The Financial Times reported that the chancellor was in discussions with the banking sector about how to continue supporting cash-strapped borrowers through the coming months. The talks follow Sunak\u2019s announcement last week that he would extend the unprecedented furlough scheme, under which the taxpayer is meeting the costs of paying 9 million workers on behalf of struggling firms. In his economic rescue package unveiled on 17 March, the chancellor announced a three-month payment holiday for home loan borrowers whose income was hit by the pandemic. But with the government moving only gradually to lift the stringent lockdown conditions that have shut down much of the economy, ministers are keen to avoid a sharp increase in financial distress as the scheme ends. Any extension may be on less generous terms \u2013 and it is unclear what the Treasury\u2019s role would be in funding it. When he extended the furlough scheme, the chancellor said businesses would have to meet part of its cost themselves after the end of July. Sunak warned on Tuesday that the UK was facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we have not seen\u201d after official figures showed a record increase in unemployment, to more than 2 million. Boris Johnson said in his televised statement earlier this month that workers in some sectors, including manufacturing, were now being \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to work where they can safely do so \u2013 and ministers are keen to see more businesses, including non-essential shops, reopen on 1 June.

      "bodyText": "Greece has revved up the engines of its tourism industry, announcing that holidaymakers will be able to return to its beaches within weeks. In an address to the nation, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said 15 June was the official start date of a tourist season delayed by the global coronavirus pandemic and that direct international fights to the country\u2019s tourist destinations would resume gradually from 1 July. Holidaymakers from the UK and other countries would not be quarantined but would have to undergo coronavirus tests, the centre-right leader said in an attempt to allay fears of the virus being brought in from abroad. As it stands, UK holidaymakers hoping to travel abroad this summer will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on their return under British government plans, though specific details are yet to be announced. In a speech highlighting the significance of the tourism sector for the Greek economy, Mitsotakis said: \u201cSample tests will be conducted on our visitors, and our general health protocols will be adhered to, without them \u2026 overshadowing our bright sun or the natural beauties of Greece.\u201d Mitsotakis , who has addressed Greeks at intervals throughout the public health crisis, spelled out the measures as he unveiled a tourism plan and other steps to rejuvenate the Greek economy. Previously the prime minister had said that \u201cin the best-case scenario\u201d, Greece would be accepting all tourists from 1 July, but \u2013 seeking to capitalise on the country\u2019s unexpectedly successful handling of the pandemic \u2013 he announced seasonal hotels could open from 15 June. The first foreign tourists are expected to enter the country by car from neighbouring Balkan states that have also recorded low infection and mortality rates. With Athens keen to attract holidaymakers from Britain, its primary market, tax cuts were also announced. In an attempt to make Greece more competitive for tour operators looking to seal package deals in the coming days, Mitsotakis said transport duties would be lowered from 24% to 13% for the next five months, making boat, plane and bus tickets cheaper during the tourist season. Taxes on coffee, soft drinks and tickets for open-air cinemas, a mainstay of any Greek summer, will also be slashed. Greece, which implemented an early and strict lockdown to avoid strain on its austerity-hit healthcare system, has recorded impressively low figures for Covid-19. By Wednesday the country\u2019s health authorities had recorded 2,850 confirmed cases and 166 deaths. Mitsotakis\u2019s announcement of \u201csample testing\u201d ends speculation of travellers being subject to pre-flight blood tests and being forced to carry coronavirus immunity certificates. But the tourism plan also kickstarts an unprecedented leap into the unknown for the tourist industry, which is being forced to reimagine itself because of the strictures of the global health crisis. Earlier on Wednesday the tourism minister, Harry Theoharis, described reigniting the tourist machine as a \u201cvery complicated exercise\u201d. The entire sector - from the obligatory wearing of face masks on flights to the way hotels operate each day while adhering to physical distancing rules \u2013 has had to be reworked down to the tiniest detail in the name of safeguarding health. Allowing tourism to return was clearly a calculated risk, Theoharis said. \u201cHow do we strike the right balance between protection and how do we preserve the core of the experience, because obviously people go on vacation to be free, carefree, to think about relaxation?\u201d he told an on online Economist conference. \u201cAnd how do we do this keeping our infection numbers low and the strength of our health system [on a level] where it can deal not only with citizens but tourists as well.\u201d In Greece\u2019s vast archipelagos of islands \u2013 all of which have remained remarkably free of coronavirus \u2013 the challenges were particularly acute. Some islands, uninhabited during the winter but popular during the summer months, were especially under-equipped, with rudimentary health clinics that would be hard pushed to deal with an outbreak. \u201cIf 9 million tourists come and just 1% falls ill that means 90,000 new cases,\u201d said Gkikas Magiorkinis, an assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology who sits on the body of public health experts that advises the Greek government on the coronavirus.

Last year Greece attracted a record 33 million tourists \u2013 the equivalent of three times its population. Close to 4 million visitors flew in from the UK. This year industry figures say they will be lucky if Greece attracts a third of that number. Mitsotakis said that although Greece led by example in its handling of the disease, Greeks could be particularly hard-hit by recession as a result of a global economic downturn caused by the pandemic. The only way forward, he said, was to get the tourist season going and prepare the ground for a successful year in 2021 when \u2013 he hoped \u2013 the coronavirus was part of the past. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020.

Some said they were struggling to pay for essentials.</p> \n<p>One health care assistant, Folasade, 47, originally from Nigeria, said that her work on night shifts in a Midlands hospital was \u201creally hard but I enjoy helping people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Folasade, who has been in the UK for ten years next month, went on: \u201cI have two children and with the NHS fees and the Home Office visa fees together it\u2019s difficult to find the money. It\u2019s a struggle to pay my rent and I\u2019ve never had a holiday. I pay \u00a3500 every month towards my debts for previous fees and next year I have to pay another set. I don\u2019t know yet how I will pay them.\u201d </p> \n<p>The surcharge has become a heated political issue since the coronavirus crisis began, with politicians and health bodies urging the government to scrap it for migrant care workers after it was paused for a year for doctors, nurses and paramedics.</p> \n<p>The NHS fee of \u00a3400 a year for migrant care workers coming from outside the European Economic Area is paid regardless of use of healthcare services.

      "bodyText": "Overseas health and care workers on the coronavirus frontline reacted with fury on Wednesday after Boris Johnson refused to exempt them from the NHS surcharge, insisting that it was \u201cthe right way forward\u201d. In interviews with the Guardian, migrant health workers \u2013 who face an NHS bill of as much as \u00a32,500 a year for a family of four \u2013 spoke out over a relentless working environment, struggles to pay their rent, and a heavy toll on their family life. \u201cWe feel insulted,\u201d one said. \u201cWe are putting our lives and our family\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d The prime minister resisted pressure from Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer to amend the policy, telling MPs that he \u201caccepts and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff\u201d but added: \u201cWe must look at the realities \u2026 those contributions help us to raise about \u00a3900m.\u201d Later the IFS estimated that the contribution from overseas NHS staff amounted to around \u00a390m. The workers who spoke to the Guardian described what they saw as a \u201cstruggle\u201d to manage the costs of the surcharge alongside rising visa fees. Some said they were struggling to pay for essentials. One health care assistant, Folasade, 47, originally from Nigeria, said that her work on night shifts in a Midlands hospital was \u201creally hard but I enjoy helping people.\u201d Folasade, who has been in the UK for ten years next month, went on: \u201cI have two children and with the NHS fees and the Home Office visa fees together it\u2019s difficult to find the money. It\u2019s a struggle to pay my rent and I\u2019ve never had a holiday. I pay \u00a3500 every month towards my debts for previous fees and next year I have to pay another set. I don\u2019t know yet how I will pay them.\u201d The surcharge has become a heated political issue since the coronavirus crisis began, with politicians and health bodies urging the government to scrap it for migrant care workers after it was paused for a year for doctors, nurses and paramedics. The NHS fee of \u00a3400 a year for migrant care workers coming from outside the European Economic Area is paid regardless of use of healthcare services. It is rising in October to \u00a3624 a year. On top of these charges, a migrant worker on a ten year pathway to citizenship will pay visa fees every two and a half years to allow them to keep working. These are currently \u00a31033. After three sets of fees, the worker pays for indefinite leave to remain, at the end of ten years for a further \u00a32,389. The costs are far higher than in other European countries. The charity Migrant Voice said that between the NHS surcharge and the visa fees a family of four would pay \u00a350,000 over a decade. One care home manager said she worked over 300 hours a month in a senior role, doing overtime to help pay her bills and childcare for her six year old. Another junior doctor said they had to take out loans to afford the charges, which left them struggling financially. Jeri Lee, a 38-year-old care home manager from Jamaica, said: \u201cThere is a lot of diversity in my company, most staff are from the Caribbean, Africa or Europe, only a small number are British. \u201cI\u2019m on a ten year path to UK citizenship, I just paid my third set of fees,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very worried during the Covid peak about becoming ill and not being able to work. My immigration status means I have no access to public funds and wouldn\u2019t have got any benefits if I was sick.\u201d Lee works over 300 hours a month in a senior role, doing overtime to help pay her bills and childcare for her six year old as well as the Home Office fees. \u201cI pay \u00a3700 hundred pounds a month in tax and then I have to pay this crazy NHS charge. It\u2019s really taking a toll on me, I work so many hours I don\u2019t get much time with my child,\u201d she said. Junior doctor, Aqsa Ghazanfar, described the expenses she has to pay as insulting. \u201cFrankly I mean myself and lots of my colleagues discussed it and feel insulted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are putting our lives and our family\u2019s lives at risk and none of us have said we are not going to do this job. I am exposing myself to patients who potentially have Covid and bringing it home.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is even more insulting [at the moment] - that is the only word I have really. It is appalling that people are still being asked to pay it.\u201d She said that she had to take a loan every time to pay for her family\u2019s visa, as there is \u201cno way that I can pay that much\u201d. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: \u201cThe immigration health surcharge is a grossly unfair financial burden \u2026 The government must drop this charge as a matter of urgency.\u201d Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, president of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK said: \u201cThe Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) for NHS workers is a cruel and unnecessary policy which must be scrapped.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 21 May. Top stories The world has seen its biggest one-day increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases, with the World Health Organization issuing a strong warning that the pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases emerged in the past 24 hours, with infection rates in Latin America growing rapidly. The EU\u2019s coronavirus chief said that between 85% and 90% of the population remain susceptible to the virus, meaning a second wave of infections is only a question of \u201cwhen and how big\u201d. Donald Trump has accused China of \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d, with the US president also inviting censure over comments that American\u2019s figure of 1.52m positive infections was a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d and indicative of its rigorous testing regime. A leaked draft document before the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission has recommended that Australian taxpayers underwrite an expansion of the domestic gas industry. The report makes little reference to renewable alternatives and does not mention climate change, recommending instead the opening of new gas fields and the building of hundreds of kilometres of new pipelines, including a mooted $6bn trans-Australian pipeline. A new Coalition discussion paper has also flagged examining \u201cemerging nuclear technologies\u201d as part of Australia\u2019s energy mix, as part of its technology roadmap towards 2022, 2030 and 2050. Rents in major Australian cities have fallen to 2013 levels, with figures released on Wednesday suggesting a combination of economic downturn, decreased migration and a glut of unutilised Airbnb lettings are forcing down landlord expectations. Victoria\u2019s attorney general tabled data this week that suggested renters are paying 31% less on average, due to the coronavirus. Elsewhere, unions have renewed calls for a government bailout to support ailing airline Virgin Australia, despite administrators expressing confidence the carrier has sufficient cash reserves to see it to a potential mid-June sale. Australia Labor and the Greens are calling for an audit into $150m of Coalition pre-election commitments, with just $9m for female sport facilities being delivered, more than a year after the money was pledged. $35m has been allocated in Australian Research Council grants to 77 projects, including studies looking into the extent of LGBT conversion therapy in Australia, shark deterrence, and offshore oil and gas prospecting. The federal government is considering a request from employer groups for urgent legislative reform, after a federal court judgment found that casual staff could receive further entitlements if they performed regular, permanent work. The koala population at NSW\u2019s proposed Shenhua coalmine faces localised extinction, with company documents suggesting habitat clearing will accelerate a decline in numbers, already under severe duress from bushfires, drought and chlamydia. The world \u201cCatastrophic failures\u201d are responsible for tens of thousands being evacuated in Michigan, where overflow from a decommissioned dam threatens major flooding for towns downstream. Benjamin Netanyahu has been ordered by an Israeli court to appear in person at the opening day of his trial for corruption, after the prime minister\u2019s bid for an exemption was rejected. The 70-year-old faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Oxfam International will close operation in 18 countries and lay off nearly 1,500 staff, with the Covid-19 pandemic dramatically affecting the global aid organisation\u2019s financial circumstances and magnifying the fallout from the Haiti sex abuse scandal. Attacks on a mosque in northern Afghanistan have killed 14 people, on the eve of US-brokered peace talks between the newly united government and the Taliban. The Taliban admits killing nine militiamen but denies targeting the civilians.

Last weekend alone, coastguard rescue teams were called out 194 times in the UK to incidents including inflatables drifting offshore, crashed jetskis, people injured while out walking or cycling along the coast, paddle-boarders, kayakers, windsurfers and kitesurfers who were in difficulty as well as people cut off by the tide. The RNLI and UK coastguard service are launching a beach safety campaign on Thursday urging parents to protect their families. There is particular concern about south-west England, where a large swell and a spring tide could make conditions particularly hazardous. Gareth Morrison, the RNLI head of water safety, said: \u201cIf the charity\u2019s lifeguards were present on the beaches today, they would be preventing many incidents before they even occurred by directing people to safe swimming areas, highlighting dangers such as rip currents and advising people not to use inflatables.\u201d The campaign features the slogan: \u201cBeach lifeguards can\u2019t be everywhere this summer.\u201d \u201cIt is important that anyone visiting the coast understands that the beach can be a dangerous environment and you must take more responsibility for you and your family this summer.\u201d Claire Hughes, the director of HM Coastguard, said: \u201cWe know from sad experience that whether you\u2019re local or not, whatever your ability of experience in your chosen sport or leisure activity, the sea can still catch you out and be unmerciful when it does. Now more than ever, we need people to respect the sea and the coast. If you get into trouble call 999 and ask for the coastguard and we will come to your aid.\u201d The two organisations are asking people not to use inflatables and to take precautions such as checking the weather forecast and timetables. The Welsh government has increased the maximum fine for repeated breaches of the coronavirus lockdown rules in Wales from \u00a3120 to \u00a31,920. The increased fines are being introduced ahead of the bank holiday weekend following a request from the four police forces in Wales for increased penalties to help deter people from repeatedly breaching the stay-at-home regulations. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: \u201cAs we approach the bank holiday weekend, we continue to ask people to stay at home to protect themselves and their loved ones from coronavirus. If they are exercising \u2013 please stay safe and stay local.\u201d",

They get up from their beds \u2013 mattresses on the floor of a church in Auckland where they are locked down \u2013 pray, sing hymns, eat a breakfast made of donated food, and then train. The 29-strong squad is stuck 2,000km from their home in Tonga, stranded in New Zealand after their Pacific home shut its borders to all travellers, including citizens. The team from Ha\u2019apai, a remote cluster of islands in central Tonga, arrived in New Zealand on 3 March, intending to spend a month playing club rugby teams around the North Island, before heading home. Team Tu\u2019uakitau had spent months preparing for the trip, training, and fundraising. Players were hoping to be scouted for contracts on New Zealand teams; a potential pathway to residency for them and their families. A week and a half into the tour, opposition coaches began calling to cancel their upcoming games and they realised the gravity of the Covid-19 situation. \u201cWe had $5,000 left in our bank account so we spent all of that to change our flight to go home,\u201d said Tuivaita Ueleni, Tu\u2019uakitau head coach. The flight was booked for 23 March, three weeks after the team arrived and two days before New Zealand\u2019s level-four lockdown began. \u201cWe arrived at the airport and were getting ready to fly away and that\u2019s when we found out that we couldn\u2019t go back,\u201d said Ueleni. The Tongan government had made the decision to shut its border, with all scheduled flights to be diverted to neighbouring island nations. This left the 29-strong squad of players and coaches facing an impending nationwide lockdown with limited options, and rapidly dwindling funds. \u201cWe arrived back at the Tokaikolo \u2018ia Kalaisi church with no money in our pockets and the people from the church offered us to stay for free,\u201d said Ueleni. Church members quickly turned the hall of worship into makeshift housing for the team, spreading mattresses across the floor and erecting a volleyball net in the yard to keep them entertained during lockdown. \u201cNine of the team volunteered to stay with friends or relatives around the city and the 20 of us have been in the church ever since,\u201d said Tevita Vakasiuola, team doctor and assistant coach. To occupy the long days in the church the team has been singing a lot, filling the cavernous hall with their well-practised harmonies. \u201cEvery day we pray together and sing hymns. The boys joke that by the time we get home we\u2019ll know every hymn there is,\u201d said Ueleni. Their daily routine has also involved runs up the neighbouring M\u0101ngare Mountain, tending to the church gardens, volleyball, and then more prayer again. Tu\u2019uakitau\u2019s 29 members are among the estimated thousands of Pasifika people stuck in New Zealand due to border closures. New Zealand traditionally depends on seasonal workforces from Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu, but with borders closed and work dried up, many foreign nationals have found themselves stranded without a clear understanding of when they can head home. \u201cWe have a number of Pasifika people up and down the country who were here on working visas but are no longer able to work and aren\u2019t able to access government support,\u201d said Debbie Sorenson, CEO of Pasifika Futures, a charitable organisation which has helped provide food and shelter to more than 250 stranded Pasifika people.

That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures.

President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>.

Thank you for following along \u2013 and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019. </strong>The US president told reporters at a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/singapore-sentences-man-to-death-via-zoom-call\">Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call</a>. </strong>A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus. </strong>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. </strong>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. </strong>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. </strong>Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

Trump said: \u201cThat was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration\u201d . </li> \n   <li><strong>The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty</strong>, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>.

Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date.</li> \n   <li><strong> The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June</strong> due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country\u2019s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>.

The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new blog at the link below \u2013 head there for rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, as cases worldwide increase by the highest one-day total so far: UK Ministers overruled permanent secretaries 11 times during pandemic Ministers responding to the coronavirus pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered their departments to override formal objections from their most senior civil servant, a report by Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. In its first assessment of the government\u2019s finances since responses began four months ago, the National Audit Office (NAO) disclosed that permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were conducted quickly and without the usual \u201cvalue for money\u201d checks. Secretaries of state issued ministerial directions to force the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable for the decisions, auditors said. There have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years, according to the Institute for Government. Apple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. The companies had announced the unprecedented collaboration to leverage their technology to help trace and contain the spread of coronavirus last month, and say 22 countries and several US states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. The software relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus. Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven\u2019t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people\u2019s location, which Apple and Google are omitting from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns. World sees largest daily rise in cases. The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address. South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system. The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months. The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d. The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Here is more on US president Donald Trump calling for an in-person G7 meeting. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d In March, the Republican president canceled the physical summit scheduled for June, moving to a video conference as nations grappled with the shutdown of international travel and multiple closures to fight the outbreak. The leaders\u2019 April and May discussions were also moved to teleconference. But Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, said an in-person summit would be a symbol of the United States and other countries seeking to return to normal, something the president has urged should happen quickly despite concerns from public health experts. As we reported earlier, French president, Emmanuel Macron, is open to traveling to the United States for an in-person meeting of G7 leaders if the coronavirus pandemic situation allows, an Elysee official said on Wednesday.

In Brazil, 888 more people have died after becoming infected, while the country\u2019s Health Ministry has confirmed a record increase in cases, with nearly 20,000 reported. That takes the total to 291,579. In the UK, overseas health and care workers on the coronavirus frontline have reacted with fury after Boris Johnson refused to exempt them from the NHS surcharge, insisting that it was \u201cthe right way forward\u201d. In interviews with the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Marsh and Harriet Grant, migrant health workers \u2013 who face an NHS bill of as much as \u00a32,500 a year for a family of four \u2013 spoke out over a relentless working environment, struggles to pay their rent, and a heavy toll on their family life. \u201cWe feel insulted,\u201d one said. \u201cWe are putting our lives and our family\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d The prime minister resisted pressure from Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer to amend the policy, telling MPs that he \u201caccepts and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff\u201d but added: \u201cWe must look at the realities \u2026 those contributions help us to raise about \u00a3900m.\u201d Later, the IFS estimated that the contribution from overseas NHS staff amounted to around \u00a390m. The head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has appealed for the world to work together to develop a vaccine, warning against any unilateral action that could prevent access for poor countries. Francesco Rocca, who heads the world\u2019s largest disaster relief network, told Reuters: The reality is that there is this risk. Everyone must have access to these lifesaving treatments. On Tuesday, the United States rejected language in a World Health Organization resolution that was designed to ensure poor countries can have access to medicine, arguing that it sends \u201cthe wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs\u201d. Rocca said: If someone would say this is the intellectual property of this company ... and putting high prices on the vaccines, so making it impossible or very difficult to have access, this of course can have an impact on the most vulnerable. We want to prevent some unilateral decision that can effect the opportunity to have treatments and vaccines for everyone. Neglecting indigenous people during the pandemic is a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d, the mayor of the largest city in the Amazon rainforest has said. Arthur Virgilio Neto, the mayor of Manaus, said the virus is killing indigenous people and warned of a \u201cgenocide\u201d if Brazil\u2019s right-wing government fails to protect vulnerable tribes. So far, 25 indigenous people have died in the rainforest as the outbreak slowly penetrates remote villages. But more than 100 have been killed by the virus in urban areas, health authorities and indigenous groups said. \u201cI fear a genocide,\u201d said Neto, whose city is home to 2 million people and is the capital of Amazonas state. The mayor said the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was not concerned about the plight of indigenous people and doing nothing to save lives threatened by the outbreak. \u201cIt is a crime against humanity what they are doing here in my state of Amazonas, in my region.\u201d he said. Bolsonaro\u2019s office did not reply to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. Healthcare for indigenous people is the responsibility of the federal health ministry and its indigenous health service Sesai, which does not treat members of a tribe who have migrated away from their ancestral lands. Health experts say the outbreak that first broke out in the cities is now spreading to isolated areas where the population has no access to healthcare. Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday they were particularly concerned about contagion in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. The mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and the child subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 as well. It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying condition of prematurity. South Africa, which has the highest coronavirus infections in Africa, reported 803 new cases in a 24-hour cycle, taking the total to 18,003 while 8,950 people have recovered. Peru\u2019s number of confirmed cases has surpassed 100,000, the country\u2019s Ministry of Health has reported. There are 104,020 in the South American nation, which has been under nationwide lockdown since March, and the death toll rose to 3,024, the ministry said. Capt Tom Moore, whose sponsored walks in his garden raised \u00a333m for NHS charities, has reacted with delight after it was confirmed he is to be knighted. \u201cI think Sir Thomas sounds very nice,\u201d he said. But he insisted the new title wouldn\u2019t change him. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,324 more deaths and 23,405 new cases; taking the totals to 91,664 and 1,528,235, respectively. A team of nurses working in Mexico City on the pandemic were rescued from a \u201cvirtual\u201d kidnapping, in which kidnappers threaten their victims via telephone and video calls and coerce them through deception into making extortion payments. Investigators say the virtual kidnappers targeted the nurses \u2013 all staying in two hotels in the Mexican capital \u2013 and called their family members, saying they were being held and would be harmed if payment was not forthcoming. The nurses were warned not to try leaving their rooms; their virtual captors claimed to have control of the hotels\u2019 security cameras and said they would attack any of the nurses if they were seen in the street. The Mexican Social Security Institute said in a statement that 13 of the 17 nurses in the team were subjected to the virtual kidnapping and were rescued by security forces on Tuesday. None of the nurses were injured and no arrests have been made. Judicial officials in the Mexican capital say detectives working on the case of a kidnapped Chiapas man stumbled upon the virtual kidnapping. The case of the virtual kidnappings was but the latest in a string of indignities committed against members of the medical profession as the Covid-19 pandemic escalates. Doctors, nurses and paramedics \u2013 all applauded in other countries \u2013 have suffered aggressions in public, including having bleach thrown on them. Many in the medical profession have stopped wearing their uniforms in public to avoid being assailed by people perceiving them as Covid-19 risks. Virtual kidnappings have proliferated in Mexico in recent years. Gerardo Priego, a former lawmaker now running an anti-kidnapping organisation, says such virtual crimes are often \u201cso well-planned that many people fall into them and they are tricked so that their family members pay ... It\u2019s very profitable and the bad guys don\u2019t run any risks.\u201d Brazil\u2019s health ministry has issued new guidelines for wider use of anti-malarial drugs in mild coronavirus cases, a treatment touted by President Jair Bolsonaro in defiance of public health experts warning of possible health risks. The interim health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an army general on active duty, authorised the modified protocol after two trained doctors left the ministry\u2019s top job under pressure to promote early use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The French president Emmanuel Macron is open to travelling to the United States for an in-person meeting of Group of Seven leaders if the coronavirus epidemic situation allows, an Elysee official has said. He\u2019s open, he\u2019s even willing to go there, but obviously with this caveat: Only if the sanitary conditions allow. Donald Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, had planned to hold this year\u2019s summit at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Maryland, in June. In the UK, the test-and-trace system could be jeopardised by delays in obtaining test results, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned, as the government\u2019s scientific advisers prepare to assess its effectiveness. Heather Stewart, Dan Sabbagh and Robert Booth write that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to grill the test-and-trace boss Dido Harding on Thursday amid concerns about whether the system will be robust enough to check the spread of the disease and allow the easing of lockdown measures from 1 June. Hunt, who has repeatedly called for \u201ctest, track and isolate\u201d to be implemented, warned that a well-functioning system required test results to be rapidly obtainable. He said: For test and trace to work, you have to get the test results back quickly, and that will mean ironing out a lot of the problems that currently exist, with people waiting too long for their test results. All of Egypt\u2019s 320 general hospitals are to offer testing to people showing symptoms, local authorities have announced. People with minor symptoms will be sent home as they await test results, while those showing serious symptoms will be kept in hospital, according to a government statement. Since 14 May, some patients with minor symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home rather than in quarantine hospitals. Egypt confirmed 745 new cases on Wednesday; the highest daily increase yet, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 14,229. The health ministry reported 21 more deaths, raising total deaths to 680. The number of people confirmed to have recovered stands at 3,994. The diplomatic clash between Beijing and Washington continues as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calls China\u2019s pledge of $2bn (\u00a31.63bn) a \u201cpaltry\u201d sum compared to the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars of damage. Pompeo rejected Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s claim that Beijing had acted with transparency after the initial outbreak and said that, if Xi wanted to show transparency, he should hold a news conference and allow reporters to ask him anything they liked. \u201cPresident Xi claimed this week that China is acting with openness, transparency responsibility. I wish it were so,\u201d Pompeo told a State Department news conference, accusing Beijing of continuing to withhold virus samples and access to facilities, to censor discussion, \u201cand much, much more\u201d. He added: I look forward to seeing them fulfil that $2bn commitment. China\u2019s contributions to fighting the pandemic are paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world. This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives, more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives. Could be as much as $9tn, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s failures. Pundits have speculated that Donald Trump\u2019s reelection strategy will focus on diverting attention from his own handling of the epidemic in the US by blaming China, where the pandemic started. The plan, a roadmap for the key industry, foresees tourist resorts welcoming holidaymakers two weeks earlier than expected. Initially, Mitsotakis had said \u201cin the best case scenario\u201d Greece would be accepting tourists from 1 July. But seeking to capitalise on the country\u2019s unexpectedly successful handling of the pandemic, he announced that seasonal hotels could open from 15 June. The first tourists are expected to enter the country by car from neighbouring Balkan states that have also recorded low infection and mortality rates. With Athens keen to attract holidaymakers from the UK, its primary market, tax cuts were also announced. In a bid to make Greece more competitive for tour operators due to seal package deals in the coming days, the centre-right leader said duties on transport will be reduced from 24% to 13 % for the next five months. That would make boat, plane and bus tickets cheaper during the tourist season. Taxes on coffee, soft drinks and tickets for open-air cinemas, a mainstay of any Greek summer, will also be slashed. Greece has revved up the engines of its tourism industry, announcing that holidaymakers will be able to return to its beaches within weeks. In an address to the nation, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis declared 15 June as the official start date of a tourist season delayed by the pandemic. Direct flights between Greece and the UK and other international destinations will resume on 1 July, with airlines flying straight into island airports gradually thereafter. Holidaymakers will not be quarantined but they will be tested, Mitsotakis insisted in an attempt to allay fears of the virus being imported from abroad. Here are the latest headlines in the global coronavirus crisis: Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address. France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system. The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months. The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d. The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle. I\u2019ll leave you in the capable hands of my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. The discovery of new coronavirus cases in two students has marred the reopening of schools in South Korea, Reuters reports. Seventy-five high schools turned pupils away on Wednesday, amid fears among some teachers that it was unsafe for classes to resume. Some students were sent home almost as soon as they had walked through their school gates for the first time this year, after the two high school seniors tested positive in Incheon on Wednesday morning, the education ministry said. The beginning of the spring semester had been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online. South Korea has reported 11,110 coronavirus cases, with 263 deaths. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian global development reporter Peter Beaumont. The agency has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Still suffering from a fall in donations from the public in the UK because of the Haiti sex abuse scandal, and heavily dependent on its shops in a number of European countries \u2013 to the tune of \u00a35m a week \u2013 Oxfam\u2019s other sources of funding had also begun drying up. Oxfam Australia had already made deep cuts earlier this month, while cuts in the UK to Oxfam GB were also foreseen. Oxfam currently operates in 66 countries and 20 affiliates. It will retain a physical presence in 48 countries, six of which it will explore as new independent affiliate members. The UK has reported 363 more deaths from Covid-19, taking the official death toll in Europe\u2019s worst-affected country to 35,704. According to the daily update, out of 60,744 people tested for the coronavirus, 2,472 came back positive. There have been 248,293 officially confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK so far - the second highest number in Europe. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address, according to AFP. With Greece suffering fewer than 170 COVID-19 deaths over two months into the pandemic, Mitsotakis said the country\u2019s prompt response to the virus would be a \u201cpassport of safety, credibility and health\u201d to attract visitors. \u201cWe will win the economy war just as we won the health battle,\u201d he said. The tourism minister, Harry Theocharis, said a list of nations resuming flights to Greece would be announced by the end of May, noting that Athens would focus on reviving a travel front \u201cfrom the Balkans to the Baltic.\u201d Bulgarians and northern Europeans including Germans will be among the first visitors, the minister said, in addition to Israelis and Cypriots. The country, which is still recovering from a decade-long debt crisis, badly needs tourism income that directly and indirectly accounts for over a fifth of its economy. In Chile, political opponents, academics and health workers have demanded greater transparency over Covid-19 death tolls, writes Charis McGowan in Santiago. With 53,617 confirmed cases of infection, Chile has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in South America. With a case-fatality rate of around 1% (totalling 544), Chile\u2019s Health Ministry has pointed out that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%. However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by \u201crespiratory disease\u201d between 3 March and 29 April. Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year\u2019s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus. The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media. Within hours of the post going viral, the Health Ministry clarified that numbers confirmed by the Department of Health Statistics and Information totalled 1,949 respiratory-related deaths from March to May, an 8% increase to the year before. \u201cEach institution maintains its responsibilities within the scope of its competence,\u201d said the Health Ministry in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cThe Health Ministry maintains the responsibility of establishing and defining the codification of the cause of death.\u201d Meanwhile, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) revealed that all official death statistics in Chile must be cross-checked by the Health Ministry, the Civil Registry, and the INE \u2014 a process that takes up to two years to verify and validate before publishing. \u201cThe Health Ministry\u2019s numbers appeared within hours in response to a tweet,\u201d Matus told the Guardian. \u201cOfficially, they haven\u2019t even finished processing the numbers from 2018. So how are these new numbers any more valid than the Civil Registry ones?\u201d Speaking on a local radio station last Friday, the health minister, Jamie Ma\u00f1alich, explained that the Civil Registry counts respiratory illness as a cause of death in combination with principal causes of death. \u201cIt includes a person who has bronchial asthma and who died in a traffic accident,\u201d he said. Yet the discrepancy between the numbers has caused concern. \u201cIt is not acceptable that Civil Registry figures are not consistent with those provided by the Ministry of Health,\u201d said deputy Andrea Parra. The Doctor\u2019s Union has demanded greater transparency over death tolls, highlighting that current figures include \u201canomalous data\u201d. Switzerland has told its ministry of defence to secure adequate supplies of coronavirus vaccine, as fears grow of a global struggle over supplies when one is finally developed. So far, no vaccine has so far been created to protect people from the virus, but it is widely thought that the crisis can only be brought to an end when one is deelopmed and rolled out to huge numbers of the world\u2019s population. Concerns are growing that some nations, such as the United States, could seek to hoard a successful candidate, once it comes, since manufacturing capacity is unlikely to be sufficient to supply global needs. Even after the first wave of the pandemic is over, immunity levels around the world will be so low that vaccine will be essential, Reuters reported the Swiss government as saying, potentially sparking a race by nations to grab what they can, to the detriment of others. \u201cThe goal is clear: The Swiss population should have the fastest possible access to a safe, effective vaccine,\u201d Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset said. \u201cBut we also know there\u2019s a big, global discussion going on, and need will be huge worldwide. All countries should have fair access to a vaccine.\u201d Switzerland\u2019s interior ministry and defence department have been given the job of leading contract negotiations to secure enough doses to treat the nation\u2019s 8.6 million population, the government said, estimating costs at around 300 million Swiss francs ($310.82 million) for such a supply. Nearly two-dozen people have escaped from coronavirus quarantine centres in Zimbabwe, the Associated Press reports, citing local media. The state-run Herald newspaper reported that 23 people had escaped in the past week, including 19 who were being held at a hotel in Beitbridge, a usually busy border town. The Zimbabwean authorities are using schools, colleges and hotels for the mandatory isolation of people entering the country during a lockdown that is now in its sixth week. Some returnees have complained about poor conditions at quarantine centres. Zimbabwe has so far reported 46 cases of coronavirus, and four deaths from Covid-19. Egypt will deduct 1% from people\u2019s salaries for 12 months from 1 July to offset the economic repercussions of the coronavirus, according to a draft law approved by the cabinet on Wednesday, Reuters reports. The tax will be imposed across all sectors of the economy in both the public and private sectors for net monthly salaries exceeding 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($127), the cabinet said in a statement. A tax of 0.5% will be deducted from state pensions. The measure comes as Egypt tries to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic, which has brought tourism to a standstill, triggered major capital flight, and threatened remittances from Egyptians working overseas. On Wednesday, Egypt reported that 745 more people had tested positive for coronavirus and 21 people had died from Covid-19. The total death toll in the country is now 680, of a total 14,229 confirmed cases. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 161 on Wednesday, one fatality less than on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 32,330, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections increased by 665, down from 813 on Tuesday, according to figures from the civil protection authority. Mayors of towns and cities across Italy threatened to close bars again after seeing images of crowds gathering for an evening drink on Tuesday, with many people not wearing masks. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, warned \u201cnow is not the time for street parties\u201d. \u201cOtherwise the curve starts heading back up,\u201d he was quoted by Ansa as saying. \u201cWe lifted the need for self-declaration forms [previously required for venturing out] because the curve was under control, but nobody should think that the rules of precaution have been lifted.\u201d There are 62,752 people who are currently infected with the virus, 676 of whom are in intensive care. The country has 227,364 confirmed coronavirus cases to date, including the deaths and 132,282 survivors. Churches and other places of worship can reopen in Switzerland from next week, the government announced on Wednesday, AFP reports. \u201cNormal life is coming back,\u201d the health minister, Alain Berset, said after the government brought the move forward by a week. \u201cMass, worship, marriages, baptisms\u201d and other events in places of worship will all be allowed to resume from 28 May, he told a press conference. Switzerland stopped short of imposing strict confinement in measures introduced in mid-March aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. It has been gradually lifting its restrictions since barbers, florists, family doctors and hardware stores were allowed to reopen on 27 April. The rates of infection, hospitalisation and death have flattened off in recent weeks, according to the health ministry. On Wednesday, Swiss public health authorities reported one new Covid-19 death, and 40 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total death toll from the disease so far in the country now stands at 1,630, out of 30,658 infected patients. The prime minister of Italy has warned that the EU\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan needs to be more ambitious or the bloc risked fuelling nationalism and widening long-term divisions. While he welcomed the surprise entente between Berlin and Paris to back a 500 billion euro ($550 billion) rescue plan as \u201ca bold and significant step\u201d, Giuseppe Conte said \u201cmuch more needs to be done\u201d. In an op-ed on the politico.eu news website, Conte said: It has quickly become clear that the economic cost of this pandemic is going to be as unprecedented as its impact to public health, putting in danger not just jobs and business in EU member countries but also threatening the fundamental pillars of our union, starting with the single market and the supply chains it facilitates. By its nature, the coronavirus crisis is a symmetric shock, affecting all countries and regions, that cannot be effectively faced by individual countries alone. It did not take me long to be convinced of this, and I have been raising awareness among other European leaders about the urgent need for a coordinated economic response. The risk has long been clear: Europe cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by doing too little or reacting too slowly. Failure to act swiftly will result in a sharp widening of divergences among EU member countries. Four European countries - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden - are expected to propose an alternative to the Franco-German recovery plan, asking for more guarantees that states receiving aid will adopt reforms, AFP reports. They will also say aid should take the form of loans rather than grants, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Wednesday. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by super-cyclone Amphan, writes Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent. Rights groups say governments are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, and warn those on board may have been at sea for months. Amnesty said the refugees\u2019 lives are at immediate risk, as the Bay of Bengal, where some boats were recently rescued, is facing its biggest storm for decades. It\u2019s thought that some of the boats are carrying refugees attempting to flee the desperate conditions in Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, where 1 million Rohingya refugees have sheltered for years after fleeing persecution in Myanmar. The location of the boats is not known, though last week it was reported that at least two vessels carrying Rohingya were believed to have been spotted off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh. \u201cThey are in rickety boats, these are fishing trawlers that they use to take a very dangerous route in the hope of a better life. The Bangladesh government and others must do everything to save their lives,\u201d said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International\u2019s south Asia campaigner. Louise Donovan, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, added that it is not clear how exactly many people remain adrift but that the storm could be devastating for those stranded. \u201cThe sea is extremely rough at the moment, and if there are any boats that are trying to disembark we would ask governments in the region to assist them,\u201d she said. Earlier this month, hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, were rescued from another boat and escorted by Bangladesh to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island that aid groups warn is isolated and prone to flooding and cyclones. The UN has offered to conduct a risk assessment of the island prior to any refugees being relocated, but this is yet to happen. On Wednesday, authorities in Bangladesh said the 306 Rohingya who remain on the island have been taken to cyclone centres. Officials have previously said that rescued Rohingya were being taken to Bhasan Char as a quarantine measure, to prevent the risk of people bringing coronavirus into the refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Just last week, the virus had been detected for the first time in the crowded camps, prompting agencies to warn of a looming humanitarian disaster. In Cox\u2019s Bazar on Wednesday morning, a third red flag was raised as a warning sign that extreme weather is approaching and that all refugees must stay inside. It is hoped that the eye of the cyclone will miss the camp, though agencies still fear flooding, tidal surges and strong winds that could tear apart the flimsy shelters in which families live. There are no cyclone shelters available to refugees in the camps, instead, communities have been given \u201ctie-down kits\u201d, sets of pegs and ropes, to try to strengthen the structures that do exist. \u201cWe\u2019re as prepared as we can be in a very difficult situation and also when dealing with Covid-19 at the same time it is very, very challenging,\u201d added Donovan. \u201cThe United States continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the US state department has insisted. A lengthy press release published the USAID website, but in the name of the department of state, says that, despite Donald Trump\u2019s threats to permanently end US funding of the World Health Organization, the US government is still distributing billions to countries and NGOs for coronavirus relief efforts. It says: Through the American people\u2019s generosity and the U.S. Government\u2019s action, the United States continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. The American people have given more than $10 billion that will benefit the global Covid-19 response, and we continue to ensure that the substantial U.S. funding and scientific efforts on this front remain a central and coordinated part of the worldwide effort against Covid-19. Months into fighting this pandemic at home and abroad, the United States continues to lead a global response\u2014building on decades of leadership in life-saving health and humanitarian assistance. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the US Government has committed more than $900 million in State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance specifically aimed at helping governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) fight the pandemic. This funding, provided by Congress, will save lives by improving public health education; protecting healthcare facilities; and increasing laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity in more than 120 countries. The United States has mobilized as a nation to make this an impressive global effort. Working with the private sector, we have begun to fulfill President Trump\u2019s commitment to provide ventilators to our partners and allies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The first shipment of ventilators donated by the United States, through USAID, arrived in the Republic of South Africa on May 11, 2020. Our foreign assistance funding to date for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes an initial $23 million specifically to provide ventilators to some of these partners and allies. We expect to make future additional purchases and shipments of ventilators and related supplies. You can read more by clicking through. Peru seemed to be doing everything right. Its president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, announced one of the earliest coronavirus lockdowns in Latin America on 16 March. In stark contrast to his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who has deliberately undermined social distancing and quarantine measures \u2013 Peru\u2019s leader strictly adhered to the World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus recommendations and mobilised the police and army to enforce a stringent quarantine. But more than two months later the country is one of the region\u2019s worst hit by Covid-19 and has been unable to flatten the curve of infections. Peru now ranks second only to Brazil in Latin America with more than 99,483 cases and a death toll of 2,914 according to official figures on Tuesday. Dan Collyns, the Guardian\u2019s man in Lima, looks into the reasons why: Just over 7% of people in Stockholm are carrying antibodies that would protect them against coronavirus infection, a survey by Sweden\u2019s public health authority has found. The findings come from the first results of the agency\u2019s investigation into the presence of antibodies against the virus in the population. They will be likely to be seized upon by critics of Sweden\u2019s \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy. The country has eschewed the kinds of lockdowns imposed by government\u2019s elsewhere in the world to curb the spread of the virus, in favour of allowing it to spread throughout the population in the hope that natural immunity will be achieved. So far Sweden has recorded 3,831 deaths from Covid-19, a far higher total death toll than its neighbours, which brought in strict lockdown measures. Stockholm, the capital, has been the worst hit region. According to the public health authority\u2019s press release on the study (rendered into English by Google Translate): The analyses for week 18 (a total of 1,104 analysed samples) show, as expected, the largest proportion of positive antibody tests in Stockholm. A total of 7.3% of the blood samples collected from people in Stockholm were positive in the antibody study, which can be compared with a total of 4.2% in Sk\u00e5ne and 3.7% in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland. The numbers reflect the state of the epidemic earlier in April, as it takes a few weeks for the body\u2019s immune system to develop antibodies. Regarding age differences, the results show that Covid-19 antibodies were most common among people between 20 and 64 years. In total, 6.7% of the samples in this group were positive, which can be compared with 4.7% in the age group 0-19 years and 2.7% in the age group 65-70 years. France is to launch a complete shake-up of the country\u2019s health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, but whose failings have been revealed by the coronavirus crisis, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff in hospitals and state-run nursing homes and to invest and reform financing of the health system. After a council of ministers (cabinet) meeting this morning, it was announced the plan will be launched next Monday (25 May) with a national consultation. This is Macron\u2019s way of saying thank you to underpaid, overworked hospital and care home staff at the frontline of dealing with Covid-19, Olivier V\u00e9ran, the French health minister, speaking after the meeting, said. \u201cNothing will be as it was before. France has seen what it owes its nurses and carers \u2026 their work is the pride of the whole nation.\u201d In a brief mea culpa, he said the government had not acted \u201cquickly or strongly enough\u201d in its hospital reforms in recent years. He said \u201cradical measures\u201d were needed to combat the nurses\u2019 \u201cmalaise\u201d, and not just pay rises. He said France needed a \u201chealth system that was renewed and rearmed and capable of dealing with all risks, all threats\u201d. Thousands of delegates streaming into Beijing for China\u2019s most important political event of the year have undergone nucleic acid tests and quarantines amid what state media have called \u201cwartime measures\u201d, writes Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing correspondent. The National People\u2019s Congress is usually a two-week affair of pomp and pageantry but this year\u2019s event has been shortened and some sessions will be held over video link. Railway stations have implemented extra screening for travellers coming to the capital and residential communities are meant to maintain strict \u201cclose management\u201d \u2013 allowing only registered residents in and out. Officials have temporarily banned the sale of petrol in bulk, as well as firecrackers. Balloons for sporting events or other types of aerial advertising are also barred. Even more so than other years, it is critical that the parliamentary session \u2013 which coincides with the meeting of an advisory body, collectively known as \u201ctwo sessions\u201d \u2013 goes off without a hitch. The event, a time for China\u2019s political elite to rubber-stamp policies and indicate new policy directions, was delayed for two months because of the coronavirus. In holding the two sessions, which begin on Thursday and Friday, Beijing is not only signalling its victory over the virus but is trying to emphasise control and leadership as it tries to move on from the pandemic. China is in unchartered territory of economic struggle and discontent at home and increased hostility from abroad, which makes the event especially important for its leader, Xi Jinping, who over the years has centralised power and embodies the government\u2019s response to crises. A US drug company has said its experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown to produce protective antibodies and immune responses in mice and guinea pigs, Reuters reports. Inovio is one of dozens of companies and teams around the world racing to produce a vaccine for the virus. Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. David Weiner, director of the vaccine and immunotherapy centre at the Wistar institute, which has collaborated with Inovio, said: We saw antibody responses that do many of the things we would want to see in an eventual vaccine. We are able to target things that would prevent the virus from having a safe harbour in the body. Inovio, which began human testing of its vaccine in April, said preliminary results from that trial are expected in June. Human development - the combination of rises in education, health and living standards - could decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced in 1990, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has said. UNDP said the impact was being felt all over the world, in both rich and poor countries, but added that the pandemic, and the crisis it had caused, was acting as \u201ca magnifying glass for inequalities.\u201d UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: The world has seen many crises over the past 30 years, including the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Each has hit human development hard but, overall, development gains accrued globally year-on-year. COVID-19 \u2013 with its triple hit to health, education, and income \u2013 may change this trend. Countries that are less able to cope with the social and economic fallout of worldwide lockdown would be likely to face a much steeper drop in development, the agency said. Pedro Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP, said: This crisis shows that if we fail to bring equity into the policy toolkit, many will fall further behind. This is particularly important for the \u2018new necessities\u2019 of the 21st century, such as access to the Internet, which is helping us to benefit from tele-education, tele-medicine, and to work from home. More than a million people in South Africa could be infected by coronavirus, causing at least 40,000 deaths, by the time the disease reaches a likely peak in the country in November, scientists have said. A consortium called the Modelling and Simulation Hub Africa (MASHA), comprising experts from the University of Cape Town and the Department of Health, released its first projections of the impact of the pandemic late Tuesday, according to a report by AFP. In an optimistic scenario there would be just over 40,000 deaths by November, said MASHA\u2019s head, Sheetal Silal. In a pessimistic scenario, the death toll would be 45,000-48,000, she said. Silal stressed the wide degree of uncertainty for making forecasts at this stage. \u201cHere we are trying to make projections on the entire span of the epidemic for the next six to eight months, so there is considerable uncertainty,\u201d she said. South Africa reported its first coronavirus case on 5 March. Its registered tally now stands at 17,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 312 deaths, in a country of 57 million.

In the United States, where Donald Trump continues to point the finger at China, a new nationally-representative survey has shown that the vast majority of the country\u2019s nurses say they have not been tested for Covid-19, are reusing personal protective equipment, or have exposed skin or clothing while caring for coronavirus patients. The survey finds that \u201cdangerous health care workplace conditions have become the norm\u201d since Covid-19 spread widely within the United States, said the union which conducted the survey. More than 100 nurses have died since the beginning of the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for years we\u2019re behind,\u201d said Jean Ross, president of National Nurses United. Not because we couldn\u2019t have what we needed \u2013 because we are the richest country on the planet \u2013 but because of greed, because of the profit system that doesn\u2019t really look out for the welfare of patients, therefore it couldn\u2019t possibly look out for the welfare of workers.\u201d The survey asked more than 23,000 nurses across all 50 states and Washington DC about their working conditions since the pandemic started. The survey represents the period between 15 April and 10 May, and was conducted by National Nurses United. It included both union and non-union nurses. Donald Trump has lashed out at China over the Covid-19 pandemic, blaming Beijing for \u201cmass Worldwide killing\u201d. In a tweet, the US president referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China,\u201d in the latest of a series of attacks aimed at the country which he appears to be framing as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Trump, who initially played down the seriousness of the threat, later changed course and blamed China for allowing the international spread of coronavirus. The worldwide Covid-19 death toll stands at 323,000. Trump wrote: \u201cSome wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the \u201cincompetence of China\u201d, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!\u201d Trump did not specify which statement he was referring to but it follows a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman hitting back after Trump sent a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the World Health Organization had not been sufficiently independent of China, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao said. The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view\u201d, says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job description fresh to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment. Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, is frank in her views in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began. \u201cLooking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges in from the different countries in terms of population immunity \u2013 which isn\u2019t all that exciting between 2% and 14%, that leaves still 85% to 90% of the population susceptible \u2013 the virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February \u2026 I don\u2019t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d In Hong Kong, where authorities have effectively banned an annual vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre by extending Covid-19 physical distancing measures for another 14 days, people are being urged to instead light candles. Following months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, the 4 June anniversary of the Chinese military\u2019s slaughter of innocent student protesters in 1989 is likely to be particularly poignant. Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong have joined sombre and peaceful candlelit vigils in years gone as part of the world\u2019s biggest commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in Beijing, when Chinese troops opened fire on student-led protesters. But after Hong Kong authorities said on Tuesday that the limit on group gatherings to no more than eight people would be extended at least until 4 June, an organiser is calling for a different approach. Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organises the annual vigils, told Reuters he believed the motive for the extension was \u201cpolitical suppression\u201d. \u201cWe have to have a plan B,\u201d Lee said. \u201cInstead of one point, we will do it everywhere, still with the powerful candlelight to condemn the massacre and mourn for those who died in 1989.\u201d Police have still to respond to an application for the vigil to be held in Victoria Park, Lee said, adding that he was not optimistic. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday health measures were not based on political considerations. Hello, readers. This is Simon Murphy now covering the global live blog while my colleague, Damien Gayle, takes a break. The Trump administration has called on the UN to remove references to sexual and reproductive health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan (HRP), writes Liz Ford, deputy editor of the Guardian\u2019s Global development website. In a letter to the UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Monday, John Barsa, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development (USAid), called on the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d and not include abortion as an essential service. Barsa\u2019s letter said the plan \u201cunfortunately \u2026 does just this, by cynically placing the provision of \u2018sexual and reproductive health services\u2019 on the same level of importance as food insecurity, essential health care, malnutrition, shelter, and sanitation\u201d. He highlighted the $650.7m (\u00a3530m) USAid had contributed to pandemic funding. It was essential the UN\u2019s response avoided creating controversy, it read. \u201cTherefore, I ask that you remove references to \u2018sexual and reproductive health\u2019, and its derivatives from the Global HRP, and drop the provision of abortion as an essential component of the UN\u2019s priorities to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures revealing the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, writes Richard Partington, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent. Warning that there was little evidence of the downturn ending soon as Covid-19 brings the world economy to an effective standstill, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall \u201cprecipitously\u201d in the first-half of 2020. The WTO\u2019s quarterly goods trades barometer, which provides real-time information on the trajectory of world merchandise trade relative to recent trends, slumped to 87.6 on a scale where anything below 100 indicates a downturn in activity. Suggesting a sharp contraction in world trade extending into the second-quarter of 2020, the reading was the lowest value on record since the indicator was launched in July 2016. The Netherlands reported thirty-three new deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as 198 more people tested positive for the coronavirus. According to the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM), 44,447 people have so far been diagnosed as infected with the virus, of whom 5,748 have died. There have been 11,627 patients treated in hospital as a result of the outbreak, with 14 new admissions reported by RIVM on Wednesday. Eighty-eight more people have been recorded as dying from Covid-19 in Sweden, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll to 3,831. The latest update from Sweden\u2019s health authority also showed that 724 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus that causes the disease. Sweden has not followed the rest of the world in imposing strict restrictive measures and business closures to contain the spread of the virus. The reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks \u2013 and has sparked a race row in the process, writes Morwenna Ferrier, the Guardian\u2019s acting joint fashion editor. Launched over the weekend under the celebrity\u2019s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them. But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of \u201ccasual racism\u201d, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment at time of publication. Police in Sri Lanka have arrested more than 60,000 people over the past two months for breaking a curfew imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus, Xinhua reports. A 24-hour curfew has been in force in the capital, Colombo, and its outskirts since 20 March, while the rest of the country is under nighttime curfew. An end date to movement restrictions has not been specified. According to a statement published on Wednesday by the Sri Lankan police, seen by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, 60,425 people had been arrested since the curfew was imposed, for infractions such as loitering on the roads, gathering and consuming alcohol at public grounds, travelling by vehicle on the roads and behaving in an unruly manner while intoxicated. The epidemiology unit of Sri Lanka\u2019s ministry of health on Wednesday reported four new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 1,027. Of those, 584 patients have recovered and 434 were under medical care. Nine people have died from Covid-19. With Greece about to unveil its much-awaited tourism plan, some are gearing up with a gusto for the season, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. As the country gradually emerges into the post-lockdown age and restrictions are eased, beaches have been opened up. But some bathers - extending the notion of the \u201cnew normal\u201d to the sea - are taking no chances. On Mykonos, one swimmer was snapped in masks and gloves as he had a paddle in the waters off the Cycladic isle - which is, like all Greek islands, still mercifully coronavirus-free. Hats off to Ioannis Alexopoulos. In a rare success story Greece has virtually eradicated the virus after enforcing draconian measures to curb the spread of the virus early on. Nigeria\u2019s largest medical union has instructed its health staff in Lagos to end their hospital shifts at 6pm each day, 2-hours before the city-wide curfew, in response to rising reports of police harassment, writes Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian\u2019s West Africa correspondent. There is an 8pm curfew in Lagos under its gradually easing lockdown measures, but in recent days reports have been rife of harassment and abuse by police officers to essential workers, after 8pm. The Nigerian Medical Association president, Dr. Francis Faduyile, told The Guardian that authorities were policing the lockdown curfew indiscriminately. \u201cYesterday a lot of senior doctors were stopped from going home after hours by police,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be asking them why they are doing this.\u201d \u201cDoctors will stay at home after 6pm to prevent themselves from being embarrassed and molested by police officers,\u201d he added. Lagos\u2019 lockdown curfew exempts essential workers, yet there is insufficient clarity between different agencies on who qualifies. Faduyile said the government needed to clarify to police that health workers were essential. Yesterday videos and pictures showed police in different parts of Nigeria\u2019s most populous city, mounting roadblocks after 8pm for hours before letting commuters go. Security agencies policing the lockdowns in Nigeria have come under scrutiny amid reports of abuses. Lagos is the most affected city in Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak, with 2,750 of Nigeria\u2019s 6,400 infections. Cases in the country continue to rise, doubling in just over a fortnight, but test capacity has only marginally improved over that time. Africa\u2019s most populous country has administered just 37,000 tests, \u201ca far cry from what is needed\u201d Faduyile said, and low compared to other African countries. Neighbouring Ghana and South Africa have tested 170,000 and 475,000 respectively. Compounding challenges with the availability of test kits, poor infrastructure had made it hard to distribute its limited supply, and to transport test samples around the country, Faduyile said. More than 90,000 people in Africa have been infected with the coronavirus, according to the latest daily update from the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. On Wednesday, Antonio Guterres praised the \u201cbrave prevention measures\u201d imposed by African governments to curb the spread of the virus, after a the kind of widespread outbreak predicted across the continent failed to materialise. However there have been consistent criticisms of civil rights abuses, police brutality, and millions left unable to make ends meet. The South Korean football club FC Seoul are facing penalties, including expulsion from their own stadium, for putting sex dolls in empty seats during a match last weekend, according to the Associated Press. The K-League is one of the few football leagues operating during the coronavirus pandemic, with games being played in empty stadiums but FC Seoul\u2019s attempts to increase the atmosphere at Seoul World Cup Stadium backfired after their 1-0 win over Gwangju on Sunday. The club expressed their sincere remorse as a public backlash intensified, but said they were assured by a supplier that they were using mannequins not sex dolls to mimic a home crowd. About 25 mannequins were supplied by a local company and dressed in FC Seoul colours and wearing masks. The Yonhap news agency reported that fans posted suspicions about the life-size dolls on social media during the match and one banner showed the names of an adult toy manufacturer and of models who had inspired those dolls. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus coverage: The global confirmed cases of coronavirus has topped 4.9 million, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally, at least 323,653 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,915,004 are confirmed as having been infected. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Russia passed 300,000. The number, already the second highest in the world, now stands at 308,705, after 8,764 coronavirus infections were reported on Wednesday, but the daily increase was the lowest since 1 May. The Spanish government has confirmed that the wearing of face masks will be compulsory from Thursday in enclosed areas and on streets when the required two-metre social distancing protocols cannot be followed. While children under six will be exempt from the order, masks are recommended for children aged three to five. The aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is to cut at least 9,000 jobs from its global staff of 52,000, due to an anticipated fall in air travel following the coronavirus pandemic. The British company said the job losses would predominantly affect its civil aerospace business, plus its central support functions. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that the developed world could learn lessons from African countries\u2019 preventative measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent. Brazil confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Sixteen more people have died from Covid-19 in Bangladesh, as the arrival of what could be the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicates efforts to maintain measures to curb the spread of the disease. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety, officials said, as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. The highest level of alert was raised at 6am, said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management and relief. It came as the latest update from the Bangladesh\u2019s institute of epidemiology, disease control and research (IEDCR), reported that 1,617 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the most in a single day since widespread testing began in the country. So far Bangladesh has recorded 26,738 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 386 deaths from the Covid-19 respiratory disease it can cause. Videos and photos showed people heading to shelters, some carrying bags with their belongings and all wearing masks to protect against coronavirus. Officials went from village to village with loudspeakers warning people to take shelter. In Sathira district, the local chief government administrator, SM Mostafa Kamal, said evacuees were given dry food, baby food and medicine. He said officials were distributing masks and other safety equipment to keep coronavirus from spreading while people stay in thousands of shelters. The cyclone slowed slightly as it reached cooler waters near the coast. But with wind speeds ranging between 160 and 170 km/h, the storm could cause extensive damage: winds and heavy rain battering flimsy houses, a storm surge that may push seawater 25km inland and the possibility of flooding in crowded cities. The cyclone is occurring during the Islamic holy month Ramadan, and reports from Muslim-majority Bangladesh said many villagers were fasting all day Tuesday, then eating at night before heading for the shelters early Wednesday. Iran reported a further 64 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the total death toll in the Islamic republic to 7,183, with 2,735 people in a critical condition in hospital with the disease. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 2,346 more people had tested positive for the virus since Tuesday. Iran has so far counted 126,949 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, of whom 98,808 people had recovered. Jahanpour said that 731,213 tests have so far been carried out in Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. New York faces enormous challenges in its attempts to implement one of the largest contact tracing schemes in the US, as the city prepares to reopen after nearly two months of coronavirus lockdown, writes Miranda Bryant for the Guardian US. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said the state is recruiting an \u201carmy of people to trace each person who tested positive\u201d for an \u201cunprecedented, nation-leading contact-tracing programme\u201d. The New York city mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced a new test and trace corps, which he said would \u201clead the way in creating testing and tracing on a level we\u2019ve never seen before in this city or this country\u201d. Contact tracing is considered to be a key pillar of safely lifting stay-at-home orders, and involves asking Covid-19 patients to recall everyone they have had close contact with while they may have been infectious, and asking those people to quarantine themselves to help prevent the virus from spreading. In countries such as South Korea and Germany, early contact tracing has been credited with successfully minimising outbreaks. But as New York authorities roll out their plans to hire and train thousands of contact tracers, experts warn of the difficulties of pulling it off in the city of 8.6 million in which the pandemic has killed more than 20,000 people. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, an anti-Asian sentiment has been on the rise \u2013 and now the fashion community is putting itself at the forefront in tackling the hate, writes Priya Elan, the Guardian\u2019s deputy fashion editor. In the UK, racist incidents have rocketed and hate crimes have increased by 21%, while in the US, there has been an increase in racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans. \u201cThe upturn of violence and discrimination really hit way too close to home for all of us,\u201d says the US designer Phillip Lim. \u201cWhen we see people who look like us, our friends and family members, colleagues being attacked, we can\u2019t be silent.\u201d Lim\u2019s 3.1 Phillip Lim label and Prabal Gurung are among the fashion brands contributing clothing, including T-shirts and hats, with proceeds going to the All Americans Movement, a campaign to help those from marginalised communities who have been affected by Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s a cross-cultural movement, which reinforces the idea that there are many different ways to be American,\u201d says Gurung, the Nepalese-American fashion designer who is based in New York. \u201cIt is an idea: a confluence of different cultures, communities and dreams. When different minority groups stand up and stand together, there is an astounding level of support that can change the tides for a more equitable and peaceful future.\u201d Holidaymakers will be welcomed back to Spain \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, but only when safe to do so, the country\u2019s foreign minister has said, PA Media reports. Foreign minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said cities with high concentrations of Covid-19 infection \u2013 such as Madrid and Barcelona \u2013 remain under stricter rules than more rural areas, but that the country will reopen to visitors at the earliest possible opportunity. Gonz\u00e1lez told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We are hoping to get tourists back as soon as possible but we are also conscious that, when we welcome them, we want to provide the safest destination in Europe. We want to make sure when they come they can continue to experience the amazing stay in Spain, whether they love sports or culture or cuisine or simply like our weather. But we want to make sure that at this moment, when every country is suffering from this pandemic, we can provide them with a safe and healthy experience \u2013 that\u2019s top of our priorities right now. Lockdown measures in Spain have reflected its high numbers of casualties, with children confined indoors for six weeks between March and the end of April. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 8,000 in Afghanistan, as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive for the second day straight and Kabul recorded its worst day of the crisis, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii for the Guardian in Herat. The health ministry confirmed 492 new cases out of 1,003 tests and 10 deaths from Covid-19 over past 24 hours, raising the total number of infections to 8,145 and death toll to 187. The ministry has pledged to increase number of daily tests. So far, 25,700 suspected patients have been tested. The country received 250 RNA extraction kits from the World Health Organization on Tuesday. Health officials asked the nation to avoid gathering for Eid, which is scheduled for the end of this week, and warned that the Eid gatherings will bring a surge in transmission as the country is yet to reach the peak of the pandemic. Kabul, the capital, recorded its worst day, after 262 of 522 tests came back positive. The city is the country\u2019s worst-affected area by confirmed cases and, despite a government authorised lockdown, streets are still crowded. The northern province of Balkh exceeded Kabul in number of deaths, with three of the latest Covid-19 deaths reported in the province. Balkh has so far recorded 27 deaths and 622 cases. Four of the new deaths were reported in the eastern province of Nangarhar. The western province of Herat recorded 59 new confirmed cases. Afghanistan\u2019s first case of Covid-19 was in Herat, when thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran, the scene of one of the earliest outbreaks outside China, in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The total number of infections in Herat stands at 1,345, with 25 deaths. Parwan province recorded nine new coronavirus cases. At least seven people were killed in the province Tuesday night when \u201cunknown\u201d gunmen stormed a mosque. The northern Takhar province, which was also a battlefield last night, reported 28 new cases. At least nine members of local police force were killed and six were wounded in a clash with the Taliban in Takhar on Tuesday night. War is raging on with full intensity across the country as president Ashraf Ghani, in response to an attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul, ordered resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups. At least eight security forces were killed when Taliban fighters tried to overrun northern province of Kunduz Tuesday. According to the defence ministry more 40 Taliban fighters were also killed in the attack. The UN mission in Afghanistan asked asked warring sides on Tuesday to halt the fighting and to \u201crespect humanitarian law\u201d. Hello, this is Damien Gayle taking on the live blog now, and bringing you the latest in coronavirus-related world news for the next eight hours or so. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions about what we could be covering, please feel free to drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. Thanks everyone, I\u2019m signing off now and handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle. Thanks for reading and for your mails too. Open-air swimming pools in Germany are beginning to reopen from today, as virologists say they are confident the coronavirus will be killed off by chlorine levels in the water. Authorities in the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia have granted the 340 lidos in the region permission to open their doors from today as long as they abide by new hygiene rules that include an online-only booking system and a daily cap of visitors. In Berlin, swimming pools are set to open from 25 May, while other states will follow suit in June. \u201cAll existing findings indicate that the virus is certain to be killed off by chlorine\u201d, the German Society for Bathing said in a statement. \u201cTherefore there is no higher risk of infection in swimming pools than in other establishments\u201d. \u201cIn indoor and outdoor swimming pools the virus will be killed off by the chlorine\u201d, virologist J\u00fcrgen Rissland told regional broadcaster Saarl\u00e4ndischer Rundfunk. The risk areas at lidos were therefore not in the water but the adjacent facilities. Berlin is therefore planning to open its outdoor swimming pools without showers and changing rooms, advising visitors to arrive at the pool in their swimwear. Further aiding Spain\u2019s fight against the coronavirus is a new development in Seville: Beer Cart, a robotic arm trained to pull contactless pints. With lockdown measures being applied at a regional level in the country, some parts of Spain have moved to \u201cphase one\u201d of reopening. This includes the capability for bars and cafes to open at reduced capacity and with strict hygiene measures, ideal for robotic staff. Beer Cart has been employed at La Gitana Loca, a bar in Seville, where it has become a local sensation. The bar\u2019s owner, Alberto Martinez, said he had bought the robot before the epidemic took hold, hoping mechanical manpower would increase sales. Because of the crisis, it was never put into use \u2013 although he realised it would be perfect in the new environment where people need to stay apart. \u201cWe thought it would be ideal for reopening in phase one,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the aim is to avoid contact between customers and items (in the bar) \u2026 we realised the robot would be good using (disposable) plastic cups to serve beer, so it\u2019s all very self-service.\u201d Even so, the bar is far from making a profit, with only 12 customers allowed at one time on the outdoor terrace. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s not profitable to open for the few seats we\u2019re allowed. Now that we have to compete with other bars we have to do something different,\u201d he said. \u201cSo (with the robot on show) people can see that the bar on the corner is open and that we\u2019re doing something different.\u201d The Spanish government has confirmed that the wearing of face masks will be compulsory from Thursday in enclosed areas and on the streets when the required 2-metre social distancing protocols cannot be followed. While children under six will be exempt from the order, masks are recommended for children aged three to five. People with breathing difficulties are also exempt from using masks. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said the measure was intended to protect both the wearer and those around them. He also said there were clear differences between going for a solitary walk in the countryside and navigating busy city streets. \u201cThe rules aren\u2019t that complicated: you need to keep a distance from others of around 2 metres,\u201d he said. \u201cIf logically, you\u2019re on the street and realised that won\u2019t be possible, you put on your mask and that\u2019s that.\u201d Until now, face masks \u2013 which are being handed out at train and metro stations \u2013 have been compulsory only on public transport. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, addressed MPs in congress on Wednesday morning to seek their approval for a fifth, two-week extension of the state-of-emergency that has been in force since 14 March. The prime minister apologised for the mistakes his Socialist-led coalition had made during the pandemic, but said the progress made over the past two months needed to be consolidated with another extension of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. \u201cIt is the people who have beaten the curve,\u201d he said. \u201cSpaniards have come together to stop the virus and no one has the right to squander what we\u2019ve achieved with the lockdown.\u201d His arguments were given short shrift by Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get us to choose between you and chaos, but that\u2019s impossible because you are chaos,\u201d said Casado. \u201cYou have no way of protecting the Spanish people except with this brutal confinement.\u201d The total number of coronavirus cases in Russia, already the second highest in the world, has passed 300,000. 8,764 new novel coronavirus infections reported on Wednesday took the nationwide total to 308,705. The daily increase was the lowest since 1 May, however. Dr Melita Vujnovich, the WHO\u2019s Russia representative, said she believed the situation in the country had entered a stabilisation phase, the Tass news agency cited her as saying. Only the US has reported more cases than Russia, though the Russian death rate remains much lower than many other countries, something that has been questioned by some critics and relatives of those who have died. Russia says the way it counts deaths is more accurate than others however and has defended its approach. The overall death toll edged up to 2,972 on Wednesday, with 135 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s coronavirus response centre said. Indonesia reported 693 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise and taking the total number of cases to 19,189, according to the website of Indonesia*s Covid-19 taskforce. There were 21 additional deaths reported, taking the total to 1,242, while 4,575 people have recovered. Indonesia reported its first case of Coronavirus on 2 March. The head of Uefa, European football\u2019s governing body, has given an interview to the Guardian discussing the effect of Covid-19 on the sport. Among the highlights, he suggests live matches with fans will be back \u201cvery soon\u201d. How would you describe the current situation and your feelings about it? There\u2019s a lot of work still to be done. I was in Switzerland last week for the first time in two months and had meetings from 9am to 11pm. There is so much information [to take in] and so many calendar issues \u2013 and so many millions and millions, dozens of millions of dollars, that we will lose. It is then hard to fall asleep at night. You would be quite irresponsible if you could fall asleep immediately after a day like that. The situation for Uefa is not that alarming, we\u2019re not in a dangerous situation, but we still care about the clubs and the leagues and the stakeholders so it is a lot of work. Would you bet a million dollars that Euro 2020 will be played in 2021? Yes, I would \u2026 I don\u2019t know why it wouldn\u2019t be. I don\u2019t think that this virus will last for ever. I think it will [change] sooner than many think. What gives you that impression? It\u2019s a serious situation but it is going down now and we are being more cautious. We know more about the virus and in general I\u2019m an optimistic person. I don\u2019t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave \u2026 people you know are likely to die one day, but do we have to be worried today? I don\u2019t think so. We are ready and we will follow the recommendations of the authorities but I\u2019m absolutely sure, personally, that good old football with fans will come back very soon. Police in the Philippines have raided an illegal hospital that had been secretly treating Chinese coronavirus patients. Two people were arrested and one patient was found during the raid on Tuesday at a residential villa that had been turned into a hospital with seven beds and its own chemists, authorities said. More than 200 suspected coronavirus rapid test kits and syringes were recovered from the villa, which was in the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone on the site of a former American air base. At the entrance to the building was a small canteen with stacks of beer cases and a red sign welcoming visitors with well wishes in Chinese. The Chinese male patient was moved to a legal hospital. Those arrested were the Chinese administrator of the illegal hospital, which may have been operating secretly for about three months, and a compatriot who manned the drugstore. Police told the Associated Press that the patients were likely to have come from a large number of Chinese nationals working for online gambling companies in the area. The Philippines, backed by the Chinese government, has launched a crackdown on Chinese citizens who enter the country as tourists and then work for gambling operations, which are illegal in China. The patients are believed to have avoided visiting public hospitals for fear of being arrested. The Philippines has reported nearly 13,000 coronavirus infections, including 837 deaths, among the highest in south-east Asia. China will have to \u2018rapidly activate domestic demand\u2019, according to the country\u2019s minister for industry, as the coronavirus cuts into global trade. The communist state has been for decades been the world\u2019s factory, manufacturing much of its goods, but despite a recent rebound the effects of the pandemic has cut into China\u2019s ability to sell. The Chinese minister for industry and information technology, Miao Wei told a news conference on Wednesday that \u201calthough our imports and exports in renminbi terms from January to April have increased moderately, I think that if the global pandemic cannot come under effective control, this is unsustainable\u201d. To drive economic growth, the country will \u201crapidly activate domestic demand\u201d to make up for weakness in the international markets, he said. China had already been trying to boost consumption as a key driver of domestic growth in a drive to recalibrate the economy from one driven by exports and state investment. The aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is to cut at least 9,000 jobs from its global staff of 52,000, due to an anticipated fall in air travel following the coronavirus pandemic. The British company, which supplies engines for large aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, said the job losses would predominantly affect its civil aerospace business, plus its central support functions. Air travel has slumped since March because of travel restrictions and future flight schedules may not return to their previous peak, hurting Rolls-Royce, which earns revenues from the number of hours its engines fly. The total number of Covid-19 cases worldwide has passed 4.9m, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The latest figures show 4,900,253 global cases and 323,341 deaths. The US continues to show the most cases, with nearly a third of the global total at 1,528,566 and 91,921 deaths. The International Energy Agency has warned that countries must redouble their efforts to increase renewable energy supply as the world recovers from the coronavirus crisis. The agency predicts that renewables are set to see a drop in growth for the first time in two decades following the pandemic. While capacity within the power sector is expected to continue to grow, the use of renewables in transport will likely fall due to a drop in travel and the crash in the price of oil. The agency, which had expected 2020 to be a marquee year for green energy, cut its two-year forecast for growth in renewable capacity by nearly 10%t. \u201cPutting emissions into a structural decline needed renewables to grow much faster across all sectors even before the Covid-19 crisis,\u201d the IEA said in an updated forecast. \u201cTo regain and exceed the growth rates seen in the years before the pandemic, policymakers need to put clean energy \u2013 including renewables and energy efficiency \u2013 at the centre of recovery efforts.\u201d Revising downwards a prediction made in October, the IEA now expects 167GW of renewable capacity to become operational this year \u2013 a decline of 13% from 2019 and the first downward trend since 2000. However, this will still add 6% to the global renewable capacity total this year \u2013 more than the combined size of power systems in both North America and Europe \u2013 with solar and wind accounting for the vast majority of new installations. Hallo there, this is Paul MacInnes and I\u2019m taking over from Helen for the next four hours. Any questions or tips feel free to email me: paul.macinnes@theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thank you for following along \u2013 and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019. The US president told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call. A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a \u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.\u201d There have only been limited studies on the drug in relation to Covid-19 so far. New Zealand PM flags four-day working week. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. High schools open in South Korea. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. China gears up for annual congress. China\u2019s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy. WHO assembly passes a resolution to investigate global pandemic response. Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The resolution backs the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to deny and delay refunds for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to new research from a UK consumer group. The latest consumer insight tracker from Which? reveals that trust in airlines and holiday companies has slumped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to -12 in May 2020, a fall of 21 points and the lowest in the seven years of collecting the data. Global report: Brazil\u2019s deadliest day as Trump calls US cases a \u2018badge of honour\u2019 Brazil has seen its most deadly day since the coronavirus outbreak began, prompting Donald Trump to consider a ban on travel to the US from Brazil as he declared the huge number of US cases of coronavirus was \u201ca badge of honour\u201d. After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday at the White House, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don\u2019t want people over there sick either,\u201d in relation to Brazil. When asked if about the possibility of a travel ban, the president said he was considering it and went on to say he saw the large number of US cases as a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d. The US has by far the highest number of cases in the world, at more than 1.5 million with nearly 92,000 deaths, followed by Russia and then Brazil, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. The death toll in Brazil reached a total of 17,971 on Tuesday, after a record 1,179 people died in one day. The highest daily toll before Tuesday had been 881 deaths, on 12 May. More than 85% of intensive care beds are full in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely. Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. \u201cFor the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,\u201d a spokesperson for Singapore\u2019s supreme court said in response to Reuters\u2019 questions, citing restrictions imposed to minimise virus spread. It was the first criminal case where a death sentence has been pronounced by remote hearing in Singapore, the spokesperson added. Genasan\u2019s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client received the judge\u2019s verdict on a Zoom call and is considering an appeal. The global growth of renewable energy will slow for the first time in 20 years due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which will \u201churt but not halt\u201d the rise of clean energy. The world\u2019s energy watchdog has warned that developers will build fewer wind farms and solar energy projects this year compared with a record roll out of renewables in 2019. But a rebound is possible in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if critical government decisions made within the next few months support a green economic recovery from the pandemic. New figures from the IEA predict that the world will grow its capacity of renewable energy by 6% or 167 GW this year. The forecast growth is 13% less than the amount of new capacity which started up in 2019. The slowdown is likely to be more severe in Europe. The IEA expects the amount of new renewable energy rolling out this year to fall by a third to its lowest annual growth rate since 1996. Contact tracers lack knowledge about Covid-19 job They were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201cdetailed\u201d instruction needed for such an important role \u2013 but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits. People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles. New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the Guardian. When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic. UK plans for contact-tracing in doubt as app not ready until June The Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh, Frances Perraudin, Heather Stewart and Peter Walker report: Plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty as it emerged that a mobile tracking app will not be ready until June. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the app would be \u201crolling out in mid May\u201d across England, but on Tuesday ministerial sources tried to downplay a system considered critical to control the disease as the country emerges from lockdown. It came as the deputy chief scientific adviser acknowledged the decision to abandon track-and-trace in March was made because of a lack of testing capacity, but said it was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d in the circumstances. Prof Angela McLean told the No 10 press briefing: \u201cThe advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available. It was what was the best thing to do with the tests that we had. We could not have people in hospital with Covid symptoms not knowing whether or not they had Covid.\u201d Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis in decades, as well as a coronavirus lockdown. Some Lebanese families have started paying their home help in the depreciating local currency, while others are now unable to pay them at all, with increasing reports of domestic workers being thrown into the street, AFP reports. Lebanon is to start repatriation flights from its closed airport on Wednesday, at first for Ethiopians and mostly male migrants from Egypt. Outside the Ethiopian consulate in Beirut on Monday, dozens of Ethiopian women and Lebanese employers tried to secure seats on Wednesday\u2019s flight. But Lebanese security forces turned them away at the door, telling them to return in nine days and employers that they would have to pay for the flight. An estimated 250,000 domestic workers live in Lebanon, the large majority Ethiopian, many in conditions condemned by rights groups. A sponsorship system known as \u201ckafala\u201d excludes maids, nannies and carers from Lebanon\u2019s labour law, and leaves them at the mercy of their employers, who pay wages as low as $150 a month. With staff obtained at high fees from recruitment agencies even before being paid wages, and unhappy workers unable to resign without their employer\u2019s permission, some have likened the system to slavery. Activists say calls for help have increased in recent weeks, especially as live-in workers have been in lockdown with families. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: \u201cThat was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration\u201d . Trump also said the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019.

New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues.In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. High schools open in South Korea. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time this year, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. China gears up for annual congress. China\u2019s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy, AFP reports. The World Health Organization annual assembly passes a resolution to investigate global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. First UAE flight to Israel, with virus aid for Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates flew its first publicly announced flight to Israel on Tuesday when Etihad Airways sent medical supplies to help the Palestinians cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Except for Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries have no official relations with Israel but Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and the Jewish state have been warming ties recently amid shared concern over Iran. California\u2019s undocumented relief fund sees chaotic start. Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. South Africa eased its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country\u2019s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country\u2019s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. China\u2019s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy, AFP reports. The 3,000 members of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), China\u2019s legislature, will gather in Beijing this week. The annual gatherings have been occasions for the Communist Party to tout its achievements, set the country\u2019s economic agenda and consolidate Xi\u2019s power. But this year\u2019s congress comes on the back of the biggest challenge of Xi\u2019s political life, with a virus that has killed thousands of people, paralysed the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and sparked a bout of online criticism of the government. The Communist Party put off the \u201cTwo Sessions\u201d, originally scheduled for March, for the first time since the Cultural Revolution as the country battled the coronavirus, which surfaced in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Since then, China\u2019s official case numbers have dwindled even as millions were infected abroad, with Beijing now positioning itself as a success story and potential saviour for the world, offering billions of dollars in aid to fight the virus. But the atmosphere will continue to be \u201csolemn and tense\u201d amid fears of new infections, Gu Su, a professor of law and philosophy at Nanjing University, said. The congress is expected to span seven days this year instead of the usual two weeks, state media reported. Lights, camera, no action: Thai films banned from shooting love scenes during Covid-19 Thailand\u2019s film industry has been instructed not to shoot any love scenes, fighting or acts that involve close contact, to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. As officials continued to relax lockdown measures across Thailand, production companies were told to adapt their work to comply with social distancing rules. Under guidance issued by Yupha Thawiwattanakit Bowon, deputy permanent secretary of culture, filmmakers must work in well-ventilated spaces, with no more than 50 crew members present. Special effects and camera angles can be used to help depict scenes that would usually require intimacy or contact, and all people off-camera must wear a mask. The US President told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d The US has 1,527,895 cases. The country with the next-highest number of cases is Russia, with 299,941. Trump added: \u201cSo I view it as a badge of honour. Really, it\u2019s a badge of honour. It\u2019s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.\u201d The US also has the highest number of deaths worldwide, with 91,921. The next worst official death toll, in the UK, is 35,422, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The US testing rates are high, but not the highest worldwide. Its total tests per 1,000 people are the fourteenth-highest worldwide, according to Our World in Data. Sweden has taken a soft approach to virus restrictions and although its rules are likely to be in place longer than in other countries, officials are adamant their strategy is a winner in the long term, AFP reports. \u201cThis fight against Covid-19 is a marathon,\u201d Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said recently, adding that his officials \u201cstrongly believe\u201d their measures are viable for the long haul. While people in other European countries have gradually begun returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, Swedes have been strongly advised to continue working from home, and possibly not just for weeks, but for months to come. However, Sweden never imposed full lockdown measures \u2013 under-16s have continued to go to school, patrons have not been stopped from going to cafes, bars and restaurants. Sweden has 30,799 confirmed cases and a death toll of 3,743. Some have accused Sweden of playing Russian roulette with citizens\u2019 lives by allowing the virus to circulate slowly in society, with the main goal being to ensure the public healthcare system can keep pace. The consequences are difficult to miss - Sweden\u2019s death rate stood at 371 per million inhabitants on Tuesday, roughly eight times the rate in Norway and Finland, according to the Worldometer website. However, although Sweden\u2019s hospitals have reported strained conditions, they have not been overwhelmed. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 797 to 176,007, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 83 to 8,090, the tally showed. Australians in the country\u2019s most populous state will be able to vacation within its borders next month, when art galleries and museums will also reopen, as officials seek to boost an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The move will allow New South Wales state, home to Sydney, to open up tourist regions on its southern coast that were badly damaged by huge bushfires before the virus wreaked further havoc. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people would still need to adapt to a \u201cnew normal\u201d as officials maintain some of the social distancing measures that have been credited with keeping both Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low. Australia has reported just over 7,000 infections, including 100 deaths, among its population of 25 million. NSW, the hardest hit state, logged just four new cases over the past 24 hours, all international travellers already in quarantine. More than 7,000 test results over the same period showed no community transmission, Berejiklian said. There are almost 4.9 million cases of coronavirus globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with 4,897,492 currently confirmed. The current number of deaths is 323,285. Both cases and deaths are likely to be higher due to differing testing rates and underreporting. The 15 worst-affected countries in terms of cases are: US: 1,527,895 Russia: 299,941 Brazil: 271,885 United Kingdom: 250,138 Spain: 232,037 Italy: 226,699 France: 180,933 Germany: 177,778 Turkey: 151,615 Iran: 124,603 India: 106,475 Peru: 99,483 China: 84,063 Canada: 80,493 Saudi Arabia: 59,854 Venezuela imposed new curfews in a handful of towns along its borders with Colombia and Brazil in response to a jump in coronavirus cases which officials attributed mainly to returning migrants, Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Tuesday. In a state television address, Rodriguez said the South American country had detected 131 new cases in the past 24 hours, the most it has registered in a single day to date. He said that included 110 people who had contracted the virus abroad, bringing the total to 749, with 10 deaths. Millions of Venezuelans have emigrated in recent years due to an economic breakdown and humanitarian crisis, with many settling in nearby Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. But with lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus in those countries now hurting their economies, thousands have returned. Migrants returning to Venezuela are required to spend a 14-day quarantine period at shelters at the border, rather than in their home states. Venezuela has so far registered far fewer coronavirus cases than most major Latin American countries, but the daily case count has grown at a brisk rate in each of the last four days. Hospital workers warn that their facilities are unprepared for a major outbreak after years of underfunding South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time this year, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. The beginning of the spring semester has been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online. But with daily coronavirus cases sharply down since a February peak, teachers with thermometers and hand sanitisers welcomed seniors in masks at their high schools on Wednesday. Under new health guidelines for schools, students and teachers must wear masks except at mealtimes, and are asked to wipe down their desks. Windows will be open to improve air-flow, and desks spaced 1 metre (3 feet) apart. Starting with high school seniors, schools will reopen in stages between 20 May and 1 June for all 5.5 million elementary, middle and high school students. Share your experiences: how do you think New Zealand should change after Covid-19? A week into New Zealand\u2019s loosened lockdown laws and the country is beginning to return to a semblance of normality. Office workers are up early heading out for their commute in smart clothes, while children are lugging around schoolbags full of homework, and hairdressers are heaving with colours, cuts and trims. Has anything changed, and what changes should stick? During lockdown it seemed that New Zealand would collapse and be rebuilt after the pandemic. Many workers found they were unexpectedly productive at home, and relished ditching the expensive and climate-destroying commute, while many children enjoyed learning in less structured ways. Many families spent more time together, dogs were walked excessively, and home-cooking become the latest fashion. Get in touch on the form here: New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. The prime minister\u2019s informal comments have excited New Zealanders, many of whom are questioning whether seismic, systemic change will result from the pandemic \u2013 or whether life will return to normal; with its associated problems. Speaking from Rotorua, one of the country\u2019s tourist hubs, Ardern said many New Zealanders said they would travel more domestically if they had more flexibility in their working lives. The country\u2019s tourism market has taken a massive downturn after the pandemic, with all borders remaining closed to foreign nationals and many New Zealanders taking pay-cuts or tightening their belt in case of lay-offs. \u201cI hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day workweek. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I\u2019ve said there\u2019s just so much we\u2019ve learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,\u201d Ardern said. The United Arab Emirates flew its first publicly announced flight to Israel on Tuesday when Etihad Airways sent medical supplies to help the Palestinians cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Except for Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries have no official relations with Israel but Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and the Jewish state have been warming ties recently amid shared concern over Iran. \u201cEtihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,\u201d an Etihad spokesperson said. \u201cThe flight had no passengers on board.\u201d The official UAE news agency WAM said the flight involved the delivery of 14 tonnes of urgent medical supplies that \u201cwill support the efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and its impact in the occupied Palestinian territory\u201d. Israel controls access to the Palestinian territories. The Etihad delivery was described as part of broader humanitarian efforts. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cCovid-19 has made much slower progress [in Africa] than the predictions that were made at the beginning\u201d of the crisis, Guterres said in an interview with RFL radio in France. This has been largely thanks to the fact that \u201cmost African governments and organisations took in time very brave prevention measures which provide a lesson for some developed nations that did not,\u201d he added. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Podcast: The scientific race to understand Covid-19 In the five months since the world learned about Covid-19, it has killed hundreds of thousands of people. In that time, what have scientists found out \u2013 and what do they still not know? Coronavirus cases and deaths over time: how countries compare around the world The Guardian\u2019s Nick Evershed and Trent Nixon have created handy this handy set of epidemic curves for most countries, based on data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and compiled by Our World in Data. It shows, approximately, which countries have managed to suppress the virus, which countries are only now being hit badly, and which countries are experiencing a second wave of infections: Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. Adding to already overwhelmed telephone systems, the state issued last-minute directives that said callers needed to reach a live person in order to apply for aid. Nonprofits across the state selected to distribute the money reported huge demand as people rushed to secure a spot for the first-come, first-served program. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or Chirla, one of 12 nonprofits tapped by the state to distribute the funds, received more than 1.1m phone calls on day one of the program \u2013 630,000 calls just within the first 90 minutes of opening the hotline. Rare UK wildlife thriving in lockdown, reveals UK\u2019s National Trust First came the goats. During the first days of lockdown the bearded, ghostly white creatures wandered down from their north Wales clifftop home into the town of Llandudno and made headlines around the globe. Now the National Trust is reporting that emboldened wildlife, from raptors and warblers to badgers, otters and even orcas, appear to be enjoying the disappearance of humans from its gardens, castles and waterways across the UK. The charity is asking people to be aware that when they eventually return to the countryside they should take care not to disturb wildlife they would not usually expect to encounter. Reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset, English partridges rootling around an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley Park in west London, having not been heard there for 20 years. \u2018We do not feel safe\u2019: Samoan seafarers plead for right to return home Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson reports for the Guardian: Samoans trapped at sea due to coronavirus have pleaded with their government to allow them to return home. The 321 Samoan seafarers working on commercial and cruise ships around the world have been told by their government to be patient, since Samoa closed its borders in March to all travellers including returning citizens. Thirty-five of the seafarers whose contracts ended at the beginning of the pandemic are concerned for their families as their sources of income have stopped. Twelve of them are stranded on MSC Armonia, a cruise ship moored off the coast of the Bahamas. Jorge Contesse, law professor and director of the Center for Transnational Law, Rutgers University said the seafarers had the right to return to their home country and were protected under the 2006 maritime labour convention (MLC). \u201cUnder this convention seafarers are entitled to be repatriated at no cost to themselves.\u201d Samoa ratified the convention in 2013. Contesse said: \u201cSamoa has a duty to protect its citizens and therefore it should activate diplomatic communications and legal proceedings if necessary.\u201d The Pan-American Health Organization said Tuesday that Nicaragua\u2019s government has denied its personnel access to the nation\u2019s hospitals despite having offered access, a move adding to the widespread belief President Daniel Ortega is trying to underplay the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. Up to this week, Nicaragua had reported only 25 confirmed Covid-19 cases and eight related deaths. Those numbers became more difficult to defend as more Nicaraguans spoke out about the deaths of their relatives and reports mounted of near-clandestine burials. On Tuesday, Nicaragua\u2019s Health Ministry suddenly increased the case count tenfold, to 254, and said the number of deaths had grown to 17. But there is evidence suggesting that might still be a vast under-count. Victims\u2019 relatives claim that some cases are simply listed as atypical pneumonia or respiratory failure. On Monday, Ortega acknowledged that some of the 309 cases of people who have died of pneumonia since January might have involved Covid-19. Interestingly, on May 3 the health ministry had reported only 86 pneumonia deaths so far this year, suggesting there were 223 such deaths between 3 May and 15 May. Ortega\u2019s government has not implemented social distancing measures used elsewhere and continues to promote mass gatherings. Schools remain open and professional sporting events still draw fans. A registry of death certificates in Mexico City suggests there were 4,577 cases where doctors mentioned coronavirus or Covid-19 as a possible or probable cause of death, more than three times the official death toll in the city, AP reports. The federal government acknowledges only 1,332 confirmed deaths in Mexico City since the pandemic began, less than a third as many as the investigation revealed. The anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption said in a report Monday that it got access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between 18 March and 12 May. It showed that in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 death certificates, doctors included the words SARS, COV2, COV, Covid 19, or new coronavirus. The virus\u2019 technical name is SARS-CoV-2. The notes the group counted included terms like suspected, \u201cprobable, or possible role of the virus in the deaths. In 3,209 of the certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. Only 323 certificates list confirmed coronavirus as a cause of death; 1,045 other death certificates listed Covid-19 but didn\u2019t specify if it was suspected or confirmed. The group did not say how it accessed the database, which was kept by local courts. But it noted that official counts showed only 1,060 coronavirus deaths during that 18 March-12 May period. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has acknowledged there are more deaths than have officially been reported, and has said a special team of epidemiologists will review the death figures. US births continued to fall last year, leading to the fewest number of newborns in 35 years, AP reports. The decline is the latest sign of a prolonged national baby bust that\u2019s been going on for more than a decade. And some experts believe the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy will suppress the numbers further. Experts say there are a number of causes, but chief among them are shifting attitudes about motherhood: Many women and couples delay childbearing and have fewer kids once they start. The economy is a factor, because many jobs are low-paying and unstable, and that coupled with high rents and other factors have caused women and couples to be much more cautious about having kids, said John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health. Santelli said it\u2019s possible births will go up this year, at least among some groups. Access to birth control and abortion has become more difficult, and some homebound couples may find themselves with greater opportunity to conceive, he said. But others say it\u2019s more likely births will plummet. The idea that there will be a lot of coronababies is widely is widely perceived as a myth, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania fertility researcher. The debate most demographers are having is not about whether there will be a decline, but whether it will be lasting, he said. The decline due to Covid-19 might be different given the extent and severity of the crisis, and the long-lasting uncertainty that is caused by it, Kohler wrote in an email. Video: The US president has defended his use of the anti-malaria drug, dismissing a study indicating it was not an effective coronavirus treatment as a \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. He also attacked Nancy Pelosi after she publicly expressed concern, claiming she had \u2018mental problems\u2019: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says that his interim health minister will on Wednesday sign a new chloroquine protocol, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro said his own mother is 93 and he keeps a box of chloroquine in case she needs it. He also said that he saw Trump say he was taking chloroquine. Interim health minister General Eduardo Pazuello would stay on for the time being, Bolsonaro said. Last week, my colleague Dom Phillips reported, Brazil\u2019s health minister abruptly resigned after less than a month on the job. Teich was Brazil\u2019s second health minister to leave office in less than a month. In the weeks leading up to the resignation Teich had increasingly disagreed with Bolsonaro over social isolation and the use of the malaria drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus. The Brazilian president has enthusiastically backed using the drug, despite a string of medical studies showing that it has no positive effect on people suffering Covid-19, and can possibly cause other health complications. More on the resignation last week below: In case you missed it: beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in an alarming sign that the pandemic may be only at the start of its destructive march through the region. More than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile\u2019s capital, Santiago, whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths, AP reports. In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world\u2019s 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000.\u201cWere in bad shape,\u201d said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peruvian governments Covid-19 task force. \u201cThis is war.\u201d In some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn\u2019t get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren\u2019t as busy running the risk of spreading the disease further. A month after swamping the Ecuadorian coastal city of Guayaquil in one of the first serious blows to Latin America, Covid-19 is sickening thousands in the capital of Quito, where 80% of intensive care beds were occupied as of Friday. In terms of intensive care, we\u2019re stripped bare,\u201d city health secretary Len\u00edn Mantilla said. In Mexico, intensive care occupancy is below 50% in most cities, although deaths have begun to overwhelm funeral homes and crematoriums in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said.In the latest apocalyptic prediction by a member of the global financial elite, David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Malpass said that the World Bank group had so far loaned money for emergency programmes in 100 countries, accounting for about 70% of the world\u2019s population, in response to the crisis. He said the money would \u201creinforce healthcare systems\u201d as well as pay for medical equipment and supplies.According to a transcript of his speech on the World Bank website, he said: The health and economic impacts that the Covid-19 pandemic and shut down have inflicted on developing countries are severe. Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty \u2013 that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years. And our forecasts indicate deep recession this year as much as minus five percent recession for the global economy. Families have lost loved ones, millions of jobs and livelihoods are lost, the health systems are under enormous strain worldwide. In the UK, thousands of people with cancer could die early because so many hospitals have suspended surgery for the disease while the NHS battles the coronavirus, experts warn today. The pandemic will have \u201ca terrible indirect impact on the lives of cancer patients\u201d for months to come, on top of the devastation for families who have lost a loved one to Covid-19, according to research by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). The authors say that the disruption to NHS cancer treatment, and especially delays to operations to remove tumours, will lead directly to some people\u2019s disease having become incurable. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. This week Brazil overtook the United Kingdom to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections, amid warnings from its former health minister that three painful months lie ahead. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Brazil accounts for more cases than any other country in Latin America, which has seen 480,000-plus cases and 31,000 dead. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has snubbed physical distancing rules and has called for gyms, hair salons and other businesses to reopen. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s global live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest news from around the world for the next few hours. Please do get in touch with any comments, questions, tips, stories or jokes on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. The World Bank estimates that 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty, World Bank chief David Malpass said in a speech, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Meanwhile Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed death toll passes 322,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 322,457 people are known to have died while at least 4,881,619 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: \u201cThat was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration\u201d . The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population. The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. South Africa eased its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country\u2019s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country\u2019s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said.

But the US death toll continues to creep up, now surpassing <strong>91,000</strong>.

The solicitor general filed a request earlier this month to halt a federal appeals court\u2019s order to turn over the material, which the court granted today. The justices set a June 1 deadline to file briefs to determine whether the case should undergo a full review. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, may be released from prison to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, per reports. Cohen would be one of many prisoners being released due to coronavirus concerns. Democrats criticized Trump for threatening to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada over their efforts to expand vote by mail. Nevada\u2019s Democratic governor said the threat was \u201cinappropriate and dangerous\u201d as states seek safe voting options in the middle of a global pandemic. Black Americans are dying of coronavirus at a rate three times higher than that of white Americans, according to a new report. More than 20,000 African Americans have already died from the virus. Trump suggested holding the next G7 summit in person, despite previously announcing that it would take place virtually. It would be very difficult to reschedule the meeting now, and it\u2019s very unclear world leaders would agree to travel to the US as the country\u2019s number of coronavirus cases continues to climb. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo dismissed claims that the state department inspector general was fired in retaliation for investigations he had launched. \u201cIt\u2019s patently false,\u201d Pompeo said of the accusations. The firing of Steve Linick has sparked concern that the Trump administration is trying to suppress government oversight. The majority of Americans are worried about reopening causing a spike in infections. According to a poll from the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Centre at the University of Chicago, about 54 % of respondents were \u201cvery or extremely worried\u201d about reopening causing more infections, and 29 % were \u201csomewhat worried\u201d about the risk. Overall, more than half the respondents said that the restrictions in their area were about right to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul reports: Apple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. The companies had announced the unprecedented collaboration to leverage their technology to help trace and contain the spread of coronavirus last month, and say 22 countries and several US states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. The software relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus. Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven\u2019t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people\u2019s location, which Apple and Google are omitting from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns. The Sanders campaign, seeking unity, has asked surrogates to refrain from attacking Biden, the Washington Post reports. From the Post: The Vermont senator\u2019s campaign has told some supporters picked to represent him this year to sign agreements barring attacks on other candidates or party leaders, combative confrontations on social media or talking to reporters without approval. The move, which carried a threat of being removed as a delegate, has the effect of blunting one of the most powerful if divisive tools of Sanders\u2019s movement \u2014 its unrestrained online presence and tendency to stoke controversy through other media, which has at times spiraled into abuse of his opponents, perceived and real. \u201cRefrain from making negative statements about other candidates, party leaders, Campaigns, Campaign staffers, supporters, news organizations or journalists. This Campaign is about the issues and finding solutions to America\u2019s problems,\u201d said the social media policy sent to some delegates. \u201cOur job is to differentiate the senator from his opponents on the issues \u2014 not through personal attacks.\u201d \u201cDo your best to avoid online arguments or confrontations,\u201d the policy said. \u201cIf engaging in an adversarial conversation, be respectful when addressing opposing viewpoints or commenting on the opposition.\u201d The agreements angered some Sanders delegates, and the campaign is now working with delegates to adjust its demands. The Senate is debating the next phase of coronavirus relief. Republicans have largely rejected the Democrats proposal for a rescue package, claiming that it costs too much. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the Democrats\u2019 bill dismissed as a \u201ctotally unserious effort.\u201d But even within the the GOP, there seems to be disagreement about how best to help states weather the pandemic. Joe Biden assailed Donald Trump in a pair of virtual events in Wisconsin, calling him \u201ca destroyer of everything he touches.\u201d \u201cAll he\u2019s ever done is hollow out what really matters and then slap a gold sign on a flimsy foundation,\u201d Biden said during the virtual rally in the battleground state. \u201cDonald Trump claimed he would fight for the forgotten man, the working class,\u201d the former vice president continued. \u201cBut as soon as he got into office, he forgot them.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Biden held a virtual roundtable with Wisconsin congressman Ron Kind and community advocates who spoke about the challenges facing rural Americans during the epidemic. During the back and forth, Biden, referring to federal funding to combat the economic fallout from the virus, said: \u201cNot one more penny should go to a Fortune 500 company. Period. Period. They don\u2019t need it.\u201d \u201cAmong the speakers at the \u201crally\u201d was Wisconsin senator Tammy Baldwin, who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee after she won re-election in 2018. Biden called her a \u201ctrue champion for Wisconsin, a true leader.\u201d Biden has been ramping up his virtual campaign schedule in recent weeks. Earlier events have been riddled with technical glitches - and the occasional honking duck. By contrast, Wednesday\u2019s events went smoothly. Prisoners and advocates told the Guardian that some infected inmates are in isolation without medical care or adequate food, cut off from family and attorneys More than 3,200 prisoners in California have contracted Covid-19 and at least 16 inmates have died, in a public health catastrophe that advocates say was both predictable and preventable. Inmates and advocates told the Guardian that at six prisons and jails with rapidly escalating outbreaks, basic protocols to prevent the virus from spreading are being ignored, and that they fear imminent mass fatalities and hospitalizations. Interviews with prisoners, their families and attorneys, along with internal records, reveal that: Some prisoners sick with coronavirus have complained that they aren\u2019t getting enough food and water while quarantined, and that they don\u2019t have access to doctors, temperature checks, basic medicine, phone calls, regular showers, outdoor time or sanitary supplies. Inmates have reported being reprimanded for wearing face coverings. At least one inmate was formally disciplined for trying to use bleach to help clean a prison. In one facility, prisoners assigned to make masks for others allegedly contracted Covid-19 in the process. Some prisoners with Covid-19 have been unable to talk to loved ones, who have been left uncertain if their relatives are still alive. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, will be released from federal prison, a person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. Due to coronavirus concerns, Cohen is expected to serve the remainder of his sentence from home. The Journal reports: He is among more than 2,500 federal inmates who have been placed on home confinement in recent weeks as prison officials try to identify those who are at high risk for the disease and low risk for re-offending. Trump said he would finish his preventative hydroxychloroquine regime \u201cin a day or two.\u201d Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he\u2019s been taking the anti-malaria drug as a preventative measure, despite a lack of evidence that it is effective when taken in this way. Although the FDA\u2019s emergency authorization for the drug allowed for it to be used as a treatment \u2014 rather than a prophylactic \u2014 for Covid-19, in hospital settings and clinical trials, researchers are studying whether hydroxychloroquine can be used to ward off disease. But that research is in its early stages, and some specialists worry that the president\u2019s politicizing of the drug by repeatedly touting it without evidence will interfere with legitimate science. \u201cThe virus is not Democrat or Republican, and hydroxychloroquine is not Democrat or Republican, and I\u2019m just hopeful that people would allow us to finish our scientific work,\u201d William O\u2019Neill, an interventional cardiologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, who is studying hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic in health care workers, told the New York Times. \u201cThe worst thing in the world that would happen,\u201d he added, \u201cis that at the end of this epidemic, in late September, we don\u2019t have a cure or a preventive because we let politics interfere with the scientific process.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: The Trump campaign is continuing to defend the president\u2019s on Michigan\u2019s mail-in balloting, even after the president deleted an earlier tweet incorrectly saying the state was mailing ballots to all registered voters. Trump later revised it to correctly say the state was mailing absentee ballot applications to all voters, which the campaign said was illegal. The effort to send absentee ballot applications could be met with a legal challenge, the Detroit Free Press reported on Tuesday. In 2008, the Michigan court of appeals ruled that a local clerk could not automatically send voters over 60 an absentee ballot application, a ruling that could be used to challenge the state\u2019s decision. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Supreme Court temporarily blocked House Democrats from accessing grand jury material from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The solicitor general filed a request earlier this month to halt a federal appeals court\u2019s order to turn over the material, which the court granted today. The justices set a June 1 deadline to file briefs to determine whether the case should undergo a full review.

The firing of Steve Linick has sparked concern that the Trump administration is trying to suppress government oversight. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump appeared to slightly back down from his threat to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada over their efforts to expand vote by mail. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump did not specify which federal funds he would withhold, adding that he did not think the move would ultimately be necessary. It\u2019s worth noting that legal experts have said it would almost certainly be unconstitutional for Trump to withhold funds over states\u2019 election practices. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany dodged questions this afternoon about which funds Trump was seeking to withhold and how the president thought Michigan officials had violated the law by moving to expand vote by mail. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to temporarily block House Democrats from accessing the grand jury material increases the likelihood that the information will not be made public before the November election. Solicitor General Noel Francisco has argued the House judiciary committee does not have an urgent need to review the material from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, considering Trump was acquitted in an impeachment trial earlier this year. \u201cThe House already has impeached the president, the Senate already has acquitted him, and neither [the committee] nor the House has provided any indication that a second impeachment is imminent,\u201d Francisco wrote. But a federal appeals court ruled that House members\u2019 need for the material was still relevant. \u201cThe committee has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the committee may recommend new articles of impeachment,\u201d Judge Judith Rogers wrote in the 2-1 decision. Solicitor general Noel Francisco filed a request with the Supreme Court earlier this month to temporarily block a federal appeals court\u2019s order, which would have allowed House Democrats access to the grand jury material. Francisco argued it would cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the federal government if House Democrats were allowed to review the grand jury material from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cOnce the government discloses the secret grand-jury records, their secrecy will irrevocably be lost,\u201d Francisco wrote. \u201cThat is particularly so when, as here, they are disclosed to a congressional committee and its staff.\u201d The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked House Democrats from accessing grand jury material gathered during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The high court issued a stay on members of the House judiciary committee accessing the material in order to allow a legal challenge to play out. The justices set a June 1 deadline to file briefs to determine whether the court should take up a full review of the case. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeatedly dodged questions about why the president claimed something illegal was going on in Michigan, as officials there move to expand vote by mail. \u201cIllegality and legality of it, that\u2019s a question for the campaign,\u201d McEnany said, referring all queries about the president\u2019s baseless claim to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. A New York Times reporter noted that McEnany presented senators with polling information yesterday, but she is now claiming a question about the president\u2019s comments accusing a state official of breaking the law are actually a campaign matter. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump would like the next G7 summit to happen in person, although it may be delayed beyond its current June date. \u201cThe President really wants to see the G7 happen here in Washington,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cHe\u2019d like to see it happen sometime in June, but as to a particular date I don\u2019t have an announcement on that front.\u201d Trump tweeted earlier today that he was interested in holding the summit in person. The White House announced in March that the June summit would be held virtually, similar to other recent G7 meetings, to limit concerns about world leaders contracting coronavirus, but the president now appears to be reversing that. Asked about whether G7 leaders would be willing to travel to the US, McEnany said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any information on the response from world leaders, but we certainly hope to see this happen.\u201d No surprise here: the first question to press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was about the president\u2019s threat to withhold funding from states that are working to expand vote by mail. Asked what funding Trump was looking to withhold, McEnany dodged the question, saying, \u201cI won\u2019t get into exactly what the funding considerations are.\u201d McEnany argued the president\u2019s tweet was \u201cmeant to alert\u201d senior administration officials, including treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was tagged in the tweets, about his concerns concerning funding to Michigan and Nevada. The press secretary said the president \u201cnoted concerns about a lot of fraud that is potentially at play\u201d when absentee voting is expanded, even though voter fraud is actually very rare. When McEnany was pressed on the fact that Trump himself has cast an absentee ballot before, she said, \u201cThe president is, after all, the president. ... He supports mail-in voting for a reason.\u201d A reporter noted a global pandemic would seem like a valid reason for absentee voting, but McEnany downplayed the likelihood of the pandemic continuing into November, even though public health experts have warned the country could see a second wave of infections later this year. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is now holding a briefing at the White House, where she will almost certainly be asked about the president\u2019s threat to withhold funding from states that are expanding vote by mail. McEnany began the briefing by boasting that Trump has brought back manufacturing jobs and shored up American supply chains to bolster production of personal protective equipment. But administration officials privately warned earlier this month that states are still facing a shortage of critical equipment like masks and gowns, according to Politico. The Lincoln Project has released another ad that is clearly meant to rile up the president, who has previously lashed out against the anti-Trump group. The latest ad from the group, which is led by former Republicans who are committed to defeating Trump in November, focuses on the president\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale. \u201cMeet Brad Parscale, from dead broke to the man Trump can\u2019t win without,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says, going on to details how Parscale has profited off his work for the campaign. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell Donald. He\u2019d wonder how Brad can afford so much.\u201d In a statement announcing the new ad, the Lincoln Project said, \u201cApparently, there\u2019s been as little oversight of Trump Pence 2020 as there\u2019s been of the U.S. Emergency Medical Supplies stockpile.\u201d The ad is clearly meant to drive a wedge between Parscale and the president, who has historically been very sensitive to accusations that his advisers are manipulating him or successfully concealing information from him. Trump reportedly threatened to sue Parscale late last month as the president saw his polling numbers slump. The president responded to a previous Lincoln Project ad by unleashing a string of attacks against its leaders, including George Conway, over Twitter, and this ad could spark a similar response. A Daily Beast reporter shared a campaign ad being circulated in South Carolina, which simultaneously lambastes vote by mail and explains how voters can remotely cast their ballots. Such contradictory ads may become more common as the general election approaches, considering a majority of Americans (and a signficant portion of Republicans) support expanding vote by mail, even as the president threatens to withhold states\u2019 funding over the issue. It should be noted that while Trump corrected his false claim about Michigan sending ballots to registered voters, his new tweet still falsely claims Michigan\u2019s efforts to expand vote by mail are illegal. Michigan\u2019s efforts are not illegal and are actually quite similar to steps taken by Republican officials in states like Georgia, West Virginia and Nebraska. In his new tweet, Trump also stood by his threat to withhold funding from Michigan, even though legal experts have said such a move would almost certainly be unconstitutional. Trump has now sent another tweet correcting his earlier tweet about Michigan\u2019s efforts to expand vote by mail. The president previously incorrectly said that Michigan\u2019s secretary of state was sending absentee ballots to every registered voter, but the state is actually sending absentee ballot applications to every registered voter. A number of Michigan lawmakers, including Democratic secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, pointed out Trump\u2019s error immediately, while noting that several Republican states are similarly expanding absentee voting options. The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that an end to US funding for the UN health agency would have a \u201cmajor implication for delivering essential health services to the most vulnerable people in the world.\u201d The WHO also warned earlier today against prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine, the antiviral medicine commonly used to treat malaria and lupus but currently, and very controversially, being taken by Donald Trump against his own federal regulators\u2019 guidelines. The WHO\u2019s Michael Ryan warned that hydroxychloroquine has potential side effects and the WHO advises it be reserved for use in clinical trials only, in relation to coronavirus. In a briefing today, reported by Reuters and The Associated Press, Ryan responded to questions from reporters about a letter sent by Trump, the US president, threatening an end to funding from the United States, its biggest donor, unless the agency reforms. Trump froze funding to the WHO earlier in the pandemic, claiming the agency was too deferential to China, where the outbreak started. The latest comments came on a day when a total of 106,000 Covid-19 cases were reported to WHO over a 24-hour period, the most in a single day since the outbreak began. The world is about to surpass five million confirmed cases, while the US accounts for 1.52 million of those and is approaching the grim milestone of 100,000 US deaths from the disease. Ryan said the US funding that reaches the WHO emergencies program was \u201con the order of $100 million a year\u201d and much of it goes to \u201chumanitarian health operations all over the world, in all sorts of fragile and difficult settings.\u201d Nevada governor Steve Sisolak criticized Trump for threatening to withhold funding from the state as it moves to expand vote by mail. Sisolak applauded Nevada as \u201ca national leader in election administration\u201d that was committed to providing safe options for voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cFor the President to threaten federal funding in the midst of a pandemic over a state exercising its authority to run elections in a safe and legal manner is inappropriate and outrageous,\u201d Sisolak said. Trump would likely be unable to freeze Nevada\u2019s funding anyway, but many of the president\u2019s critics expressed alarm about his attempt to financially retaliate against states for their election policies. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said the threat underscored why Democrats were concerned during the impeachment trial that Trump would attempt to rig the 2020 election. Trump discussed the next G7 summit with French President Emmanuel Macron, according to a readout from the White House about the two leaders\u2019 phone call today. \u201cPresident Trump and President Macron discussed progress on reopening the United States and France, as well as global economies,\u201d deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump expressed that the United States looks forward to convening the G7 soon.\u201d The statement provided no indication as to whether Macron pushed back against the idea of G7 leaders meeting in person, as Trump suggested this morning. Health experts would almost certainly be opposed to the idea of an in-person meeting that required international travel, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was noncommital about the suggestion earlier today. New figures compiled by the non-partisan APM Research Lab and released on Wednesday under the title Color of Coronavirus provide further evidence of the staggering divide in the Covid-19 death rate between black Americans and the rest of the nation. Across the country, African Americans have died at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people, compared with 20.7 for whites, 22.9 for Latinos and 22.7 for Asian Americans. More than 20,000 African Americans \u2013 about 1 in 2,000 of the entire black population in the US \u2013 have died from the disease. At the level of individual states, the statistics are all the more shocking. Bottom of the league table in terms of racial disparities is Kansas, where black residents are dying at seven times the rate of whites. \u201cThis is a call to action for our county commissioners, our state and our city officials,\u201d the Kansas state representative Gail Finney told local TV channel KWCH12 recently. Democratic senator Kamala Harris criticized her Republican colleagues on the Senate homeland security committee for pursuing an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s son in the middle of a pandemic that has claimed more than 90,000 American lives and upended the economy. \u201cThere are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee\u2019s attention, but instead this committee is doing the president\u2019s personal bidding,\u201d Harris said just before the vote. \u201cMembers of this committee, I urge you to vote against this political sideshow so that we can focus our attention on the pandemic that is threatening the lives and livelihood of the American people.\u201d The committee ultimately approved the subpoena of a Democratic public relations firm on a party line vote of 8 to 6. Harris, who suspended her own presidential campaign late last year, is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate to Biden. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump threatened to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada as the states move to expand vote by mail. Legal experts said the president would almost certainly not be able to carry out a funding freeze, but critics expressed alarm about Trump threatening financial retaliation over election practices, which fall under states\u2019 jurisdiction. Trump suggested holding the next G7 summit in person, despite previously announcing that it would take place virtually. It would be very difficult to reschedule the meeting now, and it\u2019s very unclear world leaders would agree to travel to the US as the country\u2019s number of coronavirus cases continues to climb. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo dismissed claims that the state department inspector general was fired in retalation for investigations he had launched. \u201cIt\u2019s patently false,\u201d Pompeo said of the accusations. The firing of Steve Linick has sparked concern that the Trump administration is trying to suppress government oversight. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House speaker Nancy Pelosi is officially allowing remote voting for 45 days, following last week\u2019s House vote approving vote by proxy during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cIn light of the attached notification by the Sergeant-at-Arms, in consultation with the Office of Attending Physician, that a public health emergency is in effect due to a novel coronavirus, I am hereby designating a \u2018covered period\u2019 pursuant to section 1(a) of House Resolution 965,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. House Democrats voted last week to temporarily allow vote by proxy, despite opposition from their Republican colleagues. The Senate homeland security committee has voted along party lines to authorize a subpoena in an investigation related to the business activities of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, which was a key topic during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. CNN reports: The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 8-6 to authorize the subpoena Chairman Ron Johnson requested for Blue Star Strategies, a US public affairs firm that worked with Burisma, the Ukrainian company which hired Biden. It\u2019s the first subpoena authorized in Johnson\u2019s investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden that ramped up following the end of the impeachment trial. The Wisconsin Republican has received documents from the State Department and National Archives and says he expects to release a report laying out the committee\u2019s findings in the coming months. Democrats have said the investigation is purely political and is meant to smear their party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee in the lead-up to the November election. A former Ukrainian prosecutor who investigated Burisma said in September that he had seen no evidence that Hunter Biden had violated any laws. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau was noncommittal when asked about Trump\u2019s suggestion to hold the next G7 summit in person. \u201cWe need to keep meeting as leaders,\u201d Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. \u201cWhether that\u2019s virtual or in person, we\u2019ll certainly take a look at what the US is proposing as hosts of the G7 to see what kind of measures will be in place to keep people safe, what kind of recommendations the experts are giving in terms of how that might function.\u201d But it\u2019s unlikely that health experts would endorse having several global leaders gather in a country where the number of coronavirus cases is still on the rise. The G7 summit was originally set to begin June 10 at Camp David, but the White House said in March that leaders would meet virtually to limit their risk of contracting coronavirus. The president then said in a tweet this morning that he was considering holding the summit \u201con the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David.\u201d \u201cIt would be a great sign to all - normalization!\u201d Trump said, even though the country\u2019s death toll is expected to surpass 100,000 in the coming days. Michigan\u2019s Democratic senators criticized Trump for threatening to withhold funding from the state as it seeks to expand vote by mail. Democratic senator Gary Peters, who is up for reelection this year, said Trump\u2019s threat was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s particularly remarkable given the fact that the president has voted by mail,\u201d Peters said. \u201cSo it\u2019s okay for him apparently, it\u2019s just not okay for everyday Americans.\u201d Michigan\u2019s other Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow, noted Trump likely does not have a legal option to withhold the state\u2019s funding. \u201cHe can\u2019t do that, number 1,\u201d Stabenow adds. She added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s afraid of people voting. The quickest way to have him lose the vote in Michigan is to try and stop people from exercising their right to vote.\u201d Trump narrowly carried Michigan in 2016 and will almost certainly need to win the state again in November to secure a second term. House speaker Nancy Pelosi compared Trump\u2019s tweeting to a child who tracks unwanted things into the family home. \u201c[Trump] comes in with doggie doo on his shoes and everyone who works with him has that on their shoes too,\u201d Pelosi said during her weekly press conference. Asked about calling Trump \u201cmorbidy obese\u201d earlier this week, Pelosi said, \u201cI gave him a dose of his own medicine.\u201d The speaker noted that the president\u2019s annual physical indicates he is obese, although he is not severely obese. (Many health experts choose not to use the term \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d) \u201cI was only quoting what doctors have said about him, so I was being factual in a very sympathetic way,\u201d Pelosi said. The speaker concluded her press conference by saying she would return to the podium tomorrow. \u201cWe have some other things to share with you,\u201d Pelosi mysteriously said. While secretary of state Mike Pompeo was talking this morning, Politico published the latest in a stream of reports about what state department inspector general Steve Linick had been investigating. This time it was a senior official under scrutiny for allegedly failing to report workplace bullying. Pompeo only took two questions on the Linick firing before ending the press conference. Normally, correspondents for foreign news organisations have to wait until the end to try to get their questions in. The wire agencies normally go first, then the major TV networks and major US print media, before others are called on. Today, with Pompeo under pressure, the order was reversed, with foreign correspondents called on first with questions about Taiwan and Israel-Palestinian issues. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said secretary of state Mike Pompeo should testify before Congress about the firing of state department inspector general Steve Linick. During her weekly press conference, Pelosi specifically criticized Pompeo for approving Saudi arms sales last year without congressional authorization, which Linick was investigating when he was dismissed. \u201cThey declared a fake emergency in order to initiate the sales,\u201d Pelosi said of Pompeo\u2019s decision, arguing it had \u201cundermined the will of Congress.\u201d The Democratic speaker argued the recent firings of several inspectors general demonstrated how Trump and senior administration officials were \u201cundermining truth.\u201d Secretary of state Mike Pompeo insisted state department inspector general Steve Linick\u2019s firing could not be retaliation because the secretary of state had no idea what Linick was investigating. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, there are claims that this was for retaliation for some investigation that the inspector general\u2019s office here was engaged in. It\u2019s patently false,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI had no sense of what investigations were taking place inside the inspector general\u2019s office. ... I didn\u2019t have access to that information, so I couldn\u2019t possibly have retaliated. It would have been impossible.\u201d But Pompeo acknowledged he was aware he was under investigation for approving Saudi arms sales without congressional authorization. Former officials have said it is very unlikely Pompeo was unaware he was under investigation on multiple fronts. The secretary of state ended the press conference with an attack on the ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations Committee, Bob Menendez, whose office Pompeo claimed was behind the leaks about Linick\u2019s investigations. \u201cI don\u2019t get my ethics guidance from a man who was criminally prosecuted ... in New Jersey federal district court,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not someone who I look to for ethics guidance.\u201d Menendez was acquitted of bribery charges in January 2018. The justice department dropped its case against the senator at the end of January 2018, but in April of that year, he was \u201cseverely admonished\u201d by the Senate ethics committee. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has been answering questions at a State Department press briefing about the firing of the state department inspector general, Steve Linick. Pompeo was defiant, admitting he had recommended Linick\u2019s be fired from his watchdog role \u201csome time ago\u201d. He would not explain the motives for the dismissal, claiming he did not talk about \u201cpersonnel matters\u201d, but called \u201cpatently false\u201d reports that it was retaliation for Linick\u2019s investigation of Pompeo\u2019s behaviour in office. Pompeo has been under intense scrutiny since Linick\u2019s abrupt firing on Friday night, on the secretary of state\u2019s recommendation. Since then, it has emerged that Linick, in his capacity of government watchdog, was investigating Pompeo for his role in circumventing Congress in approving arms sales to the Gulf last summer and his alleged use of a political appointee to run errands for him and his wife, including walking the dog and picking up dry cleaning. In the latest episode, NBC News has revealed that he has been using the state department to host dinners for billionaire businessmen, conservative politicians and media figures, the occasional celebrity and a relatively small number of diplomats - just 14% of the total number of guests, according to the NBC report. The state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told NBC the dinners are \u201ca world-class opportunity to discuss the mission of the state department and the complex foreign policy matters facing our exceptional nation.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s critics say the \u201cMadison dinners\u201d (as they are called, after former secretary of state and president, James Madison) suggest the guest list looked much more like a coterie of potential campaign backers, than a diplomatic salon. There have been about two dozen Madison dinners, and the guests included the chairman of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, who is a significant donor to campaigns against same-sex marriage, and the head of the American Gaming Association, Bill Miller. Trump has suggested the June G7 summit should take place in person at Camp David, despite previously announcing that it would be a virtual meeting. \u201cNow that our Country is \u2018Transitioning back to Greatness\u2019, I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all - normalization!\u201d The White House announced in March that the June summit between the world leaders would take place via video-teleconference, as other recent meetings have been conducted. Trump is clearly eager to look ahead to the next stage of reopening the country, but the number of US coronavirus cases and deaths continues to climb. The country\u2019s death toll is expected to hit 100,000 in the coming days. With that in mind, it\u2019s hard to imagine that world leaders will feel comfortable traveling to the US as it continues to grapple with the crisis. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn reports on Trump\u2019s description of the number of US coronavirus cases as \u201ca badge of honor\u201d: The president argued yesterday that the number of US cases of coronavirus, which is still climbing, simply means the country is testing more people. \u201cIf we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right,\u201d Trump rhetorically asked reporters. The backlash was swift. Most of the criticism came from former members of Trump\u2019s own party. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee tweeted he had \u201cno head left to shake\u201d. Former primary challenger Joe Walsh insisted that even if the US had the fewest number of cases, \u201cTrump would say the exact same thing.\u201d Others noted the true \u201cbadge of honor\u201d should come from a different data set altogether, as the president has been largely criticized for the US\u2019s slow response to the outbreak, initially resulting in one of the worst testing rates per capita. Democrats appeared to largely ignore the gaffe, but supporters and prominent liberal voices called out the president\u2019s remarks for their insensitivity. The US currently accounts for more than 30% of global coronavirus infections,despite being less than 5 percent the world\u2019s population. A number of commentators noted that several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, Georgia and Nebraska, have also pushed to expand vote by mail, yet Trump has not threatened to withhold funding from them. A former senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign suggested the president would be much better served by developing effective strategies for vote by mail, which is supported by most Americans. A Gallup poll released last week showed 64% of Americans, including 40% of Republicans, support allowing all voters to vote by mail or absentee ballot. The issue will likely become increasingly important as the November general election approaches, considering many public health experts are expecting a second wave of coronavirus cases later this year. Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a member of the progressive group known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d mocked Trump for incorrectly saying her state was sending absentee ballots to all registered voters. Tlaib applauded her state for promoting democracy \u201cwithout jeopardizing people\u2019s health\u201d and accused Trump of \u201cendangering people\u2019s lives\u201d through his handling of the coronavirus crisis. The president is visiting a Ford Motors plant in Michigan tomorrow, and he will almost certainly be asked about his (likely unconstitutional) threat to withhold funding funding from Michigan over the state\u2019s vote by mail policy. A number of legal experts pointed out in reaction to Trump\u2019s tweets about Michigan and Nevada that withholding federal funding from states over opposition to a specific policy would almost certainly be unconstitutional. From a former federal prosecutor: From a University of Texas law professor: From a University of Alabama law professor: Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson corrected Trump\u2019s tweet about her state\u2019s vote by mail policies, noting her office only sent ballot applications (not actual ballots) to registered voters. Benson said yesterday that the move would ensure that \u201cno Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote.\u201d \u201cWe know from the elections that took place this month that during the pandemic Michiganders want to safely vote,\u201d Benson said. It will be interesting to see how Nevada\u2019s secretary of state reacts to Trump\u2019s threat, considering she is a Republican. Good morning, this is Joan Greve taking over the blog. Trump is tweeting away this morning, and a couple tweets in particular are catching the attention of Democrats and legal experts. The president threatened to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada, which have moved to expand vote by mail amid concerns that coronavirus could spread at in-person polling places. Voter fraud is actually very rare, and it\u2019s quite unclear what legal mechanism could use to withhold funding from the states, both of which have Democratic governors. Michigan is key to Trump\u2019s reelection bid, considering he narrowly carried the state in 2016, and the president has repeatedly lashed out against Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer over her stay-at-home order. Good morning, US live blog readers, get set for another action-packed day of politics and coronavirus news in America, with all the up-to-the-minute developments. Here\u2019s what\u2019s moving so far today: Outrage is swelling over Donald Trump\u2019s comment yesterday that the US\u2019s 1.52m confirmed cases of coronavirus is good news because it\u2019s a mark of how much testing the US is doing and is, in fact, a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d. Harvard Law\u2019s Larry Tribe didn\u2019t hold back, likening it to \u201ccalling a trail of corpses a badge of honor for the police department that let the serial murderer run free for months.\u201d This as all 50 US states are now in some sort of phased reopening. Connecticut was the last to make a start. Governors are under daily pressure from the president to get business up and running, despite the fact that many states aren\u2019t up to federal guidelines from Trump\u2019s own administration recommending sustained declines in cases and other factors as a prerequisite for opening up. But the US death toll continues to creep up, now surpassing 91,000. Some of rural New York is opening, but not yet the nation\u2019s hotspot New York City, as cases there continue to come down but the authorities warn against complacency. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has a busy day ahead. He has two virtual events in Wisconsin, a state that\u2019s in the news daily in relation to voting and coronavirus issues mixed with fraught politics in the battleground state. Last night, in a virtual town hall Biden summed up many views on the news that Donald Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus despite his own regulators warning of serious risks. \u201cC\u2019mon, man. What\u2019s he doing? What in God\u2019s name is he doing?\u201d Biden said. Michigan is enduring a double-whammy. While dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, two dams have burst after days of record rain. The rushing waters have flooded central parts of the states in up to nine feet of water, leading to 10,000 people needed to be evacuated while also trying not to spread the virus. Governor Gretchen Whitmer already had her plate full, with right-wing-backed protests and death threats over quarantine and now entire dwellings being swept away in a crisis she described as \u201calmost unthinkable\u201d.",
