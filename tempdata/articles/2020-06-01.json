      "bodyText": "A court has dismissed an appeal from several Australian media companies over a 2019 judgment that held them liable for defamatory comments posted by users on their Facebook page in response to news articles. Indigenous Northern Territory youth detainee Dylan Voller, whose mistreatment in the Don Dale youth detention centre led to a 2016 royal commission, had sued the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian, the Centralian Advocate, Sky News Australia and The Bolt Report over 10 comments on their Facebook pages in response to news articles about him between 2016 and 2017. In June last year, the NSW supreme court found that the companies could be considered publishers of the third-party comments, even though companies are unable to screen comments posted on Facebook before they go public. The decision has wide-ranging ramifications for media companies in Australia, which are now held responsible for content posted by users on their Facebook pages. The court of appeal upheld the decision on Monday, finding that the companies did have sufficient control over comments to be considered publishers. \u201cThey facilitated the posting of comments on articles published in their newspapers and had sufficient control over the platform to be able to delete postings when they became aware that they were defamatory,\u201d judge John Basten said. Facebook does not allow for pre-moderation of comments on pages and comments cannot be turned off, however NSW supreme court justice Stephen Rothman had argued that the media companies could have used a word filter using extremely common words to pre-filter the majority of comments to only be visible to the page owner and that user and their friends. The case led to the federal government announcing plans late last year to make platforms such as Twitter and Facebook liable for the content posted by third parties, as part of a wide range of planned defamation law reform. The first tranche of legislation was due to be introduced this month, but the government has not yet announced any plans since the coronavirus pandemic hit. In a joint statement, News Corp, Nine and Sky said the court had shown Australian defamation law was \u201ccompletely out of step with the realities of publishing in the digital age\u201d. \u201cThe decision fails to acknowledge that it is Facebook that controls its platform, including that Facebook gives media companies no ability to turn off comments on their pages. It is Facebook that must be held responsible for content posted by its users, not media companies. \u201cToday\u2019s decision means the media cannot share any story via Facebook without fear of being sued for comments which they did not publish and have no control over. \u201cIt also creates the extraordinary situation where every public Facebook page \u2013 whether it be held by politicians, businesses or courts \u2013 is now liable for third party comments on those pages.\u201d The companies said they were considering seeking special leave to appeal to the high court of Australia. \u201cWe also reiterate our calls for urgent law reform in this area.\u201d The court has yet to rule whether the comments on the page are defamatory, or on any compensation for Voller that would arise from any such judgment. Three other media companies \u2013 Seven West Media, Bauer and Daily Mail \u2013 were so concerned at the original decision that they sought to intervene in the appeal, arguing that the media companies should be treated like internet content hosts under federal broadcasting legislation. But this attempt was dismissed by the three judges, noting it was not raised during the original hearing. \u201cThe interveners raised issues that went to the heart of the liability of media companies operating Facebook pages in a similar way to the defendants, in circumstances where the defendants did not raise, and did not propose to address, that issue,\u201d Basten said. \u201cIt was appropriate to identify this issue, even thought it could not affect the outcome of the appeal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The front pages of US newspapers over the past few days tell of the double tragedy of a nation rocked by protests over the death of George Floyd and the growing coronavirus toll. The New York Times front page on Monday says \u201cTwin crises and surging anger convulse US\u201d. Alongside pictures from the protests, two headlines proclaim: \u201cPandemic leaves nation\u2019s nerves on edge\u201d; and, \u201cVideos from protests deepen scrutiny of aggressive police tactics\u201d. An op-ed piece asks what Trump and \u201ctoxic cops\u201d have in common? It reads: \u201cWhen historians look back at the Trump era, they may very well say his presidency was encapsulated by this moment, when a sadistic cop knelt on the neck of an African-American man for almost nine minutes in plain view and the streets exploded in rage.\u201d Monday\u2019s Washington Post headline summed up the tension in the nation: \u201cUS at a precipice as demonstrations intensify\u201d. An editorial was headlined: \u201cAs cities burn, Trump\u2019s bullhorn drowns out the voices of our better angels\u201d. It says Trump, who it calls the \u201cdivider in chief\u201d is playing his \u201ccustomary role as human flamethrower: exactly the wrong leader for the times\u201d. The Boston Globe\u2019s Sunday front page also reported the twin crises: \u201cThe virus\u2019s tale\u201d and \u201cLeaders urge calm, brace for unrest\u201d. The San Francisco Chronicle on Sunday carried a powerful image of the protests with the headline: \u201cRiots, shooting rock Oakland\u201d. Also on its front page it reports the \u201cdramatic breakdown of (coronavirus) infections among races\u201d. Minorities in America have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Its editorial laments \u201cTrump\u2019s failure of leadership for a nation in crisis\u201d. \u201cA nation reeling from the worst pandemic in a century and the worst unemployment since the Great Depression of the 1930s now faces the inflammation of an affliction that has betrayed the American ideal of equal justice for all from its founding: the frustration and pain of systemic racism,\u201d the editorial says. The Chicago Tribune\u2019s Sunday headline is \u201cProtests give rise to chaos\u201d under a graphic image of a burning car. The paper said downtown Chicago was locked down as unrest spread to the south and west of the city and to some suburbs. Its editorial called for \u201cZero tolerance for rioting in the fight for police reform\u201d. It said the outrage over George Floyd\u2019s killing was justified and \u201cnationwide demands to end police abuse are legitimate\u201d. But, it said: \u201cThe rioting and vandalism that overshadowed peaceful protests the past several days represent something vile and shameful.\u201d The Los Angeles Times carried vivid images of the destruction in the city, with the headline \u201cFeels like the fires last time\u201d, remembering unrest in LA in 1992 after acquittals in the Rodney King case. Minnesota\u2019s Star Tribune carried the headline: \u201cThe guard moves in\u201d. Its Sunday editorial, in the state where Floyd lost his life, was headlined: \u201cA week that will live in ignominy\u201d In Florida, the Tampa Bay Times carried a striking image of a young boy in a mask, and the headline: \u201cTampa orders curfew as clashes continue\u201d.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>\u2018I want to introduce the new Love Islanders more than anything\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Iain Stirling, voice of Love Island</em><em>, standup comedian</em></p> <p>I remember everything in terms of football. It was the day Liverpool played Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid and, as I watched, I felt a bit fluey, meaning I had the symptoms of coronavirus. I had a gig in London the next day and with about five hours to go we cancelled, along with the shows in Brighton and Cardiff. At that point, I thought: \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll feel better and then we can carry on.\u201d But then Boris Johnson announced lockdown, and I had to postpone the entire spring leg of my tour, plus the recording of my Amazon Prime special.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0da803f682292d3c0131e567db530109559e05f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da803f682292d3c0131e567db530109559e05f8/749_120_1426_1781/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A blow\u2019 \u2026 Iain Stirling and Laura Whitmore.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A blow\u2019 \u2026 Iain Stirling and Laura Whitmore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images for Hard Rock Hotel London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luckily, because most of my material isn\u2019t topical, I haven\u2019t had to rip it all up. I tried a few coronavirus jokes back in February, but as soon as I mentioned it the audience went a bit weird. It\u2019s difficult to joke about something when you\u2019re all in the same room, breathing the same air. I don\u2019t know whether people will want to laugh about coronavirus when this is over, or pretend it never happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/love-island-cancelled-mallorca-cornwall-coronavirus-safety\">Love Island</a><em> </em>this year is a blow. You think because it\u2019s such a big show, they\u2019ll find a way to make it happen. But postponing it is the right thing to do. I\u2019ve spent so many summers in Spain now that it\u2019s going to be weird not to be out there. For the first few weeks of lockdown, my partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/20/laura-whitmore-replaces-caroline-flack-love-island-host\">Laura</a> [Whitmore, who presents] said she felt like she was in the audience of a gig every time we had dinner. I had to do something with that energy \u2013 it was either that or run down the street screaming at couples \u2013 so I\u2019ve started doing <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/iainstirling\">live streams on Twitch</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>I can\u2019t wait to get back on Love Island. Watching all the contestants being introduced is my favourite bit. Do they have funny surnames? Is there a turn of phrase or mannerism I can pick up on? I want to meet the new islanders more than anything. I need more islanders in my life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0706eaf074dc76fbb87f77003291296de786755a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0706eaf074dc76fbb87f77003291296de786755a/0_184_5097_3058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s gone\u2019 \u2026 The Watsons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s gone\u2019 \u2026 The Watsons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Will there still be theatre audiences after coronavirus?\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Laura Wade, dramatist</em></p> <p>We were just gearing up for the debut of The Watsons in London\u2019s West End when everything shut down. All the cast had been engaged, and we were about to choose understudies. Knowing that these 17 people were expecting to be in work this summer and now aren\u2019t has been the hardest bit. You feel a responsibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a4f801d3558a1e1156f71f0f2af1d72a35f939a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4f801d3558a1e1156f71f0f2af1d72a35f939a7/0_120_3360_4200/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We won\u2019t give up\u2019 \u2026 Laura Wade.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We won\u2019t give up\u2019 \u2026 Laura Wade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/08/the-watsons-review-minerva-chichester-jane-austen-laura-wade\">The Watsons</a>, my adaptation of the unfinished novel by Jane Austen, had such a long gestation. I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s gone. Maybe I\u2019m in denial, but I do believe it will come back. I\u2019m not sure where or how though. Too much is in the air. I know the show\u2019s producers will do everything they can to get it back up and running.&nbsp;</p> <p>The best thing about being a playwright is having a play on. We write to communicate, to share our stories. Getting into rehearsals, getting a play on stage, that\u2019s what I live for. So it feels extremely sad right now. But everyone in the industry is in the same boat. It\u2019s not like only my show got cancelled because, say, the finance fell through. You have to be humble about your own disappointment, and see the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p> <p>I wonder what theatre will be like after coronavirus. Will there still be audiences? What will they want to see? What will be able to afford to give them? I know we are an industry of resourceful and imaginative people. We won\u2019t give up without a big fight. The aliveness of theatre is such a special, specific thing. I can\u2019t see it going away.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea71798597847a529e95babbb4726e6bdd8beeb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea71798597847a529e95babbb4726e6bdd8beeb9/379_915_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inferno from the Dante Project performed in Los Angeles last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inferno from the Dante Project performed in Los Angeles last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Mann/The Music Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I was involved in 80 shows around the world.

Now, thanks to coronavirus, around 80 shows I was involved in around the world have been cancelled.&nbsp; I\u2019d been working on The Dante Project, a three-part epic that was due to premiere at the Royal Opera House in London this month. It took three years to bring together. The score was done, the designs were finished, and we were just about to go into rehearsals with the Royal Ballet when everything shut down.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6c5b02542ec5ec156c51dff19c6b5386866dc08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c5b02542ec5ec156c51dff19c6b5386866dc08/2231_165_2472_3090/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is a key moment for the Government\u2019 \u2026 Wayne McGregor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is a key moment for the Government\u2019 \u2026 Wayne McGregor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South China Morning Post via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The actual cancellation was quite quick and brutal. I found out in March just after my 50th birthday. The Royal Ballet had planned a celebration for me, to go alongside the Dante premiere, which would have been lovely. I\u2019m generally an optimist, though. I\u2019m pretty good at dealing with what life throws at me. The most difficult thing for me has been my company. I have a company of 50 people and they\u2019re my biggest concern. Trying to work out how it can have a life in the future has taken a huge amount of energy.&nbsp;</p> <p>The creative arts will always be vibrant, but this is a key moment for the government to realise their crucial value to everyday life, and support the industry. The experience of watching a play, a ballet, a live performance, when you\u2019re all in the same space, breathing the same air together \u2013 that\u2019s such a special thing.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f47fb2254f876390154f0ae8475a4cb7f9e67ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f47fb2254f876390154f0ae8475a4cb7f9e67ee/1126_1639_1915_1149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My mood changes hourly\u2019 \u2026 Catherine Cohen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My mood changes hourly\u2019 \u2026 Catherine Cohen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack DeZon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I flew to London and there were six people on the plane\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Catherine Cohen, comedian and actor</em></p> <p>In early March, I did this fun show in Washington DC with a bunch of female comedians. After the show, I asked them: \u201cI\u2019m meant to go to London in two days. Do you think that\u2019s a bad idea?\u201d And they were like: \u201cNo, it will be fine. You should go!\u201d</p> <p>So I flew to London and there were six people on my flight. There was this weird<em> </em>energy in the air, but my show was sold out and went amazingly. Afterwards, I was hugging a bunch of people and having drinks at the bar. I got back to my hotel room at 3am and finally had a chance to check my phone. There was a message from my mum saying: \u201cYou need to come home right now!\u201d I cancelled the rest of my London shows and flew back.</p> <p>I\u2019m dying to get back to performing. I host a weekly show at Club Cumming in New York\u2019s East Village and I miss it so much. I\u2019ve started hosting it every Wednesday on my Instagram Live, which is useful, because having a show to prepare for helps me remember what day of the week it is. But it\u2019s no replacement for the energy of performing in front of a live crowd.</p> <p>My mood changes on the hour. Some days I wake up with a knot in my stomach, feeling hopeless, thinking that everything I\u2019ve ever worked for in my career has disappeared. And then other days I think: \u201cWhat a wonderful opportunity to pause, reflect \u2013 and reinvent my artistic process!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21c738dbabd8df23a51fd84a5691c979819a29c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21c738dbabd8df23a51fd84a5691c979819a29c8/0_42_4941_2965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14\u2019 \u2026 Jack Bevan, on right, with Foals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14\u2019 \u2026 Jack Bevan, on right, with Foals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018They were doing temperature checks at Manila airport\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Jack Bevan, drummer, Foals</em></p> <p>We were at Heathrow airport, on our way to tour Asia, just as everything started to shut down. When we arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, everyone at the airport was having their temperature checked. Then our Manila gig got cancelled the day before we were meant to play. We flew back to the UK and were in lockdown about a week later.&nbsp;</p> <p>I feel sorry for emerging bands who would have been promoting debut records this summer. They\u2019ll be hit the hardest. If coronavirus had happened to us the year our first album came out, or even our second, it would have crippled us. We might have been dropped by our label. But because we\u2019re more established, we\u2019ve been able to take a year off touring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this had happened the year our first album came out, it would have crippled us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, it hurts. Festivals account for approximately 80% of our income. The impact on artists is huge, but it\u2019s also devastating for people who aren\u2019t talked about so much \u2013 the road crew and the venue staff, who may not fall into the furloughing scheme. We\u2019ve been selling fans Foals T-shirts to support the crew.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I want to introduce the new Love Islanders more than anything\u2019 Iain Stirling, voice of Love Island, standup comedian I remember everything in terms of football. It was the day Liverpool played Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid and, as I watched, I felt a bit fluey, meaning I had the symptoms of coronavirus. I had a gig in London the next day and with about five hours to go we cancelled, along with the shows in Brighton and Cardiff. At that point, I thought: \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll feel better and then we can carry on.\u201d But then Boris Johnson announced lockdown, and I had to postpone the entire spring leg of my tour, plus the recording of my Amazon Prime special. Luckily, because most of my material isn\u2019t topical, I haven\u2019t had to rip it all up. I tried a few coronavirus jokes back in February, but as soon as I mentioned it the audience went a bit weird. It\u2019s difficult to joke about something when you\u2019re all in the same room, breathing the same air. I don\u2019t know whether people will want to laugh about coronavirus when this is over, or pretend it never happened. Not doing Love Island this year is a blow. You think because it\u2019s such a big show, they\u2019ll find a way to make it happen. But postponing it is the right thing to do. I\u2019ve spent so many summers in Spain now that it\u2019s going to be weird not to be out there. For the first few weeks of lockdown, my partner Laura [Whitmore, who presents] said she felt like she was in the audience of a gig every time we had dinner. I had to do something with that energy \u2013 it was either that or run down the street screaming at couples \u2013 so I\u2019ve started doing live streams on Twitch. I can\u2019t wait to get back on Love Island. Watching all the contestants being introduced is my favourite bit. Do they have funny surnames? Is there a turn of phrase or mannerism I can pick up on? I want to meet the new islanders more than anything. I need more islanders in my life. \u2018Will there still be theatre audiences after coronavirus?\u2019 Laura Wade, dramatist We were just gearing up for the debut of The Watsons in London\u2019s West End when everything shut down. All the cast had been engaged, and we were about to choose understudies. Knowing that these 17 people were expecting to be in work this summer and now aren\u2019t has been the hardest bit. You feel a responsibility. The Watsons, my adaptation of the unfinished novel by Jane Austen, had such a long gestation. I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s gone. Maybe I\u2019m in denial, but I do believe it will come back. I\u2019m not sure where or how though. Too much is in the air. I know the show\u2019s producers will do everything they can to get it back up and running. The best thing about being a playwright is having a play on. We write to communicate, to share our stories. Getting into rehearsals, getting a play on stage, that\u2019s what I live for. So it feels extremely sad right now. But everyone in the industry is in the same boat. It\u2019s not like only my show got cancelled because, say, the finance fell through. You have to be humble about your own disappointment, and see the bigger picture. I wonder what theatre will be like after coronavirus. Will there still be audiences? What will they want to see? What will be able to afford to give them? I know we are an industry of resourceful and imaginative people. We won\u2019t give up without a big fight. The aliveness of theatre is such a special, specific thing. I can\u2019t see it going away. \u2018I was involved in 80 shows around the world. All were cancelled\u2019 Wayne McGregor, choreographer I\u2019ve never had anything cancelled before in my career. Now, thanks to coronavirus, around 80 shows I was involved in around the world have been cancelled. I\u2019d been working on The Dante Project, a three-part epic that was due to premiere at the Royal Opera House in London this month. It took three years to bring together. The score was done, the designs were finished, and we were just about to go into rehearsals with the Royal Ballet when everything shut down. The actual cancellation was quite quick and brutal. I found out in March just after my 50th birthday. The Royal Ballet had planned a celebration for me, to go alongside the Dante premiere, which would have been lovely. I\u2019m generally an optimist, though. I\u2019m pretty good at dealing with what life throws at me. The most difficult thing for me has been my company. I have a company of 50 people and they\u2019re my biggest concern. Trying to work out how it can have a life in the future has taken a huge amount of energy. The creative arts will always be vibrant, but this is a key moment for the government to realise their crucial value to everyday life, and support the industry. The experience of watching a play, a ballet, a live performance, when you\u2019re all in the same space, breathing the same air together \u2013 that\u2019s such a special thing. \u2018I flew to London and there were six people on the plane\u2019 Catherine Cohen, comedian and actor In early March, I did this fun show in Washington DC with a bunch of female comedians. After the show, I asked them: \u201cI\u2019m meant to go to London in two days. Do you think that\u2019s a bad idea?\u201d And they were like: \u201cNo, it will be fine. You should go!\u201d So I flew to London and there were six people on my flight. There was this weird energy in the air, but my show was sold out and went amazingly. Afterwards, I was hugging a bunch of people and having drinks at the bar. I got back to my hotel room at 3am and finally had a chance to check my phone. There was a message from my mum saying: \u201cYou need to come home right now!\u201d I cancelled the rest of my London shows and flew back. I\u2019m dying to get back to performing. I host a weekly show at Club Cumming in New York\u2019s East Village and I miss it so much. I\u2019ve started hosting it every Wednesday on my Instagram Live, which is useful, because having a show to prepare for helps me remember what day of the week it is. But it\u2019s no replacement for the energy of performing in front of a live crowd. My mood changes on the hour. Some days I wake up with a knot in my stomach, feeling hopeless, thinking that everything I\u2019ve ever worked for in my career has disappeared. And then other days I think: \u201cWhat a wonderful opportunity to pause, reflect \u2013 and reinvent my artistic process!\u201d \u2018They were doing temperature checks at Manila airport\u2019 Jack Bevan, drummer, Foals We were at Heathrow airport, on our way to tour Asia, just as everything started to shut down. When we arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, everyone at the airport was having their temperature checked. Then our Manila gig got cancelled the day before we were meant to play. We flew back to the UK and were in lockdown about a week later. I feel sorry for emerging bands who would have been promoting debut records this summer. They\u2019ll be hit the hardest. If coronavirus had happened to us the year our first album came out, or even our second, it would have crippled us. We might have been dropped by our label. But because we\u2019re more established, we\u2019ve been able to take a year off touring. Still, it hurts. Festivals account for approximately 80% of our income. The impact on artists is huge, but it\u2019s also devastating for people who aren\u2019t talked about so much \u2013 the road crew and the venue staff, who may not fall into the furloughing scheme. We\u2019ve been selling fans Foals T-shirts to support the crew. We\u2019ve actually sold 3,000, which helped tide them over for a few months. We haven\u2019t been able to get in a room to play because of the lockdown rules \u2013 and I\u2019m itching to do it. This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14. Our initial plan was to spend 2020 touring, then and go back into the studio next year. But I think we\u2019ll probably start writing later this year instead, and get back to touring next year \u2014 if we\u2019re allowed. \u2018My crew and I almost didn\u2019t make it back home\u2019 Chelsea Wolfe, singer-songwriter It was wild watching everything happen. I went from being on a tour bus on my way to Berlin to buying flights, driving straight to the airport, and getting on a chaotic plane home to the US. My crew and I almost didn\u2019t make it back. After Trump announced a ban on all arrivals from Europe, the airlines started price-gouging. Flights were jumping from a few hundred dollars to thousands right in front of our eyes. There was definitely a period of mourning when I got home. I poured so much into Birth of Violence, my last album, and I was so looking forward to getting it out to people on tour. I thought I might still be able to do my later tour dates, but then the entire European leg was cancelled, followed by Australia and New Zealand. I live in northern California, near the mountains. Now I wake up in the morning, do a Zoom yoga class, and start making music in my home studio. Once I got over the shock of being at home, it was nice to be creative again. I work on songs with my bandmates, going back and forth via email. The financial stuff is scary. Cancelling the tour was huge. I\u2019d already invested so much money into booking the tour bus, renting the gear, paying for my crew, the flights, a week of their time for rehearsals, the stage dressings. None of that stuff is refundable. I\u2019ve been able to sell some tour merch, which helps. It\u2019s been cool to see fans wanting to support artists. Lots have left comments online saying: \u201cI was meant to see you play live, but I bought a T-shirt instead.\u201d",

I was really shocked. I thought: \u2018You will not get Britain to lock down.\u2019 This is a country that doesn\u2019t like authority and the nanny state and being told what to do, but the level of compliance has been astonishing.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the crisis, he says, the key issues raised by viewers and listeners have been very personal. \u201cIt\u2019s been about family, about not seeing your mum. Whenever the government announces anything, that\u2019s the question: \u2018When can I see my mum?\u2019 It does come back to that.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>Like some of his audience, he believes it is too early to condemn the government for its handling of the crisis, even though he admits it is clear mistakes have been made. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t quite got the full picture of what\u2019s gone wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cTo take one example \u2013 care homes. We\u2019ve had so many anecdotal stories of care homes being told \u2018You\u2019re taking this patient\u2019 and the patient turns out to have Covid. Then the minister comes on and says the number of people transitioning from hospitals to care homes since the middle of March has been at a yearly low. We need to find out the truth about that. We\u2019re still looking at an unfolding crisis with people trying not to get a lethal illness, and we can\u2019t at the moment operate politics as normal, which is to say: \u2018This is your fault. You should resign.\u2019 We\u2019re not quite there yet. I suspect Matt Hancock isn\u2019t that long for this world, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>Vine takes a liberal view that all opinions should be heard on his programmes and dislikes the idea of no-platforming people. But isn\u2019t there a danger that he becomes a pawn in the growing culture war in the UK, especially on his feisty Channel 5 show? The morning we spoke, the show had pitted the leftwing activist Ash Sarkar against the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine as the commentators on the day\u2019s news stories. A rather obviously polarised confrontation, I suggest. \u201cI\u2019m going to resist the word \u2018clickbait\u2019, because obviously we want people to watch the show,\u201d he says.&nbsp;\u201cBut the real answer to your question is that you engage people through argument. I LOVE argument. You can have somebody on who is very knowledgeable, but if they have no passion you don\u2019t listen.\u201d</p> <p>Vine (Jeremy, not Sarah) has said in the past that presenters must never ride their own hobbyhorses, but that \u201cyour values should come across\u201d. How do you draw the line? \u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge thing about impartiality at the BBC and it led me to think about how it affects me,\u201d he says (we spoke before Emily Maitlis was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">castigated by the BBC</a> for breaching guidelines on impartiality on Newsnight). \u201cI was very much in news, I was a reporter, I presented Newsnight, and then when I moved to Radio 2 \u2013 that\u2019s a hybrid show, somewhere between news and entertainment, you can never really pin it down. It\u2019s all very well saying we\u2019re impartial, but it\u2019s a show that\u2019s very passionate and the presenter can\u2019t just read the bulletin. The conclusion I came to was that you can have values but you can\u2019t have views, and that\u2019s fundamentally how I operate.\u201d<br><br>Vine understudied Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight in the late 90s. \u201cBut I remember thinking I was in a very awkward position because, as the person who was then the other Jeremy, do I try to give you a motorhead version of Paxman, which is bloody difficult, or do I try and soften it, which was really off. Newsnight in those days was like a squash game.&nbsp;You were both going to play until one of you had a heart attack. I\u2019ve been through all that and, having done a lot of interviews \u2013 I\u2019ve spoken to 25,000 listeners on Radio 2, let alone actual interviewees \u2013 I do think asking a question and listening to the answer might be old-fashioned, but it is quite a good technique.\u201d</p> <p>He now realises his attempt to succeed Paxman was always doomed. But rescue was at hand in the shape of an offer in 2003 to replace Jimmy Young, who at the age of 81 had just been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jan/06/broadcasting.bbc\">defenestrated by BBC management</a>, on Radio 2. Young was furious at being ousted and rebuffed Vine\u2019s suggestion of a handover lunch \u2013 the two never did meet. </p> <p>Succeeding Young changed the direction of Vine\u2019s career, pushing him towards light entertainment and making possible shows such as Points of View and Eggheads. The award-winning BBC Africa correspondent of the 90s was on his way to becoming a \u201cpersonality\u201d, and the transformation was completed in 2015 when he was contestant on Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 judge Craig Revel Horwood likened his jive to \u201ca stork that had been struck by lightning\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88802409cb5be99072e438118b410bcf9f7e3114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88802409cb5be99072e438118b410bcf9f7e3114/0_63_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A stork struck by lightning\u2019 ...

Vine on Strictly with dance partner Karen Clifton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On behalf of Eggheads fans, I ask him what is happening to the programme, which he has hosted since 2008 but has been missing from the schedules of late. A series shot more than a year ago has <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/24/tv-boss-confirms-eggheads-jeremy-vine-will-back-next-week-12450084/\">now resumed</a> on BBC Two, but there is no sign of any new ones being made. \u201cMy understanding is that it\u2019s sleeping,\u201d he says. \u201cI did more than 1,000 episodes and it\u2019s one of the most successful TV shows in the history of British television, but I think what\u2019s happened is it\u2019s fallen victim to the BBC\u2019s understandable desire to pull in 16- to 24-year-olds. Eggheads has the oldest audience in British television. I think the average age is 90.\u201d</p> <p>At one point, he was presenting Eggheads alongside his radio show, Points of View and Panorama, as well as making manic appearances on election night. \u201cIt gave a beautiful range of activities,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key word for a modern broadcaster is range. If you can do the very light and the very serious, and do them almost next to each other, that\u2019s really useful. You need to be flexible and agile in this crazy world.\u201d</p> <p>When he was doing five jobs at the BBC in 2008, he was handed a mega-salary of \u00a3700,000 a year. That generated controversy a decade later when he took centre stage in the BBC\u2019s gender pay gap furore. Why, Samira Ahmed\u2019s lawyers asked when she <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50599080\">successfully took the BBC to an employment tribunal</a>, was she paid one sixth as much for presenting the audience-feedback programme Newswatch as Vine got for Points of View?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb79aa390450452fe1c396bf2b4a187627cd9510\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb79aa390450452fe1c396bf2b4a187627cd9510/0_0_4710_2826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samira Ahmed attending her employment tribunal, during which successfully argued she was paid less than male BBC colleagues for doing equivalent work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samira Ahmed attending her employment tribunal, during which successfully argued she was paid less than male BBC colleagues for doing equivalent work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Gilbert/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did he resent his name \u2013 and his remuneration \u2013 being dragged through the courts? \u201cSamira is a friend and the BBC is my employer, and it was between her and them,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that sense, I wasn\u2019t dragged into it. I was just watching from a distance.\u201d I ask him if he supported what she did. He pauses and sighs, but eventually says: \u201cYes. It\u2019s a matter of record that she asked me what my numbers [how precisely the \u00a3700,000 was broken down] were and I told her.\u201d</p> <p>Is the BBC doing enough to address pay imbalances? \u201cIt\u2019s doing a lot, but it\u2019s probably still not acting quickly enough,\u201d he says. \u201cThey almost can\u2019t act fast enough.\u201d When in 2018 he discovered the huge pay disparity with his female colleagues, Vine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/26/four-male-bbc-presenters-agree-to-take-pay-cut-report\">voluntarily took a pay cut</a> that halved his BBC salary. He now gets <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49069433\">just under \u00a3300,000</a> from the corporation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t comfortable about what the pay reveal showed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In the course of the tribunal, Ahmed made the unkind comment that Vine was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/30/bbc-mounts-defence-in-samira-ahmed-equal-pay-case\">gifted</a>\u201d his primetime Radio 2 slot, but he clams up when I ask him to respond. \u201cI won\u2019t be drawn on that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather leave that between her and the BBC. I wish her well.\u201d</p> <p>When we talk, he portrays relationships between presenters as largely friendly, but they are also intensely competitive, and his 2012 memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/24/all-news-jeremy-vine-review\">It\u2019s All News to Me</a> underlines the edgy relations between people who are vying for a small number of glittering prizes. He mentions John Sergeant\u2019s subtle way with putdowns \u2013 \u201cVine is excellent; his sense of judgment will come\u201d \u2013 and records that Paxman\u2019s first words to him when he joined Newsnight were, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d How big is his own ego? \u201cOh, minuscule,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve realised I can\u2019t be bothered to bear grudges any more. I can\u2019t still be tearing up the walls when something goes wrong.\u201d</p> <p>I suggest to Vine that he is a workaholic. \u201cI\u2019m just a very lazy person disguised as a workaholic,\u201d he counters. This is nonsense \u2013 he is very driven (or as driven as a keen cyclist can be). He has a novel called <a href=\"https://www.hodder.co.uk/titles/jeremy-vine-2/the-diver-and-the-lover/9781529308433/\">The Diver and the Lover</a> coming out in September. He published two novels in the early 90s, but now dismisses them as juvenilia. This one, though, he really believes in. It\u2019s based on Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s Christ of Saint John of the Cross. \u201cI enjoyed writing it more than I can ever say,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>He is a committed Christian, although he makes a point of not evangelising about it (unlike his beloved cycling \u2013 he periodically posts footage from his helmet camera of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3314636/jeremy-vine-twitter-video-cycling-near-miss-london/\">near</a><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3314636/jeremy-vine-twitter-video-cycling-near-miss-london/\"> misses with vehicles that cut him up</a>).&nbsp;My suspicion is that his religion explains quite a lot: the work ethic, rigour, directness, absence of that old journalistic standby \u2013 cynicism.&nbsp;He lives in west London with his wife, the news presenter Rachel Schofield, and their two teenage daughters. It\u2019s his second marriage. The first, to the American banker Janelle Muntz, ended in 2000. He admits that, since he is out of the house for the first half of the day, Schofield has been carrying the burden of home schooling during lockdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21433773432ba8359765486bd5b859b8a428981b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21433773432ba8359765486bd5b859b8a428981b/15_0_2969_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vine on Eggheads ... \u2018My understanding is that it\u2019s sleeping.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vine on Eggheads ... \u2018My understanding is that it\u2019s sleeping.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His brother is the comedian Tim Vine and his sister, Sonya, is an actor and artist. Did his parents push their children to succeed? He says his late father, a lecturer in maths and engineering, was \u201cthe most encouraging man\u201d and didn\u2019t balk at his brother\u2019s ambition to become a comedian. He taught them to believe all things were possible and to be bold. \u201cMy theory is that life was in a lovely way quite dull when we were kids,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were in Cheam [in Greater London]; nothing much happened there.\u201d They had to make their own entertainment, and the performative streak may be more significant than any desire to come top in life.</p> <p>I try to understand how the worryingly balanced and equable Vine has survived so long in the broadcasting piranha pool and been so successful across so many different formats. What is the secret? \u201cI\u2019m still looking,\u201d he says. But then he lets slip what I think is the recipe: \u201cIn the end it\u2019s about being real and being yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this weird digital age, so much is thrown at you that you find, as a listener or a viewer, that you want people who are real.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jeremy Vine is on BBC Radio 2, Monday to Friday from 12-2pm, and </em><em>presents new episodes of Eggheads, </em><em>Monday to Friday</em><em> at 6pm on BBC Two.</em></p>",

How do you draw the line? \u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge thing about impartiality at the BBC and it led me to think about how it affects me,\u201d he says (we spoke before Emily Maitlis was castigated by the BBC for breaching guidelines on impartiality on Newsnight). \u201cI was very much in news, I was a reporter, I presented Newsnight, and then when I moved to Radio 2 \u2013 that\u2019s a hybrid show, somewhere between news and entertainment, you can never really pin it down. It\u2019s all very well saying we\u2019re impartial, but it\u2019s a show that\u2019s very passionate and the presenter can\u2019t just read the bulletin. The conclusion I came to was that you can have values but you can\u2019t have views, and that\u2019s fundamentally how I operate.\u201d Vine understudied Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight in the late 90s. \u201cBut I remember thinking I was in a very awkward position because, as the person who was then the other Jeremy, do I try to give you a motorhead version of Paxman, which is bloody difficult, or do I try and soften it, which was really off. Newsnight in those days was like a squash game. You were both going to play until one of you had a heart attack. I\u2019ve been through all that and, having done a lot of interviews \u2013 I\u2019ve spoken to 25,000 listeners on Radio 2, let alone actual interviewees \u2013 I do think asking a question and listening to the answer might be old-fashioned, but it is quite a good technique.\u201d He now realises his attempt to succeed Paxman was always doomed. But rescue was at hand in the shape of an offer in 2003 to replace Jimmy Young, who at the age of 81 had just been defenestrated by BBC management, on Radio 2. Young was furious at being ousted and rebuffed Vine\u2019s suggestion of a handover lunch \u2013 the two never did meet. Succeeding Young changed the direction of Vine\u2019s career, pushing him towards light entertainment and making possible shows such as Points of View and Eggheads. The award-winning BBC Africa correspondent of the 90s was on his way to becoming a \u201cpersonality\u201d, and the transformation was completed in 2015 when he was contestant on Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 judge Craig Revel Horwood likened his jive to \u201ca stork that had been struck by lightning\u201d. On behalf of Eggheads fans, I ask him what is happening to the programme, which he has hosted since 2008 but has been missing from the schedules of late. A series shot more than a year ago has now resumed on BBC Two, but there is no sign of any new ones being made. \u201cMy understanding is that it\u2019s sleeping,\u201d he says. \u201cI did more than 1,000 episodes and it\u2019s one of the most successful TV shows in the history of British television, but I think what\u2019s happened is it\u2019s fallen victim to the BBC\u2019s understandable desire to pull in 16- to 24-year-olds. Eggheads has the oldest audience in British television. I think the average age is 90.\u201d At one point, he was presenting Eggheads alongside his radio show, Points of View and Panorama, as well as making manic appearances on election night. \u201cIt gave a beautiful range of activities,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key word for a modern broadcaster is range. If you can do the very light and the very serious, and do them almost next to each other, that\u2019s really useful. You need to be flexible and agile in this crazy world.\u201d When he was doing five jobs at the BBC in 2008, he was handed a mega-salary of \u00a3700,000 a year. That generated controversy a decade later when he took centre stage in the BBC\u2019s gender pay gap furore. Why, Samira Ahmed\u2019s lawyers asked when she successfully took the BBC to an employment tribunal, was she paid one sixth as much for presenting the audience-feedback programme Newswatch as Vine got for Points of View? Did he resent his name \u2013 and his remuneration \u2013 being dragged through the courts? \u201cSamira is a friend and the BBC is my employer, and it was between her and them,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that sense, I wasn\u2019t dragged into it. I was just watching from a distance.\u201d I ask him if he supported what she did. He pauses and sighs, but eventually says: \u201cYes. It\u2019s a matter of record that she asked me what my numbers [how precisely the \u00a3700,000 was broken down] were and I told her.\u201d Is the BBC doing enough to address pay imbalances? \u201cIt\u2019s doing a lot, but it\u2019s probably still not acting quickly enough,\u201d he says. \u201cThey almost can\u2019t act fast enough.\u201d When in 2018 he discovered the huge pay disparity with his female colleagues, Vine voluntarily took a pay cut that halved his BBC salary. He now gets just under \u00a3300,000 from the corporation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t comfortable about what the pay reveal showed,\u201d he says. In the course of the tribunal, Ahmed made the unkind comment that Vine was \u201cgifted\u201d his primetime Radio 2 slot, but he clams up when I ask him to respond. \u201cI won\u2019t be drawn on that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather leave that between her and the BBC. I wish her well.\u201d When we talk, he portrays relationships between presenters as largely friendly, but they are also intensely competitive, and his 2012 memoir It\u2019s All News to Me underlines the edgy relations between people who are vying for a small number of glittering prizes. He mentions John Sergeant\u2019s subtle way with putdowns \u2013 \u201cVine is excellent; his sense of judgment will come\u201d \u2013 and records that Paxman\u2019s first words to him when he joined Newsnight were, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d How big is his own ego? \u201cOh, minuscule,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve realised I can\u2019t be bothered to bear grudges any more. I can\u2019t still be tearing up the walls when something goes wrong.\u201d I suggest to Vine that he is a workaholic. \u201cI\u2019m just a very lazy person disguised as a workaholic,\u201d he counters. This is nonsense \u2013 he is very driven (or as driven as a keen cyclist can be). He has a novel called The Diver and the Lover coming out in September. He published two novels in the early 90s, but now dismisses them as juvenilia. This one, though, he really believes in. It\u2019s based on Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s Christ of Saint John of the Cross. \u201cI enjoyed writing it more than I can ever say,\u201d he tells me. He is a committed Christian, although he makes a point of not evangelising about it (unlike his beloved cycling \u2013 he periodically posts footage from his helmet camera of near misses with vehicles that cut him up). My suspicion is that his religion explains quite a lot: the work ethic, rigour, directness, absence of that old journalistic standby \u2013 cynicism. He lives in west London with his wife, the news presenter Rachel Schofield, and their two teenage daughters. It\u2019s his second marriage. The first, to the American banker Janelle Muntz, ended in 2000. He admits that, since he is out of the house for the first half of the day, Schofield has been carrying the burden of home schooling during lockdown. His brother is the comedian Tim Vine and his sister, Sonya, is an actor and artist. Did his parents push their children to succeed? He says his late father, a lecturer in maths and engineering, was \u201cthe most encouraging man\u201d and didn\u2019t balk at his brother\u2019s ambition to become a comedian. He taught them to believe all things were possible and to be bold. \u201cMy theory is that life was in a lovely way quite dull when we were kids,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were in Cheam [in Greater London]; nothing much happened there.\u201d They had to make their own entertainment, and the performative streak may be more significant than any desire to come top in life. I try to understand how the worryingly balanced and equable Vine has survived so long in the broadcasting piranha pool and been so successful across so many different formats. What is the secret? \u201cI\u2019m still looking,\u201d he says. But then he lets slip what I think is the recipe: \u201cIn the end it\u2019s about being real and being yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this weird digital age, so much is thrown at you that you find, as a listener or a viewer, that you want people who are real.\u201d Jeremy Vine is on BBC Radio 2, Monday to Friday from 12-2pm, and presents new episodes of Eggheads, Monday to Friday at 6pm on BBC Two.",

      "bodyText": "Tom Watson, the former deputy leader of the Labour party, has been having a busy lockdown. Signed up to write a political thriller called The House, he and his co-author Imogen Robertson have been rapidly rejigging their novel to reflect a post-Covid world. Their near-future setting now includes a national inquiry \u201cabout what\u2019s going on in the background\u201d, where characters \u2013 if they meet socially \u2013 \u201cchoose not to drink out of glasses and they wipe the bottle before they drink\u201d, and undergo temperature checks when entering public buildings, \u201cwhich everyone is used to by then\u201d, says Watson, who is finding life away from politics as a newly minted thriller author \u201ca relief\u201d. Watson and Robertson have had to decide: will there be a vaccine, in their vision of the future? \u201cTo be honest, we still haven\u2019t quite worked out whether we\u2019re going to have one or not,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever happens, people are not yet safe in that near future, but they\u2019re kind of over the worst. It\u2019s not a dystopian, post-civilisation world \u2013 we\u2019re in a slightly weird world, where things have changed, but not completely.\u201d While there have already been numerous announcements of novels purposefully set during the lockdown \u2013 Avon has already snapped up Love in Lockdown, about two neighbours who meet on their balconies, while Hodder &amp; Stoughton has acquired Stay Home, in which a married woman breaks lockdown to find her lover murdered in his living room \u2013 many more writers are in Watson and Robertson\u2019s boat, making tweaks and adjustments to reflect our current situation, rather than big changes to plot or character. After all, who among us knows what our future will look like? \u201cI\u2019m finding it incredibly difficult to work out what to do,\u201d says Holly Watt, author of To the Lions, winner of the 2019 CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger. She is working on her next novel, the third in her series following investigative journalist Casey Benedict, which was due to be published in summer 2021. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work out where we might be. Might there be a vaccine? Will getting on a plane feel wildly anachronistic? Will journalists working from an office seem weird? How interesting can a book actually be when everyone is sitting in their sitting room in their pyjamas?\u201d Watt asks. \u201cIt feels odd to be writing about people hopping on trains or popping to the pub, but focusing on Covid might make it date hideously.

Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. The virus continues to rage in other parts of the world, including Brazil which passed half a million cases on Sunday. In England, senior public health officials have pleaded for the government to cancel an easing of lockdown restrictions that starts Monday.

The UK has the second highest number in the world, approaching 39,000 confirmed deaths. Restrictions will officially ease in England on Monday, a move that senior public health officials have said is \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d, pleading with the government to change their plans. The association of directors of public health have called for it to be postponed until more was known about the infection rate and the test-and-trace system was improved, and until it was clear that the public would abide by social distancing and hygiene measures. Ahead of the easing, some citizens appeared to be ignoring social distancing measures, crowding beaches and beauty spots over the weekend. A million children in England \u2013 or half of those who are expected to return to class \u2013 are expected to stay at home on Monday, amid scepticism of the government\u2019s assurances over their safety. Jeanelle de Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said her colleagues across England were \u201cincreasingly concerned that the government is misjudging the balance of risk between more social interaction and the risk of a resurgence of the virus, and is easing too many restrictions too quickly\u201d. Around the world, there were markedly varied announcements from nation states increasing or easing their lockdowns: Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. North Korea, which has not confirmed a single infection but imposed strict rules, will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the pandemic, reports said on Monday. Bangladesh lifted its lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns despite the country recording its biggest daily jump in infections, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said the country needs 15 more days of lockdown \u2013 until 21 June \u2013 \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and that he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay-at-home rule. Indian states on Sunday began identifying high-risk zones where lockdowns should continue while the rest of country gears up to reopen this month. In the Middle East, Abu Dhabi has announced it will cordon off the UAE\u2019s capital as well as ban travel between regions within the emirate for a week from Tuesday, while Saudi Arabia has reopened its mosques after a two-month closure, albeit under restrictions. Palestinian territories have seen low infection rates after acting quickly, but poverty rates may double, according to a report from the World Bank. More that 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Chile, the health ministry has reported, with 827 of the deaths occurring in May alone. The country has had 99,688 confirmed cases and 1,054 deaths. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries</strong></h2> <p>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks</strong></h2> <p>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</p> <h2><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases</strong></h2> <p>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases</strong></h2> <p>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday he road a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload</strong></h2> <p>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the epicentre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>North Korea to reopen schools </strong></h2> <p>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. The new school term \u2013 initially scheduled to start in early April \u2013 has been repeatedly postponed, although some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The Queen makes first public appearance</strong></h2> <p>In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the lockdown began. Windsor is said to be the Queen\u2019s favourite royal residence and she has been photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell pony called Balmoral Fern. The 94-year-old regularly rides in the grounds of Windsor and has been a passionate horse lover and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses throughout her reign.</p> <h2><strong>Spain to extend lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and that he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. \u201cWe have almost achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically.</p> <h2><strong>Bangladesh lifts lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing. It comes as Bangladesh \u2013 which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths.</p>",

Children from reception, year 1 and year 6 are able to return to classrooms today but just under half of them won\u2019t do so<strong>, </strong>according to a survey by<strong> </strong>the National Foundation for Educational Research. Another survey reveals today that half of parents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/01/early-years-childcare-sector-at-risk-collapse-england\">will not take up places for their children at nurseries, preschool or childminders</a>, triggering concerns that the sector could collapse. Gavin Williamson, education secretary, tried to reassure families that schools would be safe but he did so in the face of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/health-officials-make-last-minute-plea-to-stop-lockdown-easing-happy-monday\">more warnings that the government was rushing out of lockdown</a>.

Around 1 million children in England are expected to stay at home today rather than go back to school because many parents councils and teachers remain fearful about coronavirus despite the government\u2019s attempts to push back to normality. Children from reception, year 1 and year 6 are able to return to classrooms today but just under half of them won\u2019t do so, according to a survey by the National Foundation for Educational Research. Another survey reveals today that half of parents will not take up places for their children at nurseries, preschool or childminders, triggering concerns that the sector could collapse. Gavin Williamson, education secretary, tried to reassure families that schools would be safe but he did so in the face of more warnings that the government was rushing out of lockdown. The Association of Directors of Public Health said new rules coming into force today, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet outdoors and in private gardens, were \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d and that the country was not prepared for a second wave of infections. Attempts to maintain social distancing could be complicated by the prospect of more fine weather on the way for the UK this week. Vulnerable people in England who have been shielded from the virus will be allowed to go outside from today but many of them fear it is still unsafe. Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, said on BBC TV that localised lockdowns could be used to contain any surge in coronavirus cases as rules are eased.

Demonstrations were seen from New York right across the country to Los Angeles, with police firing teargas on crowds in Detroit, San Diego and Philadelphia. Governors in six states called in the national guard, including in Minnesota where a large truck carrying fuel was driven into a throng of protesters on a bridge in Minneapolis.

He was also criticised by Floyd\u2019s brother for not allowing him to speak during a telephone call between the pair. Our Washington correspondent looks at how the crisis has exposed his presidency again. The basketball legend Michael Jordan made a rare foray into politics by releasing a statement in which he condemned the \u201cingrained racism\u201d of the US. Lewis Hamilton accused his fellow Formula One drivers of ignoring the issue but thousands of people marched in Manchester, London and Cardiff to voice support. Here is how the US papers have covered the story and how the Chinese media has goaded Trump. * * * Hong Kong call \u2013 Seven former foreign secretaries have written to Dominic Raab urging him to take the lead in coordinating the international response to attempts by China to impose draconian laws on Hong Kong. Amid concern that the response is being left to the US, the group, including Tories William Hague, Malcolm Rifkind and Jeremy Hunt, said Britain \u201cmust be seen to be leading and coordinating the international response to this crisis and ensuring the integrity of the \u2026 one country, two systems\u201d deal signed by the UK on the handover in 1997. * * * Cover star dies \u2013 Christo, the artist best known for wrapping buildings such as the Reichstag in Berlin, has died aged 84 at his home in New York.

Verhoeven had already established himself in his native Holland as a craftsman and provocateur of the first order, eager to test the extremes of sexuality and violence \u2013 his first English-language film was appropriately titled Flesh + Blood \u2013 and indulge a fetish for Hitchcockian blondes and mankind\u2019s darkest impulses.

Verhoeven\u2019s talent for delivering the hard-R goods has always given him the latitude to slip more subversive sentiments into his work, and even the overt satire of RoboCop and Starship Troopers was often ignored or misunderstood during their original run. Now that the future Verhoeven predicted has come to pass \u2013 in corporate and militarized law enforcement, in the propaganda used to sell the public on pointless and endless war \u2013 his intent seems more obvious. But his career in Hollywood, for as long as it lasted, was often about getting away with something.&nbsp;</p> <p>Loosely based on the Philip K Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, Total Recall is about Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a beefy construction worker in 2084 who lives a modest and happy life with his wife Lori (Sharon Stone), but keeps having vivid dreams of Mars. To scratch this insistent itch, he visits a company called Rekall, which promises interstellar vacations without the risk and expense of boarding a shuttle. Through memory implants, Quaid can order up a two-week trip to Mars that\u2019s as vivid as if he\u2019d gone there himself \u2013 and for a few hundred credits more, he can travel as another character, so he chooses \u201csecret agent\u201d. The procedure goes terribly awry, due to the fact that the Rekall implant clashes with Quaid\u2019s actual memories of being a secret agent on Mars, which nefarious forces have suppressed. It turns out that his current life has been a lie, and it\u2019s going to take an actual trip to Mars for Quaid to unravel this conspiracy and discover who he really is.&nbsp;</p> <p>From there, Verhoeven, working from a heavily fussed-over screenplay credited to Ronald Shusett, Dan O\u2019Bannon and Gary Goldman, departs from the text. Like a lot of Dick\u2019s short stories, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale retreats into metaphysical space where Quaid\u2019s real and false memories collide, but Verhoeven has a Schwarzenegger movie to make. That means Quaid\u2019s journey of self-discovery takes the form of other Schwarzenegger sci-fi/actioners of the period like Predator or The Running Man, with him shooting and punching and bludgeoning his way to the truth. It eventually puts him at the heart of the resistance in the mutant-filled Venusville area on Mars, where he finds the girl of his dreams, Melina (Rachel Ticotin), armed and ready.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81ce064b1e88dd181e188095fc9933914eb47546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81ce064b1e88dd181e188095fc9933914eb47546/0_0_3501_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drawing from his unrivaled gallery of heavies, Verhoeven cast Ronny Cox, who had played the corporate shark \u201cDick\u201d Jones in RoboCop, as Vilos Cohaagen, the nefarious governor of the Mars Colony, and Michael Ironside, who would later play a military recruiter in Starship Troopers, as Cohaagen\u2019s sadistic right-hand man.

Just days after World Health Organization trials of hydroxychloroquine, the drug promoted by Donald Trump as a cure, were halted, British scientists are looking to sign up hundreds of patients for trials of medicines they hope will prevent people becoming ill enough to need intensive care or ventilators. They range from drugs such as heparin, which is used for blood thinning, to therapies still in clinical trial for conditions such as muscular, lung and blood disorders, which have evidence of potent anti-viral or anti-inflammatory properties. The studies are part of the Accord (accelerating Covid-19 research and development) programme involving doctors and scientists, industry, the NHS the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and UK Research and Innovation. \u201cWe are looking for a signal of both safety and efficacy, something that could reduce the severity of the disease, shorten its duration and prevent patients going into the intensive care environment,\u201d said Prof Tom Wilkinson, a respiratory medicine consultant, who is the Accord academic lead, from the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre. Just a handful of patients have enrolled for the trial so far and with coronavirus patient numbers falling, researchers are keen to quickly enlist as many as possible, said Wilkinson. \u201cThese are small, rapidly deliverable studies if we get patients in so we\u2019re looking only to achieve around 60 patients for each arm of the trial to receive one of the drugs compared to usual standard of care,\u201d he added. Hospitals including St Thomas\u2019 \u2013 where Boris Johnson was treated \u2013 and Guy\u2019s in London, and major hospitals in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Leicester and Glasgow are also participating, as are Southend and other coastal hospitals where fears of new clusters have emerged after crowded beach scenes last weekend.

Miners enjoyed a special status as proud contributors to energy independence in the socialist state. <em>Ich bin Bergmann, wer ist mehr?</em> (I\u2019m a miner, who is more?) was a phrase commonly heard during the cold war.</p> \n<p>Germany pledged last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/germany-agrees-to-end-reliance-on-coal-stations-by-2038\">to end all coal mining by 2038</a> in line with its EU and global climate obligations. This has deepened existing political tensions in its coal-dependent regions.</p> \n<p>In Lusatia, it has placed <a href=\"https://www.ende-gelaende.org/en/\">climate activists</a> on a collision course with local politicians, the coal companies and the communities whose incomes depend on coal.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoal is a very emotive topic here,\u201d says Adrian Rinnert from the local NGO Strukturwandel Jetzt, which has opposed the expansion of these mines for nearly a decade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/germany_coal_mines_map/giv-3902A77YRRgg3Oem/\" data-alt=\"Europe's largest lignite mines - map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/germany_coal_mines_map/giv-3902A77YRRgg3Oem/\">Europe's largest lignite mines - map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The big problem, he thinks, is the lack of alternative economic opportunities. Although tens of thousands of mining jobs have been cut since the 1990s, most available employment in the region is still tied to coal.</p> \n<p>Mainstream German parties still champion the industry, and as in other parts of Europe, the impact of green policies on traditional or left-behind communities has become a convenient agenda for populists and far-right politicians to latch on to.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen people here discuss whether environmental protection or jobs are more important, it\u2019s always the jobs that win,\u201d Rinnert says.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus brought the coal plant sit-ins and the conflicts to a temporary halt in March, but the battle is resuming as Germany gets back to business. </p> \n<p>Brown coal, or lignite, of the kind mined in Lusatia is <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/merkel-state-leaders-agree-terms-of-brown-coal-exit/\">the most polluting fuel in the world</a>, and it still powers 14 % of Germany\u2019s energy, which is a higher reliance than any other EU country.

The UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia will all exit coal before 2025. Spain produced 70% less coal-powered energy in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/spain-nears-life-without-coal-sooner-than-anyone-thought\">is predicted to achieve full </a>closure by 2027. But Germany wants to keep production going well into the 2030s and some mines are expanding. Witt cites <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/germany-s-farewell-to-coal-complicated-by-new-uniper-plant\">the new Datteln IV coal plant</a> that Germany will add to the grid this summer, a move protesters call <a href=\"https://www.waz.de/staedte/witten/witten-protest-gegen-steinkohlekraftwerk-datteln-4-id229167698.html\">\u201cclimate policy madness\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The coal lobby, and many politicians, argue that Germany still needs lignite because it is already committed to shuttering nuclear power plants by 2022. And <a href=\"https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/erneuerbare-energien-experten-kritisieren-zu-geringes-tempo.769.de.html?dram:article_id=450779\">renewables are being built at </a>a pace too slow to meet the country\u2019s current energy needs.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being <em>Georg Ortmann</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\u201cThe energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being,\u201d says Ortmann, the miner.</p> \n<p>He points to the dark layer at the bottom of the pit. Here, plants and trees that grew on this spot 17m years ago are exposed by the machines, now mostly in the form of black coal. Some of the wood is still visible, but once laid bare it will decompose quickly in the fresh air.</p> \n<p>The coal companies\u2019 logic is that since the damage to the environment has already been done, existing mines should be exploited to the maximum. But that can mean expanding brown coalfields by digging them out from underneath <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/human-rights-mining-german-villagers-take-on-coal-giant-rwe\">existing villages</a>. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bulldozing a village </strong></h2> \n<p>One of those villages is M\u00fchlrose. LEAG, the Czech-owned coal firm that runs Boxberg, wants to add the lignite-rich land beneath the village to its current mine. So M\u00fchlrose will be razed and locals rehoused in the nearby town of Schleife. Even the graves in the cemetery will be moved.</p> \n<p>Of the village\u2019s original 600 inhabitants, only 200 remain. But people\u2019s lives should not be uprooted for a dying industry, Rinnert says.</p> \n<p>Yet some in M\u00fchlrose say they are tired of living next door to a coalmine and are ready to move. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered here for years,\u201d says Reinhild Martin. The 69-year-old owns a restaurant in the village, an establishment opened by her grandfather.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47350b942180d0b15b1bd4209d8711a9ab5872fc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47350b942180d0b15b1bd4209d8711a9ab5872fc/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reinhild Martin, the owner of Zur Erholung restaurant in M\u00fchlrose, a village threatened by excavation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reinhild Martin, the owner of Zur Erholung restaurant in M\u00fchlrose, a village threatened by excavation</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Loos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most villagers have mixed feelings about their proximity to the mine. Nearly everyone was employed by the coal company. Men in the mines, women in the cafeterias. At the same time, the noise and pollution were almost unbearable.</p> \n<p>Thick layers of brown or grey coal dust would be carried by the wind, lodging on window panes and clinging to the laundry on the line, Martin remembers. Over the years, she claims, M\u00fchlrose people died of lung cancer, but the matter was never officially investigated.</p> \n<p>Although it pains her to leave, Martin looks forward to a fresh start with the compensation. </p> \n<p>\u201cOnce they start ripping down the houses, I don\u2019t want to return to the village. Those that left before and that came back to see the devastation never really recovered from the sight,\u201d she says. </p> \n<p>In communist East Germany, forced displacement was part of everyday life in mining regions. An estimated 30,000 people in the Lusatia region were relocated and more than 130 villages destroyed.</p> \n<p>Next to the human cost the environmental impact is a lasting one, too. Germany\u2019s lignite mines have destroyed 175,000 hectares of <a href=\"https://www.bund.net/fileadmin/user_upload_bund/_migrated/publications/150330_bund_broschuere_zukunft_statt_braunkohle.pdf\">the country\u2019s landscape</a>. Soil here is considered dead since nothing grows in it afterwards. And once the mine shuts and the pumps regulating the water levels are turned off, the ground becomes waterlogged.</p> \n<p>Rinnert says recultivating disused pits for tourism and other uses has had mixed success and is not sustainably planned. \u201cThe coal companies are making an effort now, but who will pay once their operations stop and their money runs out?\u201d </p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany\">old mines</a> have been flooded to <a href=\"https://www.leag.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/bergbau/cottbuser-ostsee/\">create artificial lakes</a>, but managing the water quality is a long-term project. \u201cRight now no guarantees exist that the companies will continue to care for the lakes. I don\u2019t think that the plans to turn them into a holiday destination and new job sector will work out,\u201d Rinnert says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a6734ef248a2608c0b7ffb98a13b723f8ffbeb5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6734ef248a2608c0b7ffb98a13b723f8ffbeb5/0_337_5050_3030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Lusatia\u2019s artificial lake district which, was developed from disused open-cast lignite mines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Lusatia\u2019s artificial lake district which, was developed from disused open-cast lignite mines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Populists hijack local emotions</strong></h2> \n<p>Away from the eastern German coalfields, the climate crisis has mobilised public consciousness across Europe, uniting anti-coal campaigners with Greta Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future school movement.</p> \n<p>In Brussels, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister and ally of Angela Merkel, is pushing <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/the-commissions-green-deal-plan-unveiled/\">the so-called EU green deal</a> under which the 27-nation bloc would become carbon neutral by 2050.</p> \n<p>Poland is the only EU country that has refused to sign up to that goal, and its rejection is driven by coal.

It is hard to find anyone on either side who does not reject the need for a fast exit from fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>Miners feel unjustly scapegoated. \u201cFor climate protesters we are like filth and to be blamed for climate change. It feels unfair,\u201d says Ortmann. \u201cIf we could, we would earn our money in another way.

      "bodyText": "The landscape makes you think of the surface of the moon. As far as the eye can see, deep gashes scar the earth. At the spot where the giant machines stand, ancient layers of bared coal are visible all the way to the base of the pit. Georg Ortmann walks along a bridge 40 metres above the mine to check that sand and gravel taken from the earth\u2019s top layers are not sticking to the conveyor belt removing them from the precious lignite beneath. \u201cMy job is to make sure the dirt is moved from one side of the pit to the other,\u201d he jokes. This is Reichwalde, one of two open-cast lignite mines that supply Boxberg coal-fired power plant. Boxberg was East Germany\u2019s biggest power station and climate campaigners now rank it high among the \u201cdirty 30\u201d of Europe\u2019s most polluting. Reichwalde operates 365 days of the year, in all weathers. It is a physically demanding job and Ortmann has spent his entire working life in these craters. The 62-year-old is one of about 6,000 coal miners left in eastern Germany\u2019s Lusatia region, once the German Democratic Republic\u2019s mining and industrial heartland. \u201cIn East Germany, people who went through the school system had a chance at the nicer indoor jobs. I quit school early,\u201d he says. Before the collapse of East Germany and reunification, the brown coal industry in this region directly employed 100,000 people. Coal was not just the main employer in Lusatia. Miners enjoyed a special status as proud contributors to energy independence in the socialist state. Ich bin Bergmann, wer ist mehr? (I\u2019m a miner, who is more?) was a phrase commonly heard during the cold war. Germany pledged last year to end all coal mining by 2038 in line with its EU and global climate obligations. This has deepened existing political tensions in its coal-dependent regions. In Lusatia, it has placed climate activists on a collision course with local politicians, the coal companies and the communities whose incomes depend on coal. \u201cCoal is a very emotive topic here,\u201d says Adrian Rinnert from the local NGO Strukturwandel Jetzt, which has opposed the expansion of these mines for nearly a decade. The big problem, he thinks, is the lack of alternative economic opportunities. Although tens of thousands of mining jobs have been cut since the 1990s, most available employment in the region is still tied to coal. Mainstream German parties still champion the industry, and as in other parts of Europe, the impact of green policies on traditional or left-behind communities has become a convenient agenda for populists and far-right politicians to latch on to. \u201cWhen people here discuss whether environmental protection or jobs are more important, it\u2019s always the jobs that win,\u201d Rinnert says. Coronavirus brought the coal plant sit-ins and the conflicts to a temporary halt in March, but the battle is resuming as Germany gets back to business. Brown coal, or lignite, of the kind mined in Lusatia is the most polluting fuel in the world, and it still powers 14 % of Germany\u2019s energy, which is a higher reliance than any other EU country. The global climate movement has repeatedly demanded that Germany decarbonise faster. For Wiebke Witt, a brown coal expert for the NGO Klima Allianz Deutschland, Germany\u2019s 2038 closure timeline fails to honour the 2015 Paris climate agreement on ending coal energy production. \u201cWhen the end date for coal was negotiated, talks revolved around the amount of energy produced from coal and not for instance the impact it continues to have on the climate,\u201d Witt says. Belgium, Austria and Sweden are already coal-free. The UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia will all exit coal before 2025. Spain produced 70% less coal-powered energy in 2019 and is predicted to achieve full closure by 2027. But Germany wants to keep production going well into the 2030s and some mines are expanding. Witt cites the new Datteln IV coal plant that Germany will add to the grid this summer, a move protesters call \u201cclimate policy madness\u201d. The coal lobby, and many politicians, argue that Germany still needs lignite because it is already committed to shuttering nuclear power plants by 2022. And renewables are being built at a pace too slow to meet the country\u2019s current energy needs. The energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being Georg Ortmann \u201cThe energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being,\u201d says Ortmann, the miner. He points to the dark layer at the bottom of the pit. Here, plants and trees that grew on this spot 17m years ago are exposed by the machines, now mostly in the form of black coal. Some of the wood is still visible, but once laid bare it will decompose quickly in the fresh air. The coal companies\u2019 logic is that since the damage to the environment has already been done, existing mines should be exploited to the maximum. But that can mean expanding brown coalfields by digging them out from underneath existing villages. Bulldozing a village One of those villages is M\u00fchlrose. LEAG, the Czech-owned coal firm that runs Boxberg, wants to add the lignite-rich land beneath the village to its current mine. So M\u00fchlrose will be razed and locals rehoused in the nearby town of Schleife. Even the graves in the cemetery will be moved. Of the village\u2019s original 600 inhabitants, only 200 remain. But people\u2019s lives should not be uprooted for a dying industry, Rinnert says. Yet some in M\u00fchlrose say they are tired of living next door to a coalmine and are ready to move. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered here for years,\u201d says Reinhild Martin. The 69-year-old owns a restaurant in the village, an establishment opened by her grandfather. Most villagers have mixed feelings about their proximity to the mine. Nearly everyone was employed by the coal company. Men in the mines, women in the cafeterias. At the same time, the noise and pollution were almost unbearable. Thick layers of brown or grey coal dust would be carried by the wind, lodging on window panes and clinging to the laundry on the line, Martin remembers. Over the years, she claims, M\u00fchlrose people died of lung cancer, but the matter was never officially investigated. Although it pains her to leave, Martin looks forward to a fresh start with the compensation. \u201cOnce they start ripping down the houses, I don\u2019t want to return to the village. Those that left before and that came back to see the devastation never really recovered from the sight,\u201d she says. In communist East Germany, forced displacement was part of everyday life in mining regions. An estimated 30,000 people in the Lusatia region were relocated and more than 130 villages destroyed. Next to the human cost the environmental impact is a lasting one, too. Germany\u2019s lignite mines have destroyed 175,000 hectares of the country\u2019s landscape. Soil here is considered dead since nothing grows in it afterwards. And once the mine shuts and the pumps regulating the water levels are turned off, the ground becomes waterlogged. Rinnert says recultivating disused pits for tourism and other uses has had mixed success and is not sustainably planned. \u201cThe coal companies are making an effort now, but who will pay once their operations stop and their money runs out?\u201d Some old mines have been flooded to create artificial lakes, but managing the water quality is a long-term project. \u201cRight now no guarantees exist that the companies will continue to care for the lakes. I don\u2019t think that the plans to turn them into a holiday destination and new job sector will work out,\u201d Rinnert says. Populists hijack local emotions Away from the eastern German coalfields, the climate crisis has mobilised public consciousness across Europe, uniting anti-coal campaigners with Greta Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future school movement. In Brussels, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister and ally of Angela Merkel, is pushing the so-called EU green deal under which the 27-nation bloc would become carbon neutral by 2050. Poland is the only EU country that has refused to sign up to that goal, and its rejection is driven by coal. Lusatia runs along the German/Polish border. It is hard to find anyone on either side who does not reject the need for a fast exit from fossil fuels. Miners feel unjustly scapegoated. \u201cFor climate protesters we are like filth and to be blamed for climate change. It feels unfair,\u201d says Ortmann. \u201cIf we could, we would earn our money in another way. But moral lectures don\u2019t really help when people\u2019s livelihoods are at stake.\u201d The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party disputes climate science, but in Lusatia has matched its campaigning to the sentiments of people such as Ortmann, focusing (with strong echoes of the \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d demands in France) on the individual\u2019s right to drive their own car and the unfairness of fuel taxes. Toni Schneider, an AfD politician in the Lusatian town of Hoyerswerda, claims the coal protest movement is not organised by local activists, but by people from \u201cbig cities\u201d. \u201cI have seen how they arrive here by train. From how they act it seems like these protesters come on a fun weekend trip and not a serious demonstration.\u201d This culture war framing \u2013 rust-belt people being lectured to by outsiders and metropolitans \u2013 helps the AfD to manipulate local emotion and discredit local protesters, according to Rinnert. \u201cThe populists know how to address people\u2019s feelings, which is why the AfD has such a large supporter base here in the Lusatia region.\u201d This coal region spans the German states of Brandenburg and Saxony. Last year the AfD surged in popularity to win 27% of the votes in Saxony\u2019s state elections and 23.5% in Brandenburg, becoming the second biggest political party in both states. The party campaigned on a platform of delaying the deadline for closing the Lusatia mines. \u201cWe need more infrastructure for new industries, and for instance fast internet access for all households before quitting coal can be even considered,\u201d Schneider says. A parallel surge in support for the Greens nationally means the party could plausibly be in government after the next election. After explosives were placed in our letterbox, I filed a police complaint. Nothing came of it Adrian Rinnert Activists in Lusatia feel the personal consequences of this political polarisation. Rinnert, like the miner Ortmann, lives in the town of Weisswasser, where he has been on the receiving end of hate and physical attacks. He even considered leaving when threats started to include his family. \u201cAfter explosives were placed in our letterbox, I filed a complaint with the local police.\u201d Rinnert says. \u201cNothing has ever come out of it.\u201d What comes after coronavirus? The law underpinning Germany\u2019s exit from coal was planned for May or June, but the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed its introduction to parliament. The law\u2019s likely winners are the coal companies, which have been promised generous compensation. Der Spiegel reported in January that LEAG would be in line for \u20ac1.75bn (\u00a31.55bn) from the state. Germany has pledged \u20ac40bn to help coal regions to restructure. But the losers will be the people who live next to the pits and who will go on suffering the polluting consequences for almost a decade longer than foreseen by the Paris agreement. \u201cWhen you compare the draft law with other European measures, Germany remains the only country that is compensating companies for the coal exit,\u201d Witt says. With big gatherings impossible for now, campaigners in Germany have been forced to scale down the anti-coal protests. However, both sides of this political struggle will use the pandemic to advance their opposing visions for energy in the post-shutdown future. Some experts believe the lockdown has accelerated a long-term global shift away from coal. Britain has gone more than a month without burning coal to generate electricity, the longest recorded stretch since the Industrial Revolution. A public backlash against air pollution could also strengthen the resolve of European governments to speed up the switch from fossil fuels. But a back-to-business decarbonisation backlash is also a risk depending on the depth of the recession. \u201cWe have now been told that we are part of an essential service to the state,\u201d Ortmann laughs. Throughout the lockdown, production has carried on uninterrupted, Ortmann and his colleagues working their busy shifts at Reichwalde tending to the gigantic machines. Ortmann can retire in two years. \u201cI\u2019m counting down the months,\u201d he says. Exhaustion and other side-effects are taking their toll. \u201cWorking in shifts has given me insomnia. The strong vibrations from the bridge give me aches in my bones and muscles that I can still feel when I get home.\u201d A coal miner\u2019s pension is still one of the best available, topping the average eastern German retirement benefit of \u20ac1,252 a month. Ortmann knows he is one of the lucky few. With stable jobs in short supply and the political fight over coal\u2019s closure still raging, his younger colleagues lack any such certainty.",

      "body": "<p>From taking phonics lessons in woodlands to conducting play productions online, organising the summer term of primary school is likely to prove a feat for teachers.</p> <p>With unions, staff and parents expressing concerns over the safety of more nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 children returning to school on 1 June after the easing of lockdown restrictions, many are unlikely to open straight away.</p> <p>But at Hartford Manor primary school and nursery, preparations are under way to keep teachers and children safe when it begins allowing some pupils back.</p> <p>\u201cParents are clearly anxious because more are keeping them off than choosing to send them. But we\u2019re going to be ready in trying to make it as normal as possible for the children when they come back,\u201d said the headteacher Simon Kidwell.</p> <p>Across the school\u2019s site in Northwich, Cheshire, water fountains have been replaced with 37 hand-washing stations. Tables and chairs in classrooms have been spaced out to allow for two-metre distancing between pupils.</p> <p>Windows and doors will be open where possible and air conditioning units will be switched off to prevent the same air recirculating in classrooms.</p> <p>Although 400 children usually attend the school, only a quarter will be back in the week beginning 8 June, allowing more space for smaller class sizes.</p> <p>In years 1 and 6, 15 children will be in each class taught by one teacher. Reception classes will be kept to 16 pupils, with two teachers.</p> <p>Kidwell said: \u201cThe hardest bit is the reception classrooms because we want them to have a tactile, hands-on experience but equally we\u2019ve also got to look at the guidance around cleaning and keeping things separate.\u201d</p> <p>For four- to five-year-old children returning to reception, playtime will look markedly different. Sandpits have been blocked off and equipment for activities&nbsp;such as painting, building blocks and reading areas, will need to be cleaned after each group.</p> <p>In the playground, bikes and bats and balls will also need to be wiped down between groups.</p> <p>The school\u2019s nursery, which takes in three- to four-year-olds, will operate in much the same way, with some furniture being removed to allow more space between children. Where teachers are required to change nappies, they will wear personal protective equipment including an apron, gloves, face covering and eye protection.</p> <p>Kidwell said: \u201cWe\u2019re also encouraging the teachers to not get into face-to-face contact with the children. Contact will be from the side, whereas often they kneel down to be at face level with the child.\u201d</p> <p>However, he admitted there would be instances where keeping a distance would be impossible. \u201cIf a child needs a hug, and a teacher decides to give them one, we\u2019ve just got to be very sensitive around it,\u201d said Kidwell.</p> <p>Learning for year 1 (five- to six-year-olds), and year 6 pupils (10- to 11-year-olds) will be a more adventurous affair, with teachers taking classes on the playing field or the \u201cforest school\u201d in the school\u2019s adjoining woodlands, weather permitting.</p> <p>Regular hand-washing and physical distancing are the only tools being proffered as protection against the transmission of coronavirus, but Kidwell said the school had not ruled out the potential for some teachers to wear face masks around older pupils in future.</p> <p>Another key consideration, is how staff will help year 6 children with their transition to secondary school in September. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from parents that some of the children have struggled when they\u2019ve been at home because emotionally they didn\u2019t expect primary school to end so abruptly,\u201d said Kidwell.</p> <p>While the year group has had visits to London and open days at secondary schools cancelled, teachers are hoping to fill in the gaps with remote activities. This potentially includes an online leavers\u2019 performance in which each child will film a separate piece to camera.</p> <p>Although Kidwell was confident the school were taking all the steps to mitigate the risk of the spread of the virus, he said there were likely to be more obstacles to navigate in the coming weeks.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get track and trace up and running by the time we get back to school it could be that we\u2019re short-staffed or the children are forced to isolate because there\u2019s an outbreak, so it\u2019s very stop-start,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From taking phonics lessons in woodlands to conducting play productions online, organising the summer term of primary school is likely to prove a feat for teachers. With unions, staff and parents expressing concerns over the safety of more nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 children returning to school on 1 June after the easing of lockdown restrictions, many are unlikely to open straight away. But at Hartford Manor primary school and nursery, preparations are under way to keep teachers and children safe when it begins allowing some pupils back. \u201cParents are clearly anxious because more are keeping them off than choosing to send them. But we\u2019re going to be ready in trying to make it as normal as possible for the children when they come back,\u201d said the headteacher Simon Kidwell. Across the school\u2019s site in Northwich, Cheshire, water fountains have been replaced with 37 hand-washing stations. Tables and chairs in classrooms have been spaced out to allow for two-metre distancing between pupils. Windows and doors will be open where possible and air conditioning units will be switched off to prevent the same air recirculating in classrooms. Although 400 children usually attend the school, only a quarter will be back in the week beginning 8 June, allowing more space for smaller class sizes. In years 1 and 6, 15 children will be in each class taught by one teacher. Reception classes will be kept to 16 pupils, with two teachers. Kidwell said: \u201cThe hardest bit is the reception classrooms because we want them to have a tactile, hands-on experience but equally we\u2019ve also got to look at the guidance around cleaning and keeping things separate.\u201d For four- to five-year-old children returning to reception, playtime will look markedly different. Sandpits have been blocked off and equipment for activities such as painting, building blocks and reading areas, will need to be cleaned after each group. In the playground, bikes and bats and balls will also need to be wiped down between groups. The school\u2019s nursery, which takes in three- to four-year-olds, will operate in much the same way, with some furniture being removed to allow more space between children. Where teachers are required to change nappies, they will wear personal protective equipment including an apron, gloves, face covering and eye protection. Kidwell said: \u201cWe\u2019re also encouraging the teachers to not get into face-to-face contact with the children. Contact will be from the side, whereas often they kneel down to be at face level with the child.\u201d However, he admitted there would be instances where keeping a distance would be impossible. \u201cIf a child needs a hug, and a teacher decides to give them one, we\u2019ve just got to be very sensitive around it,\u201d said Kidwell. Learning for year 1 (five- to six-year-olds), and year 6 pupils (10- to 11-year-olds) will be a more adventurous affair, with teachers taking classes on the playing field or the \u201cforest school\u201d in the school\u2019s adjoining woodlands, weather permitting. Regular hand-washing and physical distancing are the only tools being proffered as protection against the transmission of coronavirus, but Kidwell said the school had not ruled out the potential for some teachers to wear face masks around older pupils in future. Another key consideration, is how staff will help year 6 children with their transition to secondary school in September. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from parents that some of the children have struggled when they\u2019ve been at home because emotionally they didn\u2019t expect primary school to end so abruptly,\u201d said Kidwell. While the year group has had visits to London and open days at secondary schools cancelled, teachers are hoping to fill in the gaps with remote activities. This potentially includes an online leavers\u2019 performance in which each child will film a separate piece to camera. Although Kidwell was confident the school were taking all the steps to mitigate the risk of the spread of the virus, he said there were likely to be more obstacles to navigate in the coming weeks. \u201cIf we get track and trace up and running by the time we get back to school it could be that we\u2019re short-staffed or the children are forced to isolate because there\u2019s an outbreak, so it\u2019s very stop-start,\u201d he said.",

But behind the joke, and McDonnell\u2019s personal charm, was a serious attempt to address the issue that any Labour shadow chancellor or chancellor will run up against: what is the party\u2019s relationship to finance?</p> <p>It\u2019s unavoidable, because Britain contains arguably the world\u2019s most important global financial hub. If you aspire to form a government here, there is no path to doing so that does not, at some point, run through the City of London. The truth is that Labour party shadow Treasury teams \u2013 whether from the left, centre or right of the party \u2013 tend to have a lot in common in this respect. John Smith, shadow chancellor before becoming Labour leader, had his early 1990s \u201cprawn cocktail offensive\u201d with the financial sector. Gordon Brown praised the financiers right up until the 2007-8 crash. <a href=\"https://www.john-mcdonnell.net/74-2/\">McDonnell</a> promised the financial sector that it would have \u201ca seat at the policymaking and policy delivery table\u201d.</p> <p>This might sound surprising. Particularly in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">global </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">financial </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">crisis</a> only a decade ago, public opprobrium against the bankers was sky-high, and the ability of international finance to bring leftwing governments to heel occupies a major space in the left\u2019s folk memory: Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s government in France, and, more recently, Syriza in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/26/greece-was-never-bailed-out---it-remains-a-debtors-prison-and-the-eu-still-holds-the-keys\">Greece</a> are the standout examples. There is also a longstanding critique from the left in Britain, which views the whole economy as distorted by the excesses of \u201cbad\u201d, unproductive finance, leaving \u201cgood\u201d, productive capital starved of investment.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s a substantial truth in the last point. Evidence from the OECD <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/finance-and-inclusive-growth_5js06pbhf28s-en\">suggests</a> that, not just for Britain, but across the world over the last 50 years, larger domestic financial systems tend to slow growth and worsen inequality. But pointing to an issue does not solve it. Nor, as the 2008 crisis unhappily revealed, does the left\u2019s preferred policy of nationalisation necessarily make finance behave any better \u2013 as the accusations of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84f65b10-1650-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44\">widespread inappropriate treatment of customers</a>\u201d at the majority state-owned RBS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">global </a><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">restructuring </a><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">group</a> suggest. <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2020-05/1589291707_who-wins-and-who-pays-may20.pdf\">New figures</a> from the Institute for Public Policy Research show that 22% of the government\u2019s job retention scheme money is making its way straight back into the financial system. Simply making the state bigger, or more generous, is not enough to shift the underlying balance of power. Instead, a future social democratic government intent on serious reform needs to base its thinking about financial services on three fundamental points.</p> <p>First, financial services are not a monolith. What insurance companies want is not the same as what hedge funds want, and this is not the same as what the major banks are after. The critical point for a reforming government is to understand where those differences lie, and to make distinctions between different types of activity. While clearly some financial activities and institutions \u2013 hedge funds, for example \u2013 are very much driven by short-term gains, others \u2013 like pension funds \u2013 have interests that are far more closely aligned to those of a would-be reforming government.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pension funds look for long-term, stable investments that produce steady returns; potentially the sorts of investment in renewable power generation, or new public transport, for instance, that are so urgently needed. Policy should be designed around an understanding of these varied interests. Some of that should include support for a greater variety of financial institutions, catering for local, regional and sector-specific needs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, the global financial system itself is not primed to trash a reforming government in Britain. With a floating exchange rate and interest rates on government borrowing at world-historic lows, neither currency speculation nor the attacks of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_vigilante\">bond vigilantes</a>\u201d, pushing up interest rates, are the dangers they might once have been. Instead, in a world where international co-operation is in short supply, the bigger risks are from <em>political</em> decisions taken elsewhere that can threaten financial stability here.</p> <p>For instance, Britain\u2019s financial institutions require access to the EU\u2019s vast capital markets. Outside of the EU, however, this access is no longer a right, but conditional on Brussels\u2019 approval. The commission has already used the threat of withdrawing access rights to put pressure on<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/574ce2e6-c49d-11e8-bc21-54264d1c4647\"> Switzerland in negotiations</a>. It could do so against other non-members. Similarly, the operation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cswap lines\u201d \u2013 cheap, fast access to dollars, essential in a crisis and reopened for the Bank of England in March \u2013 depends on decisions made in Washington. These are more diplomatic challenges than they are financial constraints and there is no reason to act as if global finance is the biggest danger a future Labour government might face.</p> <p>Third, the challenges facing society \u2013 even before Covid-19 \u2013 are now so large that every part of the economy is affected, reducing distinctions between the interests of finance and the interests of other businesses. Climate breakdown, and environmental destruction generally, directly threatens billions of pounds of investments across the globe. Former Bank of England governor <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/review/r151009a.pdf\">Mark Carney was ahead of the curve</a> in raising the risk of climate breakdown to financial stability, and major asset managers are themselves reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/15/blackrock-climate-change-environment-divestment-coal\">looking to divest from high-climate risk investments</a>. Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12851_19-Finance-and-Climate-Change-Report.pdf\">report to the </a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12851_19-Finance-and-Climate-Change-Report.pdf\">shadow </a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12851_19-Finance-and-Climate-Change-Report.pdf\">chancellor on green finance</a> is a model of the kind of detailed policy needed here, where a political lead could help reshape the sector.</p> <p>Complete accommodation to the presumed wishes of the City will not work, but nor will sloganeering hostility. In truth, no Labour shadow chancellor has <a href=\"http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=267\">ever done either</a>. The key strategic task for the party over the next few years, as it seeks to win the next election, is to understand how the different interests at play within the finance sector can align with a plan to address those three challenges, and build back better from the pandemic.</p> <p>\u2022 James Meadway is an associate fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research</p>",

New figures from the Institute for Public Policy Research show that 22% of the government\u2019s job retention scheme money is making its way straight back into the financial system. Simply making the state bigger, or more generous, is not enough to shift the underlying balance of power. Instead, a future social democratic government intent on serious reform needs to base its thinking about financial services on three fundamental points. First, financial services are not a monolith. What insurance companies want is not the same as what hedge funds want, and this is not the same as what the major banks are after. The critical point for a reforming government is to understand where those differences lie, and to make distinctions between different types of activity. While clearly some financial activities and institutions \u2013 hedge funds, for example \u2013 are very much driven by short-term gains, others \u2013 like pension funds \u2013 have interests that are far more closely aligned to those of a would-be reforming government. Pension funds look for long-term, stable investments that produce steady returns; potentially the sorts of investment in renewable power generation, or new public transport, for instance, that are so urgently needed. Policy should be designed around an understanding of these varied interests. Some of that should include support for a greater variety of financial institutions, catering for local, regional and sector-specific needs. Second, the global financial system itself is not primed to trash a reforming government in Britain. With a floating exchange rate and interest rates on government borrowing at world-historic lows, neither currency speculation nor the attacks of \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d, pushing up interest rates, are the dangers they might once have been. Instead, in a world where international co-operation is in short supply, the bigger risks are from political decisions taken elsewhere that can threaten financial stability here. For instance, Britain\u2019s financial institutions require access to the EU\u2019s vast capital markets. Outside of the EU, however, this access is no longer a right, but conditional on Brussels\u2019 approval. The commission has already used the threat of withdrawing access rights to put pressure on Switzerland in negotiations. It could do so against other non-members. Similarly, the operation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cswap lines\u201d \u2013 cheap, fast access to dollars, essential in a crisis and reopened for the Bank of England in March \u2013 depends on decisions made in Washington. These are more diplomatic challenges than they are financial constraints and there is no reason to act as if global finance is the biggest danger a future Labour government might face. Third, the challenges facing society \u2013 even before Covid-19 \u2013 are now so large that every part of the economy is affected, reducing distinctions between the interests of finance and the interests of other businesses. Climate breakdown, and environmental destruction generally, directly threatens billions of pounds of investments across the globe. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney was ahead of the curve in raising the risk of climate breakdown to financial stability, and major asset managers are themselves reportedly looking to divest from high-climate risk investments. Last year\u2019s report to the shadow chancellor on green finance is a model of the kind of detailed policy needed here, where a political lead could help reshape the sector. Complete accommodation to the presumed wishes of the City will not work, but nor will sloganeering hostility. In truth, no Labour shadow chancellor has ever done either. The key strategic task for the party over the next few years, as it seeks to win the next election, is to understand how the different interests at play within the finance sector can align with a plan to address those three challenges, and build back better from the pandemic. \u2022 James Meadway is an associate fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research",

The research from academics at Aston University, which comes before the latest round of Brexit negotiations this week, showed small British firms were ramping up sales to countries in South America and east Asia. Suggesting such firms were taking evasive action to avoid the collapse of talks before the end of this year, the researchers said they had switched more than \u00a310bn a year in exports to other markets since the 2016 Brexit vote. Hopes for a trade deal between London and Brussels are rapidly fading as the end of the Brexit transition in December draws closer, with both sides focused on responding to Covid-19 and seemingly at loggerheads over the future trading relationship. Following a drift towards stalemate in recent days, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, used an interview in the Sunday Times to accuse Boris Johnson of backsliding on Britain\u2019s commitments. The prime minister has so far ruled out extending the EU transition deal. Johnson is also under pressure since the government confirmed there would be checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK from January, despite his previous assurances this would not be the case. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader and first minister of Northern Ireland, said on Sunday that checks should be minimised to ensure they did not damage its economy. The research from Aston University analysed 340,000 export transactions by 26,000 UK firms over a five-year period. Academics said they found the smallest micro exporters had switched as much as 46% of their new export growth from the EU to non-EU markets since the Brexit referendum. Small firms switched up to 19%. With much of the growth in countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, as well as the Commonwealth, the research could bolster Brexit supporters\u2019 arguments that Britain can embrace global trading opportunities outside the EU. However, official figures show the share of UK exports to the EU has generally fallen over time, as businesses have been able to raise their sales elsewhere around the world without needing to exit the bloc. The EU still remains the UK\u2019s single most important trading partner, accounting for about half of all imports and exports in a relationship worth about \u00a3650bn a year. The academics said the coronavirus crisis exposing the fragility of long-distance supply chains could also hinder future expansion by British companies. Jun Du, professor of economics at Aston Business School, said: \u201cThis evidence suggests that UK exporters are jumping before they\u2019re pushed \u2013 finding alternative markets worldwide for their products even before we know the outcome of the current UK-EU trade negotiations and any potential new barriers. \u201cOf course, we will need to see whether these patterns still hold true in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d",

The state anti-discrimination body has received 241 official complaints in the four months between 1 January to 30 April this year. Of those, 62 were on the grounds of race \u2013 an average of four complaints a week just in one state. This includes people being abused or spat at in public, harassed for wearing a face mask, and car windows being smashed. Those statistics also do not include other complaints referred to the New South Wales police, rather than Anti-Discrimination NSW, which were more serious. The president of Anti-Discrimination NSW, Dr Annabelle Bennett, said they had experienced an \u201cincrease in enquiries related to the pandemic and racism against people of Asian backgrounds\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, these statistics do not tell the full story of what is happening across the state, as many enquiries or complaints were also cases Anti-Discrimination NSW could not handle because the perpetrator was unknown or the incident was covered under the Crimes Act and referred to NSW Police,\u201d she said. At the same time, a community database that tracks anti-Asian racism has received 380 reports in two months \u2013 the equivalent of 47 a week. Erin Wen Ai Chew, the national convener of community group the Asian Australian Alliance, said this showed that Australia had more incidents of coronavirus-related racism per capita than the US. An equivalent American database, called Stop AAPI [American Asian and Pacific Islander] Hate, has recorded 1,710 incidents of racist abuse in six weeks, compared to Australia\u2019s 380 in eight weeks. Adjusted for the countries\u2019 relative population size, there has been 30% more reports of anti-Asian racism in Australia, Chew said. In Australia, 65% of those who reported suffering racist abuse identified as being female. More than a third \u2013 37% \u2013 of incidents occurred on a public street, and 90% of respondents did not report their experience to police. \u201cCovid-19 related racism is not the cause of racism in Australia, but it is a symptom of the bigger issue around racism in Australia as a whole,\u201d Chew said. Osmond Chiu, a co-designer of the survey, said the survey performed a valuable role in recording instances of racism that go under the radar. \u201cThis survey has highlighted the very real experience of anti-Asian racism that is happening across Australia right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has allowed many Asian-Australians to tell their personal story of what it is like and how they feel, which would otherwise go unheard.\u201d Bennett encouraged all Australians to continue reporting racism, whether it happens to them or to others. \u201cWe absolutely cannot let the actions of a few disrupt the progress we have already made towards racial equality and inclusion made possible by the commencement of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act in 1977,\u201d she said. Anti-Discrimination NSW is the state government body that administers the Anti-Discrimination Act. Instances of racism that could constitute criminal offences, including racially motivated criminal offences, should be reported to police.",

      "bodyText": "Covid-19 school closures have exposed children around the world to human rights abuses such as forced genital mutilation, early marriage and sexual violence, child protection experts say. Globally, the World Bank estimates that 1.6 billion children were locked out of education by Covid-19. As schools in England and around the world prepare to reopen this week, NGOs warn that millions of the world\u2019s most vulnerable children may never return to the classroom, and say that after decades fighting for girls\u2019 education the pandemic could cause gender equality in education to be set back decades. In Tanzania, girls sent home from boarding schools where they were being protected from FGM have already been cut. In the Sahel region, where early marriage is widespread, Unicef worries that many girls will never return to school. The Dutch charity Terre des Hommes runs a safe house for girls in Tanzania, protecting them from FGM. \u201cThe community has taken advantage of this situation of Covid-19 and where children are now back at home they are cutting their girls. They know it is against the law but they are not afraid. We had one mother who was jailed for a year after carrying out FGM but for her she is happy. She is locked up but her girl is cut. \u201cMany girls have been cut, including girls we had managed to keep safe through the cutting season, which began in October last year. Some girls escaped and they ran to our FGM centre; we had several girls just turn up. For these children, school is a safe place.\u201d The Tanzanian government is now sending back small numbers of pupils, starting with those who have exams in early June. In west and central Africa alone, 120 million children were sent home after schools shut, and some had to make dangerous journeys over hundreds of miles on their own. Andy Brooks is Unicef\u2019s child protection adviser in west and central Africa and has worked on issues of child exploitation for 30 years. He says one major concern for girls is that being out of school for a prolonged period of time puts them at risk of early marriage. \u201cSecondary education is a major delayer of early marriage. In this region of west and central Africa, four out of 10 girls are married before 18. If you look at the countries of the Sahel \u2013 Mali and Niger, Burkina Faso \u2013 it\u2019s six out of 10.\u201d Brooks says there are fears for those who never return. \u201cIt\u2019s a real worry that girls won\u2019t come back \u2026 [because of the Covid-19 outbreak] the financial stresses might be even harder and families will be looking for girls to get married earlier.\u201d However, the pandemic may offer an opportunity to help some children, he says. \u201cThere is a phenomenon in the Sahel area, where many children are sent across borders to be with Qur\u2019anic teachers and learn Arabic.

Being out of school \u2026 increases the risk of teenage pregnancy, sexual exploitation, child marriage, violence and other threats.\u201d The UN refugee agency has warned that school closures risk \u201creversing small gains recently made in expanding access to education for refugee children\u201d. Even before coronavirus shuttered schools, fewer than half of school-age refugee children were enrolled, while only one in four were attending secondary school. In Bangladesh, aid groups had been preparing to launch a pilot programme that would allow Rohingya refugee children in the settlements to start learning from the Myanmar curriculum for the first time in hundreds of informal learning centres. Babu Nisa, a refugee teaching assistant at one of the centres, told UNHCR that her students were \u201cvery upset\u201d when they heard it would be closed as part of the lockdown. Likewise, in Latin America, groups working with refugees fear Covid-19 will make finding school places even harder for displaced children. Underlying fear of the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus also hangs over students who are returning to education, and, as in Europe, keeps some at home even when schools reopen. Eric Hazard is campaign and policy director for Save the Children in Africa. He points to the known risk of sexual violence that girls face when not in school. \u201cWe know what happened during the Ebola crisis. There was an increase in children who dropped out of school, in particular girls. Over 11,000 girls in Sierra Leone became pregnant.

But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film,&nbsp;A Rainy Day in New York, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it.\u2019</p> <h2>6.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/ive-never-seen-doctor-zhivago\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/lauren-arsenal-invincibles-interview-wenger\">Lauren: \u2018No one wanted to ref in training.

It doesn\u2019t seem like that long ago, until you remember how unusual it was then for women in the public eye to come out. And then it feels like centuries ago. The prejudice was extraordinary: Toksvig was stood down by Save the Children, as compere for its 75th birthday celebrations, but a&nbsp;direct action protest by the Lesbian Avengers&nbsp;led the charity&nbsp;to apologise.\u2019</p> <h2>8. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/courtney-love-in-liverpool-scousers-wild-child-how-to-rock\">Courtney Love in Liverpool: the Scousers who taught the grunge icon how to rock</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018If you were in Liverpool in 1982 and had a habit of wandering down Mathew Street, perhaps on your way to Probe record store, you are likely to have seen Courtney Love. She was 17 and living in the city, having been invited there by Teardrop Explodes frontman&nbsp;Julian Cope. Probe was one of her favourite places to go \u2013 if not to buy records, then to sit outside on the steps, drinking cider with her friend from back home in America, Robin Barbur.\u2019</p> <h2>9. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/30/desert-drugs-and-fatal-desperation-the-true-story-behind-alice-springs-trios-miraculous-rescue\">Desert, drugs and fatal desperation: the true story behind Alice Springs trio\u2019s miraculous rescue</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018It was&nbsp;initially reported as a camping trip gone awry, and a miraculous rescue from the remote outback.

Defeating Liverpool and Cologne on their way to the final in Munich, Nottingham Forest could not be accused of having things easy. Admittedly, Malmo were not the most testing of opponents in the final.

Her father, the celebrity hairdresser Gavin Hodge, was a man about town and spinner of near-mythic tales; her mother, Jan, a former model. They lived with their two children, Gavanndra and Candy, in a mansion flat in Battersea, not far from&nbsp;Chelsea\u2019s&nbsp;stylish Kings Road.

      "bodyText": "After a short hiatus, today\u2019s list is a little different, covering the top 20 pieces from the whole of last week. 1. World Cup questions: why did gifted England not beat Argentina in 1998? \u2018It\u2019s a moment of jaw-drop, of dead air. Owen runs past the Argentina end, arms wide, grabbing the night into his chest, cresting the perfect high. This is what he was born to do. Freeze that frame for ever.\u2019 2. The man in the iron lung \u2018Three days later, Paul woke up. His body was encased in a machine that wheezed and sighed. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t speak. He couldn\u2019t cough. He couldn\u2019t see through the fogged windows of the steam tent \u2013 a vinyl hood that kept the air around his head moist and the mucus in his lungs loose. He thought he was dead.\u2019 3. Britt Ekland: \u2018I was put through emotional and psychological warfare\u2019 \u2018Two days after their first date \u2013 which was also their first meeting \u2013 the comedian Peter Sellers gave Britt Ekland a dachshund puppy called Pepper. Ekland had just arrived in London from Sweden to be 20th Century Fox\u2019s next big star. She was 21 years old and living at the Dorchester hotel; a dog was a ridiculous gift, she says. Just 10 days after their first date, Ekland and Sellers were married, and the puppy was lost in the whirlwind. \u201cAll these years, I always wondered: what happened to Pepper?\u201d\u2019 4. Bobby Moore and the mystery of the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet \u2018Entangled in myth, lies and political intrigue, dragged through the criminal underworld and spat across the international press, the tale of Bobby Moore and the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet threatened international relations and very nearly left England without their main man for the 1970 Mexico World Cup. But why would he have pinched it? Could it have been a prank? Did a bracelet even exist?\u2019 5. \u2018Do I really care?\u2019 Woody Allen comes out fighting \u2018There are a thousand things one could discuss with Allen: his 70 years in comedy, his 55 years of making movies. But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film, A Rainy Day in New York, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it.\u2019 6. Lauren: \u2018No one wanted to ref in training. Wenger hid. Pat Rice was the bravest\u2019 \u201cWenger didn\u2019t say much. He listened. He knew about the football; he knew perfectly what you could do. He wanted to see the person: the character, whether you could handle it. They saw I was mature, I could take that step.\u201d 7. Sandi Toksvig: \u2018I came out, and the tabloid press thought I was Cruella de Vil\u2019 \u2018By the mid-90s, thanks to the tabloids, she was mostly famous for being gay.

Blind Date: \u2018He was raiding his dad\u2019s booze cabinet\u2019 \u2018I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting my date to dance for me, but he did a whole Lady Gaga routine, which was very impressive.\u2019 17. My favourite game: Britain upset the USA with 4x400m gold at Tokyo \u201891 \u2018Pettigrew\u2019s rolling style became a flail, his desperation to reclaim the lead depriving him of all rhythm.

      "bodyText": "The federal government has opened the door to providing cash grants for home renovations as part of a new round of economic stimulus aimed at propping up Australia\u2019s construction sector. The government has also hinted it is looking at helping the struggling arts and entertainment sector, which has been pleading for assistance for months because many workers have missed out on the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper wage subsidy. It is understood the support for home renovations is on the table \u2013 but the bigger focus of the forthcoming package is likely to be new construction and larger-scale work. The latest moves follow revelations the six-month jobkeeper program may cost $60bn less than originally forecast, and comments by the Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, that the scheme may need to be extended beyond its September expiry because the economy may be at \u201ca critical point\u201d. Scott Morrison signalled that the next stimulus measures would be announced soon and would take the form of targeted support rather than economy-wide interventions. \u201cNow, as time goes on, there are sectors who will endure more of the pain for longer, and what we\u2019ve seen, there\u2019ll be gaps that occur in our economy and house building,\u201d the prime minister said on Monday. \u201cResidential construction will be one of those gaps that we have to address.\u201d The government is considering a housing stimulus package that would extend grants to include home renovations as a way to help tradespeople weather the slowdown, according to a report in the Australian. Some limits or conditions may be placed around the types of renovations that could be covered by the scheme, the newspaper reported, but the government was tight-lipped about the details. Numerous groups have called for government support in the wake of the pandemic to include moves to fix inefficient homes and buildings, including expanding the rollout of solar panels and home batteries. The Australian Council of Social Service has urged governments across the nation to spend $7bn on building social housing for 30,000 families and individuals, with the twin goal of boosting the post-crisis economic recovery and reducing homelessness. Labor\u2019s housing spokesman, Jason Clare, said the government should move quickly and should ensure the program was \u201ccomprehensive\u201d, including social housing construction and repairs. \u201cI\u2019ve got two words for the prime minister: hurry up,\u201d Clare said. \u201cWe are talking about an industry that employs about 1 million Australians.\u201d Clare said many people \u201ccould hit the wall if this government doesn\u2019t take action to help save this industry now.\u201d Morrison said the government was looking at ways to help the residential building sector, because of predictions construction activity would drop off in the last few months of 2020. \u201cThe tradies, the apprentices and others who work in that home building sector \u2026 are going to feel a lot of pain unless we can keep a continuity in the business of house construction,\u201d he said. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who has been talking with the states about the housing package, declined to specify what conditions might be placed on renovation projects. But he said the government was focused on jobs and \u201cmeeting that gap in demand in the back half of this year\u201d. Frydenberg kept the door open to including social housing construction in the plan, saying the government would \u201chave more to say in due course\u201d. Earlier on Monday, Morrison confirmed the government had also been \u201clooking closely\u201d at support for the entertainment industry. The prime minister told 2GB he had held \u201csome good discussions with people in the entertainment industry on the weekend about what we can be doing there more specifically\u201d.

The government has been resisting calls to expand eligibility for the jobkeeper wage subsidy since the forecasting bungle was revealed, although it has left the door open to further support to worst-affected sectors \u2013 such as tourism \u2013 following a scheduled review in June. On Monday, Morrison announced the government would fast-track funding for the Sydney Metro \u2013 Western Sydney Airport Rail Link so that construction could start this year, \u201clocking in thousands of jobs\u201d. He was joined at a media conference by the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who said the \u201cmega-project\u201d would provide vital opportunities as the economy recovered from the impact of Covid-19.

      "body": "<p>For years, GDP growth targets have been the be-all and end-all of China\u2019s economy. They were the imperfect but convenient measure of economic expansion and prosperity, the ultimate economic objective for the central government, and the yardstick of achievement for local governments.</p> <p>Officials at various levels \u2013 provincial, county and city \u2013 competed in a tournament of who could generate the highest GDP growth rates, and who could expand their local economies the fastest. Some transformed their municipalities into export hubs, some into manufacturing powerhouses, while others mined coal and constructed housing. It mattered less how it was achieved \u2013 the goal was to meet, and to exceed, these targets.</p> <p>The rewards for local officials were plentiful: visibility, respect, the upgrading of their cities to a higher status (Chinese cities are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system\">ranked in a tier system</a>), and most importantly, the possibility of being promoted to a higher rung on the political ladder. These were the highly charged incentives to push for GDP growth, and what made the growth model in China <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=CN\">work so effectively</a> over 30 years.</p> <p>This makes it all the more remarkable that, on 22 May, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, announced at the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress that there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/china-abandons-gdp-target-for-first-time-in-years-amid-great-uncertainty-of-virus\">no GDP growth target</a> set for this year. This is the first time this has happened since the targets were introduced in 1990. Because of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of any economy in any part of the world is going to struggle to stay above 0%. It would be pointless, the government has decided, to set a target of 6% when extrinsic factors dictate where the economy is going. But if the move becomes the norm and stays as the default option, it would represent a new mindset, and major progress for China on several fronts.</p> <p>First, getting rid of targets would signal a shift from a quantity-based economic development model, to a quality-based one. Slowing down the economy would mean less <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/01/dramatic-fall-in-china-pollution-levels-partly-related-to-coronavirus\">pressure on the environment</a>. It would also mean that local governments could shift their priorities to improving people\u2019s livelihoods, by eradicating poverty, for example, or reducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/19/china-poverty-inequality-development-goals\">urban-rural inequality</a>, and providing better social services.</p> <p>It would free up resources for the entire economy to produce better products, not just more things. So far, the economy has relied on making as much stuff as possible, as quickly as possible. This is a national attitude true of ambitious local officials, real estate companies, private entrepreneurs, and even national universities. But this short-termism means less focus on investing for the long term, and on conducting vital research that does not have immediate gains. Patience is what China needs.</p> <p>Second, for decades, China has been growing rapidly, but at a high cost: environmental degradation, an imbalanced economy, and perverse incentives featuring an investment craze and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/15/imf-warns-china-debt-slowdown-financial-crisis\">credit addiction</a>. In this world of rapid housing construction, bridges and buildings have been torn down and rebuilt again, and more than <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gthCDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=more+than+6,000+industrial+parks+china&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LR97bXqpzk&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Nea3fj952EMFqMtppvjcRDnEFLQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwizwd6o5djpAhXCgVwKHXzFB0IQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=more%20than%206%2C000%20industrial%20parks%20china&amp;f=false\">6,000 industrial parks</a> constructed around the country. Not all investment has been productive, and not all resources have been well-used. In recent years, growth has increasingly come from borrowing and spending rather than from rising productivity improvements. The upshot is mountainous debt burdens that now threaten China\u2019s financial stability and thwart economic dynamism.</p> <p>Third, it may change some of its international practices. The incentives will no longer be about maximising export volumes to help fulfil growth targets. There are pressures for self-sufficiency coming from all directions in the global arena: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/global-markets-donald-trump-us-china-trade-war-coronavirus-covid-19\">trade wars</a>, the pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and a backlash against globalisation. Practically, this may mean fewer state subsidies to promote exports, less reliance on foreign consumption, and less of a rush to acquire resources abroad. But its shift towards producing higher-quality manufacturing products could also bring its exports into more direct competition with those made in advanced economies.</p> <p>A potential problem with abandoning the GDP targets is reduced incentives for local officials. These targets have created powerful motivation for these cadres to implement reforms and try novel and creative policies, such as setting up \u201cspecial economic zones\u201d that mimic open and unfettered markets, or building the world\u2019s first smart cities, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/3027415/president-xis-dream-city-xiongan-pushes-ahead-smart-city\">such as Xiongan</a>.</p> <p>But this works less well when objectives are multi-dimensional. If local governments are assessed on a range of factors such as local employment numbers, social stability, environmental standards, and technological development, some may have mutually conflicting goals. Without local incentives to propel the economy, growth rates may slow down significantly. That said, even if China\u2019s economy grows at 5% a year, and assuming that the US grows at 1.5%, its economy will still become the world\u2019s largest within about 10 years, even if it takes several decades for the country itself to become as rich as the US.</p> <p>GDP growth targets set an expectation, and when unmet, provoke anxiety and pessimism in the population, even when the economy is doing fine. With greater uncertainties around the world, the Chinese leadership may find managing the economy without these targets even harder. But, ultimately, putting more emphasis on the \u201cmeans\u201d rather than the \u201cends\u201d of modern development would be a smart move.

      "bodyText": "For years, GDP growth targets have been the be-all and end-all of China\u2019s economy. They were the imperfect but convenient measure of economic expansion and prosperity, the ultimate economic objective for the central government, and the yardstick of achievement for local governments. Officials at various levels \u2013 provincial, county and city \u2013 competed in a tournament of who could generate the highest GDP growth rates, and who could expand their local economies the fastest. Some transformed their municipalities into export hubs, some into manufacturing powerhouses, while others mined coal and constructed housing. It mattered less how it was achieved \u2013 the goal was to meet, and to exceed, these targets. The rewards for local officials were plentiful: visibility, respect, the upgrading of their cities to a higher status (Chinese cities are ranked in a tier system), and most importantly, the possibility of being promoted to a higher rung on the political ladder. These were the highly charged incentives to push for GDP growth, and what made the growth model in China work so effectively over 30 years. This makes it all the more remarkable that, on 22 May, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, announced at the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress that there would be no GDP growth target set for this year. This is the first time this has happened since the targets were introduced in 1990. Because of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of any economy in any part of the world is going to struggle to stay above 0%. It would be pointless, the government has decided, to set a target of 6% when extrinsic factors dictate where the economy is going. But if the move becomes the norm and stays as the default option, it would represent a new mindset, and major progress for China on several fronts. First, getting rid of targets would signal a shift from a quantity-based economic development model, to a quality-based one. Slowing down the economy would mean less pressure on the environment. It would also mean that local governments could shift their priorities to improving people\u2019s livelihoods, by eradicating poverty, for example, or reducing urban-rural inequality, and providing better social services. It would free up resources for the entire economy to produce better products, not just more things. So far, the economy has relied on making as much stuff as possible, as quickly as possible. This is a national attitude true of ambitious local officials, real estate companies, private entrepreneurs, and even national universities. But this short-termism means less focus on investing for the long term, and on conducting vital research that does not have immediate gains. Patience is what China needs. Second, for decades, China has been growing rapidly, but at a high cost: environmental degradation, an imbalanced economy, and perverse incentives featuring an investment craze and a credit addiction. In this world of rapid housing construction, bridges and buildings have been torn down and rebuilt again, and more than 6,000 industrial parks constructed around the country. Not all investment has been productive, and not all resources have been well-used. In recent years, growth has increasingly come from borrowing and spending rather than from rising productivity improvements. The upshot is mountainous debt burdens that now threaten China\u2019s financial stability and thwart economic dynamism. Third, it may change some of its international practices. The incentives will no longer be about maximising export volumes to help fulfil growth targets. There are pressures for self-sufficiency coming from all directions in the global arena: trade wars, the pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and a backlash against globalisation. Practically, this may mean fewer state subsidies to promote exports, less reliance on foreign consumption, and less of a rush to acquire resources abroad. But its shift towards producing higher-quality manufacturing products could also bring its exports into more direct competition with those made in advanced economies. A potential problem with abandoning the GDP targets is reduced incentives for local officials. These targets have created powerful motivation for these cadres to implement reforms and try novel and creative policies, such as setting up \u201cspecial economic zones\u201d that mimic open and unfettered markets, or building the world\u2019s first smart cities, such as Xiongan. But this works less well when objectives are multi-dimensional. If local governments are assessed on a range of factors such as local employment numbers, social stability, environmental standards, and technological development, some may have mutually conflicting goals. Without local incentives to propel the economy, growth rates may slow down significantly. That said, even if China\u2019s economy grows at 5% a year, and assuming that the US grows at 1.5%, its economy will still become the world\u2019s largest within about 10 years, even if it takes several decades for the country itself to become as rich as the US. GDP growth targets set an expectation, and when unmet, provoke anxiety and pessimism in the population, even when the economy is doing fine. With greater uncertainties around the world, the Chinese leadership may find managing the economy without these targets even harder. But, ultimately, putting more emphasis on the \u201cmeans\u201d rather than the \u201cends\u201d of modern development would be a smart move. A China of slower but higher-quality growth may not just be good news for Chinese people, but also for the rest of the world. \u2022 Keyu Jin is a professor of economics at LSE",

Today, it aims to keep itself exactly as it was in 1837, preserving Soane\u2019s idiosyncratic collections of art, antiquities, architectural models, books and drawings. Image: Sir John Soane, Aged 76, 1828-29, Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, 2:C - There are 118 paintings in the Picture Room. To fit so many in such a small space, Soane invented an ingenious system of moving \u2018picture planes\u2019: three of the room\u2019s walls contain hinged panels which open layer upon layer, to display further pictures behind. Image: The Picture Room, Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum. Photograph by Gareth Gardner, 3:A - The text known as The Book of Gates is inscribed into the alabaster sarcophagus of Seti I, around a lifesize image of the goddess Nut, and describes how the goddess would escort the dead pharaoh through the underworld. The strongman-turned-explorer Giovanni Belzoni excavated this artwork, but failed to find a buyer for several years before it was finally acquired by Soane. Image: The Sarcophagus of Seti I, XIXth Dynasty, Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum. Photograph by AC Cooper., 4:D - Fanny was the name of Soane\u2019s beloved Manchester terrier. The lapdog appears several times through the museum \u2013 in several portraits of the Soanes, in sketches, and even on a fictional grand tour, sitting on some classical ruins. Though Fanny\u2019s death clearly saddened Soane, the grandiose tomb inscribed with the words \u201cAlas, Poor Fanny\u201d also displays Soane\u2019s unique sense of humour.

Photograph by Gareth Gardner., 5:D - George Soane was commended by Goethe himself for translating Faust, yet his father had hoped George would become an architect rather than a literary figure. The two had a difficult relationship: George later wrote a critique of his father\u2019s work, leading to his disownment by his father, who instead gifted his house to the nation as a public museum upon his death in 1837, which it remains to this day. Image: John Soane Junior and George Soane, 1805, William Owen (1769-1825), Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, 6:B - Though today renowned for its boutique shops and restaurants, Covent Garden was in Hogarth\u2019s day one of the roughest areas of London, adjoining the slums around Seven Dials and St Giles. The Orgy depicts the Rake at the Rose Tavern, a particularly notorious brothel. However, St James\u2019s, Cheapside and Tyburn all feature in other works by Hogarth. Image: A Rake\u2019s Progress: Three \u2013 The Orgy, 1734, William Hogarth (1697-1764), Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, 7:C - Flaxman, Reynolds, and Piranesi were all acquaintances with Soane, but it was JMW Turner who acquired this Flaxman sketch of Soane\u2019s late wife Eliza and presented it to Soane upon his knighthood in 1831. Turner and Soane were good friends \u2013 Soane designed Turner\u2019s house, and the two would go fishing together. Several Turner paintings acquired directly from the artist grace the walls of the museum. Image: Mrs Soane, 1795-1800, John Flaxman (1755-1826), Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, 8:A - The Library-Dining Room was a fitting choice for the family home of Vivian Wembley (played by Laura Haddock) in the film Transformers 5: The Last Knight. In the film, Vivian\u2019s family lives in a huge mansion filled with idiosyncratic collections \u2013 a fantastical American caricature of English aristocratic living. \u201cMy dad had a lot of stuff,\u201d comments Vivian as she leads Cade Yeagar (Mark Wahlberg) through the Museum\u2019s famous Dome Area.

      "body": "<p>When coronavirus crept across the world in early February, talk of how different nations were dealing with the virus came to resemble the Olympics for state capacity. Which country had the authority, the supplies and the expertise to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d? A balance sheet of national progress marked out a bleak race to the horizon, enumerated in case numbers and death figures.</p> <p>Although the focus over recent months has remained on leaders in crisis mode and the central agencies delivering forecasts and quarantine measures, local authorities have also played a prominent role during the pandemic. Chinese mayors, US governors and Indian chief ministers have coordinated local responses, taking responsibility for populations and even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/alcohol-spat-shows-india-states-battling-modi-for-virus-billions\">locking horns</a> with national politicians.</p> <p>Most people would read the pandemic as a sign that populations and nation states should band together, and<strong> </strong>for the people \u201cat the head of the rope\u201d to pull even harder, to use the metaphor favoured by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But there are others who see matters quite differently. They spy opportunity in the crisis, and wager that we might be able to ride the wave of the pandemic into a new tomorrow, where the virus shatters the global map \u2013 and undermines the power of democratic nation states.</p> <p>The US is ground zero for this type of thinking. Across the country, regions have broken up into \u201ccompacts\u201d, with states competing against each other for life-saving ventilators and PPE. The atmosphere is one of competitive federalism, where states are reconfigured as economic units bidding in a marketplace. Washington\u2019s state governor, Jay Inslee, accused Trump<strong> </strong>of<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jay-inslee-trump-twitter-coronavirus-washington-liberate-america-a9471681.html\"> \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d</a> for his calls to \u201cliberate\u201d individual states; governor Gavin Newsom termed California a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-newsom-nation-state.html\">\u201cnation-state.\u201d</a> One Maryland governor confessed to keeping Covid-19 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/495519-maryland-governor-says-coronavirus-tests-acquired-from-south-korea-under\">tests in an undisclosed location under armed guard</a>, in part to prevent their seizure by central state authorities.</p> <p>Although North America\u2019s economy is gradually reopening, the virus is still rampaging through its population. What will economic recovery look like in the midst of a pandemic? The president\u2019s economic advisers have some ideas. In an <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">analysis</a> released at the end of April, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, two of Trump\u2019s closest economic confidants and authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/trumponomics-trump-reaganism-authoritarian-wall-street-main-street\">the book on \u201cTrumponomics\u201d</a>, predicted that \u201cblue\u201d Democratic states would be slower than \u201cred\u201d states to recover, because of what they saw as their pre-existing excess of regulations and taxes.</p> <p>Their analysis divided the US map into <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">\u201claggard anti-growth\u201d states and \u201cmomentum pro-growth\u201d</a> states. The former have minimum wages, pro-union laws and state income tax; the latter are free of such regulations.<strong> </strong>In the established mode of disaster capitalism, Laffer and Moore\u2019s analysis appears to see the pandemic as a way to compel \u201canti-growth\u201d states to adopt ever lower tax rates in order to attract mobile capital and labour. It suggests those who resist will not be bailed out by redistribution from the central government, but left to languish in a deserved economic depression. The effect is reminiscent of social Darwinism, applied as a philosophy of government.</p> <p>The most articulate cheerleader for this kind of post-pandemic libertarianism is Balaji Srinivasan, the electrical engineer and former general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. Since the pandemic began, Srinivasan has foretold a redivision of the world map into \u201cgreen zones\u201d that have controlled and contained the virus and \u201cred zones\u201d, which have not.</p> <p>\u201cWe are entering this fractal environment,\u201d Srinivasan <a href=\"https://hopin.to/events/virtual-startup-societies-summit-special-jurisdictions-in-a-post-covid-world\">recently</a> told a virtual summit organised by the Startup Societies Foundation, \u201cin which the virus breaks centralised states\u201d. The virus does not stop at the border, so nor will this process of fragmentation. As regions seal themselves off to prevent contagion, \u201cyou can drill down to the state, or even the town or county level\u201d, Srinivasan observed, noting that any state without the virus under control will \u201cface defection\u201d in an intensified contest for talent and capital. After the pandemic has passed, \u201cnations are going to turn into effectively vendors and entrepreneurs and relatively mobile people will be applicants\u201d, he predicted.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine how a particular breed of investor could see this pandemic as an opportunity that will accelerate existing trends. The loose attachments that investors feel towards this or that nation will grow even looser as capital becomes more mobile, and a sorting process will separate the productive few nations from the malingering many.

      "bodyText": "When coronavirus crept across the world in early February, talk of how different nations were dealing with the virus came to resemble the Olympics for state capacity. Which country had the authority, the supplies and the expertise to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d? A balance sheet of national progress marked out a bleak race to the horizon, enumerated in case numbers and death figures. Although the focus over recent months has remained on leaders in crisis mode and the central agencies delivering forecasts and quarantine measures, local authorities have also played a prominent role during the pandemic. Chinese mayors, US governors and Indian chief ministers have coordinated local responses, taking responsibility for populations and even locking horns with national politicians. Most people would read the pandemic as a sign that populations and nation states should band together, and for the people \u201cat the head of the rope\u201d to pull even harder, to use the metaphor favoured by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But there are others who see matters quite differently. They spy opportunity in the crisis, and wager that we might be able to ride the wave of the pandemic into a new tomorrow, where the virus shatters the global map \u2013 and undermines the power of democratic nation states. The US is ground zero for this type of thinking. Across the country, regions have broken up into \u201ccompacts\u201d, with states competing against each other for life-saving ventilators and PPE. The atmosphere is one of competitive federalism, where states are reconfigured as economic units bidding in a marketplace. Washington\u2019s state governor, Jay Inslee, accused Trump of \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d for his calls to \u201cliberate\u201d individual states; governor Gavin Newsom termed California a \u201cnation-state.\u201d One Maryland governor confessed to keeping Covid-19 tests in an undisclosed location under armed guard, in part to prevent their seizure by central state authorities. Although North America\u2019s economy is gradually reopening, the virus is still rampaging through its population. What will economic recovery look like in the midst of a pandemic? The president\u2019s economic advisers have some ideas. In an analysis released at the end of April, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, two of Trump\u2019s closest economic confidants and authors of the book on \u201cTrumponomics\u201d, predicted that \u201cblue\u201d Democratic states would be slower than \u201cred\u201d states to recover, because of what they saw as their pre-existing excess of regulations and taxes. Their analysis divided the US map into \u201claggard anti-growth\u201d states and \u201cmomentum pro-growth\u201d states. The former have minimum wages, pro-union laws and state income tax; the latter are free of such regulations. In the established mode of disaster capitalism, Laffer and Moore\u2019s analysis appears to see the pandemic as a way to compel \u201canti-growth\u201d states to adopt ever lower tax rates in order to attract mobile capital and labour. It suggests those who resist will not be bailed out by redistribution from the central government, but left to languish in a deserved economic depression. The effect is reminiscent of social Darwinism, applied as a philosophy of government. The most articulate cheerleader for this kind of post-pandemic libertarianism is Balaji Srinivasan, the electrical engineer and former general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. Since the pandemic began, Srinivasan has foretold a redivision of the world map into \u201cgreen zones\u201d that have controlled and contained the virus and \u201cred zones\u201d, which have not. \u201cWe are entering this fractal environment,\u201d Srinivasan recently told a virtual summit organised by the Startup Societies Foundation, \u201cin which the virus breaks centralised states\u201d. The virus does not stop at the border, so nor will this process of fragmentation. As regions seal themselves off to prevent contagion, \u201cyou can drill down to the state, or even the town or county level\u201d, Srinivasan observed, noting that any state without the virus under control will \u201cface defection\u201d in an intensified contest for talent and capital. After the pandemic has passed, \u201cnations are going to turn into effectively vendors and entrepreneurs and relatively mobile people will be applicants\u201d, he predicted. It\u2019s easy to imagine how a particular breed of investor could see this pandemic as an opportunity that will accelerate existing trends. The loose attachments that investors feel towards this or that nation will grow even looser as capital becomes more mobile, and a sorting process will separate the productive few nations from the malingering many. States that don\u2019t fall in line with the demands of this investor class will be starved by the voluntary expatriation of the wealthy, with their assets and abilities in tow. If you assume this is merely a pessimistic vision, you\u2019d be wrong. In fact it accords with a long-cultivated ideology that Srinivasan shares with a group of like-minded venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, who subscribe to variations of the radical libertarian philosophy known as \u201canarcho-capitalism\u201d. The idea at its root is that a wealthy class of investors and entrepreneurs should be free to exit nation states and form new communities whose members can choose which rules (and tax laws) they\u2019re governed by \u2013 as if those rules were products on a store shelf. For like-minded libertarians, the colour-coded zones used in public health to control the virus are the blueprint for a new political economy. Since Srinivasan began discussing the framework, colour-coded zones have been rolled out to control the virus in Malaysia, Indonesia, Northern Italy and France; the strategy was also considered as a model for biocontainment in the White House in early April. As of early May, India has divided its 1.3 billion people into a patchwork of green, yellow and red zones, with different freedoms and restrictions based on each. The red-green zone schema has already informed the strategies of global investors. In April, Henley &amp; Partners, the global citizenship broker, released its annual ranking of national passports for mobile investors, and predicted that coronavirus would spark a dramatic shift in global mobility. Its chief source forecast that \u201cas the curtain lifts, people will seek to move from poorly governed and ill-prepared \u2018red zones\u2019 to \u2018green zones\u2019, or places with better medical care.\u201d In early May, it reported a 42% increase in applications for new nationalities, compared with the previous year. Nobody can tell what the world will look like after the pandemic. But what we can be sure of is that some investors appear to be already placing their bets on a vision of the future where the wealthy are freed from tax constraints. As nations are divided into different zones according to their respective stages of viral and economic recovery, the well-off could follow Elon Musk\u2019s recent threat to relocate from California to Texas, voting with their feet for locations that elude redistributive taxation. In our post-pandemic future, the flight to safety, away from contagious \u201cred zones\u201d, could be a flight from the nation state as we know it. \u2022 Quinn Slobodian is an associate professor of history at Wellesley College, US",

      "bodyText": "The clothing retailer Primark plans to reopen all 153 of its English stores on 15 June, as non-essential retailers across England began coming out of lockdown on Monday. Car showrooms and outdoor markets were among the retail businesses allowed to open on Monday in England, as the government seeks to allow the economy to restart, albeit with physical-distancing rules. Non-essential retailers have been closed across the UK since 23 March, when the lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus started, but retailers have lobbied to reopen as the shutdown has threatened the survival of many businesses. Debenhams, Monsoon and French Connection are among the retailers that have closed branches or warned they are close to collapse. Primark, owned by the Associated British Foods (ABF) conglomerate, previously disclosed that it lost \u00a3650m in sales for every month that all stores were closed. The fast fashion retailer will introduce physical-distancing protocols in its stores, as well as hand-sanitiser stations, perspex screens at tills and additional cleaning of high-frequency touch points. Changing rooms in the UK will remain closed and all employees will also be offered personal protection, including masks and gloves, it said. Primark has already reopened 112 stores outside the UK, from Germany to Spain and the Netherlands, representing just over a third of its total selling space. It said trading in its reopened stores \u201chas been both reassuring and encouraging, with customer queues outside most stores and, once in store, spending on larger basket sizes\u201d. However, like-for-like sales are down in reopened stores, with sales at four city centre stores below 50% of last year\u2019s figure. John Bason, the finance director of ABF, said early sales number were surprisingly good given that people were still worried about going out, tourism was on hold, many were still working from home or furloughed and there was little call to dress up for special occasions. \u201cPeople have come back to us,\u201d Bason said. \u201cThis is not the end [of lockdown]. This is the beginning of the second phase. A number of things that have stopped for lockdown will increasingly come back. Sales in certain stores could change quite a lot.\u201d He admitted that profitability and sales in large city centre stores, which are more affected by tourism and trade from office workers, were likely to be hit in coming months but said some regional stores could trade much more strongly. Primark is sufficiently confident to have placed more than \u00a3500m in orders for autumn and winter fashions with suppliers. \u201cThat is not tokenism,\u201d Bason said. The chain has been particularly badly hit by the crisis because of it does not sellonline, meaning it has built up a huge volume of unsold clothes, despite the controversial cancellation of all orders from suppliers for delivery after 17 April. In early May, as the first stores in Austria and the Netherlands reopened, it had \u00a31.9bn in unsold stock or orders, more than double the normal amount. The company will hold back some of the unsold stock until summer 2021, while it plans to gradually work through the excess of non-seasonal basic clothing, such as underwear, without the need for the heavy discounting seen at other retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer. Primark said it had paid \u00a310m to help low-paid workers in its supply chain in countries such as Bangladesh. The cancellation of orders by Primark and other retailers meant more than a million workers were sent home without pay. Primark, which has furloughed staff and cut pay, said it had reduced its overhead spending by 50% in April and May.",

The protests against police brutality have resonated strongly in New Zealand, and the hashtag #armsdownNZ has been trending for days, calling for a police trial of armed patrols to be shelved permanently. Police officers in the island country of 5 million people do not routinely carry weapons unless part of the armed offenders squad or attending a terrorist or gun-violence-related callout. The Green party, a coalition partner of Jacinda Ardern\u2019s centre-left government, issued a strongly worded statement on Monday, throwing its support behind the Black Lives Matter movement and drawing attention to endemic racism faced by M\u0101ori and Pasifika people, who are overrepresented in prison numbers, and confront an entrenched, endemic disadvantage in health, housing and education on a daily basis, among other socioeconomic indicators.

Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/united-nations-global-effort-cut-emissions-stop-climate-chaos-2030\">7.6% yearly reduction</a> in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that confirm they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a second inadvertent link between climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that is perhaps less examined. The recovery packages designed and implemented by governments to rescue the ailing global economy could rise as high as $20tn over the next 18 months. The scale of this stimulus will shape the contours of the global economy over the next decade, if not longer. This is precisely the decade when climate scientists have warned global emissions will need to be cut by half in order to reach a sustainable trajectory. In the midst of the crisis wreaked by the pandemic is an opportunity: to ensure rescue packages don\u2019t merely recover the high carbon economy of yesterday, but help us build a healthier economy that is low on carbon, high in resilience and centred on human wellbeing.</p> <p>The case for rebuilding our economies in line with environmental targets has broad public support. A<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/two-thirds-britons-believe-climate-change-serious-coronavirus-and-majority-want-climate-prioritised\"> recent poll</a> from Ipsos Mori shows that 71% of the global population understands that climate change is as at least as serious a crisis as Covid-19, and 65% think the former should be prioritised in the economic recovery. This is not only in industrialised countries<strong> </strong>that can more easily afford to green their economies; 81% of the citizens in India and 80% of people from Mexico were also strongly in favour of a green and healthy economic recovery.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the first institutions to call for this dual approach was the<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/now-is-the-time-to-plan-the-economic-recovery-the-world-needs\"> International Energy Agency</a>, which will publish a report this month detailing policies that governments could adopt to chart the course of recovery while decarbonising their economies. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is not only advising that fiscal stimulus packages should be based on green measures, but going as far as recommending<a href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/04/29/imf-chief-1-trillion-post-coronavirus-stimulus-must-tackle-climate-crisis/\"> scrapping fossil fuel subsidies</a> and taxing carbon.&nbsp;</p> <p>A growing number of corporate leaders are also calling for government stimulus packages to have green strings attached.

      "bodyText": "The air is clean and fresh, fish have reappeared in urban waterways, birds are frequenting uncut gardens, wild mammals are meandering through cities and greenhouse gas emissions will likely drop by an unprecedented 8% this year. Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration. The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering. There is a second inadvertent link between climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that is perhaps less examined. The recovery packages designed and implemented by governments to rescue the ailing global economy could rise as high as $20tn over the next 18 months. The scale of this stimulus will shape the contours of the global economy over the next decade, if not longer. This is precisely the decade when climate scientists have warned global emissions will need to be cut by half in order to reach a sustainable trajectory. In the midst of the crisis wreaked by the pandemic is an opportunity: to ensure rescue packages don\u2019t merely recover the high carbon economy of yesterday, but help us build a healthier economy that is low on carbon, high in resilience and centred on human wellbeing. The case for rebuilding our economies in line with environmental targets has broad public support. A recent poll from Ipsos Mori shows that 71% of the global population understands that climate change is as at least as serious a crisis as Covid-19, and 65% think the former should be prioritised in the economic recovery. This is not only in industrialised countries that can more easily afford to green their economies; 81% of the citizens in India and 80% of people from Mexico were also strongly in favour of a green and healthy economic recovery. One of the first institutions to call for this dual approach was the International Energy Agency, which will publish a report this month detailing policies that governments could adopt to chart the course of recovery while decarbonising their economies. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is not only advising that fiscal stimulus packages should be based on green measures, but going as far as recommending scrapping fossil fuel subsidies and taxing carbon. A growing number of corporate leaders are also calling for government stimulus packages to have green strings attached. In the UK, the call from a group of major business leaders for the government to embrace a green recovery was answered by the prime minister\u2019s statement that the UK\u2019s commitment to delivering net zero emissions \u201cremains undiminished\u201d. In Europe, 180 business leaders, policymakers and researchers explicitly urged the EU to build the recovery package around the Green Deal. Meanwhile the Spanish government recently released a draft law banning all new coal, oil and gas projects, establishing the direction of the Covid-19 recovery effort. In Canada, more than 320 signatories representing more than 2,100 companies have signed on to support a resilient recovery. Perhaps most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that have confirmed they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic, including BP, Shell, Daimler and Rio Tinto. Elsewhere, eight investment groups, including BNP Paribas Asset Management, DWS and Comgest Asset Management, have urged corporates to maintain their focus on decarbonisation while dealing with the consequences of the recession. The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group of institutional investors representing more than $4.6tn in assets under management (AUM), remains committed to an \u201cirreversible shift to a resilient, net-zero and inclusive economy\u201d.

Here\u2019s a quick rundown on everything that happened today: As NSW eased restrictions on Monday to allow up to 50 people in restaurants and cafes, the state recorded three additional cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 3,098 for the state. Victoria announced four further cases of Covid-19 on Monday, as it also loosened lockdown restrictions, including measures that allow 20 patrons to dine at a restaurant at the same time. Scott Morrison appeared in Sydney with NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian to announce the federal government will invest $1.75bn to build a metro train line to Sydney\u2019s second airport at Badgerys Creek. Shane Patton, the Victorian deputy police commissioner, has been announced as the state\u2019s new chief commissioner of police. Patton will start the role when the current chief commissioner, Graham Ashton, leaves in June. 432 Indigenous people have died in police custody since 1991, according to Guardian Australia\u2019s latest analysis. Today, the family of 26-year-old David Dungay, a Dunghutti man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five prison guards, expressed solidarity with George Floyd\u2019s family, the US man who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis last week. The NRL has announced it will review its screening process for cardboard cut-outs of fans at games after multiple crude jokes have been discovered. It comes after Fox Sports\u2019 host Matthew Johns apologised today for a comedy sketch which placed the face of Adolf Hitler into the crowd. Rugby Australia has cut 47 of its 142 fulltime staff \u2013 about a third of its workers \u2013 as it implements a restructure that will save the code $5.5m per year From me, Elias Visontay, have a great evening. For more on the government\u2019s push to prop up the construction sector by providing cash grants for home renovations, my colleague Daniel Hurst has written this report: The NSW government\u2019s proposal to give public servants a one-off $1,000 stimulus payment if they agree to a 12-month pay freeze has been slammed by unions as insulting, AAP reports. Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has been talking with union bosses about the proposal which would see non-executive frontline staff such as nurses, police officers, paramedics and teachers receive a one-off payment in return for accepting a pay pause. The state government wants to freeze the pay of all public servants due to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 restrictions. The move is estimated to save $3bn which the coalition wants to reinvest in public projects. The $1,000 one-off payment would instead cost about $200m with Perrottet arguing it would leave the government with $2.8bn to invest in job-creating projects. \u201cWe are pausing pay rises for politicians and public servants so we can guarantee jobs for people who are in them and create tens of thousands more for those who have found themselves out of work,\u201d the treasurer said in a statement on Monday. The proposed wage freeze for 410,000 public sector workers could be blocked in the upper house. NSW Labor, the Greens and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party are expected to support a disallowance motion rejecting the regulation when it\u2019s put forward on Tuesday afternoon. If the disallowance motion passes, the Berejiklian government flagged it will take the matter to the NSW Industrial Relations Commission. The proposal has been slammed by public sector unions including the NSW Teachers Federation whose president, Angelo Gavrielatos, on Monday said the bad policy added \u201cinsult to injury\u201d. Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey says $1,000 \u201cshort changes\u201d the people who have been working hard throughout the bushfire crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, and is calling on Perrottet to confirm how long the pay freeze would be in place. \u201cLet\u2019s get fair dinkum here, if the treasurer has a proposal, a solid proposal \u2013 put it on the table ... Don\u2019t play Mickey Mouse with people\u2019s jobs and their lives and their incomes,\u201d Morey said. Morey said the treasurer should stop thinking about himself and instead focus on \u201censuring that workers have money to spend to grow the economy\u201d. The NSW Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association described the $1,000 payment as an attempt to silence nurses and midwives. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to the nurses,\u201d general secretary Brett Holmes said. Rugby Australia stood down 47 of its 142 fulltime staff on Monday morning, as it implements a restructure that will save the code $5.5m per year. The cuts, which will also see 30 contractors and casual workers axed, comes after Rugby Australia reported a $9.4m loss in 2019. All senior staff who remain with Rugby Australia will have their salary reduced by 5%. In a statement released on Monday, Rugby Australia noted \u201cover 75% of Rugby Australia\u2019s workforce has been stood down, or on significantly reduced hours since April 1, while senior executive staff have continued to work on a fulltime basis with salary reductions of at least 30% since that date.\u201d It said all stood-down staff had been receiving the jobkeeper wage subsidy. Rugby Australia interim CEO, Rob Clarke, calling Monday\u2019s restructure \u201cphase one\u201d, said: Today was an incredibly difficult day for the organisation with many people affected by changes that are necessary to ensure the viability and sustainability of the organisation as a result of the devastating impacts of the pandemic. We have delivered the news to staff this morning and told them that Rugby Australia values the contribution of each and every one of them, some of whom have given significant service to Rugby Australia and to the game over many years. This is a difficult time for a lot of very passionate, hard-working Rugby people and we are committed to helping those people find their next opportunity, whether it be within the game or elsewhere. Back on the $721m worth of debts to be repaid to Australians, opposition government services spokesman Bill Shorten is calling for \u201csome form of inquiry\u201d into the robodebt scheme. Speaking to Patricia Karvelas on ABC on Monday afternoon, Shorten also said responsibility for the scheme goes further than current government services minister Stuart Robert, naming Scott Morrison and former social services minister, now attorney general, Christian Porter. I think it goes further than the current minister ... I don\u2019t think the buck only stops with Minister Stuart Robert. On an inquiry into robodebt, Shorten said: There should be some form of inquiry, there has been a human toll. These are poor people. These are vulnerable people. Some people with mental illness. All of a sudden, the government\u2019s chasing you for a debt which you don\u2019t think exists or you don\u2019t know it exists or you can\u2019t remember it exists ... This is a terrible pressure, and it\u2019s been going on for four and a half years Asked what type of inquiry, Shorten said: Whatever the form is, I don\u2019t know if it should be a judicial inquiry. I haven\u2019t formed a view, obviously we\u2019ve got to talk, through the opposition, on that. I do think the parliament needs to talk further about it. It\u2019s not satisfactory, is it, that the government says \u201cmy bad \u2013 here\u2019s $721m plus\u201d and no one\u2019s responsible. They raised all the issues around Pink Batts. They\u2019ve never been shy of attacking Labor ... How come no one is responsible in the government for this? I\u2019ll be handing over the blog to Elias Visontay for the rest of the evening. Thanks for reading and stay safe. Representatives of Queensland\u2019s tourism industry have said there is a pent-up demand for intrastate holidays as restrictions ease. The chief executive of Tourism Tropical North, Mark Olsen, told AAP that the start of internal travel from today will \u201cinject an extra $50m into this economy\u201d. The chair of Destination Gold Coast, Paul Donovan, said he supports the state border being reopened only when it\u2019s safe to do so. \u201cJust up the road we have more than 2 million people in Brisbane who we know are looking for a break \u2013 they\u2019ll be our first target market,\u201d he said. \u201cMany have already started taking bookings from visitors throughout Queensland who are keen to come and visit the coast.\u201d Fox Sports and former NRL player Matthew Johns have apologised for a comedy sketch where they used the NRL\u2019s new cardboard cut-outs to put the face of Adolf Hitler into the crowd. As stadiums are empty, the league has launched an initiative where fans can pay $22 to send in photos and have a cardboard cut-out of themselves sit in the stands. However, multiple people have taken advantage of the scheme to submit childish and offensive jokes. Over the weekend, a photo of English serial killer Dr Harold Shipman was spotted in the stands \u2013 among other potential \u2018joke\u2019 cutouts \u2013 during the match between Newcastle and Penrith. Johns then aired a sketch on Fox Sports which showed a cut-out of Hitler in the stands \u2013 though this did not actually happen. Another japester made headlines on Friday for submitting a photo of Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummins, who did appear on TV screens. The NRL has now announced it will review the screening process for the cardboard cut-outs, to deter other people abusing the process for a cheap laugh. AAP reports that photos of rugby columnist Peter FitzSimons and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett are believed to be among those the system rejected. We have amended an earlier key event, which linked to a news story where we put the wrong date in the headline and text. It said 432 deaths had occurred since 2008, but that should have been since 1991. The Brisbane Lions coach, Chris Fagan, has said that AFL injury rates could rise because the players have been restricted to so few training sessions due to the pandemic. Teams have been restricted to only two full-group contact sessions this week, and one next week, before games start again. \u201cInjury rates could go up,\u201d Fagan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a great experiment this year to find out. We are all hoping it doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe are doing as much as we can in our programs to mitigate that, allowing good recovery time between sessions, making sure we progress the load gradually and not too fast.\u201d If you are following the George Floyd protests today, also read this from Lorena Allam. Guardian Australia\u2019s latest analysis shows that 432 Indigenous people have died in police custody since 1991. Today, the family of 26-year-old David Dungay, a Dunghutti man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five prison guards, expressed solidarity with Floyd\u2019s family. The Dungay family are campaigning for the guards to be charged and prosecuted. For the 10th day in a row New Zealand has no new cases of Covid-19 and no one is in hospital being treated with the illness, the ministry of health said. The total number of confirmed cases remains at 1,154, with the opposition leader, Todd Muller, pushing for a drop from alert level 2 to level 1, saying there is no sign of community transmission and greater freedoms would stimulate the economy and small business. A total of 1,481 people have recovered from the virus and only one case remains active, a person not requiring hospital care. Jury trials will start back up in some NSW district courtrooms in Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre, Parramatta and Newcastle on 15 June. But courtrooms are not going to look like they did pre-Covid. For the first time, jurors are not going to be required to sit in the jury box, but will instead be spread out across the courtroom to facilitate physical distancing. In some cases, jurors may even be phoned in from another location to avoid having too many people in courtrooms at the same time. Jurors may also have to go through thermal scanning to check their temperature, and will be asked health screening questions. It\u2019s unclear what will happen if one of the jurors tests positive for Covid-19 halfway through a trial. Guardian Australia has contacted the NSW district court for clarification. Labor MP Stephen Jones has called on Scott Morrison to sack Stuart Robert from the ministry over the \u201cmonumental\u201d robodebt bungle. Morrison said at a press conference earlier today that the government had \u201cgreat regrets about any pain or injury caused here\u201d. When asked whether Robert, the government services minister, still had his full confidence, the prime minister replied: \u201cOf course.\u201d But Jones, who is Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer and financial services spokesperson, said Jones had \u201ca trail of destruction behind him\u201d throughout his ministerial career and had \u201coverseen a monumental bungle\u201d over robodebt. The government announced on Friday that it would repay 470,000 debts that were entirely or partially raised using the discredited \u201cincome-averaging\u201d calculations. Robert said the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and would include recovery fee charges. But Jones said Robert should have made the decision to repay those debts six months ago \u2013 around the time the government settled a federal court case brought by Victoria Legal Aid and announced it would no longer raise debts without first gathering evidence \u2013 such as payslips \u2013 to prove a person had underreported their earnings to Centrelink. Jones said allowing the matter to drag on had caused ongoing stress and anxiety. He should have fessed up and paid the money back way back then. Why the prime minister hasn\u2019t sacked Stuart Robert I do not know. The prime minister should just move and sack him. It follows comments over the weekend by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, that Robert\u2019s career \u201cshould be over\u201d. Pity the Fair Work Commission \u2013 having to decide what to do with the minimum wage during the middle of a global pandemic. Is it freeze wages (a real cut) to try to boost jobs growth, as employers have asked, or boost pay so lower income earners have more spending money (as unions want)? A few supplementary submissions have been lodged, the most interesting of which are the Australian Retailers Association and the Victorian government. The association has changed its position from March \u2013 when it called for a 1.8% increase \u2013 to now call for the minimum wage to \u201cremain at current levels until mid-2021\u201d (that is, 0%). It said: The Covid-19 crisis has made it economically unfeasible for businesses to absorb additional cost pressures through an increase to the minimum wage and modern award minimum wages. Any increase in costs is likely to have a detrimental effect on employee headcount and/or hours, as well as impact future job opportunities. However, it is important to recognise that maintaining existing minimum wages does not preclude businesses who have been less affected by Covid-19 from passing on wage increases to their employees. The Victorian government is calling for a pay rise of \u201cat least\u201d 3%. It also made some interesting commentary about the federal government\u2019s jobseeker ($1,100 a fortnight) and jobkeeper ($1,500 a fortnight) programs. The Victorian government argued that doubling the rate of Newstart \u201ccan be seen as an acknowledgment that the previous levels of Newstart ... were unsustainable to support those seeking work and base consumer behaviour such as purchase of groceries, necessary travel and housing\u201d. The commonwealth government\u2019s jobkeeper support package is a tacit acknowledgement by the commonwealth that $1,500 per fortnight represents a \u2018living wage\u2019 ... By setting the new payment levels, the commonwealth government has tacitly acknowledged that approximately $1,200 per fortnight is the minimum income required by a single person without dependents. So, the Victorian government says, the Fair Work Commission should make sure the minimum wage keeps up and the incentive to work is preserved. Labor has called on the government to tighten its scheme allowing people early access to superannuation savings after new evidence about some people using the cash for online gambling. Accenture analysed the debit and credit card data of 13,000 people who withdrew an average of $8,000 under the scheme and found that about one in 10 used the money to gamble, according to reports. Stephen Jones, the shadow assistant treasurer and shadow minister for financial services, called on the government to enforce the requirement that the withdrawals went only to those suffering genuine hardship. At a media conference in Canberra a short time ago, Jones said the government had failed to learn the lessons from the robodebt scheme because it had not put in place proper scrutiny of the superannuation withdrawal requests. He said allowing funds to go to overseas gambling companies was not in the national interest and it was not in the interest of the people involved. Everybody loses if this scheme doesn\u2019t work properly. Earlier today, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was comfortable with the fact people were \u201caccessing their money when they need it most\u201d. He said about 1.8 million people had secured early access to a total of $15bn in superannuation funds. He said they included Australians and temporary residents and that said the funds were \u201ctheir money\u201d and they would use it \u201cfor a range of purposes\u201d. But we\u2019re going through a once-in-a-century pandemic and people do need that extra funding, that extra financial support over and above other government initiatives to help them get through this period. South Australia premier Steven Marshall is speaking now from inside a pub. He thanks the people of the state for complying with restrictions, and crows about the state\u2019s success in dealing with the virus. It was only four or five weeks ago that many people were thinking they might be coming back in July, August or September and here we are on the first day of June and we have got 80 people in pubs in South Australia. McGowan calls on West Australians to \u201choliday at home\u201d within the state this year, to boost the local economy. He says the government will launch an advertising campaign called \u201cWander out yonder\u201d. Our hard border means going east on holidays is not an option. Going overseas on holidays is not an option, but you can holiday right here in Western Australia. McGowan says statistics show West Australians spend more money on trips out of WA than other Australians do when they come into WA. I couldn\u2019t tell you the number of people I have met who have been all over the world, but never have really experienced the regions of Western Australia. This is their opportunity to spend their money at home and holiday at home. Western Australia premier Mark McGowan is giving his daily update now. He says the state has one new case from overseas, and one new case from a \u201chistorical case\u201d who contracted the virus in April but has now recovered. One new case is a woman in her 30s who has returned from overseas from the Middle East and she has been in quarantine since her arrival home, which was a few days ago. So in one of our hotels currently. Secondly, there is a historical case, a man in his 40s who got tested. He was in the Kimberley. He was cleared in Prince of Wales in April, but testing has shown that he was positive back at some point in time in the past, most likely back some time in April. Some breaking news from Melissa Davey. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has started court proceedings against the \u201chealing church\u201d that promoted a bleach solution as a cure for coronavirus. The US arm of the same church had written to Donald Trump just days before he also touted bleach as a cure. Shane Patton, the Victorian deputy police commissioner, has been announced as the state\u2019s new chief commissioner of police. Patton will start the role when the current chief commissioner, Graham Ashton, leaves in June. Premier Daniel Andrews praised Patton for \u201cgrassroots understanding\u201d, the \u201cpassion to improve this organisation\u201d, \u201ccommon sense [and a] very practical approach\u201d. And more from the former PM: Malcolm Turnbull is doing a live event with Crikey and the Mandarin \u2013 and has made some strong comments about Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the protests against police brutality and systemic racism in the US. Turnbull says Trump is a \u201cdeliberately divisive leader\u201d who \u201cseeks to divide\u201d the US or to \u201cexploit division\u201d that, he says, \u201cfar from making America great again, makes America weaker\u201d. It is terrifying, as someone who loves America, loves the values America represents at its best. [I] can only be appalled at what we\u2019re seeing at the moment. Turnbull blames the \u201crightwing populist ecosystem of which the Murdoch media is a bit part of that, it actually plays on that, that\u2019s their business model ... It\u2019s done, I believe, enormous damage.\u201d Turnbull accuses Trump of \u201creducing American participation in global leadership\u201d, saying that \u201cAmerica is less influential not least because it seeks to be less influential\u201d by pulling out of global organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the Paris treaty. History is written by those who turn up. Out of the room, out of the deal. Turnbull says America\u2019s lack of leadership has left room for China to gain greater influence. Thanks to Matilda Boseley for her work today. We\u2019ve already mentioned the loosening of restrictions that came into effect today in Victoria and Queensland. In NSW, restaurants, pubs and cafes will be able to seat up to 50 people, effective today. Museums, art galleries and zoos are also now able to open on NSW and Queensland. In NSW, beauty, tanning, nail and waxing venues will also be able to open, with a 10 person maximum. That\u2019s where I might leave you for this morning. My esteemed colleague Naaman Zhou will be here to guide you through the rest of this first wintery day. Frydenberg was asked if any of the construction stimulus funding would be directed towards the creation of social housing. Firstly, we recognise the states are partners with us in a number of housing projects and initiatives and we have already announced previous initiatives on social housing. What we do recognise is that there\u2019s a gap in the market here. So we will have more to say in due course. But what we\u2019re seeking to do is to get people to undertake construction activities, whether it\u2019s a new home or otherwise, that may have not otherwise been the case. And that\u2019s because the economy has taken a hit and they\u2019ve decided to stay on the sidelines. So what we\u2019re trying to do is to generate more activity at a time when the economy needs it and, of course, more activity means more jobs. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has confirmed that an announcement on stimulus spending in the construction industry is imminent. The housing sector, the construction industry, are vitally important to the Australian economy. There\u2019s more than a million Australians who are employed in construction. Dwelling investment is worth more than $100bn or around 5% of GDP to the economy. It\u2019s not just the sparkie and the plumber and the carpenter on the building site, it\u2019s also the timber mill, it\u2019s also the appliance manufacturer for the kitchen. It is all the supplier who helps with the materials who go into the bathroom. He said the government was \u201cworking on options\u201d for the arts sector. In terms of the arts sector, we also recognise that there is a need there for continued support and we are working on our options. But I also point out that many in the arts sector have been receiving the jobkeeper payment as well as the jobseeker payment. Scott Morrison has addressed the government-created debacle of charging unlawful robodebts, which culminated in the commonwealth agreeing on Friday to repay $721m. At a press conference in Sydney, Morrison said the government services minister, Stuart Robert, still has his full support, but expressed \u201cgreat regrets about any pain or injury caused here\u201d. We\u2019re putting this right. Let\u2019s be clear about what the change is here. The income average in principle is one that has been followed by Labor and Coalition governments for a very long period of time. Over the course of dealing with this issue, that principle was not something that could be relied upon. That doesn\u2019t mean those debts don\u2019t exist. It just means that they cannot be raised, solely, on the basis of using income averaging. I think what all Australians would agree that it\u2019s important that if there are overpayments of welfare or other things like that, then the government has to be diligent about taxpayers\u2019 funds and make sure that we are recover moneys where it\u2019s right to do so. But you\u2019ve got to do it in the lawful way and we will ensure to continue to do that with our projects going forward. This has been a very difficult project for many but the government is putting it right. Asked about the need for an apology, Morrison said that due to the legal proceedings, \u201cthe time for those sorts of statements are at another time\u201d. Asked about what he would say to a family who lost a loved one to suicide over robodebt, Morrison said: The government has great regrets about any pain or injury that has been caused here ... but as I said, those are issues we\u2019re still working through and we\u2019re making it right. Interestingly it appears the clock in this pub is still on daylight savings times - a relic of pre-covid days. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian also spoke at the press conference: This project will create 14,000 jobs in New South Wales \u2013 music to our ears. In April we lost 21,000 jobs in New South Wales. We also know that there are so many other of our fellow citizens on jobkeeper. We know we have a job ahead of us of getting people into working, into sustainable jobs. Having those direct and indirect jobs is fantastic, especially through the partnership of the federal government ... We\u2019re able to start acceleration of the project this year. As we know, New South Wales has been supporting the federal government efforts in building this project to service a metropolis. It will not only service the airport, but so many people who will call this place home or will come to the airport for work. Scott Morrison is speaking in Sydney now. The prime minister has announced the federal government will invest $1.75bn to build a metro train line to Syndey\u2019s second airport. We are getting projects happening now because that\u2019s the job making agenda that Australia needs, that New South Wales needs, and that estern Sydney needs. We couldn\u2019t hope for a better partner in our job-making program than the New South Wales government. The NSW and federal government will split the funding for this project 50/50. The prime minister says this additional investment will allow the project to stay on track, allowing the metro line to open when the new western Sydney airport does. When it rains it pours, when it comes to Covid-19 case number announcements. NSW has just released its daily numbers and three more people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. This brings the state\u2019s total to 3,098. No one infected with Covid-19 currently requires a ventilator in the state, but there is one person still in intensive care. Today the health department has provided this breakdown of how all the states cases were acquired. Overseas: 1,793 Interstate acquired: 72 Locally acquired \u2013 contact of a confirmed case and/or in a known cluster: 865 Locally acquired \u2013 contact not identified: 368 Under investigation: 0 Total: 3,098 Palaszczuk, who is in Cairns this morning, is urging Queensland residents to travel around the state as a way to boost the tourism industry while the state borders remain shut. I\u2019m encouraging Queenslanders to get out of the house, to get into their car and to book accommodation somewhere in Queensland that you haven\u2019t been before... There is so much to explore. I don\u2019t know where to begin. But Queenslanders, hop on the internet, do the searches and make sure you explore all that Queensland has to offer. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is speaking to media now. She says there have been no new cases overnight. Victoria has just released its daily case numbers, an increase of four since yesterday. One is linked to the outbreak at quarantine hotel Rydges on Swanston in Melbourne, bringing this cluster to a total of eight cases. A Department of Health spokesperson said in a statement: Thorough cleaning of relevant parts of the hotel has been undertaken, alongside contact tracing, isolation and quarantine of close contacts. A full investigation is underway to review all possible causes of transmission within the hotel, including looking into links between affected staff and contractors. Of the other three cases, one was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine and two were from community testing. The department said there were no new cases linked to any other known outbreaks, including the Keilor Downs family or any aged care facilities. And some news from the other side of the bubble: New Zealand\u2019s new opposition leader, Todd Muller, is calling on the government to explain to Kiwis why the country remains at level two alert after nine days of no new cases. \u201cKiwis have made enormous sacrifices to flatten the curve, but if their efforts still aren\u2019t enough to move to Level 1 then the Government must explain why,\u201d Muller said in a statement. \u201cIt has been more than a week since the last confirmed case of Covid-19. There are fewer cases now than there was before any restrictions were put in place.\u201d Muller accused the government of sending \u201cmixed messages\u201d and said the coalition partners weren\u2019t aligned \u2013 a reference to comments by the deputy PM, Winston Peters, urging a downgrade to level one immediately: Businesses on the brink of closure have been left in limbo too long. It\u2019s time for the Government to be clear about what conditions need to be met for the move to Level 1. Level 1 should mean businesses can return to full capacity, transport networks can resume without constraints, marriages can be properly celebrated and loved ones can be appropriately mourned. The sooner small businesses know what Level 1 will look like, the easier it will be for the backbone of our economy to start repairing itself. Some good news from South Australia: all the homes damaged by summer\u2019s devastating bushfires have now been cleared of debris. More than 450 properties can now undergo repair or reconstruction work, reports AAP. About 25,000 tonnes of waste and debris has been removed from the affected areas including Kangaroo Island, parts of the Adelaide Hills, York Peninsula and the south-east, with the $12.9m cost shared by the state and federal governments. \u201cCleaning up after a bushfire can be a very emotional time and we wanted to make sure there was one less thing to worry about so we committed to clear sites to allow the affected communities to begin rebuilding at no cost to homeowners,\u201d said the federal drought and emergency management minister, David Littleproud. On Kangaroo Island, the scene of the largest fires that burnt through more than 200,000 hectares, 220 properties were cleared, while in the Adelaide Hills, 227 properties were impacted. Continued from the previous post: Morrison \u2013 who has faced calls for months to help the arts and entertainment sector \u2013 said one of the challenges for the sector was to get capital moving again because it had to draw down on it so significantly during the crisis. The government was looking at \u201cgetting those sectors of the economy moving again as soon as they can\u201d. He explained that the government was shifting focus from the big, economy-wide schemes to support particular sectors that needed extra help. So we\u2019ve gone from the big, big, broad strokes of jobkeeper and jobseeker, but as time goes on, we\u2019ll be able to narrow it in and focus more on those sectors which need that longer term support. The government has been resisting calls to expand eligibility for the jobkeeper wage subsidy after revelations it would cost $60bn less than initially forecast. Morrison will be in western Sydney later this morning to announce that the government will fast-track funding for the Sydney metro western Sydney airport rail link. The Morrison government is planning to roll out a fourth round of economic stimulus, hinting it could include cash grants for home renovations and support for the struggling art and entertainment sector. Scott Morrison said the government was looking at ways to help the residential building sector because of predictions of a drop-off in construction activity in the last months of 2020. In an interview with 2GB, the prime minister was asked about a report in the Australian newspaper that the government was considering a housing stimulus package that would extend grants to include home renovations as a way to help tradespeople weather the slowdown. According to the report, limits or conditions may be placed around the types of renovations that could be covered by the scheme. Morrison said the government was not yet ready to announce the details of the plan, but the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, had been \u201cdoing some good work with some of the states as well who are interested in working on those issues\u201d. While saying he wanted to ensure local contractors got work through renovation projects, Morrison indicated the government was \u201cmore interested in larger projects and new home builds and things like that\u201d: And we\u2019ve been looking closely at the entertainment industry as well. I was having some good discussions with people in the entertainment industry on the weekend about what we can be doing there more specifically. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has started federal court proceedings against the Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing after it advertised a solution containing bleach as a cure for Covid-19. My colleague Melissa Davey reported on this company last month after it was fined more than $150,000 for multiple allegedly unlawful advertising offences. At that time the company was ordered to remove the advertising in question. It did not and, as a result, the TGA is seeking to obtain a court injunction restraining the company and its director, Charles Barton, from advertising or supplying the \u201ccure\u201d. This news could have some serious implications for Australian media, who could be held responsible legally for the comments others make on their social media pages. The former Northern Territory youth detainee Dylan Voller, whose mistreatment in Don Dale youth detention centre prompted a royal commission into youth detention, pursued defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, Nationwide News and Sky News for comments left by readers in the Facebook comments sections of articles relating to him. The media sites involved include the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian, Sky News, The Bolt Report and the Centralian Advocate. It looks as though Australia might be hanging with the big dogs again this year. Scott Morrison has told Sydney radio station 2GB that Donald Trump is keen for Australia to attend the G7 summit. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting an invitation there,\u201d he said. Morrison attended last year\u2019s G7 meeting as a guest of the French president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity to deal with a lot of like-minded countries,\u201d the prime minister said. The G7 is made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the UK. The NSW decision to reopen poker machines has been criticised by the NSW Council for Social Service, Wesley Mission and the Alliance for Gambling Reform. The groups say they \u201chave major concerns for a lack of preparation by the NSW Government to manage the risks associated with people being exposed to gambling again after a nine-week enforced break\u201d. Other states have opted to keep the pokies closed for another month. \u201cNCOSS remains extremely concerned about the harmful impact this form of gambling causes to individuals and the broader community, especially at such a vulnerable time,\u201d said the council\u2018s chief executive, Joanna Quilty: This decision to reopen poker machines is not a solution to addressing concerns around social isolation, it is a recipe for disaster and our members will no doubt be left to pick up the pieces. Guardian Australia has spent the past week examining aspects of the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus, investigating problems with jobkeeper, the childcare support package, and the potential economic impact of the sudden cessation of stimulus. The Australian government has handed major pathology companies lucrative Covid-19 contracts through limited tenders, shielded their closed collection centres from takeover, provided large subsidy increases after industry lobbying, waived normal registration fees and promised to provide additional assistance outside jobkeeper. This report comes from Christopher Knaus: Queensland is also gearing up for more intrastate travel. Queenslanders can now holiday anywhere in the state, but, much to the disappointment of NSW, outsiders are still not allowed in. Several Queensland cities and towns, including the Gold Coast, are reliant on tourism from other states and territories, but the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has been steadfast that state borders will remain closed. This is in part due to the persistent low-level community transmission in Victoria and NSW. South Australia\u2019s premier, Steven Marshall, is encouraging residents to plan their next holiday inside the state. Notably, he is not asking any outsiders to join in, with mandatory 14-day quarantines still in place for anyone entering SA. Restriction have been relaxed in the state today. Venues can have up to 80 patrons, provided they are contained to groups of 20 in separate rooms or areas. Just on Scott Morrison\u2019s comments to 2GB earlier about the US riots. He said: \u201cAs upsetting and terrible that the murder that took place \u2013 and it is shocking, that also just made me cringe \u2013 I just think to myself how wonderful a country is Australia.\u201d Australia has its own history of institutional violence against vulnerable groups, as Lorena Allam reports. The family of David Dungay, an Aboriginal man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five prison guards in a Sydney jail, said they have been traumatised anew by the footage of US police killing George Floyd. Here\u2019s what Gladys Berejilklian told 2GB earlier. We\u2019re working through the list, and can I be so bold as to suggest that I will be saying something publicly about that this week. What we need to do is make sure everybody\u2019s safe, everybody reopens in a Covid-safe way and that\u2019s our mantra ... There\u2019s two things that we want to say something about in the near future and that\u2019s children\u2019s community sport, but also gyms and studios. I will say something about that in the very near future. Sydney fitness junkies rejoice, it seems there might be an announcement on gyms coming soon. Scott Morrison has told the Sydney radio station 2GB he does not believe violent protests in the US will bring change. The US has been gripped by violence, with protests boiling over after George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer, now charged with murder, knelt on his neck while he was under arrest. The Australian prime minister said the footage from the US was disturbing. \u201cI saw a good meme on the weekend \u2013 Martin Luther King didn\u2019t change anything by burning anything down or by looting any shops,\u201d he told 2GB on Monday. (King\u2019s quote, \u201cin the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard\u201d, has become a rallying cry in the US protests.) Morrison said video of the officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck was awful. \u201cAs upsetting and terrible that the murder that took place \u2013 and it is shocking, that also just made me cringe \u2013 I just think to myself how wonderful a country is Australia.\u201d He discouraged Australians from joining similar protests planned for later in the week. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia,\u201d he said. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has announced plans to establish a \u201cPacific humanitarian pathway\u201d to help combat global supply chain disruptions in the Oceanic region. Payne says this will help ensure the transportation of humanitarian and medical supplies within the Pacific during the pandemic. She said: As a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia is doing its part to operationalise the Pacific Humanitarian Pathway including through the implementation of protocols for freight and passengers that minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This aid will include $5.5m to the World Food Programme, including $4m going towards air transport and logistics services, the delivery of humanitarian and critical medical supplies, and assessments of the impact on food security. For once there might actually be a bigger story than Covid-19 today: the now-global protests against the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in the US. You can check out coverage of the protests here, including those within 100 metres of the White House: But make sure you hurry on back. We have a big day of Australia\u2019s coronavirus news ahead of us. Andrews didn\u2019t provide many details on the significant outbreak in Melbourne\u2019s north-west that has caused 100 school students to self-isolate after two schools had children test positive last week: I\u2019ll let the chief health officer provide a fuller update later on today. That\u2019s a serious outbreak. All outbreaks are serious. The important point to note is that the prime minister made this point, Brendan Murphy and myself, said that as we open up, we will see positive cases. That\u2019s why so much testing is important. And my message to your Victorian viewers this is morning \u2013 if you have even the mildest of symptoms, come forward and get tested. Speaking of Victoria, the premier, Daniel Andrews, is speaking to the ABC now, doubling down on his \u201cwork from home\u201d message: One of the biggest challenges that the chief health officer has identified is literally hundreds of thousands of people coming back to the office, pressing lift button, sharing bathrooms and kitchens. Not necessarily maintaining social distancing. And then, of course, there\u2019s the issue of how they get to work. If everyone tries to cram in on public transport, well, we won\u2019t have any social distancing maintained at all ... So if you have been working from home, you have to keep working from home. Now today is the first day Victorians will be allowed to enjoy a strong cup of coffee at their local cafes. If you are enjoying the first morning back out for breakfast, shoot me a photo on Twitter. Just on the NSW wage freeze, the president of the state\u2019s Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, told ABC that the $1,000 bonus wasn\u2019t acceptable. Our teachers in NSW have not received a pay increase since November 2018. We had finalised negotiations for pay in March and then our pay for teachers was struck with the wage cap. It\u2019s unacceptable. There is a bit of news to unpack from the papers today. The Daily Telegraph and Syndey Morning Herald are reporting that NSW public servants may get a one-off $1,000 stimulus payment after the government of the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, decided to freeze their pay for 12 months. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, called union leaders on Sunday night with the offer, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The wage freeze for 410,000 public sector workers is facing a tough battle to get through the upper house. The government wants to freeze pay rises to include the entire NSW public service and MPs, citing the economic hit brought on by the Covid-19 restrictions. The freeze would save about $3bn, which would be reinvested in public projects. Berejiklian has said public sector jobs would otherwise be at risk. She said frontline workers had received 2.5% annual pay rises since the Coalition took office in 2011. The Australian has reported the federal government is considering giving householders cash grants for home renovations under a multibillion-dollar stimulus package to boost the economy. The measure will be considered by a cabinet expenditure review committee meeting this week. But there would be limits on the type of renovations that could be undertaken under the plan, which could be worth up to $4bn. Matilda Boseley here to take you through the morning. The big thing to look out for today is that Australians will experience more freedom as much of the country enters a new phase of Covid-19 restrictions. The more flexible restrictions \u2013 which differ across the states \u2013 will mean more movement in public places, including pubs, cafes and restaurants. But authorities continue to urge the public to practise safe hygiene and social distancing measures. From midday, Queenslanders will be able to travel statewide, while pubs, clubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to seat up to 20 people. The state\u2019s strict border closure will remain in place. NSW pubs, beauty salons and museums reopen, and holiday travel inside state boundaries will also be permitted. In Victoria, libraries, galleries, museums, places of worship and beauty clinics are among the venues that will be allowed to reopen to no more than 20 people. In South Australia, venues can have up to 80 patrons, provided they are contained to groups of 20 in separate rooms or areas. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth says the lifting of restrictions is a balancing act between the socioeconomic benefit from their removal and the public health risk. He told reporters in Canberra on Sunday: We\u2019re taking a deliberately safe and cautious approach. Most importantly we\u2019re taking the time to gather the data over the coming weeks to determine whether it\u2019s safe to move to the next round of lifting restrictions. Almost 7,200 Australians have tested positive to Covid-19 with more than 1.45 million tests conducted. Some 478 virus cases remain active across the country, while the death toll sits at 103. More than 62% of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 cases have been acquired overseas since 22 January. A three-year-old child is one of three new cases in Western Australia, but all were in quarantine after returning from overseas, while one of the cases from the Al Kuwait livestock ship has been hospitalised. The ship has accounted for 20 of WA\u2019s 28 active cases.",

Besides coalition projects, Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks have tapped their email lists and social media to mobilize activists to join \u201cliberate\u201d demonstrations in more than 10 states including North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Michigan, with the latter attracting some gun-toting activists. Key groups in the SOC coalition, which has 200 members, have been funded by prominent billionaires, including some who have been active in the sprawling big-money network led by the oil and gas billionaire Charles Koch. Tea Party Patriots, for instance, received almost $2m in 2017 and 2018 from Richard Uihlein, whose net worth in early 2020 was almost $25bn according to public records. Charles Koch, whose net worth Forbes last month pegged at $46.5bn, has been an Alec funder. The Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, whose net worth in February was $6.5bn, has backed Job Creators Network which also belongs to the coalition. The coalition and some member groups have held strategy conference calls that include some wealthy donors and underscore White House ties. FreedomWorks and Brandon hosted one such call on May 21 with Vice-President Mike Pence and Moore. A GOP source who heard the call said Pence offered mostly familiar rhetoric about \u201crestoring American greatness\u201d and congratulated the call\u2019s \u201cdistinguished\u201d participants. In turn, Moore stressed FreedomWorks support for a payroll tax cut, an idea Trump has pushed but which has faced bipartisan Senate opposition in part because it mainly helps workers with jobs, and not the tens of millions newly unemployed. Jerry Taylor, who heads the non-partisan Niskanen Center and used to work at Alec leading a taskforce on energy and the environment, faults the coalition\u2019s economic and health analyses. \u201cThe political actors involved with these groups are united both in their hostility to mainstream science \u2013 which they consider a conspiratorial leftist plot to destroy free market capitalism \u2013 and their superficial understanding of economics. Fully reopening the economy will not produce an economic recovery until the coronavirus is contained and can stay contained,\u201d he said.",

Given how narrowly Trump won in 2016, a marginal dent in his support there could be enough to tilt some battleground states in Biden\u2019s favor.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said: \u201cOlder Americans know that Vice-President Biden will provide the strong and compassionate leadership our country needs in a moment of crisis like this, and they know that Biden will always fight to protect the entitlements they\u2019ve spent their entire lives working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Allies and aides to Trump have publicly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJUrban/status/1253344448953683970?s=20\">downplayed</a> concerns about his deficit with seniors. But the White House has also ramped up efforts to showcase how the administration is benefiting seniors.&nbsp;And in May, Vice-President Mike Pence delivered personal protective equipment to a nursing home in Orlando treating coronavirus cases.</p> <p>\u201cJust like every American, senior citizens saw what President Trump achieved for America during his first three years in office and they see the president leading the nation during the coronavirus response,\u201d said Sarah Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>Despite the uncertainty enveloping 2020, Nancy LeaMond, the executive vice-president and chief advocacy and engagement officer of the non-partisan AARP, expects older voters will once again play a decisive role in the presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to find a way to vote, even if they\u2019re afraid in the current pandemic,\u201d she said during an online briefing last week.</p> <p>LeaMond emphasized that seniors are \u201cnot a monolith\u201d, nor are they firmly aligned with a political party, noting that while older voters were essential to Trump\u2019s political success, they helped Democrats take control of the House in 2018.</p> <p>On the policy front, protecting entitlement programs like social security and Medicare were always priorities for older voters, and LeaMond said they are probably even more so amid the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a candidate, Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/11/us/politics/where-trump-breaks-with-the-republican-party.html\">emphatic</a> in his support for such programs, breaking with traditional Republican orthodoxy. But as president, Trump has at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/10/21131316/trump-2021-budget-entitlement-cuts\">various times </a>suggested openness to spending cuts \u2013&nbsp;comments the Biden campaign intends to highlight. The Trump campaign is, in turn, attempting to weaponize Biden\u2019s past comments on social security dating back to 1979.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even before the coronavirus upended the presidential election, Biden\u2019s strength with his agemates was a threat to Trump.&nbsp;During the primary, Biden&nbsp;won voters over 65 in every state contest except <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/vermont/democratic\">Vermont</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/new-hampshire/democratic\">New Hampshire</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats say older voters, who helped Biden secure the party\u2019s nomination, view him as an empathetic leader shaped by personal tragedy, and are drawn to his moderate politics and his emphasis on shared American values.</p> <p>But Trump, 73, has also sought to cast his 77-year-old opponent as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d, a doddering older man unfit for the presidency. As part of a recent advertising blitz, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign mocked Biden as \u201cold and out of&nbsp;it\u201d and \u201cgeriatric\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign believes this strategy could backfire. Some of Trump\u2019s top aides have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-divided-over-how-to-attack-biden-amid-worries-over-troubling-poll-numbers/2020/05/02/2dcf8740-8bf0-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html\">reportedly</a> warned allies that their aggressive attacks on Biden\u2019s mental fitness could further harm Trump\u2019s standing among senior citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Florida, a state with a significant retiree population, Biden has for months maintained an edge with the state\u2019s older voters, an electorate that now includes the president.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s electoral success likely depends on winning Florida, where he defeated Hillary Clinton by just over 1 percentage point in 2016. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/florida/president\">exit polls</a>, he carried voters 65 and older in the state by a 17-point margin.</p> <p>Democrats say many voters in the state are souring on the president. The coronavirus has hit elderly Floridians hard: more than <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/05/17/in-florida-83-percent-of-coronavirus-deaths-are-people-65-and-older/\">80%</a> of those who have died from coronavirus were older than 65, and more than 40% of them can be traced to long-term care facilities.</p> <p>\u201cSeniors have eyes and ears. They see and hear exactly what Donald Trump has done and are going to be holding him accountable,\u201d said Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic party. \u201cTrump has failed us as seniors and it is now our turn.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The Biden campaign is attempting to solidify this advantage, which pollsters say could fade as the dynamics of the virus shift. Last week, surrogates hosted a series of events in battleground states with seniors while Biden makes frequent appearances on local television stations, whose audience skew older.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfc2625d2bee9779537e07a19c2905d4af4b17ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfc2625d2bee9779537e07a19c2905d4af4b17ce/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump takes questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes in the Rose Garden of the White House on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump takes questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes at the White House on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaign organizers, along with state party officials, have also been conducting \u201cwellness checks\u201d on older voters during the pandemic.

And in May, Vice-President Mike Pence delivered personal protective equipment to a nursing home in Orlando treating coronavirus cases. \u201cJust like every American, senior citizens saw what President Trump achieved for America during his first three years in office and they see the president leading the nation during the coronavirus response,\u201d said Sarah Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign. Despite the uncertainty enveloping 2020, Nancy LeaMond, the executive vice-president and chief advocacy and engagement officer of the non-partisan AARP, expects older voters will once again play a decisive role in the presidential election. \u201cThey\u2019re going to find a way to vote, even if they\u2019re afraid in the current pandemic,\u201d she said during an online briefing last week. LeaMond emphasized that seniors are \u201cnot a monolith\u201d, nor are they firmly aligned with a political party, noting that while older voters were essential to Trump\u2019s political success, they helped Democrats take control of the House in 2018. On the policy front, protecting entitlement programs like social security and Medicare were always priorities for older voters, and LeaMond said they are probably even more so amid the pandemic. As a candidate, Trump was emphatic in his support for such programs, breaking with traditional Republican orthodoxy. But as president, Trump has at various times suggested openness to spending cuts \u2013 comments the Biden campaign intends to highlight. The Trump campaign is, in turn, attempting to weaponize Biden\u2019s past comments on social security dating back to 1979. Even before the coronavirus upended the presidential election, Biden\u2019s strength with his agemates was a threat to Trump. During the primary, Biden won voters over 65 in every state contest except Vermont and New Hampshire. Democrats say older voters, who helped Biden secure the party\u2019s nomination, view him as an empathetic leader shaped by personal tragedy, and are drawn to his moderate politics and his emphasis on shared American values. But Trump, 73, has also sought to cast his 77-year-old opponent as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d, a doddering older man unfit for the presidency. As part of a recent advertising blitz, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign mocked Biden as \u201cold and out of it\u201d and \u201cgeriatric\u201d. Biden\u2019s campaign believes this strategy could backfire. Some of Trump\u2019s top aides have reportedly warned allies that their aggressive attacks on Biden\u2019s mental fitness could further harm Trump\u2019s standing among senior citizens. In Florida, a state with a significant retiree population, Biden has for months maintained an edge with the state\u2019s older voters, an electorate that now includes the president. Trump\u2019s electoral success likely depends on winning Florida, where he defeated Hillary Clinton by just over 1 percentage point in 2016. According to exit polls, he carried voters 65 and older in the state by a 17-point margin. Democrats say many voters in the state are souring on the president. The coronavirus has hit elderly Floridians hard: more than 80% of those who have died from coronavirus were older than 65, and more than 40% of them can be traced to long-term care facilities. \u201cSeniors have eyes and ears. They see and hear exactly what Donald Trump has done and are going to be holding him accountable,\u201d said Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic party. \u201cTrump has failed us as seniors and it is now our turn.\u201d The Biden campaign is attempting to solidify this advantage, which pollsters say could fade as the dynamics of the virus shift. Last week, surrogates hosted a series of events in battleground states with seniors while Biden makes frequent appearances on local television stations, whose audience skew older. Campaign organizers, along with state party officials, have also been conducting \u201cwellness checks\u201d on older voters during the pandemic. On the calls, they help seniors connect with local services and encourage them to register to vote by mail. As the death toll continues to rise, the economy spirals and social unrest spreads across the country, Trump\u2019s critics say the disillusionment of seniors with his presidency will be hard to reverse. . \u201cOlder voters have a great deal of experience with presidents and how they handle crises,\u201d said Gary Mitchell, president of the Wisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re seeing right now is a huge disappointment.\u201d Mitchell noted that the coronavirus has claimed more American lives than were lost in the Korean war and the Vietnam war combined. For the veterans of those conflicts, and the many more whose lives were shaped by them, the scale of loss in such a short period of time is hard to grasp, he said, especially as more is revealed about what could have been done to save American lives. \u201cIt\u2019s just a huge trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more people learn, the more and more angry and disappointed they are.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A deceptive calm has fallen over Dhaka. In this densely populated city of 21 million, the main roads are empty, the sounds of horns have disappeared and the polluted sky has cleared. But social distancing within our neighbourhoods is an illusion. We are all packed into the same bazaars and homes. Bangladesh began its lockdown on 26 March, on independence day, when many people were outside Dhaka to celebrate with family in their villages. The first few days were quiet as we all tried to stop the spread of Covid-19. Even the rickshaw drivers vacated the streets. But after a week they had to return to work. They have been busy, replacing cars and buses to transport people around their neighbourhoods. Day labourers remain outside, looking for work so they can feed their families. Many of them came to Dhaka from the countryside and have to send money to their villages. They cannot afford to stay at home during this lockdown. When I travel the city by bicycle or in autorickshaws, which are reserved for emergency services and journalists, I see the poorest people having to continue their daily lives; meanwhile the wealthy are comfortable, and office workers are able to stay at home and survive on their savings. I live in Mirpur, an area in northern Dhaka, which is full of low and middle-income families. People wait on the sides of the roads. I ask them why, and they say they are just waiting for someone to help them. The government has offered some support, but cannot reach everyone, so many rely on the goodwill of other residents and groups. Mirpur is home to many of Dhaka\u2019s garment factories, which have begun reopening. The workers walk long distances to get to the factories, or crowd on to trucks because no safe transport has been provided. As they leave the factories, workers tell me not much has changed apart from more hand-washing routines and some precautions, but it is hard to keep physical distance when there are thousands of workers in the factories. I keep my distance when I talk to them, worried about infecting myself and others while I take my photos. I am used to being close to everyone, physically, and through the connections I make with my subjects. Now I view my city through a telephoto lens. I miss capturing the detail in people\u2019s faces. Everyone is wearing masks; only their eyes are visible but without expression. The first few cases of the virus were reported in early March; at the time of writing, the death toll in Bangladesh stands at 582, with 42,844 infected. A friend lost his father to the coronavirus last week and now he, his wife and his three-year-old child are infected. Every time I return home from a trip outside, I cannot help but panic over the following few days, worried about whether I have been infected or am spreading the virus. Everyone in this city is worried. Even people living on the street wear some kind of mask. The government has announced that from 31 May there will be a limited easing of the lockdown, though it is far from certain that Covid-19 is under control. Nevertheless, this pandemic has given us the time to look at ourselves and decide what is important. It allows us to reflect upon what kind of civilisation we have made and what we have done to nature. We cannot live well in isolation \u2013 the world is connected as never before. Our priority should be to live by helping others and to fight together against the crises we face, whether this pandemic or climate change.",

      "body": "<p>The prime minister announced on Thursday that groups of up to six people could meet outdoors in England from Monday, permitting what he described as \u201ca long-awaited and joyful moment\u201d as family and friends reunite after 10 weeks in lockdown. He set out the next stage in the easing of restrictions with a caveat that \u201cthere may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/1267419302799593472\">police have published updated instructions</a> on what is now permitted under the updated public health regulations setting out the restrictions on gatherings and overnight stays away from home. The government has also published an <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/558/regulation/2/made\">updated version</a> of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) regulations. </p> <h2>Can I see my family and friends?</h2> <p>Yes. Whereas people in England were previously allowed to meet one person from another household outside while maintaining a two-metre distance, from Monday, groups of up to six will be allowed to meet. People will be permitted to congregate in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, instead of just in public spaces, as Johnson said \u201cthere is no difference in the health risk\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister said people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession, \u201cso that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus\u201d.</p> <p>The government also announced that from Monday, the 2.2 million people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors for the first time in 10 weeks. They will be able to go outside with members of their household while continuing to follow physical distancing guidelines. Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household.</p> <p>Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks.</p> <p>In Scotland, people from one household will be able to meet with another household outdoors in public spaces or a private garden from Friday, providing they maintain physical distancing. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the maximum number of people in a group should be eight.</p> <p>The approach in Wales is similar. People in a household will be able to meet with one other household outdoors from Monday. In Northern Ireland, groups of six are already allowed to meet outdoors. The Stormont executive plans to confirm the further easing of lockdown regulations after a meeting on 4 June but it is expected to allow small outdoor wedding ceremonies, attended by no more than 10 people.</p> <h2>Does that mean we can have a barbecue?</h2> <p>Yes. \u201cYou can even have a barbecue providing you do it in a socially distanced way, provided everybody washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense,\u201d said the prime minister. . The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, added that those having a barbecue should remember they can spread the virus by passing things from one person to another.</p> <h2>Can we go into other people\u2019s homes?</h2> <p>Yes and no. The UK government has said the science makes it clear the chances of spreading coronavirus is much smaller outside so socialising inside is not allowed.</p> <p>However, the prime minister said people could go through houses to access back gardens. Whitty also confirmed it was acceptable for people to use their host\u2019s toilet, as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards.</p> <p>The Welsh government has also said it is OK for people to walk through someone\u2019s home to get to their garden but they would be publishing guidance on how to do this safely.</p> <p>In Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cIf the distance [from your own home] is so far that you would have to use someone else\u2019s bathroom, then perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d</p> <h2>How far can we travel?</h2> <p>While people in England can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, they cannot stay over at people\u2019s houses. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to go to other households and stay there. I\u2019m afraid we are not at that stage,\u201d said Johnson.</p> <p>In Wales people are being asked to stay local, which is defined as about 8km (five miles) from their homes. Sturgeon said there would be no legal limit on how far people in Scotland could travel but she said the strong advice was to stay within five miles.</p> <h2>Can I do non-essential shopping?</h2> <p>Yes. Outdoor retail such as markets and car showrooms in England will be allowed to open in England from Monday. Other non-essential shops can open a fortnight later, as long as they abide by the guidelines.</p> <p>In Scotland, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open from Friday. The Welsh government will decide whether non-essential retail will reopen at their next lockdown review on 18 June, though they said such businesses, which could comply with the physical distancing duty, should prepare to reopen.</p> <h2>Can children go to school?</h2> <p>The UK government confirmed it was pushing ahead with plans to open primary schools in England to some pupils from Monday, giving headteachers three days of half-term&nbsp;holiday to make final preparations. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. However, some local authorities have insisted schools in their area will not be opening.</p> <p>In Scotland, teachers can return to schools from Monday to prepare for&nbsp;the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will do a mixture of at-home and in-school learning. The governments in Wales and Northern Ireland have said schools will not reopen on Monday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister announced on Thursday that groups of up to six people could meet outdoors in England from Monday, permitting what he described as \u201ca long-awaited and joyful moment\u201d as family and friends reunite after 10 weeks in lockdown. He set out the next stage in the easing of restrictions with a caveat that \u201cthere may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules\u201d. The police have published updated instructions on what is now permitted under the updated public health regulations setting out the restrictions on gatherings and overnight stays away from home. The government has also published an updated version of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) regulations. Can I see my family and friends? Yes. Whereas people in England were previously allowed to meet one person from another household outside while maintaining a two-metre distance, from Monday, groups of up to six will be allowed to meet. People will be permitted to congregate in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, instead of just in public spaces, as Johnson said \u201cthere is no difference in the health risk\u201d. The prime minister said people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession, \u201cso that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus\u201d. The government also announced that from Monday, the 2.2 million people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors for the first time in 10 weeks. They will be able to go outside with members of their household while continuing to follow physical distancing guidelines. Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household. Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks. In Scotland, people from one household will be able to meet with another household outdoors in public spaces or a private garden from Friday, providing they maintain physical distancing. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the maximum number of people in a group should be eight. The approach in Wales is similar. People in a household will be able to meet with one other household outdoors from Monday. In Northern Ireland, groups of six are already allowed to meet outdoors. The Stormont executive plans to confirm the further easing of lockdown regulations after a meeting on 4 June but it is expected to allow small outdoor wedding ceremonies, attended by no more than 10 people. Does that mean we can have a barbecue? Yes. \u201cYou can even have a barbecue providing you do it in a socially distanced way, provided everybody washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense,\u201d said the prime minister. . The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, added that those having a barbecue should remember they can spread the virus by passing things from one person to another. Can we go into other people\u2019s homes? Yes and no. The UK government has said the science makes it clear the chances of spreading coronavirus is much smaller outside so socialising inside is not allowed. However, the prime minister said people could go through houses to access back gardens. Whitty also confirmed it was acceptable for people to use their host\u2019s toilet, as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards. The Welsh government has also said it is OK for people to walk through someone\u2019s home to get to their garden but they would be publishing guidance on how to do this safely. In Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cIf the distance [from your own home] is so far that you would have to use someone else\u2019s bathroom, then perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d How far can we travel? While people in England can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, they cannot stay over at people\u2019s houses. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to go to other households and stay there. I\u2019m afraid we are not at that stage,\u201d said Johnson. In Wales people are being asked to stay local, which is defined as about 8km (five miles) from their homes. Sturgeon said there would be no legal limit on how far people in Scotland could travel but she said the strong advice was to stay within five miles. Can I do non-essential shopping? Yes. Outdoor retail such as markets and car showrooms in England will be allowed to open in England from Monday. Other non-essential shops can open a fortnight later, as long as they abide by the guidelines. In Scotland, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open from Friday. The Welsh government will decide whether non-essential retail will reopen at their next lockdown review on 18 June, though they said such businesses, which could comply with the physical distancing duty, should prepare to reopen. Can children go to school? The UK government confirmed it was pushing ahead with plans to open primary schools in England to some pupils from Monday, giving headteachers three days of half-term holiday to make final preparations. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. However, some local authorities have insisted schools in their area will not be opening. In Scotland, teachers can return to schools from Monday to prepare for the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will do a mixture of at-home and in-school learning. The governments in Wales and Northern Ireland have said schools will not reopen on Monday.",

Today, the streets of Minneapolis vibrate with energies drawn from the same source.

Unable to bear the prospect of militant black self-determination, the US government recommitted to brutal crackdowns and surveillance, taking on an openly colonial function in relation to black communities. In resisting the solution of autonomous black life, they fated future generations to an increasingly chaotic struggle between true and false freedoms. We live in this mess.</p> <p>We are experiencing overlapping outrages: co-morbidities associated with poverty make black people more vulnerable to Covid, and the vigilante-style policing associated with a white supremacist state makes black people more vulnerable to violence. Class and race. In their time, the Black Panther party drew links between police brutality and other forms of oppression \u2013&nbsp;their famous 10-point program included a demand for \u201ccompletely free healthcare for all black and oppressed people\u201d. Had the US government let them flourish, the Panthers might have been able to make headway with a long-overdue process of healing.&nbsp;</p> <p>But white supremacy has a kind of helpless automatism to it, as if its practitioners cannot distinguish between pursuit and escape. The decision to respond to black liberation struggles with renewed violence back then is what has landed the country in the midst of yet another rolling wave of uprisings now. These high crises of white supremacy are destined to return again and again, with greater stakes each time, until black people are given the space to liberate themselves. Until then, black American life is stalked by the direct violence that killed George Floyd, the systemic violence that has left so many vulnerable to disease, and the juridical violence experienced by Jalil Muntaqim.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hannah Black is an artist and writer</p></li> </ul>",

Until divestment from policing becomes more widespread, the entire political system continues to be at the mercy of racist shock troops. Jalil Muntaqim\u2019s past as a former Black Panther member makes him a target of state brutality. His life is the product of a struggle that flowered from deep roots in black American experience to dazzle the world in the 1960s and 70s. Today, the streets of Minneapolis vibrate with energies drawn from the same source. Chants of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d echo back to the murder of Eric Garner in New York in 2014, and to Muntaqim\u2019s sickbed. In its heyday, the Black Panther party pursued a thoughtful program of community support from legal observation to free health clinics for the oppressed. Unable to bear the prospect of militant black self-determination, the US government recommitted to brutal crackdowns and surveillance, taking on an openly colonial function in relation to black communities. In resisting the solution of autonomous black life, they fated future generations to an increasingly chaotic struggle between true and false freedoms. We live in this mess. We are experiencing overlapping outrages: co-morbidities associated with poverty make black people more vulnerable to Covid, and the vigilante-style policing associated with a white supremacist state makes black people more vulnerable to violence. Class and race. In their time, the Black Panther party drew links between police brutality and other forms of oppression \u2013 their famous 10-point program included a demand for \u201ccompletely free healthcare for all black and oppressed people\u201d. Had the US government let them flourish, the Panthers might have been able to make headway with a long-overdue process of healing. But white supremacy has a kind of helpless automatism to it, as if its practitioners cannot distinguish between pursuit and escape. The decision to respond to black liberation struggles with renewed violence back then is what has landed the country in the midst of yet another rolling wave of uprisings now. These high crises of white supremacy are destined to return again and again, with greater stakes each time, until black people are given the space to liberate themselves. Until then, black American life is stalked by the direct violence that killed George Floyd, the systemic violence that has left so many vulnerable to disease, and the juridical violence experienced by Jalil Muntaqim.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Elias Visontay and it\u2019s Monday 1 June. NSW and Victoria record new cases as restrictions eased As restaurants and cafes across NSW welcomed up to 50 diners at any given time on Monday, three additional Covid-19 cases were recorded, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,098. In Victoria, authorities announced a further four cases of Covid-19 on Monday, as it also loosened lockdown restrictions. Victorians are now able to dine out at restaurants with up to 20 patrons at the same time. This explainer outlines current restrictions around the country in greater depth. Scott Morrison targets construction projects as stimulus The federal government has opened the door to providing cash grants for home renovations as part of a new round of economic stimulus aimed at propping up Australia\u2019s construction sector. The government has also hinted it is looking at helping the struggling arts and entertainment sector, which has been pleading for assistance for months because many workers have missed out on the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper wage subsidy. It is understood the support for home renovations is on the table \u2013 but the bigger focus of the forthcoming package is likely to be new construction and larger-scale work. It comes as the prime minister joined NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian in Sydney on Monday to announce $1.75bn in federal government funding for a metro line to the future airport at Badgerys Creek in the city\u2019s west. NRL announces review into screening process of cardboard cut-out fans as Matthew Johns apologises for Hitler stunt Fox Sports and former NRL player Matthew Johns have apologised for a comedy sketch where they used the NRL\u2019s new cardboard cut-outs to put the face of Adolf Hitler into the crowd. As stadiums are empty, the league has launched an initiative where fans can pay $22 to send in photos and have a cardboard cut-out of themselves sit in the stands. However, multiple people have taken advantage of the scheme to submit childish and offensive jokes. Over the weekend, a photo of English serial killer Dr Harold Shipman was spotted in the stands \u2013 among other potential \u201cjoke\u201d cutouts \u2013 during the match between Newcastle and Penrith. Johns then aired a sketch on Fox Sports which showed a cut-out of Hitler in the stands \u2013 though this did not actually happen. Another japester made headlines on Friday for submitting a photo of Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummins, who did appear on TV screens. The NRL has now announced it will review the screening process for the cardboard cut-outs, to deter other people abusing the process for a cheap laugh. Drug watchdog takes church to court over Covid-19 bleach cure Australia\u2019s drug regulator has started court proceedings against a \u201chealing church\u201d that promoted a solution containing industrial bleach as a cure for coronavirus, after the church failed to remove advertisements promoting the product from its website. It comes after the Therapeutic Goods Administration fined the Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing more than $150,000 in May for selling and promoting the solution containing sodium chlorite, a chemical used as a textile bleaching agent and disinfectant. The product is named Miracle Mineral Supplement and Miracle Mineral Solution on the church\u2019s MMS Australia website, which claimed it could prevent and treat a range of diseases including Covid-19. The TGA said the company had breached multiple advertising laws. Rugby Australia cuts one-third of its staff as part of \u2018incredibly difficult\u2019 restructure Rugby Australia laid off 47 of its 142 fulltime staff on Monday morning, as it implements \u201cphase one\u201d of a restructure that will save the code $5.5m per year. The cuts, which will also see 30 contractors and casual workers axed, comes after Rugby Australia reported a $9.4m loss in 2019. All senior staff who remain with Rugby Australia will have their salary reduced by 5%. In a statement released on Monday, Rugby Australia noted \u201cover 75% of Rugby Australia\u2019s workforce has been stood down, or on significantly reduced hours since April 1, while senior executive staff have continued to work on a fulltime basis with salary reductions of at least 30% since that date.\u201d Rugby Australia interim chief executive Rob Clarke said \u201ctoday was an incredibly difficult day for the organisation\u201d. Coalition gave private pathology companies lucrative Covid-19 contracts The Australian government handed major pathology companies lucrative Covid-19 contracts through limited tenders, shielded their closed collection centres from takeover, provided large subsidy increases after industry lobbying, waived normal registration fees and promised to provide additional assistance outside jobkeeper. Guardian Australia has spent the past week examining aspects of the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus, investigating problems with jobkeeper, the childcare support package, and the potential economic impact of the sudden cessation of stimulus. A critical part of the government\u2019s response was aimed at helping the highly concentrated and influential private pathology sector.

      "bodyText": "This blog is closing now, but our round-the-clock coverage continues here: California\u2019s Department of Human Resources has just issued a directive that all state buildings \u201cwith offices in downtown city areas\u201d must be closed on Monday, a sweeping order that covers everything from Department of Motor Vehicles offices to those that license workers and provide health care, the Associated Press reports. \u201cAfter consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,\u201d said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general\u2019s offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. \u201cStaff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,\u201d the memo said. Here\u2019s footage of the moment last night when some of the White House\u2019s exterior lights were shut off, providing symbolism some have found hard to resist. The news that Donald Trump spent part of Friday evening in the presidential bunker, as protesters massed near to the White House, is getting a lot of traction online. #BunkerBoy is the leading trend on Twitter in the United States and in the top five in Australia. We\u2019ve already reported how China\u2019s state media is using these protests as an opportunity to goad Donald Trump and deflect from its own government\u2019s treatment of Hong Kong and protesters in the city. Iran is also getting in on the act. Its foreign ministry spokesman has just given this press conference that observers are saying is the first he\u2019s ever given in English, in which he directly addresses American protesters with messages of support. His government doesn\u2019t deem Iranians worthy of the same support, if last November\u2019s nationwide protests are any indication. Security forces used teargas, live ammunition and other repressive measures to crush those demonstrations, which also involved riots and destruction of banks and state buildings. Estimates of how many were killed range from 304, according to Amnesty International, to about 1,500 according to Reuters. The Iranian government has not released its own figure. George Floyd\u2019s killing has led to a global pouring of outrage and solidarity with protesters in the US. That has included four solidarity rallies in New Zealand, a large demonstration in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square and protests in Berlin and Copenhagen. Demands for justice also featured in this weekend\u2019s Bundesliga, the German football championship. Floyd\u2019s visage also now features on a part of the former Berlin Wall, along with some of his last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. We\u2019ve pulled those threads together into this story, just published: A striking detail from tonight\u2019s coverage has been reports that as protesters surged towards the White House on Friday night, US president Donald Trump, his wife Melania and son Barron briefly retreated to the Presidential Emergency Operations Centre \u2013 a fortified bunker-like structure beneath the residence. The last time a US head of state was publicly known to have used the bunker was on 11 September, 2001, where senior members of the George W Bush administration spent that day after their west wing offices were evacuated. There are no other public reports of presidents needing to use the area since - the New York Times, which first reported this detail, says \u201cit has not been used much, if at all\u201d since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But it notes the area has since been strengthened to withstand the impact of a passenger jet. The White House has declined to comment on the reports. My colleague Julian Borger in Washington DC has just filed this update on a tense evening the capital. Multiple fires broke out near the White House late on Sunday evening, as angry protesters gathered in Washington DC for the third night in a row following the death of George Floyd. Sunday evening\u2019s protests in front of the White House started relatively cheerfully, with a crowd of a few thousand in Lafayette park. Earlier in the day, demonstrators had marched through the city\u2019s downtown, chanting \u201cGeorge Floyd! Say his name!\u201d and \u201cNo Justice! No Peace!\u201d But as the 11 pm curfew approached, tensions between protesters and police mounted. Demonstrators faced off against a line of a few hundred police supported by national guardsmen. The lights illuminating the north side of the White House, which had provided the backdrop to the face off between protesters and police, were turned off. In normal times, they are only ever turned off when a president dies. Inside it was reported that Donald Trump, his wife, Melania and son Barron, had been taken down to the White House bunker at the height of the protests and then brought back up as the crowds dispersed. When 11pm came, the police line in front of the White House advanced with tear gas rounds across Lafayette park clearing out the protesters, with intermittent sprints. Read the full story here: Hello, it\u2019s just past 3am on the east coast and midnight on the west coast and the US is reeling from the sixth successive night of protests and riots following the killing of George Floyd. I\u2019ll be steering you through the next hours of our coverage. Those just checking in might have missed this frightening scene from a Minneapolis freeway earlier today, where a tanker truck appeared to charge at full speed into a throng of protesters. Nobody was injured but the driver did seek medical assistance, according to local authorities. Police in the city have now named the driver as Bogdan Vechirko, and he\u2019s been arrested. Many of the reporters on the ground are heading for some rest as the unrest quietens down for now. It\u2019s the middle of the night in the US, where cities continue to reel under protest and violence and where Black Lives Matter leaders say president Donald Trump, has failed his country. This report from David Smith in Washington: For three years, the first president elected without political or military experience rode his luck and skirted past disaster. In the fourth year, the fates demanded payback. Not even Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for four centuries of slavery, segregation, police brutality and racial injustice. But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came. Read Smith\u2019s full report here. Cities across the US saw further unrest on Sunday as protests against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis raged on. On the sixth day of demonstrations since Floyd\u2019s death, many throughout the nation defied curfews amid rising anger and frustration at the repeated failure of America\u2019s policing system. More than 4,000 protestors have been Fires burned in Washington DC, including near the White House. As the 11pm curfew passed, an area of a few blocks around the White House was thick with smoke. Donald Trump was taken into a special secure bunker as protests sparked by the death of George Floyd raged outside the White House on Friday night, according to reports. Despite days of peaceful protests and violent clashes with police in some of America\u2019s major cities, Trump has not addressed the nation and has repeatedly sent inflammatory messages over Twitter. Few defied the curfew in Minneapolis, where the main gathering place remained the street where Floyd was arrested and killed on Monday, now a memorial filled with flowers. Police had cleared protesters from the site with force last night. In the Twin Cities, thousands of people who had gathered on the Interstate 35 west bridge were forced off a semi-truck drove into the crowd. No protestors appear to have been injured by the \u201cdisturbing\u201d incident, officials said. New York descended into chaos once again, as thousands of demonstrators spread throughout the city, and at one point briefly shut down the Manhattan bridge. Protestors thew trash at the police and officers responded by beating crowds back with batons and making arrests. New York Mayor\u2019s Bill de Blasio\u2019s 25-year-old daughter was one of the demonstrators who was arrested this weekend. As outlets reported the news, a New York City police union tweeted personal information about Chiara de Blasio\u2019s arrest. Throughout the country, police responded use tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and batons against demonstrators and press. Officers fired \u201cbeanbag rounds\u201d at protestors in Austin, and in Denver police reportedly hit a Denver Post reporter with multiple nonlethal rounds despite him screaming \u201cpress\u201d. Los Angeles county, the largest county in the US, has announced a regional curfew to go from 6pm to 6am, as a number of protests continue across southern California. Business owners and residents spent Sunday morning cleaning up after Saturday night\u2019s explosive demonstration, with many merchants putting up \u201cminority-owned\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs on the boarded-up storefronts Trump tweeted that \u201cThe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\u201d The president has blamed the violence during this week\u2019s protests on Antifa and leftwing organizations despite the fact that it is unclear who is responsible for the looting. The Guardian\u2019s team in London will continue live coverage of the protests. As news outlets reported that New York City mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s 25-year-old daughter had been arrested at a protest last night, a New York city police union tweeted personal information about Chiara de Blasio\u2019s arrest. Gizmodo reporter Dell Cameron reported on the tweet from the Sergeant\u2019s Benevolent Association, calling it a \u201cdoxing.\u201d \u201cHow can the NYPD protect the city from rioting anarchist [sic] when the mayors object throwing daughter is one of them. Now we know why he is forbidding Mounted Units to be mobilized and keeping the NYPD from doing their jobs,\u201d the tweet read. It appears that Twitter subsequently removed the tweet, Cameron and other reporters noted, although comment from Twitter was not immediately available. A fourth night of chaotic protests in New York City New York descended into chaos once again today, as the fourth night of demonstrations raged on. The demonstrations have been characterized by turbulent confrontations between police and protestors, with officers arresting hundreds though the weekend. Mayor Bill deBlasio\u2019s daughter Chiara deBlasio, 25, was among the those arrested on Saturday night, news outlets reported on Sunday night, as the New York police union tweeted personal information about the mayor\u2019s daughter\u2019s arrest. In Union Square, flames rose two stories high, according to reporters at the scene. In Lower Manhattan, shops including a Duane Reade drugstore were looted. Thousands of demonstrators spread throughout the city, and at one point briefly shut down the Manhattan bridge. Protestors thew trash at the police, and officers responded by beating crowds back with batons and making more arrests. NYPD officers have been widely criticized for using excessive force in response to protestors throughout the weekend. Earlier in the day, the protests began with people kneeling at various spots across the city. Demonstrators held moments of silence in honor of George Floyd and even filmed a few officers joining in. How US newspapers have covered the George Floyd protests What does American coverage of the George Floyd protests look like to people in the rest of the world? My Guardian colleague Alison Rourke looks at the front pages of US newspapers over the past few days: Austin, Texas: Police firing \u2018beanbag rounds\u2019 at protesters ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman is covering protests in Austin tonight. She tweeted that she can see an officer firing beanbag rounds at protesters, and that he is \u201csmiling.\u201d Earlier today, the Austin Police Association tweeted about why the city\u2019s police were using beanbag rounds against protesters: \u2018Major show of force\u2019 outside police headquarters in Denver Reporters on the scene in Denver, Colorado are describing a \u201cmajor show of force\u201d as more than a thousand protesters defied the city\u2019s curfew and continued to march towards the city\u2019s police headquarters. Journalist Alex Burness of the Denver Post was hit with multiple nonlethal rounds despite screaming \u201cpress,\u201d a New York Times reporter covering the protest with him tweeted. Burness called it \u201cdefinitely the most violent single moment I\u2019ve covered over these four days\u201d and a \u201cMajor show of force by cops outside Denver PD headquarters.\u201d \u201cDenver feels like a rolling street battle right now,\u201d another reporter on scene tweeted less than twenty minutes ago. Chinese officials and state media have seized on news of the protests sweeping the US, comparing the widespread unrest to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and accusing Washington of hypocrisy, my colleague Helen Davidson reports. Read the full story here: Tens of thousands reportedly protest in solidarity in New Zealand George Floyd solidarity protests are being held in Auckland, New Zealand, with some estimating that tens of thousands of people are in attendance. Four other solidarity vigils are planned in other parts of the country. All this and a tiger on the loose? Amid the tension and fear and constant breaking news tonight, a local sheriff\u2019s department in Oakland, California tweeted an advisory: there were reports of \u201ca tiger on the loose\u201d. Just minutes later, the Alameda County sheriff tweeted an update: Oakland\u2019s Knowland Park Zoo had checked, and \u201ctigers are all accounted for\u201d. The rumor had not just circulated on Twitter: an Oakland Police Department dispatcher had asked, \u201cif we have an actual tiger walking around on the streets right now\u201d, journalist Darwin BondGraham reported. A tense night in Washington DC As the 11pm curfew passed, an area of a few blocks around the White House was thick with smoke. A fire was started in the basement of St John\u2019s Church, which since 1816 has been the \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d. Every president from James Madison on has worshipped there. The DC Fire Service got there quickly and are reported to have put it out. Around the corner, however, a few protesters smashed the plate glass window front of the AFL-CIO Union federation headquarters and someone started a fire in the lobby. A couple of bystanders tried to dissuade them, shouting that the \u201cunions are on our side\u201d but to no avail. Fifty yards away, on I St, a car was still burning. As the curfew arrived, the lights illuminating the north side of the White House, which provided the backdrop to the face off between protesters and police, were turned off, leaving police floodlights the only source of illumination. At the same time, the police line in front of the White House advanced with tear gas rounds across Lafayette Park clearing out the protesters, with intermittent sprints. There were two reports of journalists being hit with batons and non-lethal rounds. In Georgetown the old money neighbourhood to the west of the White House, there was looting and some gunshots reported. Residents were told to stay inside. DC National Guard reportedly recalled The Army Secretary recalled the entire DC National Guard to help with the response to protests in the nation\u2019s capital, according to two Defense Department officials. More from the AP: Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday that she had requested 500 DC Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman roughly 1,200 soldiers to report. The officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. \u2018Church of the Presidents\u2019 catches fire The basement of the \u201cChurch of the Presidents,\u201d located opposite the White House in Washington, briefly caught fire this evening, before firefighters rushed to put it out. Guardian editor Julian Borger notes presidents have come to worship there since it was built in 1816. New York attorney general to journalist: \u2018please report\u2019 police violence As tense protests continue in New York, Wall Street Journal reporter there tweeted that New York City police officers \u201chit me in the face multiple times with riot shields and pushed me to the ground\u201d even though \u201cI was backing away as requested, with my hands up.\u201d New York state\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, responded on Twitter: \u201cPlease report this to my office.\u201d James, who was first elected as attorney general in 2018, is known for taking bold progressive stances, including launching an investigation into the finances of the National Rifle Association. Few defy curfew in Minneapolis It\u2019s been very slow going getting around Minneapolis this evening. All the main highways have been closed and a lot of side streets are shut off by makeshift barricades. Police are blocking a lot of junctions. There are few people around defying the curfew. The main gathering place remains the street where George Floyd was arrested on Monday, now a memorial filled with flowers. Police cleared protesters from the site with force last night, but it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019d do the same this time around. As unrest over state violence towards black Americans roils the country, protesters have torn down one confederate statue in Birmingham, Alabama, and defaced another confederate monument. The statue torn down appeared to be of Charles Linn, one of the founders of Birmingham, who served in the Confederate Navy during the Civil War. NBC Washington has striking footage from the nation\u2019s capital: Police arrested the New York City mayor\u2019s 25-year-old daughter at a protest in Manhattan on Saturday night, the New York Post first reported, citing law enforcement sources. Chiara de Blasio \u201cwas one of about 100 people who refused to leave the roadway when advised by police,\u201d ABC7 New York reported. She did not tell police that she was the mayor\u2019s daughter, but she did give her home address as the address of the governor\u2019s mansion, the Post reported. In his political campaigns, de Blasio has spoken out about raising black children in America: he is white, and his wife, Chirlane McCray, is black. Things are getting tense outside the White House as an 11 o\u2019clock curfew approaches. The protest this evening started out relatively cheerfully with a crowd of a few thousand in Lafayette Park, the public gardens just in front of the White House. But as the night progressed, protesters faced off against a line of a few hundred police. You could just see the camouflage uniforms of the National Guard behind the police line. Then a few firecrackers were hurled from the crowd and the police responded with a couple of rounds of tear gas and rapid advance towards the protesters. People scattered and fires were set in the surrounding streets. A car was set on fire on I Street and a few men ran along the road swinging baseball bats at every car they came across. A hundred yards from the White House, a small knot of protesters fired three projectiles at the AFLCIO Union headquarters breaking plate glass windows. Major protests over police killings of black Americans continue across the United States tonight, even as many cities imposed curfews and called in the National Guard to suppress the continuing unrest. Some updates from the Associated Press and reporters on the ground: In Washington, DC, protesters in front of the White House set road signs on fire. Live footage on CNN showed police officers in New York city forcefully trying to clear a large protests. Protesters tweeted images of intense scenes. In Portland, Maine, in the whitest state in the US, a racially diverse crowd of about 300 people blocked traffic and vandalized police headquarters. In Philadelphia, police used tear gas on crowds. Police vehicles were set on fire. A city official said that several police officers were injured, some hit with bricks. In San Diego, police officers fired tear gas to disperse a crowd. Demonstrations in the city had started early in the day. A small group of protesters later pelted officers with rocks and bottles, officials said. In Detroit, Michigan, police fired tear gas on protesters who remained outside the police headquarters just 45 minutes after the city\u2019s 8 pm curfew. A major interstate highway through downtown Seattle, Washington was closed Sunday afternoon because of protest activity. In Boston, Massachusetts, which has a reputation among black Americans as one of the country\u2019s most racist cities, thousands marched peacefully Sunday afternoon, but police said on Sunday night that some people were throwing bricks, rocks and bottles at them. The thousands of people who had gathered on the Interstate 35 west bridge were forced off after the incident earlier this evening, when a semi-truck drove into the crowd. Police warned demonstrators that the city\u2019s curfew was approaching and large numbers left. But a minority remained and initially faced down the police on a ramp off the bridge. As they moved down the street they were pursued by the police, including by officers on bikes in gas masks. The police fired tear gas and surrounded the dwindling group. After trapping the crowd in a parking lot of an auto store, the police ordered protesters to lie on the ground while they were arrested. There was far less resistance than on previous evenings, and the group facing down the police was much smaller as it dwindled to fewer than 100 people. Scenes from across the country on Sunday evening After police violence in New York on Saturday, signs of more restraint In perhaps the biggest and most organized march yet, thousands of New Yorkers made their way from the Grand Army Plaza and Barclay\u2019s Center in Brooklyn down Flatbush Avenue, the main artery of the borough that feeds into the Manhattan bridge. In an unprecedented shutdown of the road, people on bicycles and on foot held signs and chanted while approaching the foot of the bridge, where they were met with multiple NYPD squads. The crowd included many families. Fatima, a Brooklyn resident who came with her husband and toddler. \u201cI\u2019m tired of posting social media -- I got a black husband, a black son. I\u2019m tired of them killing us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the civil rights movement and it\u2019s 2020.\u201d Some people noticed that the police had a markedly different approach to the crowds than on Saturday evening, when police cars were seen driving into groups of protesters, and police were pushing people to the ground. Most officers seemed to be holding steady to keep people out of the traffic. As of 9 pm, I didn\u2019t see any significant altercations, tear gas or any other methods. In a joint interview on CNN, the families of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd addressed the ongoing protests and the growing frustration over police brutality across the country. \u201cIt really breaks my heart that it\u2019s come to this, but I truly understand where protesters are coming from\u201d Wanda Cooper, Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s mother, told Don Lemon. \u201cBlack lives are being lost, and they\u2019re being lost for no reason.\u201d \u201cPeople are killing black men and women,\u201d Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, echoed. Philonise Floyd questioned why several officers who were present when George was killed haven\u2019t been arrested. \u201cMy brother\u2019s in the morgue, and some of these police officers are at home,\u201d he said. \u201cI want justice now. My brother deserves it.\u201d As protests sparked by the death of George Floyd raged outside the White House on Friday night, Donald Trump was taken into a special secure bunker, the New York Times reported. Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis on Monday, has sparked unrest and protests in dozens of cities across the US, including Washington DC. Demonstrators have gathered outside the White House since Friday night, with clashes erupting intermittently outside the very perimeter of the White House. As protesters converged on the White House on Friday, the \u201cSecret Service agents abruptly rushed the president to the underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks,\u201d the Times reported. Hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the White House, the bunker is the same one that sheltered vice president Dick Cheney during the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. \u201cThe president and his family were rattled by their experience on Friday night, according to several advisers,\u201d the Times report said. Trump has been widely criticized for his response to the protests that have rocked the nation since video of Floyd\u2019s death began spreading on social media. Despite days of peaceful protests and violent clashes with police in some of America\u2019s major cities, Trump has not addressed the nation and has repeatedly sent inflammatory messages over Twitter. Late on Friday, Trump tweeted that protesters could have been attacked with \u201cvicious dogs and ominous weapons\u201d wielded by the US Secret Service and accused the DC mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House. \u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d the president continued, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d The president has spoken to George Floyd\u2019s grieving family, but according to Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, the conversation was brief. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to even speak,\u201d Floyd told MSNBC . Joe Biden posted a photograph of himself today at the site of protests last night in Wilmington, Delaware, and said that he will lead \u201cthis conversation,\u201d but that also \u201cI will listen.\u201d Earlier today, the New York Times\u2019 Astead Herndon highlighted the challenge Biden faces, as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, in speaking to the deep pain, grief, and exhaustion that Black Americans are feeling in this moment. \u201cInterviews with activists and leading Democratic figures including Stacey Abrams of Georgia, the longtime civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, and Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, flipped [the] typical framework: If Democrats want people to vote, party leaders need to listen to why people are angry,\u201d Herndon wrote. \u201cInterviews with activists and leading Democratic figures including Stacey Abrams of Georgia, the longtime civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, and Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, flipped [the] typical framework: If Democrats want people to vote, party leaders need to listen to why people are angry,\u201d Herndon wrote. In Oakland, a \u2018car caravan\u2019 protest more than four miles long Cars stretched more than four miles down the streets of Oakland on Sunday, as protestors participated in a peaceful caravan to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other victims of police violence. The caravan marked the third day of protests in Oakland, sparked by the killing of Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota last week. Demonstrators invoked the names of many killed by police violence, including Floyd and Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her apartment in March, in Louisville, Kentucky. Demonstrations got heated in Oakland on Friday and Saturday after police used tear gas on protestors and stores were vandalized. But protestors in the caravan on Sunday stressed the peaceful nature of their protest, which was organized by local non-profit the Anti-Police Terror Project. \u201cWe are here to make a peaceful statement and let it be known that this cannot go on,\u201d said Ayana, a protestor holding a sign that said \u2018silence = death\u2019 and who declined to use her last name. \u201cWe have been dealing with these injustices for years and years,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to sit behind a screen or say things on our phone, but we want to be on the forefront of change, even if it\u2019s just holding up a sign, justice must be served.\u201d Organizers encouraged attendees to stay inside their cars or stand six feet apart from each other to stop the spread of coronavirus. Participants could tune into local radio station 88.1 or a Facebook livestream to listen to music and driving instructions throughout the event, which went on for more than three hours. The caravan traveled through West Oakland into Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, located near the harbor of Oakland, where cars turned around. Cars were covered in posters with slogans like \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and the names of people killed by police in recent years. Ayana and her sister Nadja drove to Oakland from Vallejo, about 20 miles away, to participate in the car caravan. They got out of their cars to walk after being stuck in the long line of cars for quite a while, said Nadja. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be looting, we don\u2019t want to be tearing up things, we want to make this as peaceful as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are walking and showing our message right now.\u201d The caravan wrapped through the bay-side park, turning around before continuing through Oakland several miles to the freeway entrance, where some protestors on foot faced off with California Highway Patrol before dispersing. Semitrailer driving through protesters on bridge \u2018appeared deliberate\u2019 The Associated Press has an update on the footage of a semi-truck driving at high speed through a crowd of protesters demonstrating on a highway bridge in Minneapolis: Officials in Minnesota say no protesters appear to have been hit after a semitrailer drove into a crowd demonstrating on a freeway near downtown Minneapolis. But the Minnesota State Patrol said in a tweet that the action appeared deliberate. The patrol says the driver was injured and taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. It wasn\u2019t clear how the driver was hurt. TV footage showed protesters swarming the truck, and then law enforcement quickly moving in. On Twitter, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety called the truck driver\u2019s actions \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and said that he was \u201cinciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators.\u201d Chicago to block major streets with sanitation trucks, suspend transit Chicago city officials are taking extraordinary steps Sunday to patrol and restrict access to the city\u2019s downtown after a night of tense protests, the Associated Press reports: Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who had already ordered an indefinite nightly 9 p.m. curfew, said only essential workers would be allowed into the central business district, city trains and bus service would be suspended, major streets would be blocked with city sanitation trucks and Chicago River drawbridges allowing pedestrians and vehicles into downtown would remain lifted. Some protesters questioned certain restrictions, saying Lightfoot\u2019s late Saturday curfew didn\u2019t allow enough time to safely exit downtown because many streets were blocked and public transportation had been restricted. The American Civil Liberties of Union of Illinois said an indefinite curfew raised \u201cserious constitutional questions that need to be remedied\u201d and said it was considering taking legal action. Oakland protests continue with socially distant \u2018car caravan\u2019 Longtime Oakland activists organized a \u201ccar caravan\u201d this afternoon to demonstrate for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Steven Taylor, while maintaining social distancing. According to local reporters covering the protest, hundreds or even thousands of cars are now winding through downtown Oakland, honking constantly. The sound is echoing across the city. I can hear it through my open window as I update this live blog. The socially distant protest was organized by the Anti Police-Terror Project. Los Angeles, the largest county in the US, has just announced a regional curfew to go from 6pm to 6am, as a number of protests continue across southern California. The order impacts 10m residents and comes one day after the mayor of LA adopted a citywide curfew and brought in the state National Guard to assist with its response to demonstrations. Protests on Sunday have continued to attract large police responses in Santa Monica, Long Beach, Huntington Beach and other LA cities. Police deployed teargas, beanbags, batons and rubber bullets during the Saturday protests, and the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) arrested roughly 400 people. On Melrose avenue, one of the main strips where some property damage occurred later in the evening, business owners and residents were doing cleanups on Sunday, with many merchants putting up \u201cminority-owned\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs on the boarded-up storefronts. Police helicopters continued to circle above. Some impacted LA restaurants have expressed support for the protests, many of them forced to close shortly after they were allowed to reopen for indoor dining following months of Covid shutdowns. Civil rights groups and some community leaders have condemned LA officials for adopting strict curfews and deploying armed National Guard officers, with the ACLU of Southern California saying \u201cthese measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest and will lead to selective and biased enforcement and risk harassment of people who are unhoused\u201d. \u201cCombined with the aggressive show of military force ... these approaches repeat the very problems at the root of the protests,\u201d the ACLU said. More from Guardian correspondent Chris McGreal in Minneapolis: A semi-truck drove into a George Floyd demonstration of thousands of people on a bridge in Minneapolis, apparently without seriously injuring anyone. But two children are now missing. A large crowd had blocked the I-35 west interstate bridge when they spotted the fuel tanker coming around the curve at speed. The mass of people parted in panic and fled to the sides of the bridge as the truck ploughed through the crowd, coming very close to hitting several people. As the vehicle ground to a halt, the crowd surged back toward the driver and dragged him from his cab and beat him. He was taken to hospital. The police said he is now under arrest. It\u2019s not clear whether it was a deliberate act on the part of the driver or he was unaware that the bridge was closed. Organisers were appealing for help to find two children who were separated from their parents as people scattered. Curfew tonight in nation\u2019s capital Washington, DC will have a citywide curfew tonight, starting at 11 p.m. local time. The city\u2019s mayor also announced she is activating the National Guard to support the city\u2019s police force. The US capital is a city of stark racial inequalities. Nearly half of DC\u2019s population is Black. Shocking footage of semi-truck driving through protesters on bridge A local television station in Minneapolis is airing footage of a semi-truck attempting to drive through crowds of demonstrators on the Interstate 35W Bridge across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. The footage was captured by a news helicopter for WCCO, a CBS-affiliate station in Minnesota. While the story is still developing, the station is reporting initial details: WCCO\u2019s chopper appears to have gotten images of a semi-truck tanker attempting to drive through crowds on the Interstate 35W Bridge across the Mississippi River, before some report the driver being pulled from the cab. There were thousands of people on the bridge when it came through at what appeared to be top speeds. The driver, according to scanner traffic, has been taken to Hennepin County Medical Center. Watching the footage as it broadcast, the anchors narrating the footage sounded shaken: \u201cOh my gosh, the speed at which that truck approached, and even some of the brave people attempting to slow it down,\u201d one said. WCCO also reported that the crowd on the highway \u201chad been, up to that point, a peaceful protest\u201d and that it was \u201cwas part of a protest group marching against the death of George Floyd, and had taken position to take a knee on the bridge.\u201d All major roads into Minneapolis and St Paul have been shut for the night as authorities aim to quell the protests in the city over the last few days. The twin cities are also under curfew until Monday morning. As the country braces for another night of protests, Donald Trump tweets: The Atlanta mayor announced two police officers have been fired and three have been placed on desk duty after a review of body cam footage showing excessive use of fore during an incident at a protest on Saturday night. Atlanta police chief Erika Shields called the images \u201creally shocking to watch.\u201d Officials said the video, which circulated online, appears to show a group of police officers pulling a woman out of a car and using a stun gun on the man with her. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. Reporters at the scene at the time of the incident said the police also broke the glass on the car and flattened the tires. Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has spoken out on the killing of George Floyd, and offered a damning condemnation of the silence from others in his sport, including his fellow drivers. \u201cI see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white-dominated sport.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can\u2019t stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are, and I see you.\u201d Hamilton is the only black driver in Formula One and has been outspoken on the sport\u2019s need for greater diversity in the past. \u201cThere\u2019s barely any diversity in F1,\u201d Hamilton said in 2018. \u201cStill nothing\u2019s changed in 11 years I\u2019ve been here.\u201d The defending world champion also gave his thoughts on the ongoing protests in the US. \u201cI do not stand with those looting and burning buildings but those who are protesting peacefully,\u201d Hamilton wrote. \u201cThere can be no peace until our so-called leaders make change,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not just America, this is the UK, this is Spain, this is Italy and all over.\u201d \u201cThe way minorities are treated has to change, [and] how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.\u201d Outside the White House, where for the past two nights protests have turned violent, large crowds have gathered again today. Donald Trump has been inside all day \u2013 no sign yet of him pulling a Nixon and wandering out among the young and the disaffected, aides skittering after him, to take the mood of the times. (That was Saturday 9 May 1970, and you can read more about it here and here.) Here\u2019s the Associated Press report on today\u2019s gathering in Washington: Protests near the White House appear to be mostly peaceful on Sunday afternoon as thousands descended on the area to call for justice for George Floyd. Loud chants of \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d can be heard from the White House grounds, but officers from the Park Police and Secret Service were keeping them far back from the heavily fortified Executive Mansion. Beside the stepped-up law enforcement presence, the White House was unusually quiet for a Sunday as staffers were encouraged to keep away from the complex. \u201cDue to ongoing demonstrations, please avoid coming to the White House Complex today if it all possible,\u201d an email alert to staffers stated. Some of the pictures from Washington are striking indeed: The AP also reports that \u201cseveral hundred people marched through downtown Boston on Sunday, carrying signs and chanting in a peaceful protest \u2026 \u201cThey chanted, \u201cNo justice no peace,\u201d \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and silence is violence\u201d as they walked by City Hall, the State House and the Public Garden, with the crowd closing off a two-lane city street. There was a light police presence and no signs of the violence that has erupted in other cities in recent days. Arizona has taken an extraordinary step in the face of the continuing protests and imposed a statewide curfew for the rest of the week. It comes into force at 8pm local time on Sunday. \u201cThis gives law enforcement an additional tool to prevent the lawlessness we\u2019ve seen here and in cities nationwide. Police will be equipped to make arrests of individuals who are planning to riot, loot or cause damage and unrest,\u201d tweeted the state\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey. The Associated Press has the story of a Mississippi mayor who said earlier this week that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything unreasonable\u201d in the treatment of George Floyd before his death. The story in full: A white Mississippi mayor who caused an outrage with his tweets about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has apologized but says he won\u2019t resign, prompting protesters to return to City Hall for a third day on Sunday to insist the mayor leave office. Petal mayor Hal Marx told the Hattiesburg American his remarks on social media about Floyd\u2019s death, which occurred after a white police officer kneeled on his neck, \u201cwere made in haste and not well-thought out or expressed.\u201d \u201cI apologize to those who found them to be insensitive, and I apologize to the people of our city,\u201d Marx told the newspaper in an interview on Saturday. Still, the mayor said he plans to serve out his term that expires in July 2021. Roughly 200 people protested outside city hall on Sunday, the third straight day demonstrators have gathered to call for Marx\u2019s resignation, the Clarion Ledger reported. Petal\u2019s board of aldermen also agreed the mayor should step down. \u201cWhy in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?\u201d Marx tweeted on Tuesday, the day that four Minneapolis police officers were fired. Floyd, 46, was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck Monday. In a follow-up tweet, the Republican directly referenced the Floyd case, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything unreasonable\u201d. \u201cIf you can say you can\u2019t breathe, you\u2019re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn\u2019t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified.\u201d Marx told the newspaper that city aldermen and others had wrongly characterized the tweets as racist. \u201cI did not make racist comments,\u201d Marx said, \u201cand I have not mistreated anyone.\u201d Michael Jordan has released a statement on the death of George Floyd, calling out \u201cingrained racism\u201d in the United States. \u201cI am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,\u201d wrote Jordan in a statement posted by the Charlotte Hornets, the NBA team he owns. \u201cI stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough.\u201d Jordan has often been criticized for his reluctance to speak up on political matters, especially when compared to the activism of other NBA stars such as LeBron James and Guardian columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. During a 1990 Senate race in his home state of North Carolina, Jordan refused to endorse Democrat Harvey Gantt, an African American who was running against the incumbent Republican Jesse Helms, a notorious racist. Jordan, who at the time had already won the first of his five NBA MVP awards, explained away his refusal to take a stance by saying \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too\u201d. Jordan has since insisted the comment was made in jest. The six-time NBA champion, widely considered the greatest basketball player of all time, said on Sunday that Americans needed to work together to find answers to the country\u2019s problems. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn out backs on senseless brutality,\u201d he wrote. Curfews were in place in more than a dozen US cities on Sunday and Jordan urged people to protest peacefully. \u201cWe need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability,\u201d he wrote. Jordan finished his statement by expressing his sympathy to the family of Floyd and others. \u201cMy heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice,\u201d he wrote. The former Chicago Bulls star has been in the news lately due to the popularity of The Last Dance, a documentary telling the story of his final championship season. Several US cities and counties have brought forward their curfew times to try to prevent another night of violent protests over George Floyd\u2019s death. Here is a state-by-state look at the known curfews and timings in several areas worst affected on Friday and Saturday (all times local): Arizona: Statewide curfew from 8pm. Will be in place for next week. California: Los Angeles County 8pm-5.30am; San Francisco 8pm-5am. Colorado: Denver 8pm-5am. Florida: Miami 8pm-5am; Orange County 10pm-5am. Georgia: Atlanta 9pm-sunrise. Illinois: Chicago 9pm-6am. Kentucky: Louisville 9pm-6.30am. Michigan: Detroit 8pm-5am. Minnesota: Minneapolis/St Paul 8pm-6am. Ohio: Cincinnati 9pm-6am; Cleveland 12pm-6am; Columbus 10pm-6am; Dayton 7pm-6am. Oregon: Portland 8pm-6am. Pennsylvania: Philadelphia 6pm-6am; Pittsburgh 8.30pm-6am. South Carolina: Charleston 6pm-6am. Tennessee: Nashville 8pm-6am. Texas: Dallas 7pm-6am. Utah: Salt Lake City 8pm-6am. Virginia: Richmond 8pm to 6am. Wisconsin: Milwaukee 9pm-7am. YouTube star Jake Paul has denied he looted an Arizona mall on Saturday night. Video emerged on Sunday of Paul standing inside a looted mall. Paul, who has 20 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, said he had been protesting against the police killing of George Floyd in Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cTo be absolutely clear, neither I nor anyone in our group was engaged in any looting or vandalism,\u201d said the 23-year-old in a statement posted to Twitter. Paul could be seen wearing a mask and filming as the mall was looted. He added in an Instagram story that police had teargassed him and his companions during the protests. \u201cI do not condone violence, looting or breaking the law; however, I understand the anger and frustration that led to the destruction we witnessed, and while it\u2019s not the answer, it\u2019s important that people see it and collectively figure out how to move forward in a healthy way,\u201d he wrote. Paul, whose brother Logan is also a YouTube star, has been involved in a number of controversies in the past few years. In 2018, he was filmed using the n-word while rapping. He was also accused of anti-social behaviour and was the subject of a number of noise complaints after moving into a house in West Hollywood house. He later relocated to another area of Los Angeles after being sued by his landlords. More from Miranda Bryant on the policing of protests in New York City\u2026 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has hit out at Bill de Blasio, branding as \u201cunacceptable\u201d the New York City mayor\u2019s handling of an incident in which two police cars drove through a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn. The New York congresswoman spoke out after de Blasio defended the New York Police Department (NYPD) officers involved. Video footage shows dozens of protesters gathering in front of a police car in the road and throwing objects at it. Another police car pulls up and ploughs through the crowd. The other car lurches forward, pushing people to the floor. \u201c@NYCMayor your comments tonight were unacceptable,\u201d the influential Democrat tweeted to her 7m followers. \u201cAs mayor, this police department is under your leadership. This moment demands leadership &amp; accountability from each of us. Defending and making excuses for NYPD running SUVs into crowds was wrong. Make it right. De-escalate.\u201d She added: \u201cRunning SUVs in crowds of people should never, ever be normalized. No matter who does it, no matter why.\u201d The mayor has since said there will be a \u201cfull investigation\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t like what I saw one bit\u201d. However, he continued to blame protesters, saying that the situation \u201cwas created by a group of protesters blocking and surrounding a police vehicle\u201d. Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to aim criticism at Joe Biden, and Democrats in general. \u201cGet tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,\u201d wrote Trump. \u201cThese people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!\u201d In fact, several Democratic governors \u2013 such as Wisconsin\u2019s Tony Evers and Minnesota\u2019s Tim Walz \u2013 called in the national guard on Saturday. Trump also attempted to take credit for Walz\u2019s decision in another tweet on Sunday. \u201cLaw &amp; Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores,\u201d wrote the president. \u201cCall in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe? All Dems!\u201d Richard Luscombe has news on US attorney general Bill Barr... Echoing His Master\u2019s Voice, attorney general Bill Barr has weighed in on the unrest sweeping the US with a statement blaming \u201cAntifa and other similar groups\u201d. In a rare Sunday afternoon missive issued by the justice department, Barr reinforced Donald Trump\u2019s earlier assertions of outside influence, and claimed that \u201cviolent radical elements\u201d have hijacked peaceful protests. \u201cGroups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate, violent and extremist agenda,\u201d Barr wrote, without citing evidence. \u201cIt is time to stop watching the violence and to confront and stop it.\u201d He also suggested that the FBI and other law federal resources may be used to crack down on the violence. \u201cIt is the responsibility of state and local leaders to ensure that adequate law enforcement, including the National Guard where necessary, are deployed in the streets to reestablish law and order. We saw this finally happen in Minneapolis last night, and it worked,\u201d Barr wrote. \u201cFederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest and are engaged in violations of federal law.\u201d National guard will be on the streets of Los Angeles tonight, although they will be protecting businesses rather than patrolling alongside the LAPD. The LAPD\u2019s chief said 500 members of the guard will be on duty in LA tonight after close to 400 people were arrested in the city on Saturday night and Sunday morning. \u201cMy hope and prayer is that [the national guard\u2019s] tenure is short here,\u201d Michel Moore said. A curfew will be in place between 8pm tonight and 5am on Monday. On the east coast, Philadelphia\u2019s curfew has been moved forward from 8pm to 6pm. Dallas\u2019s curfew will start at 7pm. North Carolina Central men\u2019s basketball coach LeVelle Moton has said he has been disappointed by the failure of white coaches to speak out about the death of George Floyd. Moton, who is black, says that the top coaches, who are paid millions of dollars a year, profit from the black community but do little to protect it. \u201cThe reality is a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,\u201d Moton said on ESPN Radio\u2019s Sunday Morning. \u201cTheir grandkids\u2019 kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you so they have been able to benefit from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people [who are] the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they\u2019re silent.\u201d Moton said he felt a link with Floyd as he was confronted a gunpoint by police officers in 2005. \u201cI have a problem with [white coaches\u2019 silence] because it seems as if black lives matter to them whenever they can benefit from it or whenever they\u2019re getting them first downs, catching an alley-oop or shooting a [basket] or whatever,\u201d Moton said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time for humanity to speak up on behalf of the student athlete, it\u2019s silent, it\u2019s crickets. And my problem is if the murdering of black Americans is too risky of an issue for you to stand up as a leader, then who are they really playing for?\u201d Some high-profile white athletes, such as the No1 overall pick in this year\u2019s NFL draft, Joe Burrow, have spoken about the death of Floyd. He said that the \u201cblack community needs our help\u201d on Twitter. \u201cThey have been unheard for far too long,\u201d said Burrow, the Heisman Trophy winner from Louisiana State. \u201cOpen your ears, listen, and speak. This isn\u2019t politics. This is human rights.\u201d Beaches in Miami had been due to reopen following the Covid-19 lockdown on Monday but that will no longer happen after a weekend of unrest in Florida, and across the country. \u201cIf everything is calm today, then we can take a respite for tomorrow and then hopefully open up on Tuesday,\u201d Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Gimenez told WPLG-Channel 10. \u201cIt really all depends on what happens today, what happens tonight. My hope is, and I believe, that today and tonight will be calm and peaceful.\u201d The city will be under lockdown again on Sunday night but Florida congressman Shevrin Jones told the Miami Herald that he does not believe anger over the death of George Floyd will dissipate anytime soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to go away,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe are here. We\u2019re in it. The black community is tired. We\u2019re tired of talking. Everyone has been saying, let\u2019s come to the table but it hasn\u2019t resulted in anything.\u201d More than 200 people were arrested during protests in Texas on Saturday night, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds. As a result, the state\u2019s governor, Greg Abbott, has declared a state of disaster, which will allow federal agents to do the work of local police. \u201cEvery Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,\u201d Abbott said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHowever, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss.\u201d In San Francisco, the mayor confirmed the city will be under curfew from 8pm on Sunday after \u201csignificant damage to the city\u201d on Saturday night. \u201cIt is hard not to have a reaction [to George Floyd\u2019s death]. It is hard not to feel the pain,\u201d said London Breed in a press briefing on Sunday. \u201cAs mayor, it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m immune from the hurt and pain.\u201d However, she said that violence and looting \u201cis not something that we\u2019re going to tolerate\u201d. Meanwhile, Washington governor Jay Inslee has activated 200 members of the state\u2019s national guard to help law enforcement in Seattle. \u201cSaturday\u2019s disheartening events in Seattle \u2013 carried out by a smattering of the thousands of protesters on hand \u2013 will not deter the cause of justice. Hundreds of public servants and volunteers are already helping clean up the property damage done,\u201d Inslee said. Robert Reich believes Donald Trump\u2019s response in the week following George Floyd\u2019s death is a final abdication of his office. Here\u2019s an extract from his column: Trump is not governing. He\u2019s golfing, watching cable TV and tweeting. How has Trump responded to the widespread unrest following the murder in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for minutes as he was handcuffed on the ground? Trump called the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and threatened to have them shot. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d he tweeted, parroting a former Miami police chief whose words spurred race riots in the late 1960s. On Saturday, he gloated about \u201cthe most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons\u201d awaiting protesters outside the White House, should they ever break through Secret Service lines. Trump\u2019s response to the last three ghastly months of mounting disease and death has been just as heedless. Since claiming Covid-19 was a \u201cDemocratic hoax\u201d and muzzling public health officials, he has punted management of the coronavirus to the states. Governors have had to find ventilators to keep patients alive and protective equipment for hospital and other essential workers who lack it, often bidding against each other. They have had to decide how, when and where to reopen their economies. You can read the full article here: White House staff have been told to stay away from work on Sunday if they can. \u201cDue to ongoing demonstrations, please avoid coming to the White House Complex today if it all possible,\u201d read an email to staff. The Secret Service said that 60 of its members were injured during protests outside the White House on Saturday night but no members of the public breached the perimeter of the complex. The statement said 11 members of the service required hospital care for their injuries, none of which were life-threatening. The statement concluded by saying that \u201cthe Secret Service respects the right to assemble, and we ask that individuals do so peacefully.\u201d On Saturday, Donald Trump said that protesters would have been greeted by \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d if they had breached the White House fence on Friday night. Richard Luscombe has news about concern among leaders that the protests over the last few days may lead to a surge in cases of Covid-19. A growing number of governors, mayors and public health officials across the US are raising fears of a surge in coronavirus cases from escalating protests over the death of George Floyd. Images of demonstrators in close proximity, many without masks, in numerous cities have alarmed leaders to the point where some are pleading with those on the streets to protest \u201cthe right way\u201d to better protect themselves. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that we had mass gatherings on our streets when we just lifted a stay at home order and what that could mean for spikes in coronavirus cases later,\u201d Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington DC, said in a press conference on Sunday. Bowser said protests in her city, which has seen violence several days in a row at the White House and other areas, were a mixed bag. \u201cWhile I saw some people with masks last night, others didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw some people social distancing, other people were right on top of each other. So we don\u2019t want to compound this deadly virus and the impact it\u2019s had on our community.\u201d The message was echoed by Keisha Lance-Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who said she was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Covid-19 spreading, and that protests had distracted her from dealing with the pandemic. \u201cI realised that I hadn\u2019t looked at our coronavirus numbers in two days,\u201d she told Jake Tapper, host of CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cAnd that\u2019s frightening, because it\u2019s a pandemic, and people of color are getting hit harder.\u201d According to the Georgia department of health, more African Americans have contracted Covid-19 statewide than any other race. \u201cThe question is how do we do protesting safely?\u201d Dr Ashish Jha, director of the global health institute at Harvard\u2019s T H Chan school of public health told CNN. \u201cI think masks are a critical part of it.\u201d In New York, governor Andrew Cuomo reported 56 new coronavirus deaths statewide, the lowest number since 23 March. He did not express fears for a resurgence of the virus as a result of the protests, but figured the lockdown was a contributory factor for them. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence the unrest happens in the midst of a pandemic,\u201d Cuomo said at his daily press briefing. \u201cPeople have lost their jobs. They are isolated at home. People are stressed and worried. It is all of that.\u201d Meanwhile, Dr Theodore Long, who is leading New York City\u2019s contact tracing strategy, offered advice to demonstrators. \u201cWe strongly encourage anybody who is out in the protests to wear a mask, practice proper hand hygiene and to the extent possible, socially distance, though we know that\u2019s not always going to be feasible,\u201d he said. As Faulkner wrote and journalists in the US or writing about it never tire of repeating, \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d And lo, the protests, riots and fires across the US this weekend bring forth a fascinating report from the Associated Press, which notes that statues honoring the Confederacy, the slave power which lost the American civil war, which was fought between 1861 and 1865 but which remains a jagged dividing line in American society, have been among targets of protesters in cities across the South this weekend: As tense protests swelled across the country Saturday into Sunday morning, monuments in Virginia, the Carolinas and Mississippi were defaced. \u2026The words \u201cspiritual genocide,\u201d along with red handprints, were painted on the sides of a Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi campus Saturday, The Oxford Eagle reported. One person was arrested at the scene. \u2026In Charleston, South Carolina, protesters defaced a Confederate statue near The Battery, a historic area on the coastal city\u2019s southern tip. The base of the Confederate Defenders statue, erected in 1932, was spray-painted, including with the words \u201cBLM\u201d and \u201ctraitors,\u201d news outlets reported. It was later covered with tarp, photos show. \u2026But the state where the debate over Confederate monuments has perhaps attracted the most attention is Virginia, where a 2017 white nationalist rally over Charlottesville\u2019s proposed removal of such monuments turned deadly. In the coastal city of Norfolk, protesters climbed a Confederate monument and spray-painted graffiti on its base, according to photos posted by a Virginian-Pilot journalist. Norfolk is among the Virginia cities that have signaled intent to remove their Confederate monuments. In February, state lawmakers approved legislation that would give cities autonomy to do so. A commission in Richmond, the state capital and what was the capital of the Confederacy, recommended removing one of five Confederate statues along the city\u2019s famed Monument Avenue. Photos posted to social media late Saturday and early Sunday showed the bases of at least two statues those of Confederate generals Robert E Lee and JEB Stuart almost entirely covered in graffiti. Nearby, a fire burned for a time at the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group responsible for erecting many Confederate statues and fighting their removal. The building, too, was covered in graffiti, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Further to Donald Trump\u2019s tweets about \u201cdesignating Antifa as a terrorist organisation\u201d earlier \u2013 he didn\u2019t elaborate about how \u2013 the president has been complaining about \u201cthe Lamestream Media \u2026 doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy\u201d. Trump also says the \u201cfake news\u201d are \u201ctruly bad people with a sick agenda\u201d and adds: \u201cWe can easily work through them to GREATNESS!\u201d Trump regularly complains about press coverage of his administration and has regularly labelled the media as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d, a phrase with distinctly Stalinesque overtones. Here\u2019s a story from Michael Safi about incidents in which journalists covering the protests and violence this weekend have been targeted by police and crowds. A salient passage: More than 50 incidents of violence and harassment against media workers were reported on social media and in news outlets on Friday and Saturday, according to a Guardian tally. They included the blinding of Linda Tirado, a freelance photojournalist and activist who has contributed to the Guardian, who was hit in the eye with a nonlethal round while covering unrest in Minneapolis The Associated Press has news of the scene in Los Angeles after a long night of protests. Armed national guard soldiers patrolled the streets of Los Angeles on Sunday as the city began cleaning up after a night of violence that saw demonstrators clash repeatedly with officers, torch police vehicles and pillage businesses. A rare citywide curfew expired as dawn revealed broken shop windows, demolished security gates and graffiti along entire blocks. Firefighters mopped up hot spots from lingering fires while store owners swept up glass and boarded up broken windows to protect what\u2019s left of their inventories. Mayor Eric Garcetti said on Saturday he asked California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, for 500 to 700 members of the guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. Garcetti said the guard members who arrived early Sunday were summoned \u201cto support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city.\u201d Fire crews responded to dozens of blazes, and scores of businesses were damaged. One of the hardest-hit areas was around the Grove, a popular high-end outdoor mall west of downtown where hundreds of protesters swarmed the neighborhood, showering police with rocks and other objects and vandalizing shops. One officer suffered a fractured skull, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said. The Legal Rights Center and ACLU of Minnesota have released a statement expressing concern that the third-degree murder charge given to Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck before his death, is insufficient. The organisations say they have \u201cgrave concerns about the legal sufficiency of the criminal complaint charging ... Derek Chauvin with third degree murder in the death of George Floyd. The charging of third degree murder instead of first or second degree murder may prove to be legally defective and allow Chauvin to evade the punishment warranted for his actions. \u201cThe issuance of a potentially defective murder charge, combined with the delay by the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s office in charging Chauvin and the other involved officers, further strengthens and validates demands for appointment of a special prosecutor to handle charges arising from this tragic event and its aftermath. Both the LRC and ACLU-MN fully support and join these demands.\u201d On a more positive note, there have been non-violent interactions between police and demonstrators. A sheriff in Michigan on Saturday was welcomed with cheers as he gave a speech before joining demonstrators on a George Floyd protest. \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re here is to make sure you have a voice, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Chris Swanson. \u201cI want to make this a parade, not a protest.\u201d Swanson then joined the demonstrators after they chanted \u201cwalk with us\u201d at him. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has joined New York City mayor Bill De Blasio by refusing to condemn an incident captured on video in which two police cars drove into a crowd of protestors in Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge it on just what I saw on the video ... as I said from what I saw on the video, I think it\u2019s inexplicable but maybe there is an explanation and lets [remember] there\u2019s always two sides,\u201d he said. Cuomo added that \u201cpolice are in an impossible situation in many ways. But their behavior is everything.\u201d Cuomo said that, rather than using violence, people should vote out leaders they are not happy with. \u201cDemand that change and if government leaders won\u2019t do it, or can\u2019t do it, or don\u2019t know how to do it then you vote them out,\u201d Cuomo said. Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia will be under curfew on Sunday night. Atlanta and Chicago\u2019s curfew will start at 9pm and Philadelphia\u2019s at 8pm. Meanwhile Chicago will close down its central business district except for business owners and residents of the immediate area. \u201cThe City of Chicago today announced new precautionary measures to further ensure the health and safety of residents and the hundreds of peaceful protestors participating in rallies this Sunday,\u201d Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cAs part of these efforts, the city announced that multiple routes to the Central Business District will be temporarily reduced today following multiple public safety incidents and property damage that occurred overnight.\u201d One person was killed in central Chicago on Saturday night and there were also incidents of looting. Lightfoot said violence undermined the protests and such actions mean \u201cwe all lose by giving the very same forces of racist oppression we are fighting the false validation that they crave\u201d. Lightfoot also reminded residents of Chicago to wear face coverings while attending demonstrations. \u201cIt goes without saying that all this is occurring while we are still in a pandemic,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cSo, to those who do go out peacefully, please \u2013 for your safety and the safety of our communities \u2013 please wear face coverings and maintain safe social distancing while you are marching.\u201d More signs that protests against the death of George Floyd have extended beyond the US. In Germany\u2019s Bundeliga, French striker Marcus Thuram took a knee after scoring for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach against Union Berlin. Thuram\u2019s action was a nod to the former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started kneeling during the national anthem in 2016 to protest against racial injustice in the United States. \u201cHe [Thuram] cut to the chase,\u201d said the Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach manager, Marco Rose, after the match. \u201cHe took a stand against racism, one that we wholeheartedly support.\u201d Marcus Thuram is the son of the World-Cup winner Lilian, who has become one of the most eloquent and powerful voices to speak out against racism in football. English forward Jadon Sancho also unveiled a message reading \u201cJustice for George Floyd\u201d after scoring for Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. Here\u2019s Miranda Bryant again, with a look at what Maryland governor Larry Hogan told CNN\u2019s State of the Union earlier: Two weeks ago, like many states, Maryland was under a stay-at-home order. Now its Republican governor fears that gatherings across the country to protest the killing of George Floyd could lead to a rise in Covid-19 cases across the US. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets, is, it\u2019s not healthy,\u201d Hogan told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s about a 14-day incubation period. So, two weeks from now across America, we\u2019re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not. But we went from a stay-at-home order, most states in America had rules about no crowds of 10 or more, and now we\u2019re seeing thousands of people jammed in together in close proximity.\u201d On the subject of protests, Hogan, a popular Republican governor, said Donald Trump\u2019s comments \u2013 including describing protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and tweeting \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d \u2013 were \u201cnot helpful\u201d and \u201ccontinuing to escalate the rhetoric\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite of the message that should have been coming out of the White House.\u201d Maryland\u2019s biggest city saw serious rioting in 2015, over the death at the hands of police of Freddie Gray, who sustained fatal injuries in custody. Hogan said he would advise other state leaders to \u201cnot let the situation get out of control\u201d. \u201cOur theory was kind of peace through strength,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not let it escalate to violence, where crowds were overpowering police. But we separated the violent acts and the destructive acts from the peaceful protesting.\u201d Donald Trump has tweeted that \u201cThe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\u201d This continues the president\u2019s habit of blaming violence during this week\u2019s protests on Antifa and leftwing organisations despite the fact that it is unclear who is responsible for the looting and violence that has taken place at some demonstrations. It may be tough for Trump to follow up on his action anyway as Antifa is not a single entity but a loosely linked group of individuals and organisations. And, as the Washington Post reported last year, when two Republican senators moved to label Antifa as domestic terrorists, Trump\u2019s plan could have damaging effects: \u201cThe lack of a central governing system for antifa creates the risk of wrongly applying the label to all counterprotesters of white supremacists, according to the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that opposes anti-Semitism,\u201d according the Washington Post\u2019s report. \u201cThis kind of mislabeling, the ADL said, could cause police to violate the civil rights of peaceful activists.\u201d Minnesota, where George Floyd was killed last week and the scene of some of the country\u2019s largest protests, will have its curfew extended into Sunday evening. The state\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, said the curfew will start at 8pm on Sunday and continue until 6am Monday. \u201cWe are not done yet,\u201d the governor said. Minnesota\u2019s public safety commissioner, John Harrington, said that a \u201clarge number\u201d of arrests made during Saturday night\u2019s protests were due to weapons violations. \u201cWe took AR-15s off of people, we took guns off of people,\u201d Harrington said. Walz said that state computers had also been the subject of a cyberattack but it was unclear who was behind the attack. \u201cBefore our operation kicked off last night, a very sophisticated denial of service attack on all state computers was executed,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not somebody sitting in their basement.\u201d Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained his stance of blaming violence during the Minnesota protests on Antifa. \u201cCongratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night. The ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. He also blamed, with no evidence, \u201cradical Left Anarchists\u201d for the violence. Miranda Bryant has news from Minnesota on a possible investigation into some of the protesters\u2026 Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison has said there is evidence of \u201cvery suspicious behaviour\u201d among some protesters and called for an investigation into their motives. It comes after US attorney general William Barr claimed on Saturday that much of the protest violence was being driven by \u201cfar left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics\u201d and crossing state lines to do so. Ellison told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of videotape taken by demonstrators of people who are very suspicious, who really did start breaking windows, particularly at the AutoZone, and there have been other, you know, photographs and cars with, you know, no license plates, very suspicious behaviour. \u201cBut the real point is we do need to investigate it. Because you know the truth is nobody really knows. I\u2019ve talked to people who are demonstrating. Some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota, and they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is unclear at this point.\u201d He accused Barr and the president of trying to \u201cwalk back\u201d their involvement in policing in key states that existed under the Obama administration and said: \u201cThey have not brought a single pattern or practice lawsuit against a major municipality where there\u2019s systemic police abuses in America.\u201d Ellison added: \u201cThey have actually tried to walk back their involvement in key states where they existed under the Obama administration. They have not moved forward, when it comes to 21st-century policing which the Obama administration started.\u201d The federal government, he said, needs to forge \u201ca better relationship\u201d between cities and police departments, instead of making \u201cincendiary comments\u201d. \u201cWe need their help to be more constructive and less assigning, you know, blame on matters that, actually, we don\u2019t know the truth of yet.\u201d Ellison also said charges against ex-police officer Derek Chauvin could be amended to include higher charges for George Floyd\u2019s killing and that the three other officers involved are \u201cnot out of the woods\u201d. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. Ellison said officials were still \u201cearly in the process\u201d. He said he does not know what charges the three other officers might face, but that charges of aiding and abetting were \u201ca possibility\u201d. He said county attorney Mike Freeman was looking into the matter and that he expects to hear something in the \u201cnear future\u201d. Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, has apologised to journalists \u201ceverywhere\u201d after a number of arrests of members of the media covering the protests. \u201cI want to once again extend my deepest apologies, to the journalists who were once again in the middle of this situation were inadvertently, but nevertheless, detained, to them personally and in to the news organizations and to journalists everywhere,\u201d Walz said at a press conference on Sunday. Michael Safi has more on the targeting of journalists - by police and protesters - during the demonstrations over George Floyd\u2019s death: Journalists covering the protests and riots that have erupted in US cities after the killing of George Floyd have reported being shot at, teargassed and arrested, as well as being intimidated by crowds. More than 30 incidents of violence and harassment against media workers were reported on social media and in news outlets on Friday and Saturday, according to a tally the Guardian collated. They included the blinding of Linda Tirado, a freelance photojournalist and activist who has contributed to the Guardian, who was hit in the eye with a nonlethal round while covering unrest in Minneapolis; the arrest of the HuffPost US reporter Chris Mathias during protests in New York; and the shooting of the Swedish foreign correspondent Nina Svanberg, who was struck in the leg by several rubber bullets on Friday night. \u201cThey\u2019re sighting us in,\u201d a member of a CBS News crew was heard saying in another incident in Minneapolis on Saturday, as police fired rubber bullets at the team, who said they were wearing press credentials and carrying large cameras. A sound engineer was struck in the arm, a journalist from the outlet said. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist, Susan Ormiston, was hit with a gas canister also while covering the protests in the city. \u201cThe thing is, we were in that parking lot all by ourselves,\u201d she said in a broadcast. The police \u201cfired at us to clear us away but we clearly had our camera equipment visible\u201d. Minneapolis was the scene of especially acute unrest on Saturday night as authorities imposed a curfew and deployed the Minnesota state national guard to clear the streets and prevent the rioting and looting of the previous night. You can read the full story here: More from Miranda Bryant, this time watching Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser, whose city has seen protests outside the White House for two nights running, talk to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: Protesters have the right to exercise their first amendment rights, Bowser said, but \u201cnot to destroy our city\u201d. On Saturday night, protests outside the White House saw wastebins and a car set on fire and windows of businesses smashed. Bowser said the damage done to the city was \u201cmaddening\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re sending a very clear message to people that they have a right to exercise their first amendment rights, but not to destroy our city. So we saw a level of just destruction and mayhem among some that was maddening,\u201d she said. \u201cOur crews are out right now cleaning up our city, and we are working with all of our law enforcement partners to ensure calm in our city.\u201d Criticising the president\u2019s handling of the crisis, Bowser urged Donald Trump to help \u201ccalm the nation\u201d. \u201cThe president has a responsibility to help calm the nation, and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to hearken to the segregationist past of our country. And he can start by doing that right now. We certainly urge him to do that.\u201d She said there are \u201csystematic issues\u201d that need addressing \u2013 at both a federal and local level. \u201cWhat you see in cities across our nations, what we saw last night, there are people who are angry and people who are hurting. And some not, not doing it in ways that are helpful to our cause. But we still have to acknowledge that hurt and that anger,\u201d she added. Here\u2019s David Smith\u2019s report from Washington on Saturday night: De Blasio ends his press conferences by saying that New York will not follow other cities in the US by imposing a curfew. \u201cThis is a place with a strong tradition of peaceful protest,\u201d he says. \u201cWe find a way in this most complex of places ... last night was not perfect but there was no loss of life. There\u2019s is no plan for a curfew.\u201d De Blasio also said he would not bring in outside military forces - the national guard has been called in in states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin \u2013 as they do not know how to deal with the \u201crealities\u201d of life on the streets of New York. De Blasio is asked about two police cars that drove into a crowd of protesters on Saturday night in Brooklyn. He says the incident will be investigated. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to see a police officer do that but I also know it was an incredibly dangerous situation [for the officers],\u201d he said. On Saturday night, De Blasio defended the officers\u2019 decision to drive at protesters. \u201cIf those protesters had just gotten out of the way and not created an attempt to surround that vehicle, we would not be talking about this,\u201d he said, in comments that were widely criticized. He says, more generally, that the \u201cculture\u201d of policing must change in New York and the US. He adds: \u201cI see more and more officers who see that\u201d and says the current NYPD commissioner, Dermot Shea, also wants to see a change in policing culture and calls him a \u201cgreat leader\u201d. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio is giving a press conference after a troubled night in his city. An investigation has been started into allegations police were heavy handed in their response to protesters. \u201cI also want to acknowledge that the vast majority of police officers are doing there jobs correctly ... An attack on a police officer is an attack on all of us ... An attack on an innocent protestor by a police officer is an attack on all of us,\u201d he says. The protests have spread beyond the US. Crowds have gathered outside the US embassy in London as part of a Black Lives Matter demonstration and have also marched down Whitehall. There have also been protests outside the US embassies in Berlin and Copenhagen. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has appeared on ABC News\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos and opened by urging unity in the United States. \u201cLet\u2019s come together. Let\u2019s be prayerful, especially on Sunday morning, about how we can put our differences aside because this is the greatest country in the world and we want to live up to the legacy of America,\u201d she said. Pelosi also described the death of George Floyd as an execution after she was asked if all four officers present at his death should be held responsible (so far only one officer has been charged with a crime). \u201cI said right from the start that it was murder. We saw an execution of a person on TV. We saw it happened, a knee to the neck,\u201d she said. There are others there who witnessed it who were \u2013 would be considered in other circumstance accomplices to it.\u201d Pelosi said many of Donald Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments - the president described some protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d \u2013 should be ignored. \u201cThe president of the United States should bring dignity to the office that he serves. He should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country, and not to fuel the flame, not to fuel the flame. Not to fuel the flame,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think to take his bait time and time again is just a gift to him because he always wants to divert attention from what the cause of the response was rather than to describe it in his own terms, sadly.\u201d Pelosi ended by saying that injustices faced by black people in American are not limited to police brutality. \u201cThis is happening at a time of other injustices. The fact is that the coronavirus has taken undue tool among people of color. This again is an injustice,\u201d she said. \u201c...Why should there have been more disproportionate deaths among people of color?Because we\u2019re not really testing in those communities to treat and save lives.\u201d Val Demings, a member of Congress and potential running mate with Joe Biden in November\u2019s presidential election, has appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. Her comments carried added weight as she is the former police chief for Orlando. She said Minnesota\u2019s chief of police should be praised for quickly firing the officers involved in George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cWhile I know that it seemed like the days that passed before the officer was arrested \u2013 if you look historically, that was a pretty swift arrest that was made,\u201d she said. Demings added that the federal government had a large part to play in ensuring law enforcement are trained properly. \u201cWhile I know that our government does not have direct jurisdiction, I certainly believe that we do have a major role to play in terms of helping law enforcement agencies throughout the nation maybe come up with some standards for hiring and training, especially use of force training,\u201d she said. Demings said she was not confident Donald Trump is the correct person to lead the United States through a time in which the country is dealing with civil unrest and a pandemic. \u201cIf there was ever a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don\u2019t know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before and we have never seen before,\u201d she said. She was asked what the president could say to heal the nation\u2019s wounds. \u201cI would tell him to begin with showing some compassion for the persons who and the families that have lost their loved ones ... and maybe we begin today by acknowledging the sins of the past and even said things that he has said and done that caused harm and brought pain to the American people,\u201d she said. More from Miranda Bryant, who has been watching the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar speak to ABC\u2019s This Week: Ilhan Omar has called for nationwide reform following the killing of George Floyd and criticised some protesters\u2019 use of violence. Speaking from Minneapolis, she told ABC News there was \u201creal work to do, to heal\u201d and that a new system is needed \u201cthat works for all of us\u201d. Omar, an immigrant from Somalia who was one of the first two Muslim women elected to the US House, called for justice \u2013 including action against the police officers present when Floyd died who have not yet been charged, with one charged with murder \u2013 and nationwide reforms following \u201csocial and economic neglect\u201d. She added: \u201dWe are living in a country that has a two-tiered justice system and people are \u2026 sick and tired of being sick and tired. And we need to really step back and say to ourselves, where do we actually from here? And that can\u2019t just be getting justice for George Floyd. It needs to be bigger than that.\u201d Omar said Minneapolis residents were feeling \u201cterrorised\u201d by the threat of their homes and businesses burning down \u2013 but also by the presence of tanks and national guard troops. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is try to figure out something between extreme aggression and ways to figure out how to not get our city burned down. And it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d Omar spoke out against those causing destruction in the city, saying: \u201cWhen we see people setting our buildings and our businesses ablaze, we know those are not people who are interested in protecting black lives.\u201d Donald Trump, she said, has failed to understand \u201cthe kind of pain and anguish many of his citizens are feeling.\u201d She added: \u201cWhen you have a president who really is glorifying violence and was talking about the kind of vicious dogs and weapons that could be unleashed on citizens, it is quite appalling and disturbing.\u201d Here\u2019s Charles Kaiser\u2019s review of Omar\u2019s new book, This Is What America Looks Like: Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown drove 15 hours to Atlanta to take part in a peaceful protest on Saturday. \u201cI drove 15 hours to get to Georgia, my community,\u201d said Brown, who is from Georgia, and is also a vice president of the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cThis is a peaceful protest. Being a celebrity, being an NBA player don\u2019t exclude me from no conversations at all. First and foremost, I\u2019m a black man and I\u2019m a member of this community. ... We\u2019re raising awareness for some of the injustices that we\u2019ve been seeing. It\u2019s not OK. \u201cAs a young person, you\u2019ve got to listen to our perspective. Our voices need to be heard. I\u2019m 23 years old. I don\u2019t know all of the answers. But I feel how everybody else is feeling, for sure. No question.\u201d Another NBA player, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 Malcolm Brogdon, was also at the protest with Brown. \u201cThis is a moment. We have leverage right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a moment in time. People are going to look back, our kids are going to look back at this and say, \u2018You were part of that.\u2019 I\u2019ve got a grandfather that marched next to [Martin Luther King Jr.] in the \u201860s, and he was amazing. He would be proud to see us all here. We got to keep pushing forward. Jaylen has led this charge, man, and I\u2019m proud of him. We need more leaders.\u201d Brown recently wrote an op-ed for the Guardian on how US society should unite to combat Covid-19. He also spoke to us about how sports are used as a mechanism of control in the States. Brogdon spoke to the Guardian last year about sports and race. In more upbeat news, the Dragon Capsule from the SpaceX mission has successfully docked at the International Space Station after a 19-hour journey from Earth. Richard Luscombe has more details on yesterday\u2019s launch: On Saturday, New York attorney general Letitia James said she will investigate violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement, with many saying the police had been heavy handed in their approach. On Saturday night, video emerged of police cars being driven at protesters near Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park. In a letter published on Sunday the NYPD commissioner, Dermot Shea, told officers he was proud of their conduct during the unrest of the last few days. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve endured these last couple of days and nights \u2013 like much of 2020, so far \u2013 was unprecedented,\u201d wrote Shea. \u201cIn no small way, I want you to know that I\u2019m extremely proud of the way you\u2019ve comported yourselves in the face of persistent danger, disrespect, and denigration. What we saw in New York City last night and the night before was not about peaceful protest of any kind. It was not about civil disobedience. It was not about demonstrating against police brutality.\u201d Around 340 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday morning during the protests in New York, and at least 33 police officers injured. \u201cWhat it was, quite frankly, was a mob bent solely on taking advantage of a moment in American history, to co-opt the cause of equality that we all must uphold, to intentionally inflict chaos, mayhem, and injury just for the sake of doing so,\u201d wrote Shea. Protesters in Minneapolis have condemned the \u201copportunistic\u201d looting and violence taking place around the US \u2013 saying it is not being done in George Floyd\u2019s name. Speaking on Saturday night \u2013 which again saw widespread violence and unrest in cities across the US following Floyd\u2019s killing during an arrest by police officers on Monday \u2013 some protesters spoke out in interviews with CNN. In an impassioned interview, one man addressed looters directly, saying: \u201cSomething is wrong with you.\u201d He said: This is what I\u2019ve got to say to the people who are destroying things. If you really feel like you have to take an opportunity, like if you\u2019re going to be opportunistic, something is wrong with you. \u201cIf you cannot stand up and fight the good fight and you want to be a cheater and go ahead and take what we\u2019re trying to do, something is wrong with you. Because what we\u2019re trying to do is stand up for the basic right of humanity. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and we\u2019re trying to do in a peaceful way.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not want to go through this anymore. OK? I want to be able to go in a white neighbourhood and feel safe. I want to be able, when a cop is driving behind me, I don\u2019t have to clench and be tense, OK? \u201cI want to be able just to be free and not have to think about every step I take because at the end of the day, being black is a crime. At the end of the day, being born black is a crime to them and I don\u2019t understand why because we\u2019re all humans and that\u2019s sickening.\u201d Another protester said demonstrations staged in Floyd\u2019s name were peaceful. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the looting and rioting is being done in George Floyd\u2019s name\u2026What\u2019s being done in George Floyd\u2019s name is this type of gathering right now and we\u2019re going to try to keep this peace and morale the way it is. \u201cOur goal tonight is to keep the energy high and the tension low, we\u2019re going to keep that up.\u201d Many leaders believe that tragedies like the death of George Floyd - and the unrest that ensues from those deaths - will continue until structural racism in the United States is dismantled. That does not appear to be the view of many in power. In an interview on CNN, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien denied that systemic racism exists in the US. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s systemic racism,\u201d O\u2019Brien told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Instead, O\u2019Brien said \u201cthere are some bad cops that are racist and there are cops that maybe don\u2019t have the right training.\u201d He added that police were being hurt by \u201ca few bad apples\u201d. O\u2019Brien returned to a theme promoted by Donald Trump that antifa elements were responsible for the violence during protests. He said he had not seen a Vice report that far-right groups attempting to stir up a race war had been partly responsible for the violence at demonstrations. He was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s language during the last few days, in which the president has labelled some protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and has appeared to relish settings dogs on demonstrators. O\u2019Brien says that the president supports peaceful protesters but not people who do so violently. More from Keisha Lance Bottoms, mayor of Atlanta, who has spoken to CBS and NBC already. \u201cLast night was not as bad as Friday night,\u201d in her city, Bottoms told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation. \u201cI think there were several reasons for that. Of one, many people just decided to heed my advice and stay home. Also, \u2026 much more support that we had for our officers last night with the national guard. And we also had a curfew last night, a 9pm curfew and so that helped tremendously.\u201d Bottoms added: \u201cI think that there is a place in America for peaceful protest, and we know that peaceful protests have had a history of changing things in this country. But it has to be organised and it has to be for a purpose. And when you have violent eruptions like we\u2019ve seen across America, then we lose sight of even what we are talking about. \u201cYesterday, all we talked about was how our cities were erupting across America, but we weren\u2019t even talking about George Floyd and so many others who have been killed in this country. So that\u2019s my concern about what happens when we get lost in the violence.\u201d Bottoms said she did not have any evidence that outside radical left groups, as described by US attorney general William Barr, were involved in planning violence in Atlanta. She also criticised Donald Trump for his tweets on the matter. \u201cThis is so reminiscent of Charlottesville when President Trump just made it worse,\u201d she said, referring to the deadly white nationalist rally in Virginia in August 2017, after which Trump insisted there had been \u201cvery good people\u201d on \u201cboth sides\u201d. \u201cAnd there are times that you should just stop. And this is one of those times. He\u2019s making it worse. This is not about using military force. This is about where we are in America. We are beyond a tipping point in this country. And his rhetoric only inflames that. And he should just sometimes stop talking.\u201d Bottoms also told CBS she did not \u201chave faith in this justice department\u201d, as it investigates not just the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis but the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, an African American out jogging, in Georgia. \u201cBut I do have faith in America as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it is my hope that between the justice department, between the state of Georgia, that there will be appropriate charges that will be brought, that will be prosecuted and that there will be a conviction.\u201d Here\u2019s more on Charlottesville from the summer of 2018, when Lois Beckett went back: Melvin Carter, the mayor of St Paul, Minnesota, is talking about the protests in the twin cities on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Carter says the anger that has spurred the protests is \u201clegitimate\u201d and that George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of the police was from from unique - he says unarmed African Americans have been killed by police for decades. He is then asked if the military should be called in to help keep peace on the streets of his city. \u201cThe thing I think would help us more than military support is some assurance across our country that we possess a legal and judicial system that has the capacity and capability to hold someone accountable when something this blatant, something this disgusting, something this well-documented happens in plain view for all of us see,\u201d Carter says. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, has been charged with third degree murder. Carter is asked if the other three officers present at the scene should be charged. Carter, whose father was a police officer in St Paul, says the basic charge of police officers is to help the community. He says that the fact that the other officers at the scene of Floyd\u2019s death helped or stood guard while Floyd died is an incredible insult to humanity and other officers. He says all four officers must be held accountable. Carter then asks people to protest peacefully but not patiently. \u201cChannel this anger towards forces that make it so difficult to hold somebody accountable when African American lives are taken,\u201d he says. The Sunday shows are about to begin, and there\u2019s sure to be plenty to discuss. Keisha Lance Bottoms is the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, a city which has seen its share of trouble this weekend. She\u2019s appearing on a number of shows this morning but she already has a stark message for protesters: \u201cIf you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a Covid test this week. \u201cThere is still a pandemic in America that\u2019s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.\u201d As the AP puts it this morning, \u201cHealth experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. \u201cWhether they\u2019re fired up or not, that doesn\u2019t prevent them from getting the virus,\u201d said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis.\u201d The US has seen nearly 1.8m infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal healthcare. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, under intense pressure during the protests, noted: \u201cWe have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other.\u201d At the White House on Friday, Donald Trump said he had spoken to the family of George Floyd, the 46-year-old African American man who was killed during an arrest by police officers in Minneapolis this week. \u201cI want to express our nation\u2019s deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI spoke to members of the family \u2013 terrific people.\u201d \u201cI just expressed my sorrow,\u201d Trump said, adding \u201cthat was a horrible thing to witness\u201d and saying it \u201clooked like there was no excuse\u201d for Floyd\u2019s death. But according to Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, the conversation did not go well. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to even speak,\u201d Floyd told MSNBC on Saturday. \u201cIt was hard. I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off, like \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 \u201cAnd I just told him, I want justice. I said that I couldn\u2019t believe that they committed a modern-day lynching in broad daylight.\u201d The officer who kneeled on George Floyd\u2019s neck has been charged with murder. Three other officers involved in the arrest have not yet been charged. Protests and riots have spread to major cities across the US. Trump has been rebuked for responses which critics say have only increased tensions, including apparent threats to have looters shot and boasts about \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d awaiting protesters outside the White House. Trump and the White House did not immediately comment on Philonise Floyd\u2019s description of the call. Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s presumptive challenger in the presidential election in November, also spoke to the family and issued a video address in which he called for calm. \u201cI asked Vice-President Biden \u2013 I never had to beg a man before \u2013 but I asked him, could he please, please get justice for my brother,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cI need it. I do not want to see him on a shirt just like the other guys. Nobody deserved that. Black folk don\u2019t deserve that. We\u2019re all dying. \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d Donald Trump had a busy Saturday, travelling to Florida for the SpaceX launch from a White House that was the scene of violent protest on Friday and Saturday nights. He found time to make news wherever he went, lambasting and threatening protesters and, on his way back from Florida, announcing that this summer\u2019s scheduled Camp David G7 conference is off, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, but that he would like to invite Russia, Australia and India \u2013 all led by allies, of course \u2013 whenever the event is staged. Today, the president has no public events scheduled. It seems unthinkable \u2013 scratch that, it would seem unthinkable under any other president \u2013 that he will therefore take the chance to go golfing at his course in Virginia, while parts of many cities across the country burn. But this, as our columnist Robert Reich notes here, is America under Donald Trump: By having no constructive response to any of the monumental crises now convulsing America, Trump has abdicated his office. He is not governing. He\u2019s golfing, watching cable TV and tweeting. Here\u2019s Robert\u2019s powerful column in full: \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of what is now extensive civil unrest in the US, over the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, not quite a week ago. The officer who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck has been charged with murder but that has not quelled protests which have spread around the country and deteriorated into violence. Five Guardian reporters across the US contributed to our lead story today: The violence happened across America from coast to coast and from big cities to small ones. Beyond the major metropolitan areas, protesters clashed with police in cities including Tulsa, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Albany, New York; Fargo, North Dakota; and Raleigh, North Carolina. Near Union Square, in the heart of Manhattan, a police vehicle was on fire, sending plumes of black smoke into the air. In Brooklyn, protesters and police clashed for hours in Flatbush. In Los Angeles, a police post was burned in a shopping mall while nearby shops were looted. In Nashville, Tennessee, a historic courthouse was set on fire and in Salt Lake City, Utah, vehicles were burned and a man with a bow and arrow was arrested after he aimed it at protesters. There have been reports of shooting, of cars driving into protesters, of widespread injury, of journalists assaulted. Protesters also returned to the White House in Washington DC on Saturday night, undeterred by Donald Trump\u2019s talk of \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d awaiting them. David Smith, our Washington bureau chief, reports: Chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump!\u201d, hundreds of demonstrators on Saturday circled the White House grounds, which have come to resemble a fortress more than at any time in recent memory\u2026 \u2026protesters overcame the barriers near the White House and entered the park in front of it, but were driven out by police wielding shields, batons and pepper spray. Demonstrators damaged several Secret Service vehicles and threw themselves against officers\u2019 riot shields, the Washington Post reported. Tensions rose as the night wore on and the National Guard was called out as pockets of violence erupted. Dumpsters and a car near the White House were set on fire, and the windows of some businesses were smashed. So far this morning there has been no word from Trump, whose tweets and comments on Friday and Saturday were widely condemned for doing nothing to calm tensions and indeed pouring fuel on the flames. Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in November, said protests against police brutality were \u201cright and necessary\u201d but urged an end to violence. \u201cThe act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,\u201d Biden said. Here\u2019s Chris McGreal\u2019s latest dispatch from Minneapolis, ground zero for a violent start to the summer of 2020:",

      "bodyText": "The announcement came out of the blue. On Sunday, the government said 2.2 million high-risk \u201cshielders\u201d in England and Wales will be allowed to go outside for the first time from Monday if they feel \u201ccomfortable\u201d, either with members of their household, or, if they live alone, to meet one other person. These are people who, for the last 10 weeks, have been told to stay in their homes 24/7, without any break for exercise or fresh air. This marks a remarkable U-turn from ministers. Previous guidance advised that people with serious underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or low immunity, would need to shield until the end of June. Andthere was no mention of an anticipated change in last week\u2019s announcement easing lockdown for the wider public, nor any advance warning to health professionals. Disability organisations and charities appear to have been taken aback by the move, with the MS Society telling me they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d. From the outset of the pandemic, the government\u2019s communication to shielders has been found wanting, to the extent that many didn\u2019t even know how long they were supposed to shield for. The latest update \u2013 announced via tweets at 10pm on a Saturday night and trailed in the press \u2013 was like moving the goalposts on the quiet. Rather than hearing it first from a government briefing or from their doctor, shielders had to find out about the change on social media. When I spoke to people affected, the reaction was one of confusion, anxiety, and anger. Some noted that they had been told by their doctors only 24 hours earlier that they would need to shield for at least another month. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m trusting the government\u2019s advice,\u201d was the general response. After weeks of mixed messaging, on top of the Dominic Cummings scandal, the impression is that this is policymaking on the hoof, risking \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d people\u2019s lives for little more than a short-lived PR stunt. As one leading scientist put it, the easing of shielding \u201cseems to lack any obvious rationale other than to add to an ongoing \u2018good news\u2019 narrative that appears to have little grounding in reality\u201d. The science hasn\u2019t changed and nor has the risk posed, so it is hard to understand why the guidance for high-risk people has. Now that the wider public are out and about more \u2013 and increasingly not following physical distancing rules \u2013 this is actually the time it feels more dangerous for people with underlying health conditions to step outside. Sage advisers have warned a second wave is likely due to Boris Johnson easing the lockdown too early. Only two days ago, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, insisted that the country was at a \u201cvery dangerous moment\u201d. If some experts deem it too soon for healthy people, how are high-risk groups supposed to feel safe? In almost every aspect, the government\u2019s handling of shielding has been a mess. Many have struggled to get food, even reporting skipping meals or sleeping to stave off the hunger. The furlough scheme hasn\u2019t given high-risk people the right to paid leave from work, even if they have been told by the government to stay home for their safety. Last week, it emerged the government had even removed some people from the extremely vulnerable list. Others who are \u201cclinically vulnerable\u201d \u2013 high risk but not deemed vulnerable enough by the government to shield \u2013 have largely been left to judge the risk themselves without any official guidance. It is hardly surprising that in this context, many people with underlying health conditions do not trust ministers to keep them safe. If you tell people that they must stay in their homes 24/7 for their health, it is not too much to ask that you give them concrete evidence as to why the advice has suddenly changed. The government says it is to make things more \u201cbearable\u201d for shielders. But while it is right to acknowledge people are desperate to be outdoors and see loved ones again, they want to be safe while they do so. Spain has developed a timetable for walks to ensure disabled and older people can go outside away from the general public, while Dublin has provided a two-hour period where only high-risk \u201ccocooners\u201d can come out to use local parks. England \u2013 and the rest of the UK \u2013 should follow suit. As it is, giving shielders more freedom without accompanying measures to protect us is at best incompetence and worst, outright negligence. It is a terrible feeling to not trust your own government to keep you safe. At a time when people at the highest risk of coronavirus need more security than ever, we are left in fear and doubt. The fracturing of trust will surely cost us dearly. \u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "A day before the first confirmed fatality from coronavirus outside mainland China was reported on 2 February this year, the death of the influential guitarist and musician Andy Gill was announced. The 64-year-old, who fronted the post-punk band Gang of Four, died of pneumonia after two weeks in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. The trajectory of Gill\u2019s illness, which took medics looking after him in January by surprise, is now familiar \u2013 sudden deterioration, low oxygen levels and organ failure. He had fallen sick after his band returned from a trip to China in late November. A short time later, his 26-year-old tour manager was taken to hospital in Leeds with a severe respiratory infection.

When I emailed the BBC with the standard offer to work around the interviewee\u2019s schedule, I received the following slightly despondent reply: \u201cCharlie says he has no schedule any more.\u201d It sounded a little like this would be less an interview and more a courtesy call to make sure he was still taking care of himself.</p> <p>I need not have worried because, as it turns out, Higson\u2019s \u201cno schedule\u201d is the busy kind of \u201cno schedule\u201d. The call was originally to talk about his participation in the new BBC Two series <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2020/22/comedians-home-alone\">Comedians: Home Alone</a>. It\u2019s an all-star sketch show, where comedians such as Vic Reeves, Bob Mortimer, Tim Key and Michael Spicer submit homemade lockdown footage. Higson pops up in episode three, reprising his old Fast Show character Swiss Toni.&nbsp;</p> <p>But then Higson reveals that he also animated his sketch, in three days, learning how to use an animation app from scratch. And that he also made a short documentary about the process. And that a new lockdown special of his Radio 4 show, Down the Line, was about to air. And that there would have been a children\u2019s book out soon too, except coronavirus has pushed its publication back by a year. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s about a kid going on holiday,\u201d he explains. \u201cTo Italy,\u201d he adds with a groan.</p> <p>It turns out that Higson, 61, is coping quite well with quarantine. \u201cI\u2019m one of those annoying people who was pretty much living in lockdown anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only difference is that my eldest son has moved back in for the duration.\u201d This last bit appears to be key in getting Swiss Toni back on the air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f43d57283c56d9c85acc9ef9422960c34da351e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f43d57283c56d9c85acc9ef9422960c34da351e/0_65_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m busier than I\u2019ve been in months\u2019 \u2026 Charlie Higson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m busier than I\u2019ve been in months\u2019 \u2026 Charlie Higson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sent by alex@alexandracann.co.uk/No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen the call came in asking \u2018Can you do a Swiss Toni sketch from home?\u2019 I thought \u2018Well, not really\u2019, because I don\u2019t actually look like Swiss Toni,\u201d Higson says. Toni was always one of the broadest Fast Show characters. Bronze and greasy, in a flammable-looking suit (it will come as no surprise that he began life in a sketch on The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer), he was less a human being and more a cackhanded David Dickinson waxwork made sentient, albeit years before Dickinson became a household name. Recreating this look after quarter of a century would have been almost impossible.</p> <p>This is where his son comes in. Frank, 27, according to his father, does \u201csort of directing and editing and stuff\u201d, and together they struck upon the notion of animating Swiss Toni. They found old photos of the character, drew over them and hashed out a quick cartoon. Higson then called on Bob Mortimer \u2013 with whom he co-created the character all those years ago \u2013 for help with some of Toni\u2019s more seamy dialogue (\u201cAvoiding coronavirus is very much like making love to a beautiful woman shot through with STDs\u201d). \u201cBob always used to write the really filthy analogies,\u201d Higson recalls. \u201cAnd then I would write the other non-funny stuff that people don\u2019t always like.\u201d</p> <p>Swiss Toni seems like quite a risky character to bring back. Although he was one of the most immediately identifiable Fast Show characters, even gaining his own BBC Three sitcom in 2003, in his graphically sexual monomania he does seem like a product of his time. Given that the recent Little Britain revival for BBC One\u2019s Big Night In telethon received almost 200 complaints from suddenly offended viewers, was Higson ever worried about how he would fare in today\u2019s climate?</p> <p>\u201cHe is very inappropriate and out of date,\u201d Higson concedes. \u201cBut The Fast Show was never meant to be offensive. It was meant to be inclusive. Even with the most extreme and unpleasant characters, we derived it from something of real life. With Swiss Toni, his life was falling apart. We put on our shell and our suit of armour, which in his case is his shiny suit and hair, and we hide behind that.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94d88903d86c0eacd3035626f0bd8884960cb5a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94d88903d86c0eacd3035626f0bd8884960cb5a3/0_8_4502_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedians: Home Alone, a new BBC sketch show, features homemade lockdown footage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comedians: Home Alone, a new BBC sketch show, features homemade lockdown footage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Done &amp; Dusted/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same goes for Down the Line, the brilliant semi-official Fast Show reunion show that aired on BBC Radio 4 between 2006 and 2013, and which prompted a smattering of outrage from listeners who initially mistook it for a genuine call-in show.

Prior to that, he was responsible for the equally successful Young Bond books. While many of The Fast Show\u2019s alumni have remained more visible, either with acting roles or fishing shows, it is interesting that Higson has found his greatest success writing for kids.</p> <p>\u201cIt began because I wanted to take a break from filming so I could be around my kids a bit more, because they were getting to that age where they needed to be with their father a bit more or whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I thought it would be great to write some kind of action-adventure story for them. The great thing was I could test it on them when I was writing. If they fell asleep on you, it meant you had to kill someone.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's a shame we don't have sketch shows like it any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a gratifying medium for him; he marvels that \u201csometimes with these kids, it\u2019s the first book they\u2019ve read. It could be something they remember for the rest of their lives. That is an amazing thing.\u201d</p> <p>That is how I feel about The Fast Show, I tell him. I was a teenager when it aired, and it\u2019s one of the first shows I remember falling head over heels in love with.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat is lovely,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd luckily, our show is still well remembered. But I think it\u2019s a shame that we don\u2019t have sketch shows like that any more. It always used to be that each generation had their own sketch show that they thought had been made just for them. They\u2019d go to school the next day and do the catchphrases and the lines. There was us, then for later generations you had Little Britain and Catherine Tate. But since then, there has only really been Horrible Histories. There isn\u2019t that big show that teenagers in years to come will say, \u2018Yeah! That was a show we all watched\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Sketch shows, he says \u201care very expensive to make. And the BBC\u2019s got no money, so they can\u2019t afford to make them. No one else wants to take the risk because they are very risky.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>As well as his book, the virus has also put the brakes on some of Higson\u2019s screenwriting projects that were close to going into production. \u201cGod know what\u2019s going to happen with them,\u201d he sighs. \u201cEveryone has been hit the same way. And nobody really knows how you start getting back into it. How do you film a love scene where everyone\u2019s got to stay 2 metres apart? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu\">Normal People</a> would have been quite a different show. They\u2019d just be wanking in different rooms.\u201d</p> <p>As the interview comes to an end, I quickly run through all of Higson\u2019s projects to make sure I have not missed anything out. Swiss Toni, Down the Line, the Bond books, the Enemy books, the delayed children\u2019s book, the screenwriting. Was there anything else?</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he huffs. Then he adds: \u201cWell, Frank\u2019s had two video things that he\u2019s making. And one of them involves building a robot head, which we did together. He\u2019s got to deliver it tomorrow and he\u2019s giving me dirty looks, so I should get off the phone. I\u2019ve been busier in lockdown than I have been for months.\u201d</p> <p><em>Comedians: Home Alone airs tonight at 10pm</em><em> on BBC Two</em></p>",

There isn\u2019t that big show that teenagers in years to come will say, \u2018Yeah! That was a show we all watched\u2019.\u201d Sketch shows, he says \u201care very expensive to make. And the BBC\u2019s got no money, so they can\u2019t afford to make them. No one else wants to take the risk because they are very risky.\u201d As well as his book, the virus has also put the brakes on some of Higson\u2019s screenwriting projects that were close to going into production. \u201cGod know what\u2019s going to happen with them,\u201d he sighs. \u201cEveryone has been hit the same way. And nobody really knows how you start getting back into it. How do you film a love scene where everyone\u2019s got to stay 2 metres apart? Normal People would have been quite a different show. They\u2019d just be wanking in different rooms.\u201d As the interview comes to an end, I quickly run through all of Higson\u2019s projects to make sure I have not missed anything out. Swiss Toni, Down the Line, the Bond books, the Enemy books, the delayed children\u2019s book, the screenwriting. Was there anything else? \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he huffs. Then he adds: \u201cWell, Frank\u2019s had two video things that he\u2019s making. And one of them involves building a robot head, which we did together. He\u2019s got to deliver it tomorrow and he\u2019s giving me dirty looks, so I should get off the phone. I\u2019ve been busier in lockdown than I have been for months.\u201d Comedians: Home Alone airs tonight at 10pm on BBC Two",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Fires burned close to the White House in Washington DC on Sunday night, as a sixth day of national demonstrations over police brutality and the killing of George Floyd brought fresh unrest to the capital. In other big cities including New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Salt Lake City there were clashes between police and protesters over the weekend, with the nightly curfews imposed by local leaders having only a limited impact on angry crowds. In Minneapolis, the city where Floyd was killed and the demonstrations began, a semi-truck drove into a crowd of thousands protesting on a bridge \u2013 remarkably, no one was seriously injured in what appeared to have been a deliberate action. And if you\u2019re looking for violent rioters, argues Nathan Robinson, then look no further than the police themselves: In theory, the police are supposed to protect the community. When they are whacking the community with sticks, and firing teargas into it, they are more like an armed gang than keepers of the peace. As a crisis rages, Trump tweets from behind closed doors Donald Trump spent Sunday firing off messages such as \u201cSTRENGTH!\u201d and \u201cLAW &amp; ORDER!\u201d but otherwise made little public comment on the unfolding national crisis. It has been reported that on Friday night, as protesters neared the White House, the president and his family were rushed to a special secure bunker that is not known to have been used since the days after 9/11. While US cities reel from protests and violence, the president\u2019s critics say he has utterly failed to meet the moment \u2013 and may well have made it worse. As David Smith writes: The nation waits in vain for a speech that might heal wounds, find a common sense of purpose and acknowledge the generational trauma of African Americans. That would require deep reading, cultural sensitivity and human empathy \u2013 none of which are known to be among personal attributes of Trump. Floyd\u2019s brother says Trump brushed him off. Philonise Floyd told MSNBC that the president \u201cdidn\u2019t give me an opportunity to even speak\u201d when he tried to press for justice over his brother\u2019s death during a phone conversation last week. Beijing is goading Trump, with officials and state media seizing on the news from the US to accuse the president of hypocrisy over his criticism of China\u2019s crackdown on protests in Hong Kong. Could the mass demonstrations cause a Covid-19 surge? Politicians and public health officials have expressed concern that the mass protests could contribute to an increase in coronavirus infections across the US, with numerous images emerging of demonstrators in close proximity, many without masks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to not have mass gatherings,\u201d said Washington DC\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser. \u201cAs a nation, we have to be concerned about rebound.\u201d Pro-Trump donors are funding a campaign to reopen states. The Save Our Country coalition, whose key members have strong ties to the administration, is trying to raise $5m to lobby for states to reopen their economies, to oppose pandemic spending and build support for new tax cuts. The pandemic could leave 54 million Americans hungry, according to an analysis of the unfolding economic catastrophe by Feeding America, the national food bank network. Brazil passes 500,000 cases, but Wuhan seems virus-free Brazil is second to the US as the country with the highest number of coronavirus infections, after passing 500,000 confirmed cases. In Wuhan, where the outbreak began, widespread testing of more than 1 million people each day found no new infections in the city on Sunday \u2013 not even asymptomatic cases \u2013 though mainland China had 16 new cases, its highest daily total for three weeks. A Belgian prince broke lockdown rules to attend a party in Spain, where he caught Covid-19. Prince Joachim apologised for his behaviour, which caused anger in Spain \u2013 where the lockdown is to be extended for a final 15 days until 21 June. In other news\u2026 The SpaceX Dragon crew capsule docked with the International Space Station on Sunday, carrying two Nasa astronauts: the first pairing in space featuring a crewed spacecraft made by a private firm. Democrats are poised to question the fired state department watchdog Steve Linick. The former inspector general, who was dismissed by Trump last month amid rumours he had been investigating misconduct by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will go before House and Senate committees on Wednesday. Did Jake Paul loot a mall? The 23-year-old YouTube star has denied taking part in criminal activity after he was filmed standing inside a looted mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. Great reads How Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet became his generation\u2019s movie star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has distanced himself from his involvement in Woody Allen\u2019s new movie, yet it is his name that has made it a worldwide hit. The only man under 30 with a best actor Oscar nomination, Chalamet is Generation Z\u2019s James Dean, says Steve Rose. Are America\u2019s seniors deserting Trump? The president\u2019s erratic handling of the coronavirus pandemic has lost him support among the group most vulnerable to Covid-19: seniors. The over-65s traditionally lean Republican, but the influential voting bloc might be swinging to Biden, as Lauren Gambino reports. Being black while in nature Christian Cooper\u2019s confrontation with an angry white woman while he was birdwatching in Central Park went viral last week. It\u2019s just one example of nature-lovers of colour facing harassment and threats, simply for enjoying the outdoors, writes Poppy Noor. Opinion: The US needs to stand up for Hong Kong It is hard to imagine a US president with less credibility than Trump when it comes to criticising Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the Hong Kong protests. But the US must stand up for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, not sacrifice it to make a larger point, says Michael H Fuchs. If the US upends Hong Kong\u2019s special status, it could help seal the fate of the people of Hong Kong as just another part of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s autocratic domain. Last Thing: Christo\u2019s life in pictures The Bulgarian artist Christo, best known for large-scale artworks that involved wrapping landmarks such as the Reichstag and Paris\u2019s Pont Neuf bridge in fabric, has died aged 84.

The UK became one of the first major economies to set a target to become carbon neutral by 2050 through legislation that demands that emissions fall to net zero within the next 30 years. The latest call comes after the the International Renewable Energy Agency found that accelerating investment in renewable energy could spur global GDP gains of almost $100tn (\u00a380tn) between now and 2050. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that the economic fallout of the coronavirus could pose a threat to climate action unless governments use green investments to help support economic growth through the global slowdown.",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s just nice to see kids outside playing, doing what they do well.

The imprisoned WikiLeaks founder was unable to attend via video link because of ill-health and advice from his doctors, according to his partner Stella Moris. Assange, 48, is wanted in the US to face 17 charges under the Espionage Act and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion after the publication of hundreds of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. He is being held at Belmarsh prison in south London while the court system tries to reschedule his extradition hearing, which was postponed owing to the coronavirus pandemic.

The demand was rejected after barristers for Sonia Khan, the former chancellor\u2019s media adviser who was marched by armed police from Downing Street, successfully argued that the behaviour of Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide was pivotal to the case. The disclosure will be seen as an attempt by the government to protect Cummings from further controversy. He is facing demands for his resignation after the Guardian revealed that he had driven hundreds of miles across the UK during the coronavirus outbreak. It also means that Cummings could be made personally liable for part of any damages award. Khan was Javid\u2019s media adviser at the time she was escorted from No 10 after Cummings accused her of misleading him over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She denied any inappropriate contact. Javid was furious to learn about her dismissal after the event. At an employment tribunal hearing in central London, a judge set the case for a five-day hearing in December at which the relationship between Cummings and Johnson will be scrutinised. Barristers for Khan named Cummings as a respondent in the case, which also includes an unfair dismissal claim. It is understood that the government\u2019s solicitors attempted to argue that his name should be removed and replaced as a respondent with that of the Cabinet Office. Whitehall sources said Cummings planned to fight the claim. Counsel for Khan, who is being backed by the FDA union, argued that Cummings was pivotal to the case and that what he had done personally, rather than just as an agent of the employer, was actionable. He is expected to be summoned as a witness. The hearing ruled that the Cabinet Office could be added as a respondent but Cummings would also remain. Khan, 28, was accused by Cummings of lying about her conversations with Hammond\u2019s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge. It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings. There were no other firsthand witnesses to Khan\u2019s sacking by Cummings, who spoke to her in an office in Downing Street close to the prime minister\u2019s. In a meeting days after Khan\u2019s departure with Boris Johnson\u2019s team of special advisers \u2013 known as spads \u2013 Cummings is said to have remarked: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like how I run things, there\u2019s the door.\u201d Bruce Carr QC, a former government adviser on employment law, said the naming of an individual as a respondent could mean he could be personally liable for damages. \u201cThere are plenty of cases where it is appropriate and legitimate to include an individual as a respondent where that individual is central to the allegations of discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere that is or might be the case, it is actually very difficult for the principal respondent such as a government department to persuade a tribunal to strike out a claim against the individual named respondents. \u201cWhat you are effectively asking them to do is rule that the claim against the individual is frivolous or hopeless or is being brought for illegitimate reasons.\u201d Cummings has previously faced criticism over what some describe as his high-handed behaviour.

      "bodyText": "Global stocks have enjoyed a good start to the week, building on the gains of the past month, amid relief that tensions between the US and China haven\u2019t worsened. The US president said on Friday night he would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel in retaliation for Beijing\u2019s new security law for the former British colony -- but stopped short of outlining immediate measures. China has reportedly asked state-owned firms to halt purchases of soybeans and pork from the US, but so far markets have shrugged this off. Optimism was also boosted by final readings for closely-watched manufacturing surveys. They showed declines eased in the US, UK and the eurozone in May after production hit record lows in April because of Covid-19 shutdowns. In China, production unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time since January. The dollar has weakened as protests spread across the US after the killing of George Floyd in police custody. Gold and silver prices have rallied amid safe-haven buying. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 1.2% at 6,148 France\u2019s CAC up 1.39% at 4,760 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.6% at 18,485 Dow Jones up 0.15% at 25,421 Nasdaq up 0.35% at 9,522 S&amp;P 500 up 0.12% at 3,047 Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back to the US, where the more closely watched Institute of Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing PMI for May is out. It\u2019s come in at 43.1 versus 41.5 in April, indicating that while manufacturing is shrinking, the decline has eased slightly. US stocks have turned positive, with the Nasdaq now up 0.14% and the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones flat. An earlier announcement from the UK\u2019s financial watchdog might spell good news for small businesses. Several UK insurers have admitted they are liable to pay company owners under business interruption insurance policies after the City regulator challenged them to prove in court that their policies did not apply to the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. The Financial Conduct Authority is seeking court clarification on whether insurers\u2019 policies allow them to refuse business claims related to the coronavirus pandemic. The hearing is scheduled for late July. The majority of small businesses were not covered for the pandemic, as their policies mainly related to property damage, the regulator believes. However, after the regulator asked 56 insurers for information on 1 May, an undisclosed number quickly gave in and said they would pay out, after previously insisting they were not liable. You can read the full story here. The US manufacturing PMI survey from IHS Markit is out. It recorded 39.8 in May, up from 36.1 in April, signalling the second-biggest decline in production since April 2009. The decline is similar to those measured over here Markit recorded 39.4 in its eurozone survey, and 40.7 in the UK. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street and stocks have opened lower. Dow Jones down 97 points, or 0.38%, at 25,286 Nasdaq down 27.5 points, or 0.29%, at 9,462 S&amp;P 500 down 11.5 points, or 0.38%, at 3,032 Ikea has reopened 19 stores in England and Northern Ireland and large queues formed, for example in Warrington, where are line of more than 1,000 people \u2013 physically distanced \u2013 filled the car park, and at Wembley in London. Restaurants in Soho in central London are asking for temporary pedestrianisation of areas around them so they can offer alfresco dining with physical distancing once they are allowed to reopen in July, my colleagues Sarah Butler and Ed Cumming report. In Liverpool, some areas will also be semi-pedestrianised to help welcome outdoor diners. The UK is taking inspiration form Lithuania\u2019s capital, Vilnius, which has announced plans to turn the city into a vast open-air cafe and San Francisco, where restaurants are being encouraged to take over parking bays, pavements and streets. My colleague Joanna Partridge reports from Norwich: After eleven weeks closed, Norwich\u2019s outdoor market is reawakening, with traders arranging their goods outside their stalls and customers returning to the city centre. Markets in England are permitted to reopen from today, provided social distancing rules are followed, and a couple of council enforcement officers patrolled on foot to ensure people were keeping their distance and the one-way system inside the market was being observed. Trade was steady on the first morning, and stall owners selling goods deemed non-essential such as clothing and fresh flowers were keen to get back to business. The market is one of the oldest and largest in England -\u201d it\u2019s lovely to have it back,\u201d said Liz Johnson, out buying fish, fruit and vegetables with her husband Tim, \u201cit\u2019s our first proper day out since mid-March\u201d. A trickle of shoppers bought fresh flowers at Ponds Flowers stall during the morning- \u201cWe\u2019re at the bottom rung of the ladder, building back up,\u201d said Kevin Howes who works on the flower stall. Time for a round-up of today\u2019s news. Global stock markets are rallying on relief that there hasn\u2019t been an escalation in tensions between the US and China, and amid further easing of Covid-19 lockdowns. While Donald Trump said he would strip Hong Kong of its special status in response to Beijing\u2019s decision to impose a new controversial security law on the semi-autonomous territory, he didn\u2019t outline any specific measures on Friday night. A surprise expansion in Chinese manufacturing in May according to the Caixin PMI survey added to the optimism. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index rallied 3.4% and China\u2019s CSI 300 rose 2.7%. In London, the FTSE 100 index is 1% ahead at 6,138 while European shares are also up: France\u2019s CAC has gained 1.1% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has added 0.8%. Markets in Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and Norway are closed for the Whitsun holiday. However, tensions could rise as China has asked its state-owned agricultural firms to halt purchases of soybeans and pork from the US, according to Bloomberg and Reuters, unnamed citing sources. And China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman said any US attempts to harm Chinese interests would be met with firm countermeasures. US stock futures were negative, pointing to stock falls on Wall Street when it opens later, but then turned positive. Declines in the UK and eurozone manufacturing sectors eased in May from April\u2019s record lows, as expected, but economists warned of a \u201cnew normal\u201d as global demand was likely to stay weak for some time. The dollar has weakened to its lowest level since mid-March as protests against police brutality after the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, escalated, with fires burning outside the White House. Sterling hit a three-week high of $1.2425 against the dollar, as lockdown restrictions were relaxed in England, despite high Covid-19 infection and death rates. Gold and silver prices are rising, amid some safe-haven buying. Spot gold rose as much as 1% and now is 0.36% ahead at $1,732 an ounce. Silver touched a three-month high and is now up 1.5% at $18.10 an ounce. In corporate news, the budget fashion retailer Primark said it would reopen all its 153 stores in England on 15 June. Ted Baker, another fashion brand, announced an emergency \u00a3105m fundraising to get the business through the coronavirus pandemic. Its founder Ray Kelvin\u2019s 35% shareholding will be diluted after he backed the share sale. Times are tough for carmakers (and most other companies), although car showrooms are allowed to re-open in England from today. Experts are expecting a brief surge in sales after dealerships were closed for 10 weeks, but warn that this could fade quickly as a firm bounceback in consumer demand looks unlikely. In France, new car sales plunged 50.3% in May from a year earlier, following an 89% slump in April and a 72% decline in March, new industry figures show. Some 96,310 cars were registered in May. Sweden\u2019s truckmaker Scania plans major job cuts and estimates it may have 5,000 more staff than it needs because of the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Scania is owned by Germany\u2019s Traton, in which Volkswagen has an 89.7% stake. Scania\u2019s chief executive Henrik Henriksson said today that up to 1,000 office jobs at its headquarters in S\u00f6dertalje near Stockholm are under review. The Swedish truckmaker employs 51,000 people around the world. It said it also had too many staff in global sales and services because of a sharp fall in demand that is likely to persist for some time. Henriksson said: Our assessment is that it will take long before market demand reaches pre-crisis levels and we therefore need to adapt the organisation to the new situation. These will be company-wide measures and formal notices of redundancies are not excluded. The rally on stock markets has lost some steam. Traders have been relieved at Donald Trump\u2019s response to China\u2019s new security law for Hong Kong on Friday. He said he would end Hong Kong\u2019s special status in travel and trade, but stopped short of calling for an immediate end to the former British colony\u2019s privileges. Today, China warned that it would adopt countermeasures. Its foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters, according to Reuters: The announced measures severely interfere with China\u2019s internal affairs, damage US-China relations, and will harm both sides. China is firmly opposed to this. Any words or actions by the US that harm China\u2019s interests will meet with China\u2019s firm counterattack. According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials told the state-owned trading companies Cofco and Sinograin to halt imports of some farm goods, which could lead to rising tensions between China and the US. Here are the latest moves in stock markets: UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 1.04% at 6,139 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1% at 4,742 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.68% at 18,320 The UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI reading for May, at 40.7, was slightly better than that for the eurozone, at 39.4. But the main surprise today was Chinese factories\u2019 return to growth to last month, for the first time since January. The country\u2019s Caixin manufacturing PMI improved to 50.7 in May from April\u2019s 49.4, above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. So the story is that countries\u2019 factories are slowly cranking back into gear, but will have to adjust to new work practices as physical distance rules remain in place because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Economists are warning of a \u201cnew normal\u201d with demand set to remain weak for some time. The worst of the factory downturn may be behind us, said Rob Dobson, director at Markit. Those who typically see the glass half empty will note that the UK manufacturing sector remained mired in its deepest downturn in recent memory. Output, new orders and employment fell sharply again in May as restrictions to combat the spread of COVID-19 caused further widespread disruptions to economic activity, demand and global supply chains. However, the glass-half-full perspective is one where the rate of contraction has eased considerably since April, meaning \u2013 absent a resurgence of infections \u2013 the worst of the production downturn may be behind us. Pressure on manufacturers should ease further as lockdown restrictions are loosened, customers return to work and global activity restarts. However, changes to working practices, uncertainty about how long the COVID-19 restrictions may be in place for, weak demand and Brexit worries all suggest the UK is set for a drawn-out economic recovery. This will make the \u201cnew normal\u201d one of the toughest recovery environments many manufacturers will ever have to face. Markit, which compiles the survey, said pockets of growth at UK factories were generally linked to healthcare-related or PPE products. Some firms also noted that inflows of new business showed signs of restarting as clients began the process of reopening and the lockdown restrictions implemented both in the UK and overseas are gradually easing. The UK manufacturing PMI has come in at 40.7 in May, little changed from the flash estimate of 40.6, and up from April\u2019s record trough of 32.6. Output, new orders and employment shrank at some of the fastest rates during the 28-year survey history, albeit less sharply than the records set in April. The output sub-index rose to 35.0 from April\u2019s 16.3. The euro is also getting a lift from expectations of further stimulus from the European Central Bank on Thursday. It is expected to raise its asset buying programme by \u20ac500bn to \u20ac1.25 trillion. While stock markets are pushing higher on economic optimism as coronavirus lockdowns are eased further, the dollar has weakened amid widespread protests against police brutality in the US after the killing of George Floyd. The euro has been boosted by the final manufacturing PMI readings. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit, said: While we are still set to see unprecedented falls in industrial production and GDP in the second quarter, the survey brings hope that the goods producing sector may at least see some stabilisation \u2013 and even potentially a return to growth \u2013 in the third quarter. Whether growth can achieve any serious momentum remains highly uncertain, however, as demand \u2013 both domestically and in export markets \u2013 looks set to remain subdued by social distancing measures, high unemployment and falling corporate profits for some time to come. He noted that headcounts continue to be cut at a rate not seen since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009 as firms scale back capacity in line with weak demand. Prices charged for goods are meanwhile also still falling at a pace not exceeded over the past decade as manufacturers offer discounts to help clear warehouses of unsold stock. The labour market and profits could therefore deteriorate further in coming months, holding any recovery in check. Germany recorded the lowest PMI of all countries, followed by Spain. Italy was the best-performing country, posting a smaller contraction than others at 45.4 (the 50 mark divides contraction from expansion). In the eurozone as a whole, factory activity shrank at a slower rate in May than in April, when coronavirus lockdowns brought economies to a virtual standstill. The final reading for the manufacturing PMI came in at 39.4 in May, little changed from the flash estimate of 39.5, and compared with April\u2019s record low of 33.4. Germany\u2019s final reading for the manufacturing PMI in May is 36.4, worse than expected, and up only slightly from April\u2019s 11-year low of 34.5. It signals deep contraction. Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said: The latest data show that business continues to be severely disrupted by the COVID-19 crisis. Even though more factories have started to resume operations after the loosening of restrictions, weak underlying demand is still a limiting factor, as evidenced by the survey\u2019s measure of new orders rebounding far less than that of output in May. Manufacturing production was already down 7-8% from a peak in late-2017 even before the onset of the pandemic, and now that figure looks to be in the region of 25-30%. With production as far as it is below capacity and manufacturers not expecting a full recovery anytime soon, factory job losses have continued to accelerate, led by another round of staff cuts in the particularly ravaged investment goods sector. The French manufacturing PMI rose to 40.6 in May (slightly up from the preliminary reading of 40.3), compared with 31.5 in April. Eliot Kerr, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, said: Despite some French manufacturers beginning to resume normal operations in May, output continued to decline following April\u2019s record contraction. Although the rate of decline eased, the further reduction in activity highlights the challenges that the economy faces in its recovery from this crisis. Firms are now presented with an environment of subdued demand, as clients remain hesitant to place orders amid uncertainty over the removal of restrictions and the potential for further outbreaks. The Italian factory PMI is also stronger than expected at 45.4 in May, bouncing back from a record low of 31.1 in April, but still showing a contraction in manufacturing. The final reading for Spain\u2019s manufacturing PMI for May is out. At 38.3, it\u2019s slightly better than previously thought, but still indicates a sharp contraction, being far below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion. Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, said: Spain\u2019s manufacturing sector remained mired in a deep downturn during May as the difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on goods producers. Whilst there were reports of factories coming back online in response to the slight easing of lockdown restrictions, low demand, constraints on economic activity and difficulties in sourcing inputs inevitably weighed on production. Indeed, anecdotal evidence pointed to plants operating at well below capacity with firms easily able to cope with current workloads and subsequently in many instances looking to reduce staffing numbers. Such decisions were in part driven by ongoing pessimism about the future, with sentiment remaining deep inside negative territory as worries persist about the longer-term impacts of the pandemic on incomes and consumption. Stock markets are rallying, as Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are eased further and traders shrug off the rioting in the US. The FTSE 100 index in London is trading 1.4% higher at 6,162. France\u2019s CAC 40 is 1.7% ahead, Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is up 1.4% and Spain\u2019s Ibex opened 2% higher. Germany is closed for the Whitsun holiday. In the UK, English primary schools have reopened for some younger children for the first time since the lockdown began 10 weeks ago, although many parents planned to keep their children at home. Car showrooms and outdoor markets are also allowed to open again from today, and up to six people can meet outside in England, at a 2m distance. Another fashion brand, Ted Baker, has unveiled plans to raise \u00a395m by selling shares, after slumping to a pretax loss of nearly \u00a380m in the year to January. Its share price fell almost 7% on the news. Ted Baker was already struggling before the coronavirus crisis struck. The firm has been embroiled in an accounting scandal and its founder and former chief executive Ray Kelvin resigned after allegations of \u201cforced hugs\u201d at the company. He has denied allegations of misconduct. In corporate news, the fashion retailer Primark is preparing to reopen all its 153 stores in England on 15 June, according to its owner Associated British Foods. Since the UK\u2019s coronavirus lockdown was imposed on 23 March, all non-essential shops have been shut, apart from supermarkets, pharmacies and some other essential stores. All shops will be allowed to open again from the middle of the month under the easing of lockdown restrictions. Car showrooms and outdoor markets can reopen today. Primark is installing hand sanitiser stations and perspex screens at tills and handing out face masks and gloves to staff in preparation for the reopening of stores in England. Primark is currently trading from 112 stores across Europe and the US, equivalent to 34% of its selling space. It previously warned that it was losing \u00a3650m in sales for every month all its stores were closed. Gold and silver continue to climb this morning after Friday\u2019s gains, as investors seek refuge in safe-haven assets. Spot gold is trading at $1,741 an ounce, up 0.9%. Silver rose 2.7% to $18.31 an ounce. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business. Markets were buoyed by economic optimism last week as lockdowns around the world were eased, despite fears of a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 is now back above 3,000, and the FTSE 100 index in London ended the week above the 6,000 level. Asian markets are up today, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rising 3.5% and China\u2019s CSI 300 advancing 2.7%, despite widespread protests against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in the US. The FTSE 100 is being called about 60 points higher. Tensions between the US and China over Hong Kong rose last week as Beijing approved plans for a new security law to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous territory. Donald Trump responded by announcing that he would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel, but traders are relieved that the phase one of the US trade deal with China appears to be intact. China\u2019s factories unexpectedly returned to growth last month for the first time since January, as lockdown measures were eased. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for May rose to 50.7 in May from April\u2019s 49.4, above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. However, surveys for China\u2019s trading partners in Asia showed sharp declines in factory output. Japan\u2019s factory activity shrank at the fastest pace since 2009 in May and South Korea also saw the worst manufacturing slump in more than a decade. Many European markets are closed for the Whit Monday holiday, but even so the final readings for the manufacturing PMI surveys compiled by IHS Markit will be released this morning, followed by the UK\u2019s PMI. Flash readings showed that the UK and eurozone manufacturing sectors continued to shrink at a fast pace in May and recovered only slightly after the coronovirus lockdown measures brought economies to an effective standstill in April. You can find our latest monthly analysis of how the coronavirus crisis has hit the UK\u2019s economic outlook here. Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at investment firm ADM Investor Services International, says: A new month begins with markets still riding on a wave of hope that lockdown easing will lead to a \u2018strong\u2019 recovery, an eternal hope of a vaccine being found, and more \u2018stimulus\u2019 (monetary &amp; fiscal) measures, specifically from the European Central Bank this week. The negatives remain all too visible - dire levels of job losses and very high levels of job insecurity, still little visibility on the economic outlook, a sharp rise in US (and many others) political tensions with China, and rising levels of social unrest, above all in the US and Hong Kong. Over here, Brexit talks between the UK and the EU resume this week. Finally, the Atlantic hurricane season officially starts today (more on this later), and India\u2019s monsoon season also gets under way.

These see teams of marbles, often having progressed through qualifying rounds, compete in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN_boA0zTO0\">sand racing rallies</a>&nbsp;and motor racing-inspired contests called things like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wH6AuAZiDs\">Marbula One</a>.

At the start of March, the JMR YouTube channel had fewer than 600,000 subscribers. That number is now more than 1.1 million and, he says, \u201cI think we will jump to 2 million pretty soon.\u201d</p> <p>The past month has seen the sport make its TV debut on US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/espn-ocho-spt-trnd/index.html\">network ESPN</a>&nbsp;and attract the attention of the comedian John Oliver\u2019s HBO show&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=50&amp;v=HPdRVxiAq_0&amp;feature=emb_logo\">Last Week Tonight</a>, which will financially sponsor the forthcoming Marble League in return for a few diminutive billboards placed among the event\u2019s 10,000+ marble \u201cspectators\u201d. The team will this week meet a major international TV producer who is interested in developing marble racing as a primetime TV format.

      "bodyText": "\u201cCan\u2019t believe I watched this all the way to the end,\u201d Gary Lineker tweeted early into Britain\u2019s coronavirus crisis. \u201cThe lack of live sport is clearly getting to me.\u201d He attached a 2-minute YouTube video in which a handful of marbles career down a twisting channel dug into sand, accompanied by a breathless commentary: \u201cMarbles in the blocks \u2026 and they\u2019re off!\u201d Once an unseen figure sets the marbles loose, there is no human interaction in the race, the positions of the coloured competitors decided purely by chance and the chicanes of the course. The early lead is taken by a light blue marble called Comet, until an unlucky collision knocks it back to fourth place. \u201cAnd now Comet, just like that, fights back to the lead,\u201d roars the commentary. The marble goes on to enjoy an emphatic win. \u201cSod you, Lineker, you drew me in,\u201d tweeted one follower. \u201cBut you\u2019re glad I did, aren\u2019t you?\u201d replied the TV presenter and former England footballer. Welcome to the madcap world of competitive marble racing, which you might describe as a spoof sport were it not, to its growing number of fans, so very serious. The sand rally was staged by Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs, a YouTube channel that since 2006 has been run by a Dutch marble enthusiast, Jelle Bakker, and his older brother, Dion. Beginning with relatively simple \u2013 if enormous \u2013 marble runs, they progressed to competitions, and now screen several elaborately staged events each year. These see teams of marbles, often having progressed through qualifying rounds, compete in sand racing rallies and motor racing-inspired contests called things like Marbula One. Later this month they will stage the Marble League, a multi-sport tournament inspired by \u2013 but no longer named after \u2013 a more familiar multi-sport event, after the International Olympic Committee objected to its original name of MarbleLympics. Though marble racing\u2019s popularity among fan communities has grown steadily in recent years, the global pandemic, as Dion notes wryly, \u201chas been pretty good to us\u201d. At the start of March, the JMR YouTube channel had fewer than 600,000 subscribers. That number is now more than 1.1 million and, he says, \u201cI think we will jump to 2 million pretty soon.\u201d The past month has seen the sport make its TV debut on US network ESPN and attract the attention of the comedian John Oliver\u2019s HBO show Last Week Tonight, which will financially sponsor the forthcoming Marble League in return for a few diminutive billboards placed among the event\u2019s 10,000+ marble \u201cspectators\u201d. The team will this week meet a major international TV producer who is interested in developing marble racing as a primetime TV format. After 20 years in youth work and child psychiatry, Dion quit his job three days ago, saying, \u201cI just live from YouTube now.\u201d It was Jelle, now 37, who first began making marble runs as a four-year-old autistic child, helped by his brother, who is two years older. Jelle still builds all the tracks and stands for the races, though it is no longer a two-man operation. The commentator, Greg Woods, is American, their designer is based in Belgium, their composer in Greece, and a 15-strong committee scrutinises all times and results. \u201cYeah, we have to check everything really well,\u201d says Dion, \u201cbecause in America people are really living for it, and they see it as a real sport.\u201d Merchandise sales for the competing teams, inevitably, are also booming. How does he account for its appeal? The lack of any other sport has obviously been significant, he says, also pointing to the humour of the videos, which include stop-motion battles between competing marbles in the stands and marble streakers. Fundamentally, Dion says, \u201cIt pulls you into another dimension. Most people who watch it forget real life. Everything that has a competitive element \u2013 the human brain is just addicted to that.\u201d He says 49% of viewers are now in the US, with the UK the fourth biggest audience after the Netherlands and Germany. \u201cPeople are really rooting for one team. It\u2019s very cool to see and to experience.\u201d And yet, he confesses with a laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it really, because if you ask me, I would never watch it. I would never watch it on YouTube if I wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d",

EU officials have accused the UK of backsliding on promises made by Boris Johnson last October, while refusing to engage in detailed talks on the issue. British officials reject these charges, while blaming the EU for holding up progress on an area of mutual benefit. British arguments have failed to convince EU diplomats to rewrite Barnier\u2019s mandate, while EU officials have warned of stalemate if this week\u2019s talks fail to progress. Another inconclusive round is likely to set up a difficult encounter between Boris Johnson and the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in mid June. The EU is playing down expectations of that meeting, which was once seen as a decisive encounter at the halfway stage of talks. \u201cNo one has the interest at the moment to see this as a make-or-break summit, because we know we won\u2019t have enough progress, so we just need to find a common strategy to deal with it,\u201d an EU diplomat said. A UK spokesperson said the government would continue to approach talks constructively. \u201cWe expect this round to keep the process on track ahead of the high-level meeting later this month, but it\u2019s clear that the EU needs to evolve its position if we are to reach an agreement. \u201cA balanced solution is needed which reflects the political realities on both sides, and we will continue to make sure our position is understood,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the UK would not agree \u201cdemands for us to give up our rights as an independent state\u201d.",

Many were refused universal credit, but prevented from reclaiming their original benefits by DWP rules.</p> <p>It comes amid rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/30/benefit-changes-leave-disabled-people-facing-poverty-uk-charities-warn-coronavirus\">concern from charities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/labour-urges-universal-credit-rethink-to-help-low-income-families-coronavirus-lockdown\">opposition parties</a> that policies such as the benefit cap and the two-child benefit limit have left the poorest households struggling to cope with the increased cost of food and energy bills during the pandemic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://doc-0o-2s-apps-viewer.googleusercontent.com/viewer/secure/pdf/cnskkpradnunkeltm2n216uco9606bf9/qba46aqpf8hr1e3ndar93aau58bi4l88/1589715825000/gmail/10718478291334072593/ACFrOgC0S3oFl4J3gLkI6n9nZDS25CiRk_YS2LrDvX9YYR053ZvIfbyA5ILTpZ5jOyM9doAcfXhFSnVvLzvmtGkI9uN0EVfcDZ9FcaFsmstM_1pMEUEcBeeCyUbPjbQ=?print=true&amp;nonce=a8b7oodr0812k&amp;user=10718478291334072593&amp;hash=kqbh8gd97rs1dkad4agpjj3mkb211pbl\">Estimates</a> suggest that around 108,000 families \u2013 including 90,000 families already capped \u2013 will not see any of the chancellor\u2019s cash boost because it takes them over the benefit cap limit, enabling the DWP to claw it back. In one case, a capped claimant has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/17/woman-left-worse-off-by-coronavirus-cash-boost-challenges-benefits-rules\">taken legal action</a> after she was left worse off by the chancellor\u2019s uprating.</p> <p>The benefit cap was intended to \u201cincentivise\u201d unemployed claimants to get a job by limiting their total household benefits to \u00a323,000 a year (\u00a3442 a week) in London and \u00a320,000 a year (\u00a3385 a week) outside the capital. People can escape the cap if they get a job or work more hours.</p> <p>The SSAC letter pointed out that this was currently likely to be difficult: \u201cClaimants would normally have the option to move into paid work or to move home to avoid the impact of the benefit cap, but neither of these are realistic choices for many people at the current time.\u201d </p> <p>It said the DWP had claimed it was administratively too difficult to safely uprate jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA) and employment and support allowance (ESA). However, ministers should \u201censure that this group of claimants \u2026 are brought up to the same level as those in receipt of universal credit as soon as it is possible to do so\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said ministers should heed the committee\u2019s words: \u201cThere is no justification for failing to uprate JSA and ESA In line with UC and the benefit cap should be scrapped \u2013 it\u2019s clearly impossible to work more hours or move to cheaper housing during the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The SSAC\u2019s membership includes policy experts from organisations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, as well as former DWP officials.</p> <p>The DWP said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWe are doing whatever it takes to ensure people are supported through these unprecedented times, including injecting \u00a36.5bn into the welfare system and rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cWe have experienced a surge in demand since mid-March and universal credit has enabled us to increase payments at pace, while maintaining the stability of the welfare system overall. We estimate that 2.5 million households on Universal Credit will benefit immediately from the \u00a320-a-week increase in the standard allowance. We have also increased other entitlements such as local housing allowance, to better support those across all benefits.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s own expert welfare advisory group has called on ministers to review the benefit cap, amid evidence that the controversial policy has left tens of thousands of low-income claimants without vital extra financial help during the coronavirus lockdown. A letter to the work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, from the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) said that although the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had done \u201cremarkable\u201d work to support claimants during the crisis, ministers needed to address several \u201crough edges\u201d to its policies, including the benefit cap. The SSAC also called for the \u00a390-a-month uprating of universal credit and tax credits announced by the chancellor in March to help with living costs related to Covid-19 to be extended \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to hundreds of thousands of people on older unemployment benefits who did not receive the cash boost. \u201cWe are of the strong view that it is increasingly untenable for this group of claimants to be excluded and to continue to have a lower level of income than those in receipt of universal credit and working tax credit,\u201d the committee, which is formally sponsored by the DWP, said. The letter was also critical of DWP advice that left some self-employed people worse off after losing existing benefits in lockdown when they were wrongly told to apply for universal credit as their incomes dropped. Many were refused universal credit, but prevented from reclaiming their original benefits by DWP rules. It comes amid rising concern from charities and opposition parties that policies such as the benefit cap and the two-child benefit limit have left the poorest households struggling to cope with the increased cost of food and energy bills during the pandemic. Estimates suggest that around 108,000 families \u2013 including 90,000 families already capped \u2013 will not see any of the chancellor\u2019s cash boost because it takes them over the benefit cap limit, enabling the DWP to claw it back. In one case, a capped claimant has taken legal action after she was left worse off by the chancellor\u2019s uprating. The benefit cap was intended to \u201cincentivise\u201d unemployed claimants to get a job by limiting their total household benefits to \u00a323,000 a year (\u00a3442 a week) in London and \u00a320,000 a year (\u00a3385 a week) outside the capital. People can escape the cap if they get a job or work more hours. The SSAC letter pointed out that this was currently likely to be difficult: \u201cClaimants would normally have the option to move into paid work or to move home to avoid the impact of the benefit cap, but neither of these are realistic choices for many people at the current time.\u201d It said the DWP had claimed it was administratively too difficult to safely uprate jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA) and employment and support allowance (ESA). However, ministers should \u201censure that this group of claimants \u2026 are brought up to the same level as those in receipt of universal credit as soon as it is possible to do so\u201d. Labour\u2019s Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said ministers should heed the committee\u2019s words: \u201cThere is no justification for failing to uprate JSA and ESA In line with UC and the benefit cap should be scrapped \u2013 it\u2019s clearly impossible to work more hours or move to cheaper housing during the crisis.\u201d The SSAC\u2019s membership includes policy experts from organisations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, as well as former DWP officials. The DWP said: \u201cWe are doing whatever it takes to ensure people are supported through these unprecedented times, including injecting \u00a36.5bn into the welfare system and rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters. \u201cWe have experienced a surge in demand since mid-March and universal credit has enabled us to increase payments at pace, while maintaining the stability of the welfare system overall. We estimate that 2.5 million households on Universal Credit will benefit immediately from the \u00a320-a-week increase in the standard allowance. We have also increased other entitlements such as local housing allowance, to better support those across all benefits.\u201d",

Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

      "bodyText": "Norwich Market, having survived wars, plagues and recessions in over 900 years of trading from the same site, has reawakened once again after the coronavirus shutdown had closed all but a handful of stalls selling food and essential goods. From early Monday morning, traders selling fruit and vegetables, vintage clothing and household items, rearranged their stalls, hoping to entice the shoppers slowly returning to the quiet city centre. Council workers had hurriedly installed a one-way system in the market alleyways and laid floor stickers to encourage shoppers to keep 2 metres apart. A steady trickle of customers were buying seasonal peonies and baby\u2019s breath at Pond\u2019s Flowers, next to Gentleman\u2019s Walk, which has been run by Alexander Pond\u2019s family for more than a century. \u201cWe\u2019re starting on the bottom rung of the ladder, building it back up,\u201d said Kevin Howes, who has worked on the stall with Pond for 25 years. Only about a fifth of the 90 businesses that operate at the market, known for its distinctive candy-striped roofs, had raised their shutters on Monday morning. Many are waiting for high street stores to reopen later this month and for footfall to pick up in the city. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how many traders will come back,\u201d said Mark Wright, the chair of the market traders\u2019 association and owner of Taxi Vintage Clothing, \u201cI hear some have done well online.\u201d Without his own online business, Wright was hoping his rail of floral Hawaiian shirts would catch a shopper\u2019s eye so he could \u201cbreak the ice\u201d and make his first sale in 11 weeks. Norwich city council granted traders a rent holiday during the shutdown but do not intend to cancel rent payments. \u201cWe will need to reexamine rents at the end of the summer,\u201d said councillor Matthew Packer. \u201cWe are very stretched financially.\u201d Dale Barker had got off to a flying start \u2013 he was greeted at 8am by a customer eager for him to open his foam and upholstery supplies stall. Barker was glad to return and, like some of his fellow traders, said a \u00a310,000 small business grant from government had \u201ckept the business afloat\u201d. From mid-morning, a pair of uniformed council enforcement officers patrolled the aisles to enforce physical distancing \u2013 even if the market wasn\u2019t inundated with visitors \u2013 instead of their usual role handing out parking tickets. By lunchtime a well-spaced queue had formed at Ron\u2019s Fish and Chips. \u201cPeople are slowly getting their confidence back,\u201d said James Read as he handed a bunch of bananas over the trestle table separating him from his customers. Nigel Simmeth had cycled 10 miles from nearby Wymondham for toast and coffee at Debs Champion\u2019s stall. \u201cIt\u2019s good to get some sort of normality back,\u201d said Simmeth, 65. \u201cWhatever normality is\u201d. Meanwhile Debs was chilling a bottle of prosecco in her fridge to toast the market\u2019s return with her fellow traders at the end of the day.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has shown signs of recovering from the worst damage inflicted during the coronavirus outbreak, after a survey showed that factory output had declined at a slower pace in May than a month earlier. The monthly snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which is closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signals about the economy, indicated that the downturn in the manufacturing sector eased last month as lockdown measures were gradually lifted. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2013 compiled from surveys of business activity \u2013 rose to 40.7 in May from 32.6 a month earlier, when harsh restrictions brought Britain\u2019s economy to an effective standstill. However, the index remained below the 50 mark that separates economic growth from contraction, and still represented one of the worst months on record for factory output. According to the latest figures, manufacturers continued to feel the impact from the coronavirus pandemic as the economy struggled to build momentum to escape the deepest recession in living memory. Pockets of growth were generally linked to healthcare-related or personal protective equipment products as factories increased production to respond to the global health emergency. Despite the continued stress facing the industry, IHS Markit said the worst of the downturn had probably passed, as lockdown measures were gradually being lifted and factories were starting to reopen for business. Stock markets around the world rose on Monday amid promising indicators of economic activity from other major nations, including figures revealing an unexpected return to growth for Chinese factory production in May after three months of contraction. PMI readings for the US and eurozone also rose from record low levels recorded in March and April, indicating that the moment of maximum damage for the world economy might now have passed. The FTSE 100 closed up 1.5% on Monday at 6,166. Markets across Europe also recorded fresh gains, while Wall Street was higher in early afternoon trading. Despite the positive signals, economists and industry groups warned that the recovery could take longer than first expected and that the risk of lasting damage was rising. The threat of a second wave of Covid-19 infections, renewed lockdown measures or government emergency financial support being removed too soon could also rapidly derail the rebound. Rob Dobson, a director of IHS Markit, said: \u201cChanges to working practices, uncertainty about how long the Covid-19 restrictions may be in place for, weak demand and Brexit worries all suggest the UK is set for a drawn-out economic recovery. \u201cThis will make the \u2018new normal\u2019 one of the toughest recovery environments many manufacturers will ever have to face.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Government plans to make MPs vote in person during the coronavirus crisis have been condemned as \u201cbeyond a farce\u201d amid concerns they will discriminate against shielding politicians and threaten the lives of staff. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, tabled a motion on Monday preventing the resumption of virtual voting, which allowed MPs to have their say from afar during the pandemic. If the house approves the government plan on Tuesday, MPs may have to form kilometre-long queues in order to obey physical distancing rules when voting \u2013 despite the Lords planning a move online. The former cabinet minister Karen Bradley is leading a rebellion against the ending of the hybrid Commons proceedings, which allowed for remote voting and virtual debates. Bradley, now the chair of the powerful procedure committee, has put forward amendments which would allow those MPs not able to travel to Westminster to keep participating in debates via video link and to vote remotely. She has the support of the chairs of 16 other select committees including a number of former ministers. Valerie Vaz MP, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, said: \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s discriminatory proposals would result in two classes of MPs. Those who can physically attend and those unable to owing to the government\u2019s own rules, including having an underlying health condition or shielding responsibilities. \u201cThe abolition of the hybrid remote parliament which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances is discriminatory and would not be acceptable in any other workplace.\u201d Rees-Mogg defended the plan in the House political magazine, saying the total numbers on the estate \u201cwill not increase significantly\u201d, with MPs\u2019 staff continuing to work from home. \u201cFor those MPs with underlying health conditions who have been told to shield or are receiving specific government advice about their health, the government is working with the house authorities to see how they can continue to contribute to proceedings,\u201d he wrote. But the plans, which are still being risk assessed, have drawn criticism from pressure groups and politicians. The Electoral Reform Society said: \u201cIf this goes ahead, it is beyond a farce. It is unacceptable when there is currently a safe, secure and speedy option for voting available: remote/digital voting. MPs have already used it, and it works. \u201cSince some MPs are shielding and are not safe to travel in person, these plans \u2013 if confirmed \u2013 pose a real threat for democratic representation and political equality.\u201d Senior Tories including Robert Halfon, the chair of the Commons education select committee, who is currently shielding, have called for virtual proceedings to continue for those who need them. The Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m a carer for my wife. You\u2019re asking me to choose between the health of my family and abiding by your poxy stubbornness. I choose to fulfil my duties as a husband and family man.\u201d Dame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP for Barking, said she was \u201cfurious\u201d that she was being \u201cdenied the right to vote\u201d on Tuesday because she was deemed vulnerable. She accused Boris Johnson of being on a \u201cmission to end\u201d digital voting, tweeting: \u201cThis damaging move will limit accountability &amp; create a toothless parliament. It means MPs in the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 category will be rendered voiceless &amp; it will completely distort votes.\u201d The government\u2019s motion requires voting to take place in person at the Palace of Westminster and that MPs must follow Public Health England guidance. The mechanics of voting would then be left to the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, to set out, with parliamentarians having to avoid the narrow division lobbies. He has described a single file of MPs snaking through parliament as a \u201csupermarket queue\u201d that will lead through the centre of the chamber to the dispatch box. Unions said the plans will put parliamentary staff at risk from the virus and urged the government to publish any risk assessment of the plans. Amy Leversidge, the FDA union\u2019s assistant general secretary, said Rees-Mogg\u2019s article revealed that \u201crisk assessments are being conducted\u201d. \u201cIt is shameful that with less than 24 hours to go the government are still scrambling to work out how parliament can return safely,\u201d she said.

We have come so far together, we can take these steps together. But do not step too far, the disease is not done yet. We mustn\u2019t throw away the progress that has been made.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although reimposing lockdown measures nationally was not being ruled out, the government was more likely to do so locally.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are attempting to move the system from these national, blanket measures to a more targeted approach - this is why test and trace is such an important part of that.</p> <p>But we have always said that we are prepared to reintroduce measures - whether that is nationally or in response to a localised outbreak - if that is necessary.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of new coronavirus infections were being traced through the new test and trace system.</strong> But he refused to give precise figures, or to say how many contacts were being identified, and what proportion of them were agreeing to self-isolate. <strong>Prof John Newton</strong> from Public Health England said data would be published in due course. When it was put to him that some contact tracers have said they have had nothing to do, Hancock said that was a good thing. He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The level of incidence of disease has come down and so actually we have more capacity than we need, this is a good thing.</p> <p>I think to err on the side of having too many contact tracers is the right side to err on.

But the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, says<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/may/speaker-agrees-to-recall-of-parliament/\"> it is not safe to return to the old system of voting, involving large numbers of MPs crowding into the division lobbies.</a> Instead Rees-Mogg will ask MPs tomorrow to agree to a new system of voting, reportedly one that would involve MPs having to form an enormous queue all around parliament so that they can vote in person while observing social distancing.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/the-virtual-parliament-is-no-longer-necessary-we-can-do-so-much-better\">an article for the House magazine </a>Rees-Mogg explains why he thinks it is so important for MPs to return to the Commons in person. Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It comes down to the quality of communication between MPs and ministers. Politics is better done face-to-face, even if the whites of the ministerial eyes are six feet away. In the chamber frontbenchers will have to keep on their toes as interventions are once again made possible. This exceptional aspect of British democracy, curtailed under the hybrid halfway house, can once again flourish.</p> <p>Out of the chamber, too, MPs will be able to come together - at the right social distance - to represent shared problems faced by those in multiple constituencies. This is what Edmund Burke meant when he wrote that parliament should be a \u201cdeliberative assembly of one nation\u201d rather than a \u201ccongress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests\u201d. Cross-party work is often under-reported but is an important part of our system. With MPs present in Westminster, rather than scattered hither and thither, voters\u2019 interests will be better represented.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour MP <strong>Dame Margaret Hodge</strong>, who is in the \u201cvulnerable\u201d category, says the Rees-Mogg proposal will disenfranchise MPs like her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/margarethodge/status/1267459620399984641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow the Govt wants 650 MPs to stand in a giant queue to vote on how the Commons makes decisions from now on.

He explains: <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As state primary schools in England open today, so too do their independent counterparts, often known as prep schools. Christopher King, the chief executive of the <strong>I</strong><strong>ndependent Association of Prep Schools</strong>, says almost all of the 550 prep schools in England belonging to IAPS have opened to year 6 pupils this morning. Those with nurseries or \u201cpre-prep\u201d are also opening to reception and year 1 age groups, with what King calls a mixture of enthusiasm and apprehension.</p> <p>\u2018The vast majority of prep schools in England are open today, apart from a few that are opening tomorrow. They are enthusiastic about reopening, but for staff and parents there is a degree of apprehension particularly because of the younger year groups and the difficulty in social distancing,\u2019 King said.</p> <p>Like state schools, prep schools remained open for the children of key workers and to provide remote learning for the rest of their pupils. Initial reports of unhappy parents saw many private schools cut their fees by 10%-20% for this term.</p> <p>The situation is different in secondary schools, where neither state nor independent senior schools are reopening for the rest of the school year in England, other than for brief visits by year 10 and year 12 pupils from 15 June. In any case, boarding schools such as Eton would face additional complications in reopening because of the coronavirus regulations around residential education.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> Although in the past it was true that Conservative MPs mostly sent their children to private schools, that is probably not the case now.

On Sunday, the government said 2.2 million high-risk \u201cshielders\u201d in England and Wales will be allowed to go outside for the first time from Monday if they feel \u201ccomfortable\u201d, either with members of their household, or, if they live alone, to meet one other person. These are people who, for the last 10 weeks, have been told to stay in their homes 24/7, without any break for exercise or fresh air. </p> <p>This marks a remarkable U-turn from ministers. Previous guidance advised that people with serious underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or low immunity, would need to shield until the <a href=\"https://shropshireccg.nhs.uk/health-advice/coronavirus-advice/shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-groups/\">end of June</a>.

The latest update \u2013 announced via tweets at 10pm on a Saturday night and trailed in the press \u2013 was like moving the goalposts on the quiet. Rather than hearing it first from a government briefing or from their doctor, shielders had to find out about the change on social media. </p> <p>When I spoke to people affected, the reaction was one of confusion, anxiety, and anger. Some noted that they had been told by their doctors only 24 hours earlier that they would need to shield for at least another month. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m trusting the government\u2019s advice,\u201d was the general response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/relaxing-lockdown-shielders-government-lives\">By relaxing lockdown for shielders, the government is playing with people's lives | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:21:03.559Z\">at 1.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4edfa8f087122eca534f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:05:56.150Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> concluded her speech by speaking directly to young people, who she said will be very frustrated about being stuck inside and unable to see their friends. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This virus can still be very harmful to you.

But at a press conference last week <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020\">Boris Johnson claimed that all five tests were being achieved.</a></p> <p>The five tests were originally set out by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645#block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645\">at a press conference in April</a> (when Johnson was ill). Here they are, with the rival assessments for each test from Johnson in his speech last week and from the ADPH yesterday <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/05/adph-presidential-blog-a-time-for-steady-leadership-careful-preparation-and-measured-steps/\">in its statement.</a></p> <p>The PM says all five tests have been passed. The ADPH accepts that the first test has been met, but on the other four it says it is too soon to be sure.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - NHS\u2019s ability to cope must be protected</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. </p> <p>The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April.</p> <p>On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firstly, the pressure on the NHS \u2013 and those that tirelessly and expertly work within it \u2013 has been significant but it has been able to cope with those who unfortunately need hospital treatment for the effects of Covid-19. The number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 is falling, and beds are available for those that require them.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>2 - Sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.</p> <p>While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Secondly, there must be a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate. While the first peak in deaths has passed, the downward trend is slow \u2013 particularly in care settings. Deaths are a measure of what happened roughly two weeks before \u2013 the effect of easing measures now will only become evident in two weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>3 - Rate of infection decreasing to manageable levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that\u2019s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May.</p> <p>Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied that the third test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The critical debate is about the third test \u2013 ensuring the rate of transmission of the infection continues decreasing to manageable levels (taken to mean R being well below 1). The rapid and multiple ways in which measures are being eased is likely to make it difficult to judge the cumulative impact on R. As we saw in March, R can go above 1 in a very short space of time \u2013 and once it does it can take many months to bring it back down. The room for manoeuvre is tight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>4 - Testing capacity and PPE supply at adequate levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day.</p> <p>We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including face masks, visors, gowns and aprons.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fourth aspect, ensuring supply of tests and PPE is able meet future demand, remains an enormous challenge. PPE manufacturing and supply chains are stronger, but shortages are still being reported and it is not clear that supply can meet new demand as different parts of society, public services and the economy open. While testing capacity has undoubtedly increased, we are not yet confident that the current testing regime is sufficiently effective in getting the priority tests done and the results to where they are needed to enable swift action.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>5 - No risk of a second peak that would overwhelm NHS</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Finally, the fifth test. A second peak cannot be ruled out \u2013 whether it will overwhelm the NHS is an important question to ask. But perhaps the even bigger one is, do we really want the same number of deaths again? The scale to date represents an unimaginable tragedy and we must do everything possible to limit further loss of life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T09:08:58.006Z\">at 10.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b8aa8f08f5e3730122cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:25:11.227Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Directors of Public Health are increasingly concerned that the government is misjudging this balancing act and lifting too many restrictions, too quickly. </p> <p>This is a new disease; evidence is still emerging and there is much uncertainty. However, based on what is currently known, several leading scientists and public health experts have spoken out about a string of recent national policy announcements affecting England which project a degree of confidence that many \u2013 including ADPH members \u2013 do not think is supported by the science.</p> <p>Over the weekend we have seen signs that the public is no longer keeping as strictly to social distancing as it was \u2013 along with this, we are concerned that the resolve on personal hygiene measures, and the need to immediately self-isolate, if symptomatic, is waning. A relentless effort to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>De Gruchy expanded on this in an interview on the Today programme this morning. She said local directors of public health could only be effective if other parts of the anti-coronavirus programme were working too. She went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we need testing, the national testing programme, to be absolutely robust and ready, and we need the NHS test and trace to be robust and ready. And of course the other issue ... is about PPE and the supply of PPE. So all of those organisational challenges that we are all working really hard getting in place - we\u2019re not feeling, just yet, that we are really confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:37:02.406Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b1498f084df971c8d53a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:44:28.682Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than 200 travel and hospitality businesses have joined a campaign urging the government to overturn its planned 14-day quarantine for arrivals into the UK, PA Media reports.</p> <p>The group of major hotels, travel companies and restaurateurs claim the policy is \u201cunworkable\u201d and are calling for air bridges to be created which enable people to travel - without being quarantined - between countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is deemed to be low.</p> <p>George Morgan-Grenville, the chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed.</p> <p>The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than 200 businesses have signed the letter to the home secretory, Priti Patel. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:51:00.035Z\">at 8.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4aade8f08f5e37301227a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:21:09.052Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast is exploring the coronavirus crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons.</p> <p>When Britain went into lockdown in March, most people were confined to their homes with little more than a short daily walk allowed.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for the UK live blog today, thank you for reading. If you want to continue following the latest coronavirus developments, do head over to our global liveblog. Here\u2019s a quick round up of all the latest stories from across the UK today: Thousands return to school in England but many parents still wary. This week marks the start of the government\u2019s phased reopening of schools in England, with pupils in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 returning to classes from 1 June, but a survey of school leaders suggested about half of the 2 million pupils entitled to return this week would not turn up. Public trust in UK government over coronavirus falls sharply. Trust in the UK government as a source of accurate information about the coronavirus has collapsed in recent weeks, suggesting ministers may struggle to maintain lockdown restrictions in the aftermath of the Dominic Cummings affair. Travel in Scotland may be restricted after hundreds flout rules. Nicola Sturgeon has threatened to introduce new laws against travelling for leisure outside local areas after widespread breaches of Scotland\u2019s lockdown rules at the weekend. Shopper numbers surge 36% as lockdown in England relaxed. Shoppers rushed back to high streets and retail parks on Monday with the reopening of car showrooms, markets and some Ikea stores. The number of shoppers soared 36% compared with last week\u2019s bank holiday Monday. Rees-Mogg accused of disenfranchising vulnerable MPs by abandoning electronic voting. He will ask MPs tomorrow to agree to a new system of voting, reportedly one that would involve MPs queuing around parliament to vote in person while observing social distancing. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who is in the \u201cvulnerable\u201d category, says the proposal will disenfranchise MPs like her. Far too soon to ease lockdown in north-east England, leaders warn. Political leaders in the north-east of England have urged residents to disregard the government\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d relaxation of the lockdown amid concerns it will lead to a second spike of coronavirus in a region with the UK\u2019s highest infection rate. UK protesters accuse police of targeting black people during lockdown. Organisers of anti-racism protests in the UK have accused the police of unfairly targeting black people during the lockdown and called for further demonstrations this week. Police Scotland have revealed they gave more than 2,000 people dispersal orders for breaching lockdown regulations over the weekend, after Friday\u2019s easing of Scotland\u2019s lockdown restrictions saw people flooding to beauty spots and beaches. The force said they issued 1,391 \u201ccompliant\u201d dispersal orders between 7am on Friday 29 May and 7am on Monday, as well as 650 dispersal orders \u201cafter police warning\u201d; they issued 16 \u00a360 instant fines but made no arrests. The data was released after Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, warned the Scottish government may seek to strengthen the lockdown regulations by introducing new laws against travelling too far from home. On Friday, people in Scotland were allowed to travel more than five miles from home to see close family, and to see up to 8 people from other households, but only outdoors and two metres apart. The five mile radius rule is not set in statute. However, that advice was ignored by thousands of people; the police had to erect a checkpoint at Drymen, a village near Loch Lomond, as Transport Scotland reported a 200% increase in traffic near the loch on Saturday. Some people camped out overnight, or drove to beauty spots with their caravans and camper vans. She told Monday\u2019s daily press briefing that Scots who ignored the lockdown regulations were putting lives at risk, and threatening a second wave of infections and hospitalisations. If that rate of breaches continued, she said, new legislation was likely. Deputy Chief Constable Matt Kerr said the force was relying on people to accept they had a civic duty to act responsibly; his officers would use persuasion before enforcement. He said: Complying with the legislation about meeting only one other household outdoors at any one time and following the Scottish government\u2019s guidance about avoiding travelling long distances will stop our parks, beaches, lochs and hills from becoming over-crowded. We all want to enjoy our outdoor spaces safely and, whilst our officers will continue to robustly tackle crime and anti-social behaviour, please take reasonable steps to keep yourself safe and act responsibly. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s press conference. Hancock, the health secretary, said that the latest daily figure for the number of UK coronavirus deaths, at 111, was \u201cthe lowest figure since lockdown began on 23 March\u201d. But the figure is only this low because some coronavirus deaths added to the overall total have been treated as historic additions, not new additions (ie, they have been added to previous totals, not yesterday\u2019s.) See 6.01pm. These headline numbers are also an underestimate because they only cover people who tested positive for coronavirus and died. Thousands more people have died from coronavirus without having been tested. Today\u2019s chart (see 5.13pm) also suggests that in recent days the rolling average for the daily number of deaths has been levelling off rather than continuing to fall. Hancock urged people not to throw away the progress made in fighting the disease. He said: We must all remember that in the war against this virus we are all on the same side. We have come so far together, we can take these steps together. But do not step too far, the disease is not done yet. We mustn\u2019t throw away the progress that has been made. He said that, although reimposing lockdown measures nationally was not being ruled out, the government was more likely to do so locally. He said: We are attempting to move the system from these national, blanket measures to a more targeted approach - this is why test and trace is such an important part of that. But we have always said that we are prepared to reintroduce measures - whether that is nationally or in response to a localised outbreak - if that is necessary. He said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of new coronavirus infections were being traced through the new test and trace system. But he refused to give precise figures, or to say how many contacts were being identified, and what proportion of them were agreeing to self-isolate. Prof John Newton from Public Health England said data would be published in due course. When it was put to him that some contact tracers have said they have had nothing to do, Hancock said that was a good thing. He explained: The level of incidence of disease has come down and so actually we have more capacity than we need, this is a good thing. I think to err on the side of having too many contact tracers is the right side to err on. I\u2019d rather have too many people trained and ready to go. Hancock said the new joint biosecurity centre, that will have to assess the coronavirus alert level, was still in the process of being set up. Organisers of anti-racism protests in the UK have accused the police of unfairly targeting black people during the lockdown and called for further demonstrations this week. Protests took place in London, Cardiff, Manchester and Nottingham on Saturday and Sunday against the killing last week of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minnesota, which has led to widespread unrest across the US. As well as showing solidarity with demonstrators in the US, Britons have expressed anger and frustration at the increased use of stop and search during the lockdown in areas with large black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations. The Guardian revealed last week that BAME people in England were 54% more likely to be fined under coronavirus rules than white people. British demonstrations were called spontaneously by young black people who are not affiliated with any organisations. They said they wanted to shine a spotlight on the impact of institutional racism in the UK. During the protests, the rallying cry that \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d was accompanied by Black Lives Matter banners. Aima, 18, who did not wish to give her last name, was one of the organisers of a protest in London on Sunday. She said: \u201cI started the LDNBLM hashtag and it blew off. I didn\u2019t expect that to happen. What inspired me was how much pain I\u2019ve suffered while in the UK. \u201cI moved here from Nigeria when I was 10 and as soon as I came here I experienced a lot of discrimination from the police and from people around me. People need to understand in the UK, we\u2019re suffering too.\u201d The protest was not associated with the more established group Black Lives Matter UK. A spokesperson for the group said: Although we are supporting newly founded groups in their demonstrations, we are currently not calling protests due to the life-threatening reality of the pandemic, which is killing members of our communities at a rate far greater than their white counterparts. We are the first to work, first to die and now, first to fight. Norwich Market, having survived wars, plagues and recessions in over 900 years of trading from the same site, has reawakened once again after the coronavirus shutdown had closed all but a handful of stalls selling food and essential goods. From early Monday morning, traders selling fruit and vegetables, vintage clothing and household items, rearranged their stalls, hoping to entice the shoppers slowly returning to the quiet city centre. Council workers had hurriedly installed a one-way system in the market alleyways and laid floor stickers to encourage shoppers to keep 2 metres apart. A steady trickle of customers were buying seasonal peonies and baby\u2019s breath at Pond\u2019s Flowers, next to Gentleman\u2019s Walk, which has been run by Alexander Pond\u2019s family for more than a century. \u201cWe\u2019re starting on the bottom rung of the ladder, building it back up,\u201d said Kevin Howes, who has worked on the stall with Pond for 25 years. Only about a fifth of the 90 businesses that operate at the market, known for its distinctive candy-striped roofs, had raised their shutters on Monday morning. Many are waiting for high street stores to reopen later this month and for footfall to pick up in the city. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how many traders will come back,\u201d said Mark Wright, the chair of the market traders\u2019 association and owner of Taxi Vintage Clothing, \u201cI hear some have done well online.\u201d Without his own online business, Wright was hoping his rail of floral Hawaiian shirts would catch a shopper\u2019s eye so he could \u201cbreak the ice\u201d and make his first sale in 11 weeks. Wales could place lockdowns on certain parts of the country if hotspots of coronavirus are found, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said he would not rule out \u201cprecise, localised\u201d restrictions on the public if a new contact-tracing system showed spikes of transmissions, despite Wales\u2019 finance minister saying doing so would cause \u201cconfusion\u201d. Drakeford was asked about localised lockdowns at the Welsh government\u2019s daily press briefing, to which he said ministers \u201cdefinitely haven\u2019t ruled out\u201d doing so. I\u2019ve referred to identifying hotspots, and if there are hotspots and the best answer is to take particular measures in that area then that is what we will do. And that would be a very ordinary response to a public health problem, that you take the action in the place where the problem comes to the surface. On Wednesday finance minister Rebecca Evans said local lockdowns were not being considered by the government after being questioned about a recent spike in cases in North Wales. She said: \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re not considering differential lockdowns across different parts of Wales, and part of that is because I think that one of the strengths of the message is it\u2019s a very clear message that applies to everybody equally across Wales. \u201cAnd I think that if you do look for differential lockdowns or lockdowns in small areas, then there is the potential for a great deal of confusion.\u201d Drakeford also ruled out any other sports currently restricted in Wales being allowed until the next review of measures in three weeks\u2019 time, but said there were people who could make \u201ca good case\u201d for why non-team sports like tennis should be made an exception. He added: \u201cWhat I have to explain to them is their exception would be met by somebody else\u2019s exception. \u201cAnd by the time you\u2019ve added all these exceptions up, the risk is considerably bigger than it would be otherwise.\u201d PA Media has obtained an explanation as to why today\u2019s UK coronavirus death figures and yesterday\u2019s don\u2019t appear to add up. (See 5.55pm.) It reports. The number of people in the UK who have died after testing positive for Covid-19 is 556 higher than the equivalent total announced yesterday, although the government is reporting the day-on-day change as 111. The reason for the difference in these two figures is to do with how deaths are being incorporated into historic data retrospectively. Yesterday\u2019s cumulative total announced by the Department of Health was 38,489, which is 556 below today\u2019s cumulative total of 39,045. But since yesterday, 445 deaths have been added to the historic data. These additional deaths are linked to cases that have been identified through testing that has been carried out by commercial partners, rather than testing that has been done in NHS and Public Health England laboratories. Rather than include these 445 deaths in today\u2019s increase, the Department of Health has incorporated them within the previous cumulative total, to create a notional total for yesterday of 38,934 (38,489 + 445). The difference between this notional total of 38,934 and today\u2019s total of 39,045 is 111, and this is the one being reported by the government. UPDATE: And here is the explanation from the Department for Health and Social Care. A spokesperson said: A further change to the reporting process was introduced on 1 June 2020 and affected data from 24 May onwards. Deaths linked to cases identified through \u2018pillar 2\u2019 testing (see \u2018Total and daily UK cases\u2019 section on this page) are included as well as \u2018pillar 1\u2019 cases. All deaths before 24 May 2020 of people who tested positive through \u2018pillar 2\u2019 testing are included in the reported daily figure for 24 May 2020. This change resulted in an additional 445 deaths being included (as at 1 June 2020). Political leaders in the north-east of England have urged residents to disregard the government\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d relaxation of the lockdown amid concerns it will lead to a second spike of coronavirus in a region with the UK\u2019s highest infection rate. Martin Gannon, the leader of Gateshead council, which has the second-highest rate of infections in the UK, said: The current approach from government is reckless and they haven\u2019t put systems in place to keep it safe. Our advice is that [people] should be staying with the initial advice, which was lockdown, stay socially isolated within our homes until such time as we can have an effective testing, tracking and tracing system in place. The north-east has the highest per-capita infection rate of any region in the UK. It is thought to be particularly vulnerable given its relatively high proportion of people with secondary illnesses linked to heavy industry, such as mining and shipbuilding. Of the 10 worst-affected local authorities, the top four are all in the north-east: Sunderland, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Middlesbrough. The region\u2019s current R value \u2013 the number of people an infected person will on average infect \u2013 is the highest in the UK, at 0.8, double the rate in London, according to analysis by Cambridge University scientists working with Public Health England. If the R value reaches 1, it means the virus is spreading. At the start of the press conference Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that there had been 111 new UK deaths, taking the UK total to 39,045. (See 5.13pm.) But yesterday the UK headline total was given as 38,489. That implies an increase of 556, not 111. The Department of Health has yet to explain the discrepancy. Guardian reporters Mattha Busby, Amy Walker and Sally Weale have reported on how the first day back at school (for some children) went today. There were nerves, excitement, laughter \u2013 and some tears \u2013 as children, who have been stuck at home since schools were closed as part of a national lockdown to contain the coronavirus, returned to their classrooms for the first time in 10 weeks. For staff, who have had to work flat out to adapt their schools and timetables to ensure safe social distancing in the Covid era, it was a happy \u2013 though anxious \u2013 moment to see children back in classrooms that have remained largely empty, apart from small numbers of children of key workers and vulnerable pupils. While many parents remained fearful and chose not to send their children back, despite the government\u2019s exhortations, those pupils who arrived could be seen queuing patiently at school entrances, keeping two metres apart, before being welcomed back to school and promptly sent to wash their hands. At Cooper Perry primary school in Stafford, in the West Midlands, head teacher Emily Proffitt said she had been \u201cvery relieved\u201d that the first day back had gone to plan as some reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils returned. She said: I\u2019ve been the most nervous I\u2019ve been as a headteacher. When all the staff came in this morning, you could just see the nervous energy amongst us. Our fears were unwarranted, because the children came in brilliantly. They were automatically social distancing. Even our reception pupils were stood at two-metre intervals down the line. All children are in groups of 15 or smaller, while break times are on a rota to allow each group space to play safely. Teachers have also been encouraged to head out to the school\u2019s playing fields and adjoining forest area for classes because there is less risk of transmission outdoors. A prep school once attended by Boris Johnson is to shut down as a result of the impact of the coronavirus. Ashdown House preparatory school in East Sussex, which has been in existence for 180 years, will close its doors at the end of the academic year after a ruinous downturn in pupil numbers. The independent schools sector in the UK has been severely affected by the coronavirus, which has seen many parents lose income and a significant drop in interest from overseas pupils. As a result, the school was expecting to be less than a third full from September. Announcing the closure, Tom Beardmore-Gray, chief executive of the Cothill trust of which Ashdown is part, said: The harsh reality is that the impact of the coronavirus has changed everything. In recent years the trust has invested heavily in the school, and there has been a relentless drive to keep the school moving forward. Given the challenges the sector as a whole is now facing, it is not possible to maintain this support. He went on: \u201cAshdown is a prestigious school, rich with heritage and tradition. We take some solace from the fact that, while the school is unable to continue, Ashdown\u2019s impact will be felt for generations to come.\u201d The prime minister attended the school in the 1970s. In her latest Guardian column Polly Toynbee says \u201cthe government will not escape the ghosts of needless care-home deaths\u201d. Here is an excerpt. Care beds are essential with over-85s doubling over the next 25 years. But the service needs to be free for rich and poor alike by the time they use it, to stop this financial conflict. There is no better time for brave reform, with care newly valued by all who have stood and clapped. The former Tory pensions minister Ros Altmann has slammed big care companies, \u201cbought up by hedge-funders at knockdown prices, loaded with debt, tripling their money\u201d. If they think they\u2019re too big to fail, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t bail them out, take them over\u201d. [Boris] Johnson is no nationaliser. But families will not forgive the scandal of care-home deaths on his watch, left with tragic images of grandparents dying alone, feared to be without morphine or tranquillisers. Divorced from the NHS, private ownership of social care is a key reason why this horror is happening. And here is the full article. Q: There are thousands of people who cross the England/Scotland border every day. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier if the same advice applied in both countries? Hancock says, in most respects, the advice is the same. He says the two countries are trying to move together as closely as possible. Q: Shielded people in Scotland cannot go out, but shielded people in England can. Who\u2019s right? Newton says they try wherever possible to give the same advice in England and Scotland. But the mechanisms for implementing advice in the two countries are different. And sometimes political decisions are involved, and some of those are devolved. That\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: GPs have said they have been inundated by complaints from worried patients who don\u2019t understand why the shielding advice has been changed so quickly. Hancock says this is important for people. People do not realise how demanding staying at home was for people. So, when the scientific advice changed, it was important to publicise this. Q: How would a localised lockdown work? Would it just cover schools? Or transport too? Hancock says taking local action is \u201can incredibly important part of the toolkit\u201d. It could involve stopping new admissions to a local hospital. The joint biosecurity centre would provide advice to the chief medical officers, who would advice ministers. The toolkit is \u201cas broad as the legal toolkit that we have nationally\u201d, he says. Newton says they would have a \u201cwhole system response\u201d. All services might contribute, he says. If an area had to close a healthcare unit, another area could step in to help. Q: If the R rate goes up, how likely is it that you will reimpose some blanket lockdown measures? Hancock says the government is trying to move to a more targeted approach. But it has always said that, if necessary, it will reintroduce blanket measures. He says he has also changed the basis of the law. It used to say you could not leave your home unless you had a specific reason. Now that has been reversed, he says; now the regulations say you can leave home unless you are doing so for specific reasons. Q: Will we get data this week on what proportion of infected people have been contacted by contact tracers, how many of the people they have been in contact with have been contacted, and how many are complying? Newton says these are new systems. They are quite complicated. A number of different systems are being used. They want to make sure the data is reliable, and they plan to do a bit more work before the results are published. Q: Since the system started last week around 9,000 new cases have been reported. How many of those have been contacted? Hancock says he does not have the number, but it is high. Newton says some people do not need contact tracing. For example, some might be in a care home, he says. He says the system is working well. Figures will be published soon, he says. Q: Does the joint biosecurity centre actually exist? It has no website, and has published no reports. Yes, says Hancock. He says it is being set up at the moment. Q: Some contact tracers have told us they have had very little to do since they started work on Thursday. What is happening? Hancock says the system is up and running, and is successful. He says people being contacted are responding positively when being asked to self-isolate. He says the government has more capacity than it needs. That\u2019s a good thing, he says. Q: How many contacts have been made since Thursday? With 2,000 new cases a day, that should generate quite a lot of work. Hancock says he would rather have too many contact tracers than too few. There are 7,500 clinicians in the system, he says. That means six for every new case. And he says the number of contacts people have is lower than expected. Hancock is now taking questions. Jill from Warrington asks what has changed to allow the advice for people shielding to change. Hancock says asking people to stay at home was hard. So, when the clinical advice changed, the government changed its advice. This is a positive change for people, he says. He says it has been welcomed. (That is not what our colleague Frances Ryan has found. See 1.19pm.) Here is the slide for the number of people being admitted to hospital. And here are the death figures. Hancock says, at 111, the daily figures is the lowest it has been since the lockdown was announced. (This figure just covers people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. There will be other people who will have died from coronavirus without testing positive.) The family of a man who died with Covid-19 after attending the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid march in March are calling for an inquiry into why the match was allowed to go ahead, the BBC has reported. Richard Mawson, 70, was \u201cfit and healthy\u201d before the match on 11 March his wife Mary said. He was admitted to Aintree Hospital two weeks later after developing Covid-19 symptoms which left him \u201ccompletely breathless\u201d, and he died on 17 April. The match was attended by 52,000 people, including around 3,000 Madrid fans who travelled to Anfield when Spain was already under partial lockdown due to a high number of Covid-19 cases. The government halted football two days later, but Mary says it was too late. \u201cYou go and do what your government tells you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government acted too late.\u201d Richard\u2019s son Jamie said he was certain his father had caught the virus at the game and his sudden downturn in health had been a severe shock. Public health authorities are already investigating a potential link between the match and a potential coronavirus rise in the city. Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, said he had commissioned \u201ca full investigation into any potential link between that match and the situation with coronavirus in the city.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s metro mayor, Steve Rotheram, has also called for an independent inquiry. The scientist leading the UK\u2019s largest Covid-19 tracking project has said the Cheltenham Festival and the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid match \u201ccaused increased suffering and death\u201d and rates of cases locally \u201cincreased several-fold\u201d . A government spokesperson said: \u201cThere are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age, general health, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve.\u201d Hancock starts with testing numbers. He says the government has the capacity now to carry out 206,444 tests per day. That is important, he says. It means anyone who needs a test should get one. And he says the number of confirmed cases, at 1,570, is the lowest it has been since 25 March (which was two days after the lockdown was announced). Hancock is starting now. He says he is going to introduce the daily slides. Normally the minister leading the press conference lets one of the medical or scientific experts introduce the slides. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is taking the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. It is due to start any minute now. He will be joined by Prof John Newton from Public Health England, who is overseeing the government\u2019s testing programme. Labour has united with almost all the other opposition parties in the Commons behind a move to reject Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s plan to abandon electronic voting and hybrid debates (ie, with some MPs participating by Zoom) tomorrow. (See 4.05pm.) They are backing an amendment that would keep the arrangements that have been in operation during the lockdown. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, said: Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s discriminatory proposals would result in two classes of MPs. Those who can physically attend and those unable to owing to the government\u2019s own rules, including having an underlying health condition or shielding responsibilities. The abolition of the hybrid remote parliament which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances is discriminatory and would not be acceptable in any other workplace. We remain ready to work with the government and all parties to reach a consensus that would allow all MPs to participate on an equal basis. The amendment has been signed by MPs from Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Greens, the SDLP and the Alliance party. But there is no signatory from the DUP. A major survey of doctors has revealed fears around a second peak overwhelming the health service, as lockdown measures are relaxed in England. The British Medical Association\u2019s (BMA) latest tracker survey of more than 7,000 doctors found that almost half of respondents were not confident in their ability to manage a second influx of Covid-19 cases. The latest ONS figures indicate there remains significant community spread of the infection \u2013 with an estimated 8,000 new cases daily. The BMA said to reduce the risk of a second peak, government priorities must be: A widescale, accurate and systematic approach to test, trace, isolate, support and follow up with people with Covid-19 symptoms or those who have come into contact with people with symptoms. To take mitigating actions preventing the public and workers from contracting and spreading the virus while carrying out essential duties. Supporting the public in adhering to social distancing and infection control measures as restrictions are relaxed. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: As the government relaxes lockdown measures, we absolutely must not forget that the infection rate in the community remains worryingly high, with 8,000 new cases daily. The risk from this highly infectious illness remains significant and if there is further spread thousands more families could lose loved ones before their time. Doctors working on the front line are therefore rightfully worried about the devastating impact a second peak could have for their patients, the health service and the wider population. This is not the time to be complacent. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate continues to rise, the Ministry of Justice daily update shows. As at 5pm on Sunday, 466 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 79 prisons, a 1.5% increase in three days. The number of prison staff with the virus increased 2% to 923 workers across 105 prisons in the same period. The figures are not live cases and include those who have recovered. There are around 80,000 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. So far, 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. And Public Health Wales has reported five more coronavirus deaths in Wales, taking the total to 1,347. The full figure are here. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has recorded one more coronavirus death, taking the total to 524. The full details are here. Public trust in the UK government as a source of accurate information about the coronavirus has collapsed in recent weeks, suggesting ministers may struggle to maintain lockdown restrictions in the aftermath of the Dominic Cummings affair, our colleague Jim Waterson reports. Millions of sub-standard masks and thousands of fake hand sanitisers have been seized from Heathrow airport during the since the outbreak of Covid-19. Trading standards teams have stopped 6.5m sub-standard face masks and 8,000 counterfeit hand sanitisers coming through the airport since the pandemic started, according to London Trading Standards (LTS). LTS reports that the majority of masks seized had been labelled with false claims or fake safety certificates and around 4.25m had to undergo label amendments before they were subsequently released. However, 2.25m have been found not to comply with legal safety standards. Trading standards teams examined a further 1.5m face masks and no issues were found. The teams also seized 8,000 fake hand sanitisers, branded Andrex and Comfort. Suspicions were raised as they had identical packaging and labelling, except for the brand name, and the same batch code on the entire consignment. A further 4,500 hand sanitisers with false labelling were seized at the airport, according to LTS. As well as stopping dodgy imports, trading standards are increasingly concerned about unsafe UK-made hand sanitisers being sold that fail to meet safety standards. Tower Hamlets trading standards have, for example, recently found UK-made hand sanitiser on sale online from a local shop that contains the banned substance Triclosan. Ealing council\u2019s trading standards team recently detained 454,500 face masks described as \u201canti-virus\u201d, where fake safety certification was supplied. The borough also seized 3,390 hand sanitisers, which lacked any legally required information regarding ingredients, batch, traceability, warnings or instructions. Tomorrow MPs return to the Commons after the Whitun recess. As Toby Helm reported in the Observer at the weekend, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has abandoned the system that allowed MPs to vote remotely. But the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, says it is not safe to return to the old system of voting, involving large numbers of MPs crowding into the division lobbies. Instead Rees-Mogg will ask MPs tomorrow to agree to a new system of voting, reportedly one that would involve MPs having to form an enormous queue all around parliament so that they can vote in person while observing social distancing. In an article for the House magazine Rees-Mogg explains why he thinks it is so important for MPs to return to the Commons in person. Here\u2019s an excerpt. It comes down to the quality of communication between MPs and ministers. Politics is better done face-to-face, even if the whites of the ministerial eyes are six feet away. In the chamber frontbenchers will have to keep on their toes as interventions are once again made possible. This exceptional aspect of British democracy, curtailed under the hybrid halfway house, can once again flourish. Out of the chamber, too, MPs will be able to come together - at the right social distance - to represent shared problems faced by those in multiple constituencies. This is what Edmund Burke meant when he wrote that parliament should be a \u201cdeliberative assembly of one nation\u201d rather than a \u201ccongress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests\u201d. Cross-party work is often under-reported but is an important part of our system. With MPs present in Westminster, rather than scattered hither and thither, voters\u2019 interests will be better represented. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who is in the \u201cvulnerable\u201d category, says the Rees-Mogg proposal will disenfranchise MPs like her. Criminals are exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic and targeting those most vulnerable at home and in the care sector, Scotland\u2019s serious organised crime taskforce has said. Reports of incidents involving organised crime groups have included: A care home in the Forth Valley area was left without PPE after the supplier claimed they had not received the \u00a310,000 payment, despite it being sent. A police investigation showed that the payment had been moved from the bank account it was paid into and they believe organised criminals were behind it. A number of reports of people knocking doors and offering to disinfect the householder\u2019s driveway to rid it of any Covid-19 for a fee. Businesses emailed by scammers urging them to click on an official-looking link for a \u00a325,000 grant. The link leads to a fake \u2018UK government\u2019-branded website asking for business and banking details. \u00a310,000 fraud intercepted by Scottish Borders Council when an application for a business support grant was hacked by criminals who requested the redirection of the payment to a different bank account. Due to the checks in place the council were alert to the scam and the money was not paid out. Humza Yousaf, justice secretary and chair of the taskforce, said: People are understandably concerned about their health, and that of their family, as well as concerned about their jobs. It is abhorrent, but not unexpected, that these groups are looking to exploit those fears and concerns. Police Scotland assistant chief constable Angela McLaren said: During the current pandemic, we are seeing targeted attempts by fraudsters to adapt well-known techniques to include references to coronavirus, lockdown measures and PPE. We remain vigilant to this and circulate alerts and preventative messages, not just those associated with Covid-19, where appropriate. According to Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), attendance at primary schools in England today seemed to be \u201chighly variable\u201d, with head teachers reporting that the attendance ranges between 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils. Although we have been talking about schools \u201creopening\u201d (which is the experience for most parents), schools have largely stayed open during the lockdown for the children of key workers and for children who are deemed vulnerable. According to Department for Education statistics, 80% of schools were open in late May. But only 2.6% of pupils were in school, which is less than was expected when the key worker/vulnerable children exemptions were announced at the start of lockdown. Barton said that, with some primary school pupils going back, he expected more pupils in the two exemption groups to start returning. He said: School leaders are also reporting that they are seeing an increase in the number of key worker children who are attending across all year groups. Schools have remained open to vulnerable and key worker children throughout the lockdown period, and as the lockdown eases, it is likely this will lead to greater demand for places. This will be extremely challenging for primary schools to accommodate, particularly small primary schools, in addition to bringing in the eligible year groups. Almost 2.5 million Britons have not been screened, tested or treated for cancer because the Covid-19 pandemic has led to \u201cenormous disruption\u201d of NHS care for the disease, experts have warned. More than 24,000 cases of cancer have gone undiagnosed as a result of the suspension of normal services while delays in treatment mean some people\u2019s disease is now inoperable, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says. Analysis by the charity has found there is a backlog of what it estimates to be 2.1 million people across the UK waiting to undergo screening for breast, bowel or cervical cancer because the NHS has not offered those appointments while hospitals have been busy tackling Covid-19. As a result 3,800 people whose cancer would usually have been picked up by screening have gone undiagnosed, CRUK believes. Another 20,300 cancers have also been missed because an estimated 290,000 people were not urgently referred by their GP for investigation within two weeks of possible cancer symptoms, it says. The suspension of much normal NHS care during the lockdown has also meant that 12,750 fewer cancer patients have had surgery, 6,000 fewer have received chemotherapy and 2,800 fewer have undergone radiotherapy. Services were put on hold to reduce the risk of people with cancer, who have lower immunity, contracting coronavirus if they came into hospital for treatments. \u201cMy colleagues and I have seen the devastating impact this pandemic has had on both patients and NHS staff. Delays to diagnosis and treatment could mean that some cancers will become inoperable,\u201d said Prof Charles Swanton, CRUK\u2019s chief clinician. Police in England can tell people to leave someone\u2019s home if they are breaching new lockdown rules but cannot make them go, according to guidance issued to forces. Gatherings of up to six people can now take place outdoors, for example in open spaces or in private gardens, but people are banned from staying overnight anywhere other than the place where they are living. Any indoor gatherings of two or more people are also prohibited unless they are members of the same household or fall under a short list of exceptions to the rule. A document from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) and College of Policing said: You may only direct a person to return home. There are no powers in the regulations to remove someone or use force. Fixed-penalty notices (FPNs) and arrest still apply, where appropriate. The document also points out the laws put in place \u201cprovide no power of entry\u201d and Downing Street said police did not have the power to enter gardens to check numbers. However, officers still have existing powers at their disposal to gain entry to a property where they suspect illegal activity to be taking place. In public places \u201cdirection, removal and/or use of force can still be used\u201d, the guidance said, adding: \u201cIf you are lawfully in a private place you can only direct a prohibited gathering to disperse, or any person in the gathering to return home. \u201cFPNs and arrest still apply, where appropriate.\u201d The latest laws define a gathering as two or more people \u201ctogether in the same place in order to engage in any form of social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity with each other\u201d. Tourism leaders in Wales have signed an open letter calling for clear reopening dates and consistency with the leisure and tourism sector elsewhere in the UK, saying the negative impact of the extended lockdown \u201ccould be felt for years to come\u201d. Leaders from some of the most popular visitor attractions in Wales wrote to first minister Mark Drakeford calling for urgent clarity around dates for reopening. The letter, signed by over forty bosses from a range of tourist destinations including Snowdon Mountain Railway, Zip World and the National Botanic Garden of Wales, warns of \u201cwriting off 2020 for Welsh tourism\u201d without a clear roadmap to reopening such as those published in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The letter reads: What needs to be made clear is that nearly 100% of Welsh tourism is fast approaching the half way point of its trading season and is in real danger of running out of time. This really is \u2018harvest time\u2019 for our leisure and tourism industry here in Wales. The UK population are now choosing to plan or book England and Scotland destinations for their summer break, day trips or family holiday. Wales will not just be three weeks behind the other countries but will lose out altogether on the tourism volumes and market share. Shoppers rushed back to high streets and retail parks on Monday as the reopening of car showrooms, markets and some Ikea stores marked the easing of lockdown restrictions in England. The number of shoppers out and about soared 36% across all retail destinations compared with last week\u2019s bank holiday Monday, and was up 21% on Monday two weeks ago, according to analysts at Springboard. \u201cIt appears that even though only markets and car showrooms have opened today in addition to essential stores, shoppers are heading back into bricks and mortar destinations,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s insights director. While the vast majority of non-essential stores, including clothing, shoe and toy stores, will not reopen until 15 June, a range of other retailers selling products classed as essential such as DIY, furniture and bicycles, have gradually been reopening under lockdown. Ikea is the latest in a wave of furniture stores to open in the last few weeks, including Dunelm, Furniture Village, DFS and ScS. A council leader has called for stricter travel rules following the weekend\u2019s chaotic beach scenes in Dorset which saw three people seriously injured after jumping off cliffs into the sea. Councillor Vikki Slade, the leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, has written to local MPs and the chief constable of Dorset Police after widespread scenes of irresponsible behaviour witnessed across the area\u2019s beaches, including at the limestone arch of Durdle Door. She said she had witnessed first-hand incidents of people failing to adhere to social distancing rules, illegal parking, widespread barbecues and staff facing abuse when going about their work. Slade said many of the visitors to the beaches were people who had travelled from outside of the county. We have asked the police for extra support in enforcing social distancing and we have been told that we are policed by consent and that this is not practical, and that the capacity of the police makes it impossible to achieve. We have even been asked to stop councillors and residents from calling the police when they have concerns about gatherings, groups and breaches. We saw the most awful scenes in Durdle Door with the arrival of two helicopters to deal with the stupidity of people jumping from the top of cliffs, cheered and clapped by thousands of beachgoers. We saw the kettling of people to give space to the helicopters and the closely packed paths as people were told to leave. We have seen crowds on our beaches, in large groups clearly not from the same household, we have had council officers spat at, abused and intimidated as they go about their work, and I am asking you all to go back to ministers in Westminster and ask them to put a travel restriction on England, as they have done in Wales and Scotland. In those devolved nations you can only travel five miles from home for reasons other than work or risk fines, and I am asking that a similar policy is brought in for England with immediate effect. After the three men were seriously injured in Saturday\u2019s incident after jumping from the top of the Durdle Door arch, the popular beauty spot and nearby Lulworth Cove were closed. However on Sunday, scores of people defied attempts to close the beach and so-called tombstoners could even be seen jumping from the 200ft high sea arch. NHS England has announced 108 new deaths in hospital of people who tested positive for coronavirus bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,722. The full figures are here. Of the 108 new deaths announced on Monday, 13 occurred on 31 May, 40 occurred on 30 May and 16 occurred on 29 May. For reference, here are the equivalent NHS England headline death figures for the last two weeks. Today\u2019s figure is higher than last Monday\u2019s (a bank holiday), but lower than a fortnight ago. Monday 18 May - 122 Tuesday 19 May - 174 Wednesday 20 May - 166 Thursday 21 May - 187 Friday 22 May - 121 Saturday 23 May - 157 Sunday 24 May - 147 Monday 25 May - 59 Tuesday 26 May - 116 Wednesday 27 May - 183 Thursday 28 May - 185 Friday 29 May - 149 Saturday 30 May - 146 Sunday 31 May - 85 Earlier in the comments PaulyLans asked this. My colleague Richard Adams, the Guardian\u2019s education editor, says that, although there have been a lot of claims on social media to the effect that private schools are refusing to bring pupils back in the way that state schools in England are being ordered to, in reality that\u2019s not the case. He explains: As state primary schools in England open today, so too do their independent counterparts, often known as prep schools. Christopher King, the chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools, says almost all of the 550 prep schools in England belonging to IAPS have opened to year 6 pupils this morning. Those with nurseries or \u201cpre-prep\u201d are also opening to reception and year 1 age groups, with what King calls a mixture of enthusiasm and apprehension. \u2018The vast majority of prep schools in England are open today, apart from a few that are opening tomorrow. They are enthusiastic about reopening, but for staff and parents there is a degree of apprehension particularly because of the younger year groups and the difficulty in social distancing,\u2019 King said. Like state schools, prep schools remained open for the children of key workers and to provide remote learning for the rest of their pupils. Initial reports of unhappy parents saw many private schools cut their fees by 10%-20% for this term. The situation is different in secondary schools, where neither state nor independent senior schools are reopening for the rest of the school year in England, other than for brief visits by year 10 and year 12 pupils from 15 June. In any case, boarding schools such as Eton would face additional complications in reopening because of the coronavirus regulations around residential education. UPDATE: Although in the past it was true that Conservative MPs mostly sent their children to private schools, that is probably not the case now. This is from the Labour MP Karl Turner. The Downing Street lobby briefing has now finished. Here are the main points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman suggested that the government is backing away from its plan for all primary school pupils in England to spend at least a month in school before the start of the summer holidays. In its coronavirus recovery plan (pdf) the government said it wanted \u201call primary school children [in England] to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible\u201d. Asked if that was still the plan, the spokesman said this proposal remained \u201cunder review\u201d. The spokesman also said the government accepted that some primary schools were not able to reopen today. He said: We have only taken this step because we believe it is safe to do so. The medical evidence considered by government scientists has been published. It\u2019s hugely important that children do have the opportunity to get back into school and to learn but we are doing this in a very cautious and safe way. We fully understand that there will be some schools who feel that they need more time to prepare. The spokesman indicated that the government backed a call from Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, for children to get catch-up tuition during the summer holidays. Asked about this proposal, the spokesman said the government wanted to ensure young people did not miss out. He went on: We are [looking at] what additional measures may be required to ensure every child has the support they need, including over the summer. Downing Street urged people not to abandon social distancing rules. Asked about reports that in some places over the sunny weekend people people seemed to have abandoned social distancing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: Over the course of the pandemic people across the country have made huge sacrifices and we thank them for it. We all need to still play our part. And it\u2019s important that people should continue to follow social distancing guidelines and to stay two metres apart. We will only continue to keep the virus under control if people continue to follow social distancing rules. No 10 rejected calls for the easing of lockdown to be paused. Asked about the statement from the Association of Directors of Public Health (see 9.25am) saying it was too soon the relax the lockdown, the spokesman said the changes being made were \u201climited and ... cautious\u201d and that the government was only implementing them because it had met its five tests. (The ADPH does not accept that the five tests are being met. See 10.02am.) The spokesman also claimed it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that the measures taken to relax the lockdown in England would push R, the reproduction number, back above 1. He said: We have worked to gradually and safely ease the lockdown measures, the consensus from the scientists is if test and trace is up and running and the public follow the social distancing guidance then it\u2019s unlikely the measures will push the R above one. The spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision to start easing the lockdown in England even though the Covid alert level has not fallen. In its recovery plan (pdf) published last month, the government said: The content and timing of the second stage of adjustments will depend on the most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus. The five tests set out in the first chapter must justify changes, and they must be warranted by the current alert level. At the time the government said that the alert level would have to go down from 4, the current level, to 3 before the current restrictions could be eased. Here is a slide it produced at the time. But the alert level, which is determined by the joint biosecurity centre, is still at 4, even though restrictions are being eased in England. Asked to justify this, the spokesman said that the alert level was \u201cmoving down from 4 to 3\u201d and that the five tests had been met. The spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision to issue new advice to the 2.5m people in the \u201cshielding\u201d category (extremely clinically vulnerable) at the weekend. (See 1.19pm.) He said it was a \u201cvery cautious change\u201d, issued in accordance with medical and scientific advice. But he refused to say the move had been explicitly authorised by Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The announcement caught those affected by surprise. One person who did not know it was coming was Dr Nikita Kanani, head of primary care at NHS England. The spokesman said the police would be expected to \u201cexercise discretion\u201d when enforcing rules that technically make it illegal for a couple not living together to have sex indoors. See 10.38am. Asked about this apparent consequence of the way the regulations have been drafted, the spokesman also stressed that the police did not have the power to enter people\u2019s homes to investigate alleged breaches of lockdown rules. \u201cThey cannot enter your home unless they suspect serious criminal activity is taking place,\u201d the spokesman said. The spokesman said the government had not been including figures for the number of individuals tested in its recent daily testing figures because one of the government\u2019s commercial partners doing testing had not provided figures. The spokesman said there was no requirement for MPs to vote on the move to impose quarantine on people arriving in the UK. There has been speculation that, if there were a vote, the government might be at risk of losing because so many Tory MPs oppose the plan. The spokesman did not deny reports in the Sunday papers saying that Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Alok Sharma, the business secretary, would be included in a beefed-up coronavirus inner cabinet. Currently all key decisions are taken at the No 10 C-19 morning meeting, attended by Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock. The spokesman said that a series of organisational changes were being made and that there would be an announcement in the next couple of days. The spokesman said the UK was opposed to Russia being re-admitted to the G7. But, asked about President Trump\u2019s plan to invite Russia to attend the next G7 summit, the spokesman said it was customary for the G7 host country to invite non-members to attend. The spokesman said the attacks on journalists covering the rioting in America were \u201cvery concerning\u201d. The spokesman was unable to say how many people with coronavirus have had their contacts traced through the new test and trace system that went live last week. But he confirmed that the system was not yet operating at full capacity. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is taking the government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. The cabinet will meet tomorrow, the spokesman said. The first horse race in Britain since the coronavirus lockdown has been won by Zodiakos in Newcastle. Trained by Roger Fell and ridden by James Sullivan, Zodiakos won the Betway Welcome Back British Racing handicap at Newcastle racecourse - the first race in Britain since meetings were last held on 17 March. Follow all the latest coverage with our horse racing live blog: Early indications suggest the number of pupils back in the classroom across England today varies significantly depending on local area. Schools have begun reopening to pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 in England, and nurseries have also opened their doors to more children. However, a survey of councils by the PA Media news agency has found dozens of local authorities across England, predominantly in the north, are advising against a return to school on Monday amid safety concerns. Some have raised concerns the test and trace programme is not yet \u201crobust enough\u201d to sufficiently reduce Covid-19 transmission in schools, where social distancing is hard to maintain with children. But in some areas of England - such as Kingston and Richmond in London - local authorities report the vast majority of primary schools are providing some provision for priority year groups from Monday. It is not yet clear how many parents opted to send their children back to school but a recent survey suggests heads were expecting around half of families to keep pupils at home. Cathy Moden, headteacher of Hiltingbury infant school in Chandler\u2019s Ford, Hampshire, said she had anticipated 45 of the 90 children in reception to attend on Monday but only 39 turned up. Kieron Smith, from Blyth in Northumberland, who has a son in reception, told PA he would not be sending his child back to school until he has more confidence in the government\u2019s approach. \u201cAll in all, it\u2019s not worth it. It\u2019s not a risk I\u2019m able to tolerate. The government have not assured us of our children\u2019s safety.\u201d The government\u2019s aim is for all primary school pupils to return to school before the summer break. In a message to heads ahead of the reopening, Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: We will be arguing that a full return before the summer break is not possible based on the advice we have from the Department for Education. Despite the narrative from the government, the level of confidence for a return to schools remains low. The next few days will reveal whether the government has passed the confidence test. We will discover how many families feel confident to come to school. And we will get a sense of the reaction from staff too. Telling the most vulnerable they can now go out fits the \u2018good news\u2019 narrative. But where is the evidence behind this U-turn? The announcement came out of the blue. On Sunday, the government said 2.2 million high-risk \u201cshielders\u201d in England and Wales will be allowed to go outside for the first time from Monday if they feel \u201ccomfortable\u201d, either with members of their household, or, if they live alone, to meet one other person. These are people who, for the last 10 weeks, have been told to stay in their homes 24/7, without any break for exercise or fresh air. This marks a remarkable U-turn from ministers. Previous guidance advised that people with serious underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or low immunity, would need to shield until the end of June. And there was no mention of an anticipated change in last week\u2019s announcement easing lockdown for the wider public, nor any advance warning to health professionals. Disability organisations and charities appear to have been taken aback by the move, with the MS Society telling me they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d. From the outset of the pandemic, the government\u2019s communication to shielders has been found wanting, to the extent that many didn\u2019t even know how long they were supposed to shield for. The latest update \u2013 announced via tweets at 10pm on a Saturday night and trailed in the press \u2013 was like moving the goalposts on the quiet. Rather than hearing it first from a government briefing or from their doctor, shielders had to find out about the change on social media. When I spoke to people affected, the reaction was one of confusion, anxiety, and anger. Some noted that they had been told by their doctors only 24 hours earlier that they would need to shield for at least another month. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m trusting the government\u2019s advice,\u201d was the general response. Nicola Sturgeon concluded her speech by speaking directly to young people, who she said will be very frustrated about being stuck inside and unable to see their friends. This virus can still be very harmful to you. Even if you yourself are not adversely affected, you can still pass the virus on to other young people, who can then pass it on to parents and grandparents, who are at a greater risk of becoming seriously ill. So please do think of that wider risk when considering your own behaviour in the coming weeks and months. She added: \u201cLets remember that each decision we take as an individual, will affect the safety and wellbeing of all of us.\u201d Thousands of people have been queuing outside Ikea stores after the furniture chain reopened 19 shops in England and Northern Ireland. Some customers reported waiting for four hours to enter stores as they opened for the first time in nearly three months at 10am on Monday. Pictures showed huge numbers of people snaking across car parks and even alongside a road in Belfast, while maintaining strict social distancing rules. One Twitter user reported a \u201cfive-mile queue\u201d outside the Ikea store in Nottingham, while in Warrington the traffic was reportedly causing a gridlock stretching back to the M62. Ikea said a limited number of customers were being allowed into its 19 stores including Warrington, where hundreds of people were pictured waiting on Monday morning. A maximum of two people per household were allowed into each shop, which were accepting cashless payments only. The Swedish chain said \u201csocial distancing wardens\u201d were patrolling each of its stores to ensure customers stick to the 2-metre rules. Northern Ireland\u2019s hotels can reopen from 20 July as long as the rate of infection is under control, Stormont\u2019s economy minister, Diane Dodds, said. The industry has been devastated by a shutdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic in March. Dodds said: Covid-19 has presented an unprecedented challenge for our tourism industry, as it has for tourism markets around the world. I believe the time is right to provide the tourist accommodation sector with clarity about opening dates. I want to build upon the positive progress in managing the spread of the virus and begin to reopen our tourism industry in a safe and managed way. The 20 July date covers guesthouses, guest accommodation, B&amp;Bs, hotels and hostels, as well as holiday and home parks, caravan sites and self-catering properties - although the latter may be opened earlier depending on scientific advice. Sturgeon warned that if people in Scotland continue to flout lockdown restrictions, measures which are currently only put in place as guidelines will be enforced as law. If there is continued evidence of even a minority not abiding by these guidelines and travelling unnecessarily, if people meet up in larger groups or if they\u2019re making journeys which risk spreading the virus, we will have to put these restrictions on group size and travel distance into law - and we won\u2019t hesitate to do that. The stipulation that no more than two households should meet is already in enforced as law in Scotland, she added. Police in Scotland were forced to disperse people five times more often on Saturday than the previous week, as people flouted social distancing rules as the lockdown was eased. Nicola Sturgeon said she was pleased to see the majority of people enjoying long-awaited family reunions over the weekend stuck to the social distancing rules, but said there were many who did not. On Saturday, the police in Scotland recorded 797 dispersals, people being moved on for not following social distancing guidance, she said. She said there were also cases of people driving more than five miles to beauty spots, and people staying overnight in tents, caravans and campervans. Transport in Scotland was up 70% on Sunday compared with the week before, Sturgeon said. In some places, such as Loch Lomond and Glen Coe, the increase was even higher, she added - up to three times higher. The latest coronavirus figures from Scotland, as first minister Nicola Sturgeon begins her press conference: A further 18 confirmed cases, taking the total to 15,418. 1,046 Covid-19 patients in hospital, a decrease of 27 from yesterday. 27 Covid-19 patients in intensive care, the same as yesterday 3,695 Covid-19 patients have now recovered and left hospital 1 further death, taking the total death toll in Scotland to 2,363. Sturgeon warned that the recording of deaths over the weekend tends to be lower than other days of the week. Last week she reported three deaths on Monday, but 18 on Tuesday. With schools in England reopening their doors to pupils today, parents have been in touch to say some pupils in year 6 - the final year of primary school in two-tier systems - have been told they are unable to return, with priority instead going to reception and year 1. Katherine Blaker has a son in year 6, and has been told by his school it is \u201cunable to accommodate year 6s back to school safely\u201d at any point before the end of the academic year. She is concerned about the wellbeing and mental health implications for children navigating the transition to secondary school without support. I am angry that little consideration appears to have been given to the long-term impact on our children\u2019s wellbeing and ability to settle and be productive at secondary school. We know from research that a disrupted transition period can impact on children for several years into their secondary education and at a sensitive time emotionally and socially. Government guidance suggests schools should prioritise reception and year 1 where space is limited. Blaker suggested that schools could dedicate the last two weeks of the summer term to year 6, alongside secondary schools, with transition activities. She added: While I am sympathetic to the pressures on schools and teachers, I am concerned that the way in which the wellbeing and mental health needs of year 6 children have been deprioritised. A survey of 2,000 school leaders by the NAHT headteachers\u2019 union found 72% were planning to bring back year 6 today, 71% reception class and 62% year 1. Worshippers feel \u201cdisappointment and hurt\u201d at not being able to visit places of worship, despite some shops being allowed to open to the public, a bishop has said. As of Monday, car showrooms and outdoor markets in England are allowed to reopen while non-essential shops can start to trade again from 15 June. But places of worship remain shut, with the government saying they could open for individual or private prayer before opening up for small weddings and services. The continued closure is a blow for worshippers, the bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, said, with questions being raised about how and where lockdown restrictions are being eased. There is no doubt that a second wave of the virus could be devastating for our way of life. Yet with shops reopening and some people appearing to be returning to a degree of normality, it is understandable that questions are being raised as to how and where the lockdown is being relaxed. Churchgoers are amongst those feeling real disappointment and hurt, as places of worship remain closed to the public. She said the Church of England (CoE) was working with local churches to develop a detailed plan to help them open for individual prayer as well as weddings and eventually services. We believe it could help bring healing and strength to many who are hurting amid this traumatic time, with our churches acting in so many places at the centre of community life, which is now beginning to resume. It comes after the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said people of faith may find it \u201cstrange\u201d that places of worship would remain closed when shops and other places may open in the coming weeks and months. At the Downing Street briefing on Sunday, he said: I understand how important it is for millions of people in this country, and I can understand how people of faith would consider it strange that shops, cafes, pubs, restaurants, many other settings, might be open in the weeks and months ahead, but not somewhere as important as a place of worship. I think the first logical step is probably to open places of worship for individual or private prayer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards with the faith leaders. The government\u2019s Social Security Advisory Committee, a statutory body that scrutinises welfare policy and makes recommendations to ministers, has said that some benefit claimants are unfairly losing out because they are not eligible for a coronavirus-related increase. When the crisis struck, the Treasury approved a \u00a31,000 annual increase in universal credit (UC). But the same increase was not available to people on employment support allowance or jobseekers\u2019 allowance, two of the \u201clegacy\u201d benefits being replaced by UC. In a letter (pdf) to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, the SSAC\u2019s interim chairwoman Liz Sayce called for action to help those who are not on UC. The SSAC was told that the legacy benefits were excluded because they could not be changed quickly or safely and would have required overcoming \u201cserious IT challenges\u201d. Sayce said: While we understand the reasons for not including ESA and JSA in the original announcement, we are of the strong view that it is increasingly untenable for this group of claimants to be excluded and to continue to have a lower level of income than those in receipt of universal credit and working tax credit. We recommend that the government finds a way to ensure that this group of claimants, that includes some of the least well-off, are brought up to the same level as those in receipt of universal credit as soon as it is possible to do so. On \u201cgrounds of equity\u201d, the government should consider backdating the increase to 6 April, she added. As our colleague Richard Adams reports in the Guardian today, a survey conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research found that primary school heads expect 47% of families in England to keep their children at home today. This morning the GMB union says a survey of 1,601 of its members on Friday found that more than 80% said they did not intend to send children back to school today. Given that GMB members are more likely than average parents to be Labour supporters, this might not be particularly surprising. Some YouGov polling from last month found support for the government\u2019s policy of reopening primary schools for some pupils in England from today varies considerably along party lines. Conservative supporters mostly approve, and Labour supporters mostly disapprove. England\u2019s three-match rugby league Ashes series against Australia in October and November has been cancelled \u201cwith great reluctance and disappointment\u201d. The competition had been revived after a 17-year absence and talks have already begun about a series in 2022 after next year\u2019s World Cup. Ralph Rimmer, the Rugby League chief executive, said We make this announcement with great reluctance and disappointment, as we had been looking forward so much to welcoming the Kangaroos for the revival of the Ashes in 2020. The prospect of the series had captured the imagination of our players, broadcast and commercial partners, supporters and media alike. However the current circumstances have had a seismic impact on rugby league, as on all other sports, and we all now need to give in order to find solutions for the greater and longer-term good of the game. Good news for soap fans, Coronation Street will resume filming next week, bosses have confirmed - but without kissing scenes or older cast members. Filming will start again at the show\u2019s studios in Trafford, Greater Manchester, on 9 June, with cast and crew having their temperatures checked on a daily basis. Coronation Street actor Andrew Whyment, who plays Kirk Sutherland, said \u201cthere definitely will be no kissing scenes\u201d. Cast \u201cwho are over the age of 70 or have an underlying health condition won\u2019t be on set in the initial period of filming\u201d, ITV has said. Those who fall into a clinically vulnerable category will \u201cfollow an individual risk assessment process, which will enable them to return to work if it is safe for them to do so\u201d. Older cast members include William Roache (Ken Barlow), Barbara Knox (Rita Tanner) and Maureen Lipman (Evelyn Plummer). The number of episodes to air will continue to be fewer than before the pandemic, at three a week initially. Series producer, Iain MacLeod, said: The whole team at Coronation Street has pulled together to generate an ingenious, intricate set of protocols to allow filming to restart as safely as humanly possible. We are really pleased to be able to resume making the nation\u2019s favourite soap at a time when people need the reassurance of their regular Corrie fix more than ever. ITV said that the return to filming will ensure the soap, which celebrates its 60th anniversary in December, stays on air in July. Intensive cleaning and sanitisation of areas where filming is taking place will occur on a daily basis and props will be sanitised, with the design team working at a safe distance. And, for an alternative take, this is from Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, on the easing of the lockdown, which is going ahead more rapidly in England than in the rest of the UK. Another parent who wasn\u2019t able to send their child to school today has got in touch. The mother, who wished to remain anonymous, said: We live in Lancashire and my son is in year 6. He attends a rural village school where total school size less than 40 children and his year group is fewer than 10 children. We were perfectly happy with the arrangements that the Head and teachers were putting into place but then Lancashire CC decided late last Wednesday evening to \u201cadvise\u201d schools not to reopen today. We think that is a ridiculous generalisation but the head and governors did not feel that they could go against this advice. Our son is really upset this morning and we are trying to cheer him up but asking him to sort out a shopping list for his year 7 start in the autumn. It\u2019s very unfair and there will be many other parents and schools in this situation this morning. Boris Johnson has been tweeting about the new lockdown rules in England. They will bring \u201cjoy and relief for many\u201d, he claims. While some parents will not be sending their children to school as part of the government\u2019s phased return, there are many who have. Jo Frost, 37, who was dropping off her five-year-old son Max at Queen\u2019s Hill primary and nursery school near Norwich, told PA Media: It\u2019s obviously a difficult decision but you\u2019ve got to weigh up everything in life. You can\u2019t just shut yourself away and wrap yourself up in cotton wool. You could just walk out the door and anything could happen. The school have really thought about it. They\u2019ve sent out lots of letters, pictures and given us all the information we need. I feel confident that they\u2019re doing everything right. They\u2019ve put everything in place, they\u2019ve put a lot of thought into everything. I\u2019m really happy with it. We were quite relieved, to be honest, as it\u2019s quite a long time that he\u2019s been off and at his age it\u2019s really important to be with his peers. I\u2019m more than happy for him to come in. Two parents got in touch earlier this morning to say they want to be able to send their children back to school, but weren\u2019t able to because of caps to classroom sizes. Due to the requirements for social distancing, one primary school in Middlesex sent a letter to parents stating they can safely accommodate an average of nine children per class room. For this reason, every place the school has available has now been taken by critical worker and vulnerable families. The school told parents they would not be able to allocate any additional places for reception, year 1 and year 6. Yesterday the UK government published a new Q&amp;A explaining what is and is not allowed now in England under the slightly more relaxed version of the lockdown rules now in force. In his London Playbook briefing Jack Blanchard has published a sceptical assessment. And guess what? It\u2019s all a little confusing. So the guidance says you CAN go to a friend\u2019s garden party \u2026 but you CAN\u2019T go within 2 meters of the host \u2026 but you CAN tuck into their BBQ buffet \u2026 but you CAN\u2019T sit on their garden chair \u2026 but you CAN nip inside to use the loo \u2026 but you CAN\u2019T help carry food on your way back out \u2026 but you CAN walk through the house to get to the front door \u2026 but you CAN\u2019T stay the night under any circumstances. All clear? The Q&amp;A has been published alongside an amendment to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 that gives legal force to the lockdown in England. They have been updated to make allowance for the new rules. As the lawyers George Peretz and David Allen Green point out on Twitter, the new version of the regulations has some peculiar consequences. I\u2019m grateful to dfic1999 in the comments for flagging this up. In his Today interview this morning Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said the government had launched its test and trace programme last week. Sir Chris Ham, a former head of the King\u2019s Fund health thinktank, says the government is overstating what has been achieved. He says that an effective test and trace system won\u2019t be in place for weeks, and that the government is easing the lockdown too quickly. In her interview on the Today programme this morning Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, also claimed that the UK government\u2019s five tests for easing the lockdown had not been met. But at a press conference last week Boris Johnson claimed that all five tests were being achieved. The five tests were originally set out by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, at a press conference in April (when Johnson was ill). Here they are, with the rival assessments for each test from Johnson in his speech last week and from the ADPH yesterday in its statement. The PM says all five tests have been passed. The ADPH accepts that the first test has been met, but on the other four it says it is too soon to be sure. 1 - NHS\u2019s ability to cope must be protected What PM says: At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April. On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April. What ADPH says: Firstly, the pressure on the NHS \u2013 and those that tirelessly and expertly work within it \u2013 has been significant but it has been able to cope with those who unfortunately need hospital treatment for the effects of Covid-19. The number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 is falling, and beds are available for those that require them. 2 - Sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates What PM says: As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met. What ADPH says: Secondly, there must be a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate. While the first peak in deaths has passed, the downward trend is slow \u2013 particularly in care settings. Deaths are a measure of what happened roughly two weeks before \u2013 the effect of easing measures now will only become evident in two weeks. 3 - Rate of infection decreasing to manageable levels What PM says: And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that\u2019s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May. Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied that the third test is being met. What ADPH says: The critical debate is about the third test \u2013 ensuring the rate of transmission of the infection continues decreasing to manageable levels (taken to mean R being well below 1). The rapid and multiple ways in which measures are being eased is likely to make it difficult to judge the cumulative impact on R. As we saw in March, R can go above 1 in a very short space of time \u2013 and once it does it can take many months to bring it back down. The room for manoeuvre is tight. 4 - Testing capacity and PPE supply at adequate levels What PM says: Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day. We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including face masks, visors, gowns and aprons. What ADPH says: The fourth aspect, ensuring supply of tests and PPE is able meet future demand, remains an enormous challenge. PPE manufacturing and supply chains are stronger, but shortages are still being reported and it is not clear that supply can meet new demand as different parts of society, public services and the economy open. While testing capacity has undoubtedly increased, we are not yet confident that the current testing regime is sufficiently effective in getting the priority tests done and the results to where they are needed to enable swift action. 5 - No risk of a second peak that would overwhelm NHS What PM says: This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious. What ADPH says: Finally, the fifth test. A second peak cannot be ruled out \u2013 whether it will overwhelm the NHS is an important question to ask. But perhaps the even bigger one is, do we really want the same number of deaths again? The scale to date represents an unimaginable tragedy and we must do everything possible to limit further loss of life. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. As we reported overnight, the Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH) issued a statement overnight saying it was worried that the UK government was lifting lockdown restrictions too soon. Here is our story. Here is the full text of the statement from the ADPH president, Jeanelle de Gruchy. Here is an extract. Directors of Public Health are increasingly concerned that the government is misjudging this balancing act and lifting too many restrictions, too quickly. This is a new disease; evidence is still emerging and there is much uncertainty. However, based on what is currently known, several leading scientists and public health experts have spoken out about a string of recent national policy announcements affecting England which project a degree of confidence that many \u2013 including ADPH members \u2013 do not think is supported by the science. Over the weekend we have seen signs that the public is no longer keeping as strictly to social distancing as it was \u2013 along with this, we are concerned that the resolve on personal hygiene measures, and the need to immediately self-isolate, if symptomatic, is waning. A relentless effort to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events is essential. De Gruchy expanded on this in an interview on the Today programme this morning. She said local directors of public health could only be effective if other parts of the anti-coronavirus programme were working too. She went on: So we need testing, the national testing programme, to be absolutely robust and ready, and we need the NHS test and trace to be robust and ready. And of course the other issue ... is about PPE and the supply of PPE. So all of those organisational challenges that we are all working really hard getting in place - we\u2019re not feeling, just yet, that we are really confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures. More than 200 travel and hospitality businesses have joined a campaign urging the government to overturn its planned 14-day quarantine for arrivals into the UK, PA Media reports. The group of major hotels, travel companies and restaurateurs claim the policy is \u201cunworkable\u201d and are calling for air bridges to be created which enable people to travel - without being quarantined - between countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is deemed to be low. George Morgan-Grenville, the chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said: This is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed. The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country. More than 200 businesses have signed the letter to the home secretory, Priti Patel. The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast is exploring the coronavirus crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons. When Britain went into lockdown in March, most people were confined to their homes with little more than a short daily walk allowed. But in prisons, lockdown meant an end to an already heavily restrictive way of life. There were no visits allowed, education programmes were paused and prisoners were confined to their cells for more than 23 hours a day, something close to solitary confinement. The podcast speaks to David Adams, who has just been released from prison where he had served more than two years for a series of burglaries; and Sarah Lewis, director of Penal Reform Solutions, who describes how devastating to inmates and staff the Covid-19 crisis has become in prisons. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has said he understands parents\u2019 concerns at sending their children back to school. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI completely understand every parent wants to keep their child safe. And that\u2019s precisely what the government wants to do in ensuring schools are safe places to return to.\u201d Sharma is doing the government media rounds this morning, but was called out by Piers Morgan last night for apparently refusing to go on Good Morning Britain. Sharma denied the easing of the lockdown was a \u201cdash\u201d, PA Media reports, insisting measures are being eased in a \u201ccautious\u201d approach. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThis is not a dash. These are very cautious steps that we are taking. They are phased.\u201d He insisted there is a \u201cgood likelihood\u201d that the R rate of coronavirus infections will not go past the crucial figure of one if the public heeds the rules. \u201cAnd what they also said is if people comply with the rules and the test and trace system is up and running which it has been since Thursday then there is a good likelihood that we will not breach the R value factor above one,\u201d he said. Primark owner Associated British Foods (ABF) said it is working to reopen all its stores in England on 15 June, following the announcement by the government allowing non-essential retailers to open their doors to customers again. ABF expects to have reopened 281 of its stores by that date, having already reopened at 112 sites across mainland Europe. It said in a statement: Safety has been our highest priority in our detailed preparations to welcome our customers and employees back to stores. We are following government safety advice in all markets. Importantly, we will apply the valuable experience gained from more than 100 stores which are already open as we open the remainder of our estate, including stores across the UK. Social distancing protocols, hand-sanitiser stations, perspex screens at tills and additional cleaning of high frequency touch points in the store are among the measures we are implementing. Personal protection, including masks and gloves, are being made available to all employees. Government guidance requiring 2.2 million people in at-risk groups to stay indoors is to be relaxed in England from Monday, the housing and communities minister Robert Jenrick said on Sunday. He confirmed that people shielding will be able to spend time with their households or, if they live alone, with one person from another household. But vulnerable people who have been shielding for many months have voiced concerns that the lockdown is being eased too quickly in England. The Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, Helen Pidd, reports: For the last 10 weeks, Graham Bell has been sleeping in a hotel near the Devon hospital where he works as an intensive care nurse, away from his wife and toddler triplets. His wife, Hannah Gallagher-Bell, another nurse, is shielding because of diabetes and other underlying health conditions. The triplets \u2013 William, Benjamin and Florence, who are two and a half \u2013 were born prematurely and are vulnerable to lung infections. This prompted the couple to take the agonising decision for Graham to stay out of the house in case he picked up Covid-19 on the ward and infected the rest of the family. Hannah, who has not been able to work during the crisis because of her health vulnerabilities, has not left their house in Barnstaple since Graham packed his bags and went to a hotel on 22 March, the day before Boris Johnson put the UK into lockdown. She will not be going anywhere soon, she said: \u201cThe thought of it absolutely petrifies me.\u201d Five new drugs are to be trialled in 30 hospitals across the country in the race to find a treatment for Covid-19, according to an exclusive report by the Guardian\u2019s Lisa O\u2019Carroll. The drugs range from Heparin, which is used for blood thinning, to therapies still in clinical trial for conditions such as muscular, lung and blood disorders, which have evidence of potent anti-viral or anti-inflammatory properties. Researchers hope the drugs would prevent people becoming ill enough to need intensive care or ventilators O\u2019Carroll reports: The studies are part of the Accord (accelerating Covid-19 research and development) programme involving doctors and scientists, industry, the NHS the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and UK Research and Innovation. \u201cWe are looking for a signal of both safety and efficacy, something that could reduce the severity of the disease, shorten its duration and prevent patients going into the intensive care environment,\u201d said Tom Wilkinson, a respiratory medicine professor and consultant, who is the Accord academic lead, from the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre. Just a handful of patients have enrolled for the trial so far and with coronavirus patient numbers falling, researchers are keen to quickly enlist as many as possible, said Wilkinson. Morning and welcome to the UK liveblog on the coronavirus. Children in England in reception, year 1 and year 6 can start returning to the classroom today, but half of pupils are expected stay home as many parents, councils and teachers remain sceptical of the government\u2019s assurances over their safety. Guardian education editor Richard Adams writes: Boris Johnson\u2019s government has invested considerable political capital in opening classrooms to primary school pupils in three year groups \u2013 reception, year 1 and year 6 \u2013 leading to warnings by independent scientists that it is too soon to reopen while transmission and infection rates remain so high. While most of England\u2019s 18,000 primary schools will open to more pupils from Monday, a large majority of headteachers say they are not able to accommodate all three year groups, in some cases for the remainder of the school year. According to a survey conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research, primary school leaders expect that 47% of families will keep their children home, with the proportion rising to 50% among pupils eligible for free school meals. The gradual reopening of schools is part of a raft of measures to ease the lockdown in England on Monday, which includes allowing groups of up to six people to meet outdoors and in private gardens. Outdoor markets and car showrooms can now resume trading from today, provided they socially distance. Senior public health officials made an extraordinary last-minute plea for ministers to scrap Monday\u2019s easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection and that public resolve to take steps to limit transmission has been eroded. The Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH) said new rules were \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d and that pictures of crowded beaches and beauty spots over the weekend showed \u201cthe public is not keeping to social distancing as it was\u201d. It follows comments by a second senior government medical adviser, Jenny Harries, a deputy chief medical officer for England, who effectively criticised Dominic Cummings for breaching lockdown regulations by saying it is \u201ca matter of personal and professional integrity\u201d to abide by the rules.

      "body": "<p>Sajul Islam has had his eye on a new seven-seater Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace throughout the coronavirus lockdown, and he took his chance on Monday as car dealerships across England opened their doors for the first time in more than 2 months.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for weeks for this showroom to open up again,\u201d Islam said, as he haggled over last-minute discounts with the salesman from behind a perspex screen inside the Marshall VW dealership in Loughton, Essex. \u201cMy family has grown during the lockdown, and we need more space; that\u2019s why I chose this seven-seater.\u201d</p> <p>Islam, 36, who works for Transport for London, said he had been planning to buy the car before the lockdown was imposed on 23 March. \u201cNow, with three kids, we aren\u2019t comfortable in my BMW, we need more space. I would have bought it during lockdown, but I wanted to see it and test drive it before I bought it.\u201d</p> <p>To comply with the social distancing rules, Islam, who lives in Tower Hamlets, London, headed out on the test drive alone. Car dealerships have negotiated special insurance deals to allow prospective customers to take new cars out for solo spins.</p> <p>Lorraine on reception has seen her role expand, ensuring that physical distancing rules are met and that everyone remembers to sanitise their hands. The dealership has also introduced a one-way system, limits on the number of people allowed inside and customers are no longer allowed to wander around unaccompanied.</p> <p>Andrew Lean, Marshall Motor Group\u2019s director of VW dealerships, hopes that the firm, which operates 117 dealerships for a variety of marques, will emerge from the coronavirus crisis relatively intact, even though sales have collapsed. \u201cWe sold 3,700 cars during the shutdown, which compares to 19,000 during the same period a year earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 80% decline, but it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been.\u201d</p> <p>While car showrooms in England were allowed to open from 1 June and in Northern Ireland they can open from 8 June, there is no date set for reopening in Wales or Scotland.</p> <p>Lean said there was \u201ca lot of pent up demand\u201d from people wanting to buy cars and the large showroom was often full to its self-imposed capacity of 10 customers on Monday. But he said people were showing more interest in secondhand than new cars. \u201cNormally our sales ratio is about two used cars for every new one, but it has risen to about 7-8:1,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lean said it was hard to predict how sales would pan out after an initial peak from pent up demand expected this week. \u201cBoris [Johnson] has told people to go back to work, but also told them not to go on public transport. It\u2019s quite a confused message, but we think that might explain why there has been more interest in used cars.\u201d</p> <p>Back from his solo test drive spin, Islam is ready to sign on the dotted line for his Tiguan. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d he said before adding quietly: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to squeeze out a bit of a better deal yet.

      "bodyText": "Sajul Islam has had his eye on a new seven-seater Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace throughout the coronavirus lockdown, and he took his chance on Monday as car dealerships across England opened their doors for the first time in more than 2 months. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for weeks for this showroom to open up again,\u201d Islam said, as he haggled over last-minute discounts with the salesman from behind a perspex screen inside the Marshall VW dealership in Loughton, Essex. \u201cMy family has grown during the lockdown, and we need more space; that\u2019s why I chose this seven-seater.\u201d Islam, 36, who works for Transport for London, said he had been planning to buy the car before the lockdown was imposed on 23 March. \u201cNow, with three kids, we aren\u2019t comfortable in my BMW, we need more space. I would have bought it during lockdown, but I wanted to see it and test drive it before I bought it.\u201d To comply with the social distancing rules, Islam, who lives in Tower Hamlets, London, headed out on the test drive alone. Car dealerships have negotiated special insurance deals to allow prospective customers to take new cars out for solo spins. Lorraine on reception has seen her role expand, ensuring that physical distancing rules are met and that everyone remembers to sanitise their hands. The dealership has also introduced a one-way system, limits on the number of people allowed inside and customers are no longer allowed to wander around unaccompanied. Andrew Lean, Marshall Motor Group\u2019s director of VW dealerships, hopes that the firm, which operates 117 dealerships for a variety of marques, will emerge from the coronavirus crisis relatively intact, even though sales have collapsed. \u201cWe sold 3,700 cars during the shutdown, which compares to 19,000 during the same period a year earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 80% decline, but it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been.\u201d While car showrooms in England were allowed to open from 1 June and in Northern Ireland they can open from 8 June, there is no date set for reopening in Wales or Scotland. Lean said there was \u201ca lot of pent up demand\u201d from people wanting to buy cars and the large showroom was often full to its self-imposed capacity of 10 customers on Monday. But he said people were showing more interest in secondhand than new cars. \u201cNormally our sales ratio is about two used cars for every new one, but it has risen to about 7-8:1,\u201d he said. Lean said it was hard to predict how sales would pan out after an initial peak from pent up demand expected this week. \u201cBoris [Johnson] has told people to go back to work, but also told them not to go on public transport. It\u2019s quite a confused message, but we think that might explain why there has been more interest in used cars.\u201d Back from his solo test drive spin, Islam is ready to sign on the dotted line for his Tiguan. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d he said before adding quietly: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to squeeze out a bit of a better deal yet. A couple of free services at least.\u201d",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Neither Hancock nor Newton could say how many positive cases had asked for their contacts to be traced so far, how many people had been asked to isolate, how many of those had gone on to test positive or when those figures would be made public.</p> \n<p>At the briefing, Hancock announced the lowest number of daily deaths, 111, since the lockdown began, although this did not include 445 extra deaths from 24 April to 31 May that were listed in an annexe.</p> \n<p>The number of new daily cases confirmed through a positive test was 1,570, which is also the lowest since the start of the lockdown.

Ashdown House preparatory school in East Sussex, established 180 years ago, will close its doors at the end of the academic year after a ruinous downturn in pupil numbers. The independent schools sector in the UK has been severely affected by the coronavirus, which has seen many parents lose income and a significant drop in interest from overseas pupils. As a result, the school was expecting to be less than a third full from September. The trustees of the boarding and day school, which caters for boys and girls aged five to 13, have concluded that closing the school \u201cis the only remaining option\u201d. It comes after the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard that the school had a \u201cspartan and unforgiving\u201d culture, where the sexual abuse of pupils during the prime minister\u2019s time there was not reported to authorities. Announcing the closure, Tom Beardmore-Gray, chief executive of the Cothill trust, of which Ashdown is part, said: \u201cWhen the trust first welcomed Ashdown into our family of schools over a decade ago, trustees did so knowing that there were some very significant challenges that needed to be addressed. \u201cThey were united, however, in the belief that everything that could be done to keep the school open should be done.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has offered to invite Vladimir Putin to an expanded G7 meeting in September, but the invitation has already been adamantly opposed by the UK and Canada. According to a Kremlin account on Monday, the US president initiated the call, in which the two leaders talked about the coronavirus pandemic, oil prices and cooperation in space, as well as Trump\u2019s postponement of a planned G7 summit at Camp David this month and the inclusion of other countries. \u201cDonald Trump informed about his idea of holding a G7 summit with a possible invitation from the leaders of Russia, Australia, India and the Republic of Korea,\u201d according to the Kremlin readout. There was no mention of the wave of unrest in US cities. Some hours later, the White House had not produced its own version of the conversation. Trump raised the possibility of inviting Russia on Saturday, after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had made clear she would not attend the Camp David summit. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world. It\u2019s a very outdated group of countries,\u201d Trump told reporters. He suggested the creation of an expanded grouping called the G10 or G11 and said the summit could be held in the weekend before or after the UN general assembly. The UN summit is currently due in the week beginning 20 September. The White House later said the proposal was aimed at bringing together \u201ctraditional allies\u201d to talk about how to deal with China. In 1997 Russia was admitted to the group of advanced democratic economies \u2013 the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan \u2013 but then evicted in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea. The UK and Canada quickly rejected any suggestion that Russia be readmitted as long as Russia behaved aggressively on the world stage. A Downing Street spokesperson said Russia should not be a member \u201cunless it ceases aggressive and destabilizing activity that threatens the safety of UK citizens and the collective security of our allies\u201d. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201c[Russia\u2019s] continued disrespect and flaunting of international rules and norms is why it remains outside of the G7 and why it will continue to remain out.\u201d Trump has repeatedly pressed for Russia\u2019s readmission at the G7, bringing it up at earlier summits, but each time it has been rejected by his fellow leaders.",

The initial phase of the government\u2019s controversial reopening plans got off to a patchy start with many primary schools remaining closed to further pupils. For those that opened, attendance was as low as 40% in some, rising to 70% elsewhere. In some regions, as few as one in four state primary schools were reported to be open to more pupils on Monday than before, and just one in 10 in some local authorities. Most schools have remained open during the crisis for children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, but from Monday primary schools across England were asked by the government to open more widely and admit pupils in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6, despite opposition from teaching unions and some scientific advisers. While media coverage showed returning children queueing 2 metres apart outside their primary schools for the first time since the gates closed on 20 March, it was clear that many parents were not ready to send their children back and some councils advised against premature reopening to more pupils. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said reports from members suggested the picture on the ground was \u201cvery mixed\u201d, depending on differing local authority approaches, space constraints and staff availability. \u201cThis means some schools will not open this week, and there will be schools which are simply unable to bring in all the eligible year groups, that is reception, Year 1 and Year 6,\u201d he said. \u201cThe expected level of pupil attendance is also highly variable, and we are hearing that it ranges anywhere between around 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils.

But as this week progresses, more than 50% of state primary teachers said their school will have reopened by Friday, and by next Monday the proportion will have risen to more than three-quarters of schools. While school leaders were satisfied with the plans for physical distancing they were able to put in place for the year groups due to return first, a number told the Guardian they were \u201cat capacity\u201d and there was no way they could fit all primary year groups in before the summer holidays. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which runs nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire. For most schools, who are having to split classes into groups of less than 15, there will not be enough space. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said. A BBC poll of 2,350 primary governors from the National Governance Association found that three-quarters thought it unlikely that all pupils would be able to return before the summer. Previously, the government made plain in its coronavirus recovery plan that it wanted \u201call primary school children [in England] to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible\u201d. But in a sign that they are backing away from the proposal, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said it remained \u201cunder review\u201d and added that the government accepted that some primary schools would not be able to reopen on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important that children do have the opportunity to get back into school and to learn but we are doing this in a very cautious and safe way.

      "bodyText": "Facebook employees are staging a rebellion over Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to act against Donald Trump, expressing their dissatisfaction with their boss on social media in a rare public display of dissent and, in some cases, staging a \u201cvirtual\u201d walkout. Disagreement came from employees at all levels of the company, including some senior staff. Particular criticism was levelled at Zuckerberg\u2019s personal decision to leave up the Facebook version of a tweet sent by Trump in which the president appeared to encourage police to shoot rioters. By contrast, Twitter hid the message behind a warning. Andrew Crow, the head of design for Facebook\u2019s Portal video-phone, tweeted: \u201cGiving a platform to incite violence and spread disinformation is unacceptable, regardless who you are or if it\u2019s newsworthy. I disagree with Mark\u2019s position and will work to make change happen.\u201d Jason Stirman, a member of the company\u2019s R&amp;D team and the former chief executive of the \u201cmental training\u201d app Lucid, also posted on Twitter, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable.

People are regarding lockdown as not over but in its dying phase,\u201d Wehrle said. Non-essential retailers have been closed across the UK since 23 March, when the lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus started, but retailers are keen to reopen as trading online has not made up for store closures. Many businesses are struggling for survival, with Debenhams, Monsoon and French Connection among those to have closed branches or warn they need to raise cash to survive. Under new government rules, car showrooms and outdoor markets selling non-food items were allowed to reopen from Monday. Food market stalls in some areas have been able to operate since May, but many owners have chosen not to do so. While the vast majority of non-essential stores, including clothing, shoe and toy stores, will not reopen until 15 June, a range of other retailers selling products classed as essential, such as DIY, furniture and bicycles, have gradually been reopening under lockdown. Restaurants remained closed. As shopper numbers increased, so too did the number of people travelling. Motoring organisations reported a much busier start to the week on roads. An AA spokesman said breakdown callouts on Monday had peaked from 9am, an hour earlier than the pattern during lockdown, indicating the return of a morning rush. Data from the AA until the end of Sunday showed that the weekend had been the busiest since the start of lockdown, with traffic at around 80% of normal levels, or about 15m cars on the road.

      "bodyText": "The Ted Baker founder, Ray Kelvin, has slashed his stake in the fashion retailer by more than half, handing control of the company to an investor known as \u201cthe Rottweiler\u201d as part of an emergency \u00a3105m fundraising to get the business through the coronavirus pandemic. The retailer raised \u00a395m through a share placing and on Tuesday will launch a \u00a310m offer for subscription. The refinancing has so far slashed Kelvin\u2019s stake by 55% to 15.8% after he bought just \u00a33.5m of new shares. Investment firm Toscafund \u2013 whose founder, Martin Hughes, is nicknamed \u201cthe Rottweiler\u201d for his tenacity and strong-arm tactics with target companies \u2013 nearly doubled its stake to 26.4%, making it Ted Baker\u2019s biggest shareholder. The offer for subscription is unlikely to dramatically change any shareholders\u2019 position. The fundraising comes hot on the heels of the sale and leaseback of Ted Baker\u2019s London headquarters, the Ugly Brown Building, which raised \u00a372m to pay back lenders in March. The coronavirus pandemic has caused revenues to slump by 36% between 26 January 2020 to 2 May 2020, with department stores and branches closed by a government order. Kelvin left the company in March 2019 after allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including \u201cforced hugs\u201d. He denied all allegations of misconduct. The emergency fundraising comes after a difficult year for the retailer.

      "body": "<p>Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that about a fifth of people are expected to receive a spot-check to ensure that they are staying at the address or addresses they have provided to the authorities, but enforcement of the quarantine will be limited.</p> \n<p>The rules, still being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health&nbsp;amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry.</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced on 22 May that nearly all international arrivals at UK ports, including airports, ferry ports and international rail terminals, must quarantine for 14 days from Monday 8 June. There are exemptions for health workers, scientists, lorry drivers and others.</p> \n<p>During the coronavirus travel quarantine&nbsp;period, people will be allowed to leave their given address to buy food \u2013 including for pets \u2013 or medicine or to fulfil a legal obligation, it is understood. Arrivals into the country will be able to provide more than one address where they will stay for the period, sources with knowledge of the draft plans told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Around 20% of arrivals will receive a check call to make sure they are where they should be. However, according to draft rules, the police in England will not have power of entry. In theory, if they call on someone suspected of breaching the regulations, the person does not have to open the door. Fines of \u00a31,000 can be issued in England, although while the quarantine plan is UK-wide, enforcement is devolved.</p> \n<p>One source&nbsp;said: \u201cTo get caught, you will either&nbsp;have to be unlucky or stupid.\u201d</p> \n<p>A No 10 source stressed that going to the shops or changing address were allowed only if no alternative was possible, and would not be seen as the norm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Exemptions to quarantine include escaping harm or to access victim services, similar to the list of reasonable&nbsp;excuses to leave home that were in force at the start of the general lockdown.</p> \n<p>On arrival at ports and airports, people will be told to go directly home or to the address where they are staying, but the draft&nbsp;rules allow them to use public transport to get there.</p> \n<p>The plans differ from some other countries, such as Greece, which designated quarantine hotels where new arrivals would stay, with food left outside their door and smoking rooms to avoid the need to go out.</p> \n<p>Sir David King, the&nbsp;former government chief scientific adviser, who has convened an unofficial version of the Sage science advice committee to offer alternative views on coronavirus, said he was concerned by the draft plans. \u201cIf we look at what\u2019s happened in other parts of Europe, and certainly in south-east Asia, the quarantine process has been much more rigorous than this,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a particular worry I have, that is too much discretion is being left to the individual. If the legal requirement, which for infectious diseases is set out in law, is not followed through, then it does spell difficulties. There\u2019s too much emphasis on individual discretion in making key decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Travel and tourism industry representatives have said the plans, which will be reviewed after three weeks, will cause significant economic harm. They have called for so-called air bridges, allowing quarantine-free travel to and from countries with low Covid-19 infection rates.</p> \n<p>Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, who is heading a cross-party group of several dozen MPs opposing the plans, said the draft rules meant the quarantine proposals made even less sense. \u201cIt really feels like it will bring limited public health benefit for a lot of economic pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already some absurdities to the idea, like backdoor routes, so you could fly to Dublin, go Dublin to London, and then not be checked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP and former culture secretary, said the only quarantine plan that would bring benefits would be targeted at specific countries with high Covid-19 infection rates, such as Brazil. \u201cThere are no public health benefits of a blanket quarantine at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is simply a fig leaf to disguise Priti Patel\u2019s embarrassment at not having had a quarantine at the beginning of the outbreak, when one might have been justified.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot only is there no basis in science for this ridiculous policy, but it will unnecessarily cost thousands and thousands of jobs. The sooner the government scraps it, the better.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the MPs frustrated with the quarantine plans seem unlikely to force a vote, their numbers have grown sufficiently to seemingly prompt officials to indicate that the system could be revised very soon. Briefings from unnamed sources to some newspapers suggested some air bridges without quarantine could be introduced by the end of the month.</p> \n<p>Asked about the idea of air bridges, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve said it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at, and that remains the case.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the weekend, more than 200 travel and hospitality businesses joined a formal push against the quarantine plans. George Morgan-Grenville, chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said: \u201cThis is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed. The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country.\u201d</p> \n<p>The rules will be introduced as a statutory instrument to the 1984 Public Health Act, a form of legislation that can amend the law without a full parliamentary process. This one will be made a \u201cnegative procedure\u201d, which means it becomes law without a vote.</p> \n<p>MPs can force a subsequent vote by agreeing a \u201cprayer\u201d motion in the Commons. However, with the process for physically distanced voting still to be decided once the Commons returns fully on Tuesday, this appears unlikely.</p> \n<p>With estimates that queues of distanced MPs could take hours to pass physically through voting lobbies, Smith said he did not expect a vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe appetite for votes that can be avoided is very low,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the normal course of events, I think we\u2019d be seeking a division on the issue of quarantine. But because it is something that\u2019s temporary, and like it or not a relatively niche issue, my view is that it could be more counterproductive than positive, because it\u2019ll put people\u2019s backs up.\u201d</p> \n<p>A No 10 source said: \u201cWe are confident that these are very robust procedures which will help significantly in reducing the spread of coronavirus in the UK from overseas.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson said:&nbsp;\u201cThis&nbsp;quarantine system&nbsp;is&nbsp;designed to keep the transmission rate down, stop new cases being brought in from abroad, and help prevent a devastating second wave of coronavirus. All of our decisions have been based on the&nbsp;latest scientific evidence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe&nbsp;are&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;businesses in the tourism sector through one of the most generous economic packages provided anywhere in the world&nbsp;and we will continue to look at options to increase international travel, when it is safe to do so, as we move forward.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament. The Guardian understands that about a fifth of people are expected to receive a spot-check to ensure that they are staying at the address or addresses they have provided to the authorities, but enforcement of the quarantine will be limited. The rules, still being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry. Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced on 22 May that nearly all international arrivals at UK ports, including airports, ferry ports and international rail terminals, must quarantine for 14 days from Monday 8 June. There are exemptions for health workers, scientists, lorry drivers and others. During the coronavirus travel quarantine period, people will be allowed to leave their given address to buy food \u2013 including for pets \u2013 or medicine or to fulfil a legal obligation, it is understood. Arrivals into the country will be able to provide more than one address where they will stay for the period, sources with knowledge of the draft plans told the Guardian. Around 20% of arrivals will receive a check call to make sure they are where they should be. However, according to draft rules, the police in England will not have power of entry. In theory, if they call on someone suspected of breaching the regulations, the person does not have to open the door. Fines of \u00a31,000 can be issued in England, although while the quarantine plan is UK-wide, enforcement is devolved. One source said: \u201cTo get caught, you will either have to be unlucky or stupid.\u201d A No 10 source stressed that going to the shops or changing address were allowed only if no alternative was possible, and would not be seen as the norm. Exemptions to quarantine include escaping harm or to access victim services, similar to the list of reasonable excuses to leave home that were in force at the start of the general lockdown. On arrival at ports and airports, people will be told to go directly home or to the address where they are staying, but the draft rules allow them to use public transport to get there. The plans differ from some other countries, such as Greece, which designated quarantine hotels where new arrivals would stay, with food left outside their door and smoking rooms to avoid the need to go out. Sir David King, the former government chief scientific adviser, who has convened an unofficial version of the Sage science advice committee to offer alternative views on coronavirus, said he was concerned by the draft plans. \u201cIf we look at what\u2019s happened in other parts of Europe, and certainly in south-east Asia, the quarantine process has been much more rigorous than this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular worry I have, that is too much discretion is being left to the individual. If the legal requirement, which for infectious diseases is set out in law, is not followed through, then it does spell difficulties. There\u2019s too much emphasis on individual discretion in making key decisions.\u201d Travel and tourism industry representatives have said the plans, which will be reviewed after three weeks, will cause significant economic harm. They have called for so-called air bridges, allowing quarantine-free travel to and from countries with low Covid-19 infection rates. Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, who is heading a cross-party group of several dozen MPs opposing the plans, said the draft rules meant the quarantine proposals made even less sense. \u201cIt really feels like it will bring limited public health benefit for a lot of economic pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already some absurdities to the idea, like backdoor routes, so you could fly to Dublin, go Dublin to London, and then not be checked.\u201d Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP and former culture secretary, said the only quarantine plan that would bring benefits would be targeted at specific countries with high Covid-19 infection rates, such as Brazil. \u201cThere are no public health benefits of a blanket quarantine at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is simply a fig leaf to disguise Priti Patel\u2019s embarrassment at not having had a quarantine at the beginning of the outbreak, when one might have been justified. \u201cNot only is there no basis in science for this ridiculous policy, but it will unnecessarily cost thousands and thousands of jobs. The sooner the government scraps it, the better.\u201d While the MPs frustrated with the quarantine plans seem unlikely to force a vote, their numbers have grown sufficiently to seemingly prompt officials to indicate that the system could be revised very soon. Briefings from unnamed sources to some newspapers suggested some air bridges without quarantine could be introduced by the end of the month. Asked about the idea of air bridges, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve said it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at, and that remains the case.\u201d At the weekend, more than 200 travel and hospitality businesses joined a formal push against the quarantine plans. George Morgan-Grenville, chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said: \u201cThis is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed. The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country.\u201d The rules will be introduced as a statutory instrument to the 1984 Public Health Act, a form of legislation that can amend the law without a full parliamentary process. This one will be made a \u201cnegative procedure\u201d, which means it becomes law without a vote. MPs can force a subsequent vote by agreeing a \u201cprayer\u201d motion in the Commons. However, with the process for physically distanced voting still to be decided once the Commons returns fully on Tuesday, this appears unlikely. With estimates that queues of distanced MPs could take hours to pass physically through voting lobbies, Smith said he did not expect a vote. \u201cThe appetite for votes that can be avoided is very low,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the normal course of events, I think we\u2019d be seeking a division on the issue of quarantine. But because it is something that\u2019s temporary, and like it or not a relatively niche issue, my view is that it could be more counterproductive than positive, because it\u2019ll put people\u2019s backs up.\u201d A No 10 source said: \u201cWe are confident that these are very robust procedures which will help significantly in reducing the spread of coronavirus in the UK from overseas.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis quarantine system is designed to keep the transmission rate down, stop new cases being brought in from abroad, and help prevent a devastating second wave of coronavirus. All of our decisions have been based on the latest scientific evidence. \u201cWe are supporting businesses in the tourism sector through one of the most generous economic packages provided anywhere in the world and we will continue to look at options to increase international travel, when it is safe to do so, as we move forward.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 2 June. Top stories Donald Trump has called US state governors \u201cweak\u201d and encouraged them to crack down on crowds protesting the death of George Floyd. New York City is the latest to introduce a curfew as a growing number of cities are convulsed by mass protests. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer pinned his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck. The chief of Minneapolis police has said \u201call four officers\u201d involved in Floyd\u2019s death were \u201ccomplicit\u201d, though only one has been charged with murder. A private autopsy the family arranged has found Floyd died of asphyxiation. There is growing pressure for the other three officers to face charges. The president of the Minneapolis police union has written to its members calling George Floyd a \u201cviolent criminal\u201d, while elsewhere, the Houston police chief joined protestors to march. Barack Obama has shared advice on making the protests a \u201cturning point\u201d, while Floyd\u2019s family called for protests to be peaceful. The Australian federal government will not rule out using new laws to allow a future reboot of the botched robodebt scheme. Guardian Australia can reveal an opinion from the solicitor general \u2013 referred to in a ministerial submission that has formed the basis for the government\u2019s response to an ongoing class action \u2013 was received in September. The government is refunding 460,000 unlawful debts, worth $720m. Queensland man Nathan Turner, thought to be Australia\u2019s youngest Covid-19 fatality, has proved to be negative to the virus. His death last week in the central Queensland town of Blackwater prompted an emergency health response after an initial coronavirus test following his death returned a positive result. Queensland Health has now confirmed a second test came back negative. Meanwhile, polling shows Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of Covid-19 continues to win approval, Spain is reporting no deaths in a 24-hour period for the first time since March, and a rapid rise in cases in Iran stokes fears of a second wave. Australia Matt Canavan has been grilled over his criticism of action against climate change during an episode of Q+A where he was also asked to clarify his family\u2019s links to the coal industry. \u201cI hardly started talking about the coal industry yesterday \u2026 I have been elected on that platform, to develop our country and keep our jobs here,\u201d the Nationals senator said when pushed by host Hamish Macdonald about his coal industry \u201cinterests\u201d. Australia\u2019s track record on deaths in custody is again under scrutiny, as Aboriginal people whose family members died in similar circumstances to George Floyd express solidarity with US protestors. There have been at least five deaths since Guardian Australia updated its Deaths Inside project in August 2019, two of which have resulted in murder charges being laid. Australia\u2019s drug regulator has launched court action against a \u201chealing church\u201d touting bleach as a Covid-19 cure. The Therapeutic Goods Administration fined the Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing more than $150,000 for breaching advertising laws. Anti-Discrimination NSW has recorded a surge in anti-Asian racism during the coronavirus pandemic. The state\u2019s anti-discrimination body received 241 official complaints between January and April this year, 62 on the grounds of race \u2013 an average of four a week. Labor has said the government-owned national broadband network should consider buying fibre networks from Telstra and other fibre operators across Australia covering up to 300,000 homes. Last month, NBN Co announced it had raised an extra $4.1bn, which could be used for \u201cstrategic\u201d investments after the NBN rollout is completed at the end of this month. The world The sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, according to an analysis by scientists who warn it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation. More than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. Hong Kong police have formally banned this week\u2019s vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre, citing Covid-19 measures. The move had been expected, but the announcement confirms there will be no commemorative event for the first time since the Chinese military killed untold numbers of protestors on 4 June 1989. Facebook employees are staging a rebellion. Employees say Mark Zuckerberg has refused to act against Donald Trump, expressing their dissatisfaction with their boss on social media in a rare display of dissent. Recommended reads Australian artist Imants Tillers was among more than 100 volunteers who helped wrap 90,000 square metres of plastic fabric around a Sydney coastline in 1969. The work was the project of Bulgarian-born, New York-based artist Christo \u2013 who died on Sunday \u2013 and his French partner and artistic collaborator Jeanne-Claude. It transformed Little Bay into what was then the largest single artwork ever made. Read about the history of Wrapped Coast \u2013 One Million Square Feet which profoundly influenced the course of contemporary art in Australia. Yes, Australia\u2019s carbon emissions are falling \u2013 but it\u2019s a hollow boast, writes Greg Jericho. The latest greenhouse gas emissions data released on Friday contained some good news, but comes with a couple of caveats. Brodie Lancaster has watched every single episode of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in lockdown. That\u2019s 206 episodes. On paper, this show shouldn\u2019t appeal to anyone with a heart or a brain, but Lancaster says it\u2019s just about the most fun you can have in your own living room. Listen On Full Story, is Hong Kong is nearing the end of one country, two systems? Protesters have taken to the streets again, this time over a national security law that is set to be imposed by Beijing. Verna Yu and Lily Kuo look at how the standoff compares with those of Hong Kong\u2019s recent history. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Tensions over border closures are reaching fever pitch on the Gold Coast, according to the Courier Mail. In the West Australian, traditional owners of Rottnest Island have started consultations about how to commemorate hundreds of Aboriginal boys and men who were incarcerated and died on the island when it was used as a jail. Coming up The RBA board will meet in Sydney today, with official cash rates on the agenda.

In many states, governors have activated national guard units.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible.</p> <p>\u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has urged US governors and law enforcement officials to take a more forceful approach in responding to protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck for several minutes. The weekend saw the most widespread civil unrest in the US since the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. In a group call on Monday morning of which the Guardian obtained a recording, the president, accompanied by attorney general Bill Barr and secretary of defense Mark Esper, repeatedly urged participants to act more forcefully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t dominate your city and your state, they\u2019re going to walk away with you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn Washington we\u2019re going to do something people haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d The call came amid alarm across the US, as some protests have descended into rioting and looting. In many states, governors have activated national guard units. Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors. \u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible. \u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d. The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests. \u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a first amendment right. Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down. The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump. West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d \u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it. She doesn\u2019t know me very well.\u201d Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric surrounding Floyd\u2019s death, which he said was \u201cmaking it worse\u201d. Trump shot back that he didn\u2019t like the Democrat\u2019s \u201crhetoric either\u201d and said he had repeatedly addressed his horror over Floyd\u2019s death. Others supported Trump. Arizona governor Doug Ducey said \u201cthe more aggressive approach does work\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said \u201cI agree in peace through strength.\u201d Trump\u2019s theme was crush, or be crushed. \u201cThey come armed with bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come armed with bricks and rocks.\u201d Former vice-president Joe Biden, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, in contrast sought advice from mayors including Atlanta\u2019s Keisha Lance Bottoms, Chicago\u2019s Lori Lightfoot and Melvin Carter of St Paul, Minneapolis\u2019s \u201ctwin city\u201d, who are all African American, on balancing \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d while \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests\u201d. Biden said on Monday: \u201cPeople are angry. I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing. A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor Andy Beshear said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis. Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence. The president, also grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were rushed to a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.

This would allow extra people inside workplaces, restaurants, pubs and shops, and reduce the length of queues. The prime minister has instructed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to look into the possibility.</p> \n<p>The UK guidance is out of line with advice in most other countries and with recommendations from the WHO, which says people should stay 1 metre apart. This is followed by France, while countries such as Germany and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/20/social-distancing-rules-australia-when-will-end-guidelines-coronavirus-laws-physical-covid-19-restrictions-signs-posters-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-nt-tasmania\">Australia</a> have a 1.5-metre rule.</p> \n<p>The Lancet\u2019s meta-analysis of observational studies across Covid-19 but also \u2013 predominately \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars</a> and Mers, highlights the potential consequences of a change.</p> \n<p>It found that keeping a distance of more than 1 metre from other people reduced the risk of infection to 3%, compared with 13% if standing within a metre. However, the modelling also suggested that for every extra metre further away up to 3 metres, the risk of infection or transmission may halve.</p> \n<p>Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThe most useful finding is that physical distancing matters. There have been plenty of complaints that the guidance in the UK on 2 metres distance is excessive because it is more than in other countries. But this review supports it.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaintaining this distance is likely to reduce risk compared to 1 metre.&nbsp;Thus, where possible, this is the distance that retailers and employers should use as more premises and workplaces reopen in the future.

      "bodyText": "Reducing physical distancing advice from 2 metres to 1 metre could double the risk of coronavirus infection, according to the most comprehensive study to date. The research, part-funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and published in the Lancet, will add to the debate in the UK about whether the 2-metre rule should be reduced. Last week, Boris Johnson said he hoped to \u201cbe able to reduce that [2-metre] distance\u201d, to make it easier to travel on public transport and boost the hospitality industry. This would allow extra people inside workplaces, restaurants, pubs and shops, and reduce the length of queues. The prime minister has instructed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to look into the possibility. The UK guidance is out of line with advice in most other countries and with recommendations from the WHO, which says people should stay 1 metre apart. This is followed by France, while countries such as Germany and Australia have a 1.5-metre rule. The Lancet\u2019s meta-analysis of observational studies across Covid-19 but also \u2013 predominately \u2013 Sars and Mers, highlights the potential consequences of a change. It found that keeping a distance of more than 1 metre from other people reduced the risk of infection to 3%, compared with 13% if standing within a metre. However, the modelling also suggested that for every extra metre further away up to 3 metres, the risk of infection or transmission may halve. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThe most useful finding is that physical distancing matters. There have been plenty of complaints that the guidance in the UK on 2 metres distance is excessive because it is more than in other countries. But this review supports it. \u201cMaintaining this distance is likely to reduce risk compared to 1 metre. Thus, where possible, this is the distance that retailers and employers should use as more premises and workplaces reopen in the future. This is going to be very difficult in some settings but is important and we\u2019ll all need to get used to maintaining this distance for some months to come.\u201d The researchers also wade into the debate about face masks. Based on evidence from 10 studies involving 2,647 participants, they found that the risk of infection or transmission when wearing a mask was 3% compared with 17% when not wearing a mask, although they said the level of certainty was \u201clow\u201d. Similar benefits were found, also with low certainty, concerning wearing of protective eye coverings such as face shields, goggles and glasses. Respirator-type masks were found to offer more protection from viral transmission to healthcare workers than surgical masks. The authors also found that multi-layer masks were more effective than single-layer ones, which may help guide people making their own face coverings at home. Business leaders have warned that if the 2 metre distance is not reduced it could make their companies unsustainable, despite the relaxation of lockdown. Greg Clark, the chairman of the Commons science and technology select committee, told the Telegraph he had written to Johnson urging him to urgently review whether it was possible to reduce the distance to 1.5 metres. \u201cThe difference between 2 metres and 1.5 metres may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs,\u201d Clark said. Last month, Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England (PHE), told the committee PHE was looking at \u201cwhether 2 metres is actually necessary or could it be reduced further\u201d. The distance is based on the belief that when people cough and sneeze large respiratory droplets, believed to be the main means of transmission of Covid-19 along with contact, they will travel no more than 2 metres before falling to the ground. However, some believe this to be an underestimate. Additionally, debate remains about whether smaller aerosols can cause transmission. The authors of the Lancet paper analysed nine studies involving 7,782 participants relating to physical distancing across the three viruses, reaching conclusions with \u201cmoderate certainty\u201d. Prof Holger Sch\u00fcnemann from McMaster University in Canada, who co-led the research, told the Guardian: \u201cWe have a suggestion here that 2 metres might be more effective than 1 metre distance. And what that would mean is if one were to implement a policy, and particularly if 2 metres were already in place, 2 metres may be the right policy to undertake.\u201d How countries\u2019 rules differ UK: Physical distance requirement of 2 metres; guidance says a face covering should be worn in \u201cenclosed spaces\u201d where physical distancing may be difficult, such as on public transport or in some shops. Germany: Physical distance requirement of 1.5 metres; face masks compulsory on public transport and shops (although some variation by state). Australia: Physical distance requirement of 1.5 metres; face masks not required. France: Physical distance requirement of 1 metre; face masks compulsory on public transport and in secondary schools, and shops can require customers to wear them.

They need our help now.\u201d",

That driver was in a Porsche but Cox said offenders were spotted in all types of vehicles, from across all demographics, and in all speed zones.</p> \n<p>He urged drivers to think of the dangers to \u201cvulnerable road users\u201d during a period when people were being urged by Boris Johnson to avoid public transport and instead to walk or cycle to work.</p> \n<p>Police data obtained by the RAC through freedom of information requests revealed that the second highest speed recorded in early lockdown was 151mph on the M62 in West Yorkshire, and the third 140mph on the A14 in Suffolk.</p> \n<p>RAC&nbsp;road safety spokesman Simon Williams described the speeds as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and warned that motorists travelling this fast have \u201cvirtually no time to react should anything unexpected happen\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He went on: \u201cSome drivers have taken advantage of quieter roads to speed excessively, putting the lives of others at risk at the worst possible time. It\u2019s encouraging that so many police forces have taken firm action even during the lockdown, which sends a strong message to other would-be offenders.\u201d</p> \n<p>Five other forces detected motorists driving at more than 130mph.</p> \n<p>Cox, the Met\u2019s lead for its Vision Zero initiative to eliminate deaths on the roads, said his team caught a driver doing 134mph in a 40mph zone in Enfield. Tracking cameras showed driving speeds in London were \u201cabove the limit on average in all categories from the first part of lockdown to early May\u201d, he added.</p> \n<p>Data for May showed a tenfold increase in the number of enforcements in the 20mph zone, with 530 drivers caught breaking the limit, compared with just 50 in 2019.</p> \n<p>There were more than double the number of offences in the 30mph zone, and a near eightfold increase in speeding in the 60mph zones. The figures relate to physical interventions by officers and do not include data from speed cameras.</p> \n<p>Local councils have also been concerned, warning that speed limits did not change with empty roads.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wandbc/status/1259411618884132865\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The roads are quieter but the speed limit is still the same.

That driver was in a Porsche but Cox said offenders were spotted in all types of vehicles, from across all demographics, and in all speed zones. He urged drivers to think of the dangers to \u201cvulnerable road users\u201d during a period when people were being urged by Boris Johnson to avoid public transport and instead to walk or cycle to work. Police data obtained by the RAC through freedom of information requests revealed that the second highest speed recorded in early lockdown was 151mph on the M62 in West Yorkshire, and the third 140mph on the A14 in Suffolk. RAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams described the speeds as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and warned that motorists travelling this fast have \u201cvirtually no time to react should anything unexpected happen\u201d. He went on: \u201cSome drivers have taken advantage of quieter roads to speed excessively, putting the lives of others at risk at the worst possible time. It\u2019s encouraging that so many police forces have taken firm action even during the lockdown, which sends a strong message to other would-be offenders.\u201d Five other forces detected motorists driving at more than 130mph. Cox, the Met\u2019s lead for its Vision Zero initiative to eliminate deaths on the roads, said his team caught a driver doing 134mph in a 40mph zone in Enfield. Tracking cameras showed driving speeds in London were \u201cabove the limit on average in all categories from the first part of lockdown to early May\u201d, he added. Data for May showed a tenfold increase in the number of enforcements in the 20mph zone, with 530 drivers caught breaking the limit, compared with just 50 in 2019. There were more than double the number of offences in the 30mph zone, and a near eightfold increase in speeding in the 60mph zones. The figures relate to physical interventions by officers and do not include data from speed cameras. Local councils have also been concerned, warning that speed limits did not change with empty roads. As schools reopen and more people return to work without using public transport, police are urging people to shun drivers who speed, saying it is the single biggest contributor to fatalities in the capital. \u201cI can\u2019t say the increase is a surprise, because we see reckless driving all the time. Too often people say this is about revenue-raising \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you catch some real criminals?\u2019 \u2013 which is offensive to me and my team because we have seen what happens when there are life-changing injuries or deaths and how lives are wrecked. \u201cThere has to be a change in social attitudes. In the last 25 years, drink-driving has become socially unacceptable. People won\u2019t get into a car when someone has been drinking, they will take the keys from friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is not happening with speeding. The problem is these drivers or their friends don\u2019t understand how dangerous it is, don\u2019t think we will be there or they will caught, or that they will be the ones in an accident.\u201d He said the people caught speeding were likely to be those that would do so anyway but \u201csaw more opportunity in lockdown as the roads were quieter\u201d. Department for Transport figures show traffic was down by two-thirds in the first few weeks of lockdown. Top 10 violations Here are the highest speeds by drivers breaking the limit between 23 March and 13 April, recorded by police forces that provided data to the RAC (speed limit 70mph unless stated): 1 London: 163mph 2 West Yorkshire: 151mph 3 Suffolk: 140mph 4 Northamptonshire: 138mph 5 Gwent: 136mph 6 Staffordshire: 135mph 7 London: 134mph (40mph speed limit zone) 8 Kent: 132mph 9 Humberside: 130mph 10 Scotland: 128mph",
