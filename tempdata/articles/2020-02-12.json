But the ACCC took aim at the poor performance of the controversial fibre-to-the-node technology brought in by the Coalition government instead of continuing the full-fibre rollout. Fibre-to-the-node is fibre cable right up to a box, usually on the end of a street, that then uses the existing Telstra copper phone lines for the remaining distance to people\u2019s homes. It means the speed of the connection depends on the quality of the copper line and the distance from the node to a person\u2019s home.

In places where fibre-to-the-node cannot meet these expectations, NBN Co has been remediating the copper, and in a very small number of places, upgrading the homes to full-fibre. The NBN Co chief executive, Stephen Rue, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday the number of homes needing upgrades was not significant. \u201cIt\u2019s a small number we have been upgrading to fibre-to-the-premises,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have always rolled out technologies where it is best to do so to meet the statement of expectations, and in this case it was a small number of premises where we have built with fibre-to-the-premises where we weren\u2019t able to meet the requirements because basically the length of the copper.\u201d Labor\u2019s communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said the report raised questions over why the network was \u201cstill not delivering the speeds Australians are paying for\u201d. On Tuesday, the government-owned company tasked with building the $51bn network reported a half-year revenue of $1.8bn, up 39% on the same time the previous year. A total of 10.5m homes and businesses were able to connect to the NBN as of the end of 2019, and 6.4m were using the service. The largest portion of those were on fibre-to-the-node, at 2.8m connections, and 4.4m able to order a service. Rue said the network was on track for the \u201cvolume build\u201d of 11.5m homes to be completed by 30 June, but the final six months would be more complicated, and potentially more costly for the company as some of the most complex places to install the network were connected. This has meant the cost to install the NBN on a per-premises basis rose $63 in the past six months to $2,331 for fibre-to-the-node, and $120 to $3,249 for fibre-to-the-curb. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Philip Knox, said that after 30 June there would also be a number of other sites that would still need to be connected, despite the volume build being \u201ccomplete\u201d. \u201cThere will, of course, always be new homes that will need to be added to the network, and there remain a number of culturally significant and heritage sites, and complex builds where construction efforts will continue past that June target,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Australian exporters heavily dependent on China are braced for the full impact of the coronavirus on Australian exports, from iron ore and LNG, to lobster and lamb, and bionic ear technology.</p> <p>The global death toll from the virus outbreak has passed 1,000, and more than 40,000 people have been infected, 99% of those in mainland China. Vast swathes of China\u2019s massive economy remain in lockdown.</p> <p>While China\u2019s senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has forecast that the outbreak may have peaked and could be over by April, the director of the World Health Organisation said a vaccine could be 18 months away, and warned of the potential economic and social consequences if the virus outbreak is not brought under control.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/coronavirus-fallout-could-leave-australian-tourism-and-retail-sector-in-the-doldrums\">Coronavirus fallout could leave Australian tourism and retail sectors in the doldrums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are concerns Chinese importers of copper and gas could use force majeure clauses in their contracts that will allow them to suspend deliveries of the key commodities.</p> <p>Force majeure clauses refer to unforeseeable external circumstances that prevent a party from fulfilling a contract, usually dramatic events such as natural disasters, strikes or terrorist attacks.</p> <p>China and Australia are intensely interdependent on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Australia supplies about 40% of China\u2019s LNG, while about 40% of Australia\u2019s LNG exports are to China.</p> <p>China\u2019s largest importer of LNG, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), reportedly invoked force majeure to suspend contracts with Total and Shell last week, but the claim was dismissed by the suppliers. Shell\u2019s Queensland Curtis LNG project is CNOOC\u2019s biggest Australian supplier.</p> <p>The price of Australia\u2019s most important export to China, iron ore, fell 11% in January due to the virus outbreak, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said.</p> <p>Australia exports more than <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2019/aug/box-b-the-recent-increase-in-iron-ore-prices-and-implications-for-the-australian-economy.html\">$60bn a year</a> worth of iron ore to China, and the industry is a major source of tax revenue.

      "bodyText": "Australian exporters heavily dependent on China are braced for the full impact of the coronavirus on Australian exports, from iron ore and LNG, to lobster and lamb, and bionic ear technology. The global death toll from the virus outbreak has passed 1,000, and more than 40,000 people have been infected, 99% of those in mainland China. Vast swathes of China\u2019s massive economy remain in lockdown. While China\u2019s senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has forecast that the outbreak may have peaked and could be over by April, the director of the World Health Organisation said a vaccine could be 18 months away, and warned of the potential economic and social consequences if the virus outbreak is not brought under control. \u201cTo be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. There are concerns Chinese importers of copper and gas could use force majeure clauses in their contracts that will allow them to suspend deliveries of the key commodities. Force majeure clauses refer to unforeseeable external circumstances that prevent a party from fulfilling a contract, usually dramatic events such as natural disasters, strikes or terrorist attacks. China and Australia are intensely interdependent on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Australia supplies about 40% of China\u2019s LNG, while about 40% of Australia\u2019s LNG exports are to China. China\u2019s largest importer of LNG, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), reportedly invoked force majeure to suspend contracts with Total and Shell last week, but the claim was dismissed by the suppliers. Shell\u2019s Queensland Curtis LNG project is CNOOC\u2019s biggest Australian supplier. The price of Australia\u2019s most important export to China, iron ore, fell 11% in January due to the virus outbreak, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said. Australia exports more than $60bn a year worth of iron ore to China, and the industry is a major source of tax revenue. A fall in volumes and price will hurt Australia\u2019s budget bottom line. According to Moody\u2019s, mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals is the Australianmining company most exposed to a downturn in China: making 93% of its sales there. But the two big Anglo-Australian miners, BHP and Rio Tinto, are also heavily exposed, selling 55% and 45% respectively to China. NAB\u2019s Forward View said commodity prices remain in retreat in response to the coronavirus, and warned \u201cthe scale and duration of the outbreak is highly uncertain\u201d. \u201cMarkets are concerned that containment measures implemented by Chinese authorities will negatively impact demand for commodities from the manufacturing and construction sectors \u2013 placing downward pressure on prices.\u201d Ben Jarman, senior economist at JP Morgan, said growth forecasts for China had been significantly downgraded as a result of the coronavirus and continuing uncertainty over its impacts. \u201cThe forecast short-run hit to industry in China is very large, and it may be difficult for affected users of raw commodity inputs to \u2018look through\u2019 to the other side of the shock.\u201d Reports that force majeure may be declared on some of China\u2019s LNG imports, suggest \u201ca quite persistent shock to demand\u201d. Australia\u2019s largest meat-processing cooperative, Northern Cooperative Meat Company, has had product stuck at Chinese ports awaiting dock workers to return to work, while China\u2019s ban on seafood imports has left Australian producers with millions of dollars worth of unsold fish and shellfish. Economists at UBS say Australia\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.1% this quarter thanks to the coronavirus outbreak, and have warned that it could be even worse. This is UBS\u2019s weakest forecast for Australia since the global financial crisis and warn that the recessionary impact could even be as great as a 0.5% contraction. The calculations are based on an expectation of a 30% slump in China\u2019s total outbound travel in 2020, with the first quarter contraction the most severe. Millions of Chinese tourists visit Australia every year and are the biggest spenders when they get there. \u201cThis wipes A$6bn from GDP, or 0.9% off annual growth, a plausible downside risk scenario ... we now think Q1 GDP growth is likely to be negative, even with arguably still optimistic assumptions,\u201d UBS analysts said in a note. Australia\u2019s shipping routes have not yet been particularly affected by the government\u2019s travel restrictions, according to the CEO of Ports Australia, Mike Gallacher. He said both maritime imports and exports were continuing as usual. The government\u2019s travel ban, announced on 1 February, requires any person who passes through mainland China to spend at least 14 days outside of China before entering Australia. But many cargo ships from China to Australia already take 13 or 14 days to arrive, creating only negligible delays. \u201cWe can fortunately say there have been no reported major disturbances to the supply chain,\u201d Gallacher told Guardian Australia. \u201cAs an island nation with 98% of its trade coming through our ports, imports and exports must and will continue with the addition of extra safety measures.\u201d Australian and New Zealand firms heavily exposed to China are also demonstrating support for the country by sending significant donations to help fight the virus. The a2 Milk Company has donated NZ$1m ($961,100) to two universities working to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, as well as more than $2m ($1.9m) in cash and milk products to the Chinese Red Cross. \u201cWe believe that in addition to providing support on the ground for Chinese families through product donations and financial support for the local Red Cross, the most effective way for us to assist the Chinese people and the global community is to provide funds that will help independent scientific researchers develop an effective vaccine for this virus,\u201d managing director Geoff Babidge said. Rio Tinto and Fortescue have also donated $1m each to Chinese NGOs and charities to help the country fight the coronavirus outbreak. Australian hearing implant maker Cochlear Ltd cut its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday, blaming the coronavirus outbreak as hospitals in China delayed surgeries to limit further spreading of the infection. Hospitals across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been deferring surgeries, including cochlear implants, as part of a host of measures to stem the spread of the virus and prevent panic. \u201cIt has become clear that the coronavirus will impact the number of cochlear implant surgeries in Greater China, a top-five market for Cochlear,\u201d Cochlear chief executive Dig Howitt said in a statement.",

And so I\u2019ll be looking to that coalition of peaks, and Pat Turner, who has demonstrated amazing leadership in bringing all of those groups together, and most recently we met in the cabinet room, as I referred to earlier today. It was a tremendous meeting. </p> <p>We are making great progress. So I look forward to the shared targets with the right data that can inform us as to how we\u2019re tracking against those targets, where the responsibilities for meeting those targets are very clearly articulated. </p> <p>The suggestion that this commonwealth parliament alone can act to address all of these targets is a misplaced notion, because state governments, Mr Speaker, are equally are part of this process. That\u2019s not me saying, it Mr Speaker. It is Indigenous Australians through the coalition of peaks themselves. And that\u2019s why this process, Mr Speaker, is a partnership.

When we look at policies like the CDP [Community Development Program] policy, the cashless debit card, which entrenches First Nations people in poverty in this country, then of course we\u2019re not going to see the outcomes that we want to see in health, in education, in housing, in life expectancy.</p> <p> I call on the Morrison government to connect these very important policies. It\u2019s been five years when <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> got rid of $500m to the Aboriginal Affairs budget in this country, and we have seen year after year, a breaking down even further into poverty, into disadvantage for First Nations people. And the Coalition government has to see this connection. There\u2019s also a connection between calling for a voice to the federal parliament, calling for a voice to be in the constitution. All of these things are connected to Closing the Gap and improving the lives for First Nations People.</p> <p> And I call on the federal government, I call on <strong>Ken Wyatt</strong> as the minister for First Nations people in this country to be serious about this job, to be very serious. There is no doubt no doubt, there is sincerity in terms of Ken Wyatt\u2019s push to see a better way of life for people. But it\u2019s not happening, and the reason why it\u2019s not happening is because of the chaos and the dysfunction in the Coalition party, the fact that the Nationals can go away and worry about themselves and not care about the people of the land and the country. </p> <p>The fact that they\u2019re so obsessed with their own concerns when there are people in desperate need, not just First Nations people but people who are recovering from the bushfires who are wanting to know what their future is. </p> <p>That dysfunction is being carried out in what we saw take place in the Coalition party room yesterday when senators opposed a move of, any move, for a referendum for First Nations people in this country and that\u2019s an absolute disgrace. </p> <p>It is an absolute disgrace. And I call on those senators to stand up in the Senate today and have that debate. And they know who they are.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T23:47:21.113Z\">at 11.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4323aa8f08e133247417cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-11T22:00:49.535Z\">10.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Mineral Council of Australia says it is happy to meet with <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> (see previous post).</p> <p>Chief executive officer <strong>Tania Constable </strong>said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The MCA supports continued action on climate change, Australia\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement and a technology-neutral transformation to a low-emissions global economy.

We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning for the last sitting day of the week \u2013 there\u2019s a one week break before the next sitting, so don\u2019t get too comfortable. Given the mood in this place, it looks like it will be a mad rush to the airport come the Thursday adjournment. But we have one more question time to get through before that, so brace yourself. A massive thank you to the Guardian brains trust, and Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Mike Bowers and Paul Karp. And thank you, as always, to you, for following along and making the day interesting. We truly appreciate it. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Please \u2013 take care of you. Meanwhile, over in the Senate: Question time, as seen by Mike Bowers: Mr Self Aware: Some special guests: Spot the difference: Malcolm Roberts is once again in the Senate arguing that no one has provided the empirical evidence that carbon dioxide is leading to a warmer climate. Or something. I was too busy reaching for my alfoil to pay much attention. An inquiry into the auditing industry has been pushed back to September. From finance committee chair, James Paterson: The committee has worked hard to meet the original deadline set by the Senate and is ready to report. We have held four public hearings and heard from all major submitters including Asic twice, Apra, the ATO, the ANAO, Treasury, the major accounting firms, two banks, standards bodies, academics and independent experts. Further hearings will not change the recommendations, and will just delay the government\u2019s response. Those who rely on the transparent and effective operation of auditing in Australia shouldn\u2019t have to wait any longer for action to improve confidence in the industry. The government is looking for a new way to deport Indigenous people who were not born in Australia, or who can not prove citizenship, following yesterday\u2019s high court ruling. As Paul Karp reports: The Morrison government is looking to sidestep the high court\u2019s decision that Aboriginal non-citizens cannot be deported using the aliens power by using other powers instead, the attorney general has said. Responding to the high court\u2019s landmark decision on Tuesday, Christian Porter said he found \u201cgreat strength of reasoning\u201d in chief justice Susan Kiefel\u2019s minority judgment and the government may be able to legislate to deport the \u201cnot very large\u201d group of Aboriginal non-citizens who have committed crimes in another way. In a four-to-three decision, the high court held that Aboriginal people with sufficient connection to traditional societies cannot be aliens and therefore are beyond the reach of existing deportation laws which depend on the aliens power in section 51 (xix) of the constitution. Darren Chester: Today I felt unwell and experienced a brief moment of disorientation while sitting in the House of Representatives. I received prompt attention from colleagues with medical backgrounds and House attendants. After being examined by a nurse at Parliament House, and on the advice of health professionals, I attended Canberra hospital for some tests which cleared me of any serious medical issues. I\u2019ve been advised that my temporary condition was likely to have been fatigue-related and I\u2019m able to continue my duties as a local MP and minister from tomorrow. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the colleagues from both sides of the chamber who came to my assistance, the parliamentary staff and the outstanding team at Canberra hospital who treated me. My apologies for causing such alarm during the prime minister\u2019s important speech on \u2018Closing the Gap\u2019 on Indigenous disadvantage. Thank you to the many people who have contacted my office to express their best wishes. In addition to Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation voting with the government, Centre Alliance\u2019s Stirling Griff abstained on that motion. Griff told Guardian Australia: \u201cMotions are a conscience vote for Centre Alliance, they are never party votes. I absolutely support the Senate being given at least summary details of the Gaetjens report, but not actions to humiliate any member of parliament, as this motion did.\u201d Griff argued the motion created no real consequences for the government, because it would be free to appoint someone other than Mathias Cormann to represent the prime minister. He suggested an alternative would have been to reorder or restrict the time for government business in the Senate, which he \u201cwould\u2019ve been far more likely to agree to\u201d. \u201cSending someone to naughty chair is a personal attack. I supported the premise, but not the penalty of humiliating a member of parliament.\u201d Griff confirmed that MP Rebekha Sharkie agreed with his view, and that he had told senator Rex Patrick (who was in favour of the motion) that he planned to abstain. He lives. Officially. The vote is 36 to 35. Stirling Griff was absent from the chamber from what I can see. It probably shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to come up with a consensus in a party room of three. But it looks like Centre Alliance has managed to defy expectations. Seems like the actual battle might be within Centre Alliance, given Pauline Hanson\u2019s dumping there. Pauline Hanson says she signed the motion, but it \u201cdisturbed her\u201d. She tells the chamber that Rebekha Sharkie came to her office expressing concern, and Stirling Griff also called her to express concern about the precedent the motion would set. Except ... Rex Patrick just stood up to say that Centre Alliance was supporting the motion. Hanson says she is concerned that the Senate will be \u201cblamed for overstepping our power here\u201d and she \u201cwon\u2019t wear it\u201d. Pauline Hanson has seemingly pointed the finger at Rebekha Sharkie as the reason she has withdrawn her support: Centre Alliance in the Senate is supporting the motion. She said yes, then she said no. But she\u2019s not a flip-flopper. For the motion to pass, there needs to be an absolute majority. One Nation out makes it 38 each, meaning the motion will fail. Mathias Cormann has argued that \u201cselection of the leader of government in the Senate is exclusively a matter for the government\u201d. Cormann argued by analogy, if the principle is accepted, that a majority of the members of the House of Representatives could do the same and \u201cremove the leader of the opposition for three weeks\u201d. He said: \u201cIt would be completely inappropriate and we would never do it. Because unlike those opposite we respect the institution of the parliament. \u201cThis is a political stunt. The fact Labor is supporting and proposing this motion reflects very badly on all of you. Let me say to those Labor senators who have not been ministers before ... who aspire to be Senate ministers in future: Be very wary of letting those who came before box you into precedents you will have to live with.\u201d The Australian is reporting Pauline Hanson has withdrawn her party\u2019s support from the motion \u2013 which she had previously co-signed. \u201cWe all understand that this is a political stunt,\u201d says Mathias Cormann. \u201cThe fact that Labor is sponsoring and supporting this motion reflects very badly on all of you.\u201d Cormann says the Senate is boxing itself into a dangerous precedent if it passes the motion. Mathias Cormann is continuing to claim public interest immunity. He says in the *90-year history of the Senate, the sanctions are unprecedented, and it is the government\u2019s view the Senate is attempting exceed its powers (they want to remove Cormann as the representative of the prime minister, if he doesn\u2019t hand over the report). *This previously said 190 \u2013 my fault \u2013 slip of the finger Mathias Cormann is doing his \u201cno, you can\u2019t have it\u201d speech in response to the Senate motion to hand over the Gaetjens report into the sports grant affair. The Senate is about to vote on the motion which would strip Mathias Cormann of his ability to represent the prime minister in the Senate and estimates next week, unless the government tables the PM&amp;C sports grant affair report. I am going to assume this was Ed Husic, because it is always Ed Husic: And question time ends. Mike Kelly to Mark Coulton: Can you explain why the government has cut Medicare bulk-billing incentives in my bushfire-affected electorate, making it harder for doctors to bulk-bill children and pensioners? Coulton: I will remind the member for Eden-Monaro that the changes that he is referring to passed this House on 14 October unopposed. I welcome the opportunity on a day like today to speak about rural health. On the day where we announced another 100 training places for the Royal Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, generalist pathways putting doctors into areas such as the honourable member\u2019s electorate ... There has been no change to the regulation. The changes are an update from the bureau of statistics. They are agreed by both sides of this House. It is important to remember that this policy is to service regional and rural, remote education, health and those changes are purely on the demographics of the areas mentioned. There\u2019s been no change to bulk-billing. Tony Burke: The minister just referred specifically to a piece of legislation he alleged had passed this House, I ask him to table it. Because it doesn\u2019t exist. Chris Bowen to Mark Coulton: I refer to his previous answer in which he claimed there have been no cuts to bulk-billing incentives. Can the minister explain what the financial incentive was in dollar terms to affected areas before the government\u2019s change, and what it is now? Coulton (who has been given some notes on this in between the last question and this one): I welcome the opportunity to add to my last answer. The changes that were made were geographic changes. They were not changed by electorate. They were changed by geographical area from the bureau of statistics. I can confirm that \u2013 and I think it\u2019s important to know \u2013 that rural bulk-billing incentives go to rural areas. That\u2019s the idea ... The idea of rural and regional incentives ... all doctors who bulk-bill, regardless of their location, will continue to be eligible for bulk-billing incentive. These changes relate to the higher rural bulk-billing incentive. And the government has delayed these implementations from the 1st of July 2019 until the 1st of January to allow these practices to come to terms with these changes. And I can assure the members, if they want their doctors to find out more about this, they can go to check their modified Monash classifications on the Doctor Connect website. Oh the lols: Nothing is as funny as a lack of accountability within our democratic systems. Nothing. I think Labor may have found a new target for its wounded gazelle strategy. Chris Bowen to Mark Coulton: Can the minister confirm that of the 14 regions affected by cuts to Medicare bulk-billing initiative, eight are in Liberal electorates, six are in Labor electorates, but none are in Nationals electorates? Coulton: I can confirm there has been no cuts to GP bulk-billing. There has been a change \u2013 there has been a change \u2013 to geographic location using information from the bureau of statistics. And that is an update on information from 30 years ago. And so, areas \u2013 outer metropolitan areas that may have been regional are now part of larger metropolitan areas. And so they are the ones that are impacted. But GPs in those areas are still eligible for district-of-workforce priority. They still can bulk-bill, and those changes have not happened. This is interesting \u2013 from Katharine Murphy: David Littleproud is continuing his exciting foray into the world of green ties. Uhhhhh, no we haven\u2019t. That\u2019s the point. That\u2019s why all of this is happening. Literally the reason it is happening. There are not enough evens IN THE WORLD to can\u2019t with this. When are we getting a federal integrity commission? Like dinner, it will be ready when it\u2019s ready, Christian Porter says. Following the playbook to the letter, Michael McCormack has taken the well-trodden embattled leader\u2019s path to a camera, to talk about how everything is just fine and there are no problems in the party he leads. This particular camera belongs to the Nine Network, which reports the bowl of soggy Weet-Bix that serves as the deputy prime minister has told Chris Uhlmann that he\u2019s getting on with the job and his parliamentary colleagues \u2013 a whole other 20 people \u2013 should do the same. \u201cI was sent here to do a job, I wasn\u2019t sent here to lead a rabble, a destabilised rabble,\u201d McCormack told the network. Angus Taylor sits down, so Tony Burke asks him to table the document and the web address he got it from. Taylor tables it. Angus Taylor just said the words: Mr Speaker, I have here a document ... And the House just exploded in laughter. Siri: show me self awareness. Anthony Albanese stands to tell the Speaker: You won\u2019t be surprised we want to check the validity of the document ... we want to know if it\u2019s real or not. Mike Kelly to Scott Morrison: Prime minister, the Liberal member for Bega, Andrew Constance, reflecting my own experience in the region, stated: \u201cAt the forums I\u2019ve been at over the past two nights, the plea for help from business is about protecting casual employees and the need for a cash injection now. People are reluctant about loans.\u201d On Monday, the prime minister ridiculed Labor for standing up for businesses that don\u2019t want to take on more debt. Does the prime minister have the same response to the Liberal member for Bega? Morrison (after updating on the uptake of government assistance): The suggestion being made that, somehow, the government should be providing an insurance for income loss, Mr Speaker, across the country in relation to any natural disaster. ... Mr Speaker, it is not the government\u2019s policy to provide cashflow assistance for businesses for income loss that have not had direct impact on natural disasters. That is the policy followed by the Labor government when they were in power. It is the policy that we applied to other natural disasters, in particular up in north Queensland, whether up in Townsville or across the areas affected by those floods, Mr Speaker, in the areas you\u2019re talking about, there is some 165,082 businesses alone that have employees. If we were to follow the approach that Labor seem to be suggesting, that alone would be some $8bn and, if you applied it to all businesses, it would be $22bn. Mr Speaker, the opposition cannot be taken seriously when they\u2019re suggesting those sorts of figures. Winston Churchill is shaking in his grave with the oration skills being displayed by Angus Taylor here, and that noise you hear is Don Watson furiously taking notes on speech writing: There is a blanket moratorium on gas in Victoria. When it comes to those deals \u2013 when it comes to these deals, whether it\u2019s New South Wales or Victoria, the principle is very simple. No gas, no cash. That\u2019s right, Mr Speaker. The principle\u2019s simple \u2013 no gas, no cash. Angus Taylor is speaking and Angus Taylor is very pleased to be hearing from Angus Taylor. I mean.... Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer confirm that under the Morrison government annual wages growth in every single quarter has been lower than in any quarter under the last Labor government? Frydenberg: I can confirm \u2013 I can confirm that, today, real wages are growing at 0.6%, and that under Labor real wages were growing at just 0.4%, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, the reality is, under Labor, the real minimum wage went down in three out of the six years they were in government. Under us, real minimum wages have gone up every year under us. Mr Speaker, the way to boost wages is through cutting taxes. And there\u2019s only one side of this House that took to the Australian people $387bn of higher taxes. And it was the genius \u2013 the member for Rankin \u2013 together with the member for McMahon \u2013 who came up with $387bn of higher taxes, which the member for Rankin said he was proud and pleased of. Frydenberg sits down, but the next dixer is interrupted by Chalmers and Frydenberg continuing their back and forth from the benches. It\u2019s like watching a cat that has spotted itself in the mirror. Michael McCormack is saying letters in the order which form words, but no matter how hard he tries it just comes out as white noise. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: Yesterday, the electricians and plumbers\u2019 union was ordered to pay a fine for minor paperwork breaches, a fine which is double the amount that celebrity chef George Calombaris\u2019s businesses were ordered to pay for stealing the wages of more than 500 workers. Why does the government always have one rule for workers, and another for employers? Morrison: Well the penalty imposed upon the CEPU was determined by an independent judge of the federal court of Australia, applying the Labor government\u2019s own laws, Mr Speaker. He continues, but it boils down to unions are pretty terrible, yadda, yadda, yadda. Bob Katter said some things about risking his life and crocodiles and the over-valued dollar and the Great Barrier Reef and I can\u2019t type any more because I got whiplash trying to follow it all. Pat Turner, the lead convenor for the coalition of peaks, has spoken powerfully on the Closing the Gap report, saying it would be \u201ceasy to get overwhelmed\u201d by the continued lack of progress shown in the annual report card against the targets. \u201cIt is a widening gap in life expectancy, soaring rates of incarceration, with our people dying in custody, our children taken away from their families and culture, and the missed opportunities in education and employment through daily experiences of racism,\u201d she said. \u201cAt their heart, the issues our people face is a lack of recognition of our equal place in Australia as First Peoples with our own culture, language and practices. \u201dThis lack of recognition has enabled the systemic dispossession of land, population displacement, removal of our children, and prejudice in everyday life, and outright discrimination. \u201cWe cannot be genuine about closing the gap until we end this denial.\u201d Turner said government needed to be \u201cupfront\u201d about how disadvantage had been entrenched in the country\u2019s institutions and structures. She also said she hoped a new approach that gave Indigenous groups a greater say in policy development, rather than programs \u201cdesigned by government for us\u201d. \u201cWe know that when services are delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, the outcomes are much better.\u201d The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said he was looking forward to a future for indigenous Australians that was \u201cmuch stronger and better\u201d, with indigenous Australians having a greater say. Labor\u2019s Linda Burney said she wanted to believe that \u201cwe are on the cusp of doing business differently \u2013 we must.\u201d \u201cWe cannot consign another generation of young black kids in this country to brutality, to sacrifice, to suicide. There has to be a new way forward.\u201d Labor\u2019s second volley of questions in the Senate is from Jess Walsh to Simon Birmingham, about Matt Canavan\u2019s interjection yesterday that the government has \u201cnot yet\u201d funded new coal power plants. Birmingham said the government is funding two feasibility studies for projects in Queensland: \u201cNothing more, nothing less.\u201d Labor\u2019s Murray Watt starts interjecting in Canavan\u2019s direction \u201cNothing more \u2013 don\u2019t get too excited.\u201d Canavan plays it cool, keeping his nose buried in a colourful copy of the Closing the Gap report. Birmingham said if the feasibility studies show the projects stack up, that will be the time to gauge the private sector\u2019s enthusiasm for them: \u201cYou would expect to see investment flow into projects that stack up, that is how the commercial market works.\u201d Birmingham objects to Walsh characterising his remarks yesterday as ruling out government funding for new coal power stations, noting he had only said it is not government policy. Greg Hunt adds to that answer: In terms of potable water, the prime minister has set out the position, commitment and work we\u2019re doing on that front. In terms of keeping dialysis \u2013 I had the privilege, with the minister for Indigenous Affairs, of visiting People House in Alice Springs, focusing on a $23m announcement for kidney dialysis. We know that renal failure and renal damage is an immensely important issue in Indigenous Australia, along with a number of areas of eradicating avoidable Indigenous blindness, eradicating avoidable Indigenous deafness, eradicating heart disease ... What we also want to do is make sure that we help to work towards eradicating avoidable kidney failure. So the $23m to Purple House is our commitment, and we will always continue to work with them on their needs, but we know this is important. I have seen the cases. I have visited the site. I have worked with the minister for Indigenous Affairs, as well as people on all sides, and I have to say Purple House is a great Australian initiative, supported by people on all sides of this House, and it\u2019s about saving lives and protecting lives in Indigenous Australia. Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: There are Indigenous communities in remote Australia that don\u2019t have access to kidney dialysis because they don\u2019t have pottable water. Prime minister, I have been to these places. Will you commit to ensuring that all communities in Australia have clean water? Morrison: This was one of the important topics that I discussed with Pat Turner this morning. This is one of the critical things that needs to be put in place to support the health and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples right across the country. As she reminded me this morning, that is made more difficult because of recent events around bushfires and drought which has complicated the water potability for Indigenous Australians in so many parts of the country. So I can agree with the member who\u2019s put this matter to us. This is absolutely an issue that requires attention not just from commonwealth governments but from state governments as well, Mr Speaker. And it will be a matter that will be getting important attention through the process which I outlined in my previous answer to the earlier question. It will also be one as we pursue our water policies across the country. Government dixers have moved from Closing the Gap to energy. Apparently the opposition is \u201criven with division\u201d on the issue. HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA. Oh the irony. It burns. A lot of that seemed aimed at his own party room, rather than the opposition. Anthony Albanese: Will the prime minister hold a referendum in this term to enshrine a First Nations voice to parliament in our constitution? Morrison says he has a broad position on the issue, but that his main goal is success of the referendum: What I\u2019m interested in is that such a proposition would be successful. Success is the goal that I would seek in pursuing that agenda. And it\u2019s an agenda that I am pursuing, and the minister for Indigenous Australians is pursuing. And one of the things I\u2019ve learned \u2013 carefully \u2013 from the minister for Indigenous Australians - is you need to keep walking together until you can find the point where there is an agreement that would enable such an important recognition to be achieved. So I am not going to allow, Mr Speaker, any timetables to prevent the successful achievement of this result. My position on this matter I\u2019ve set out very clearly, Mr Speaker. Those opposite have a very different view as to the manner and form of this to those in the government. And I think that presents, Mr Speaker, a lack of consensus. What we will do ... is continue to pursue the bipartisan recommendations of the joint select committee, and I thank the member for Berowra and the other members of the committee, Mr Speaker, who put forward those recommendations and put forward a process of co-design as the way forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s our policy. We will continue to apply ourselves to that process. I hope we\u2019re able to achieve a consensus at an early opportunity. But, Mr Speaker, in the absence of a consensus ... I am not going to go down a path that would see something important such as this result in a failure. Ken Wyatt takes a dixer on the Closing the Gap update today. It echoes what we have heard from the prime minister earlier. But he finishes with this: I\u2019ve asked the agency now to always engage with our people on all initiatives that we do. They are not to tell communities what they need. They are to sit, identify the challenge, work on solutions. But I also want to ask all of us in this chamber to do the same. To engage in our electorates. To listen to the voices of the people at the local level. Many of us do it well. Some of us, it depends on time. But if we do this consistently and we bring in the feedback [from] ... the Aboriginal community, then let me say that we will have an outcome that is an exemplar for the future, and we can collectively take credit for the way in which we\u2019ve engaged in a real way. Labor\u2019s Pat Dodson sends the first volley of questions to Anne Ruston, representing the Indigenous affairs minister. Ruston did not commit to hold a referendum on constitutional recognition this term, saying instead that the \u201cone thing that we\u2019ve absolutely given categorical commitment on is to work with First Australians\u201d. Recognition will be \u201cinformed by a co-design process\u201d. Dodson asks if the government has ruled out constitutional entrenchment of a voice, what form of recognition in the constitution it is proposing. Ruston dodges, arguing recognition is an \u201citerative process\u201d. So she hasn\u2019t ruled out the voice may (eventually) be included in the constitution. Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: I refer to the fact that five out of the seven Closing the Gap targets have not been met or are not on track. Will one of the 14 new targets set in April be a justice target? Morrison: I thank the member for her question and I thank her for her constructive support of the process we are now going through in the establishment of the new Closing the Gap targets. As the member would be aware, that is a process that is a cooperative process. It\u2019s a process that involves state governments, the commonwealth government, but most importantly it is a process which is being driven by the coalition of peak groups led by Pat Turner. And so, Mr Speaker, it would be presumptive of me, as prime minister, as a part of this process, to be seeking to prejudice that process and not listen \u2013 not listen to what the priorities are to be set by Indigenous Australians. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll be doing. As I said today in my address on Closing the Gap: we want to see the gap from the eyes of Indigenous Australians. I want the gaps to be defined by Indigenous Australians. And so there is an engagement to that end. There will be a discussion of these matters in March of this year. And this is a process we\u2019ve been working to for over a year now. And so I\u2019ll be looking to that coalition of peaks, and Pat Turner, who has demonstrated amazing leadership in bringing all of those groups together, and most recently we met in the cabinet room, as I referred to earlier today. It was a tremendous meeting. We are making great progress. So I look forward to the shared targets with the right data that can inform us as to how we\u2019re tracking against those targets, where the responsibilities for meeting those targets are very clearly articulated. The suggestion that this commonwealth parliament alone can act to address all of these targets is a misplaced notion, because state governments, Mr Speaker, are equally are part of this process. That\u2019s not me saying, it Mr Speaker. It is Indigenous Australians through the coalition of peaks themselves. And that\u2019s why this process, Mr Speaker, is a partnership. I intend to respect the partnership with Indigenous Australians. It starts with an update on Darren Chester. He will miss out on question time for \u201cmedical reasons\u201d. The veteran affairs minister collapsed during the Closing the Gap address, and has gone for some tests. Scott Morrison: I\u2019m sure members of the House will be pleased to know that the member is well and he is very appreciative of the attention that was provided to him today in the House from \u2013 there was bipartisan medical support provided, Mr Speaker, of which he\u2019s most grateful. He said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t send flowers \u2013 have a holiday in East Gippsland!\u201d Anthony Albanese: Just to associate myself and this side of the House \u2013particularly Dr [Mike] Freelander \u2013 with the comments of the prime minister. The member for Gippsland has some political opponents in this House on both sides, but everyone \u2013 everyone in this House \u2013 respects him and likes him, and we wish him well. And finally, James McGrath suggests \u201copen and transparent\u201d appointments \u2013 to the woman who was the prime minister\u2019s captain\u2019s pick. Ms Buttrose, the third point of my plan to reform the ABC is that you could advise the Prime Minister that all appointments at the ABC should be open and transparent. If you have time, perhaps you could discuss with the Prime Minister how the ABC might be able to reduce its $20 million travel budget. These are just a few ideas. They aren\u2019t radical, they aren\u2019t unachievable; they\u2019re actually very reasonable and very achievable. The ABC must show how it can manage its existing budget before asking for a bigger one. Remember: its existing budget is over $1.1 billion\u2014$1.1 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money. The ABC needs to be better, must be better, because if it isn\u2019t it will no longer be taken seriously; it will become nothing more than a joke, and Australians won\u2019t be amused. James McGrath moved on to selling the ABC\u2019s property portfolio, presumably because he would like to complain about the rents the ABC is paying in the near future. Hey \u2013 in a culture war, you have to plan ahead. Secondly, you could look at reducing the ABC\u2019s property portfolio, something I have previously spoken about in this chamber. The ABC\u2019s headquarters in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne are valued at around half a billion dollars. It\u2019s half a billion dollars for three offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. They account for 81% of the entire ABC property portfolio. Sell them off. Move the ABC to the suburbs or the regions. Get it out of the inner city. The BBC shifted a lot of its operations from London to Salford, near Manchester, so there is a precedent that has been set. Answers to questions asked by me in estimates confirmed that, funnily enough, the ABC property portfolio is already under review and staff at the ABC were notified of this review back in October 2019. There hasn\u2019t been a word or a whisper since. Perhaps the ABC are still coming to terms with the fact that they\u2019re a national broadcaster and not a property developer. I am still not sure why James McGrath has been butt-hurt over the national broadcaster, but he has come up with a three-point plan to \u201csave\u201d the ABC, which appears to have five points. First, you could tell the prime minister you would like a wide-ranging independent review of the ABC, including of its charter and act. The last time there was a serious review of the charter and the act was before the fall of the Berlin Wall. So, like President Reagan standing in front of the Brandenburg Gate saying to the East Germans and the Soviets, \u2018Tear down this wall,\u2019 Ms Buttrose, I would like you to say to the prime minister: \u2018Review this charter. Please have this charter reviewed.\u2019 You should tell the prime minister you would like to look at new ways of funding the ABC to lessen the burden on taxpayers, because you are funded by the taxpayers of Australia. You already have ABC ads on the ABC. Why can\u2019t you have commercial ads on the ABC as a way of funding the national broadcaster? It gets better: Instead of the ABC continuing its good work, the ABC has already changed its focus from journalism to lobbying. It\u2019s a joke, and no one is laughing. So I have some free advice for the chair of the ABC, Ms Buttrose, and I won\u2019t even charge Ms Buttrose and the ABC for it. I won\u2019t even charge them and then try to charge them some more because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d charged them enough already. Ms Buttrose, it\u2019s been briefed out that you\u2019re going to meet the prime minister. Before you meet with the prime minister, before you put the cart before the horse, you should look at ways to reduce spending and increase revenue. You could look at the ways the ABC could live within its means and perhaps adopt my three-point plan to save the ABC \u2013 to save the ABC from itself. For reasons known only to James McGrath (and his bid for Senate preselection, given the lack of Liberal spots and overflow of Liberal senators at the next election), he has decided to launch an attack on the ABC, just days after MPs of all persuasions praised it for its crucial role as emergency broadcaster during the summer: What do you call a quiet Australian at the ABC? Lonely\u2013 very lonely. I wanted to open with a joke, because I read one on Monday. The joke went like this: the ABC, funded by taxpayers, runs out of money this year and every year \u2013 no matter how much and no matter how little \u2013 so they keep asking for more. It isn\u2019t particularly funny, is it? That\u2019s because it is no laughing matter. The ABC has a spending problem, not a revenue one. Actually, perhaps it has both. After all, it is funded by the taxpayers. But before I turn to ways the ABC could reduce spending and increase revenue, I want to briefly reflect on its role during the recent weather events. I acknowledge the role of the ABC over this period. This is what the ABC should do: report and provide factual information about events such as national disasters, with journalistic independence. The ABC exists to broadcast across the nation, including \u2013probably especially \u2013 in rural and regional areas. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the national broadcaster. But too many people I know no longer see the ABC as the national broadcaster. They see it as the un-Australian broadcaster. Question time is about to begin. Hit me up with your predictions. Linda Burney has spoken to the ABC about today\u2019s Closing the Gap report update and what needs to be done: I think one of the really crucial things that was made, once again, by Anthony today and the prime minister, is the importance of bipartisanship. The social justice condition of Aboriginal people is dire. We have seen improvements in some areas, but it\u2019s still dire. And the only way it\u2019s going to be fully addressed is through a partnership with First Peoples. That\u2019s in place. And that\u2019s very good. But it has to be a partnership, in my view, across the parliament. Oh excellent. Meanwhile: Travel advice for China remains at level four: do not travel. Another 40 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess. Marise Payne says the government is attempting to work out if there are any Australians among the newly diagnosed. Eleven Australians on the cruise ship have tested positive. Over in the Blue Room (the second most serious government press conference location) Greg Hunt, Marise Payne and the acting chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, are giving an update on coronavirus, which the WHO has now officially named COVID-19. All 13 people on the second evacuation flight from Wuhan have been found to be negative. Bob Katter\u2019s press conference seems to be going well. He has just called a journalist from the Australian a \u201csocialist\u201d and another reporter from AAP a \u201clily pad leftie\u201d. Alan Finkel: Hydrogen is abundant. In fact, it\u2019s the most abundant element in the universe. The only problem is that there is nowhere on Earth that you can drill a well and find hydrogen gas. Don\u2019t panic. Fortunately, hydrogen is bound up in other substances. One we all know: water, the H in H-2-O. We have two viable ways to extract hydrogen with near-zero emissions. First, we can split water in a process called electrolysis, using renewable electricity. Second, we can use coal and natural gas to split the water, and capture and permanently bury the carbon dioxide emitted along the way. I know some may be sceptical, because carbon capture and permanent storage has not been commercially viable in the electricity generation industry. But the process for hydrogen production is significantly more cost-effective for two crucial reasons. First, since carbon dioxide is left behind as a residual part of the hydrogen production process, there is no additional step, and little added cost, for its extraction. And second, because the process operates at much higher pressure, the extraction of the carbon dioxide is more energy efficient and it is easier to store. Alan Finkel: Natural gas is already making it possible for nations to transition to a reliable and relatively low emissions electricity supply. Look at Britain, where coal-fired electricity generation has plummeted from 75% in 1990 to just 2% in 2019. Driving this has been an increase in solar, wind and hydro electricity, up from 2% to 27%. At the same time, and this is key to the delivery of a reliable electricity supply, electricity from natural gas increased from virtually zero in 1990 to more than 38% in 2019. Closer to home, look at South Australia\u2019s success in increasing solar and wind electricity to 51% in the last fiscal year. Again, natural gas is key to the stability of the electricity supply, accounting for 47%. I am aware that building natural gas generators may be seen as problematic, and I will come back to that, but for now let\u2019s assume that with solar, wind and natural gas we will achieve a reliable, low emissions electricity supply. Is this enough? Not really. We still need a high-density source of transportable fuel for long-distance, heavy-duty trucks. We still need an alternative chemical feedstock to make the ammonia used to produce fertilisers. We still need a means to carry clean energy from one continent to another. Enter the hero: hydrogen. Alan Finkel continues his address: I want you to imagine a highway exclusively devoted to delivering the world\u2019s energy. Each lane is restricted to trucks that carry one of the world\u2019s seven large-scale sources of primary energy: coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar and wind. Our current energy security, and we do have energy security, comes at a price: the carbon dioxide emissions from the trucks in the three busiest lanes \u2013 the ones for coal, oil and natural gas. We can\u2019t just put up roadblocks overnight to stop these trucks; they are carrying the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s energy supply. But what if we expand clean electricity production carried by the trucks in the solar and wind lanes \u2013 three or four times over \u2013 into an economically efficient clean energy future. Think electric cars instead of petrol cars. Think electric factories instead of oil-burning factories. Cleaner and cheaper to run. A technology-driven orderly transition. Problems wrought by technology, solved by technology. The regional health minister, Mark Coulton, has held a press conference announcing that the government will create 100 more places for doctors to be trained as specialists by the college of rural and remote medicine. Coulton was asked about reports that the Nationals are debating among themselves whether to charge taxpayers to attend a function in Melbourne celebrating 100 years of the party. Coulton said it was up to individual MPs and senators to determine if they were entitled to claim travel expenses and the independent parliamentary expense authority would then scrutinise claims. He said: \u201dI can only speak for myself. I\u2019m attending that function ... with my wife. She\u2019ll be paying her way; I\u2019ll be paying my way. But I\u2019m not going to speak in general terms to my colleagues.\u201d Asked if he was disappointed infighting was capturing headlines, he replied: \u201cI can tell you for sure that the people I represent across regional Australia are far more concerned about ... getting doctors into regional Australia ... I\u2019ll repeat what I said this morning: they couldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s toenail about the soap opera that\u2019s being portrayed at the moment.\u201d The chief scientist continues: The stunning technology advances I have witnessed in the past 10 years make me optimistic. Renewable energy is booming worldwide, and is now being delivered at a markedly lower cost than ever before. In Australia, the cost of producing electricity from wind and solar is now about $50 a megawatt-hour. Even when the variability is firmed with storage, the price of solar and wind electricity is lower than existing gas-fired electricity generation and similar to new-build coal-fired electricity generation. This has resulted in substantial solar and wind electricity uptake in Australia and, most importantly, projections of a 33% cut in emissions in the electricity sector by 2030, when compared with 2005 levels. And this pricing trend will only continue with a recent United Nations report noting that in the last decade alone, the cost of solar electricity fell by 80% and is set to drop even further. So we\u2019re on our way. We can do this. Time and again we have demonstrated that no challenge to humanity is beyond humanity. But we cannot be naive about the scale of the task ahead. Nor can we afford to discard any of the tools at our disposal. I have always maintained that the focus needs to be on outcomes. The outcome in this case is reduced atmospheric emissions. We should use whatever underlying technologies achieve the goal. Alan Finkel has begun his National Press Club address: Growing up in the 1960s we lived with the possibility that our beautiful planet would be wiped out in unconstrained nuclear war. The United States and Soviet Union had armed themselves with enough nuclear weapons to obliterate the human race several times over, with both sides publicly committing to immediate retaliation in the event of a first strike. The only outcome of such a defence would be mutually assured destruction. With the stunningly appropriate acronym MAD. For years the terrifying prospect was that the image in that photograph, that blue marble containing all we know and cherish, could vanish in a single flash of light. A single moment of MAD-ness. Such was the fear, that a young American wrote to President Kennedy: \u201cI am 11 years old and every night I worry. What will be left of this wonderful world if someone presses the button? What will be left of you and your family?\u201d Late last year I received my own letter from a child. My 10-year-old grand-niece, Elise, wrote: \u201cUncle Alan, I just watched a frighteningly real video on the crisis of sustainability. I would love it if you could talk to my school about what we can do, how we can help, and what is actually going on.\u201d Now there is a world of difference between nuclear war and climate change, but we cannot deny that for the next generation climate change is one of their biggest concerns when contemplating the future. Elise, I\u2019d like to reassure you that just as mutually assured destruction was supplanted with mutual international cooperation, so too can we take collective action on climate change. No matter what you may think of politicians in general, there are those who actually care about outcomes. Darren Chester has tweeted, following his collapse: Anthony Albanese finishes with this: To Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples I say you have been patient. Patient beyond any ordinary level of comprehension. Your tenacity and your patience have been tested and your generosity has been truly humbling. As a nation we are tantalisingly close to the cusp of something new. Not the reinvention of Australia but the realisation of a greater one. An Australia that draws into its heart the generosity to heal and be healed, to honour and be honoured. To find courage to begin the process of truth telling and national treaty making. An Australia that is closing every one of the gaps, every one of the chasms that divide and belittle us all. When we consider all of our achievements as a nation we should be confident that these challenges are not beyond us. Let us take them up and let our modern nation stand whole, proud and reconciled alongside this continent\u2019s many ancient ones. As that great Yunupingu said, we started a fire. We hope it turns bright for Australia. Anthony Albanese: Through it, we must come to grips with the realities of our colonial past, that began with the arrival of the first fleet in 1788. Life could never be the same again. Not for those watching from the shore. The latest on this continent\u2019s unbroken line of generations stretching back over so many millennia. The world\u2019s oldest continuing culture. How proud are we of that. Not for the new arrivals, representatives of what they thought was the old world, to a world far older as they came together that day, collisions were set in train and as a new society steadily rose to its feet the mosaic of ancient societies was brought to its knees. From that point, for our First Nations people it was a history shaped by brutality, a brutality sometimes born of misunderstanding but more often it was not. A brutality that has echoed darkly through every generation that has followed. Anthony Albanese: Embarking upon truth telling hopefully will help us all towards liberation and the betterment of our nation. We have been moving slowly beyond our erasure of Indigenous achievement. We are putting behind us what William Stanger called the cold of forgetfulness, the great Australian silence. Look at what Bruce Pascoe has done with Dark Emu. In this one extraordinary book, Bruce has unearthed the knowledge we already had in our possession and chose to vary along the way. Ignorance feeds in darkness. Bruce has simply reminded us where the light switch is. And with the flick of the switch, the complex mosaic of ancient nations is suddenly laid before us in light as bright as those early European explorers first saw it and recorded it. The voice cannot be the end of the story, but must be followed by truth telling, and the telling of that truth must be entire. Bob Katter has called a press conference for 12.30 to respond to the Closing the Gap latest report, with this statement: We have had enough. You\u2019ve had your chance Mr White Fella Government. Your own report card reads \u201cFAILED MISERABLY\u201d. I will be disclosing on behalf of my Black Fella brother cousins in the north the action we will now be taking. It is time for war. Anthony Albanese: At its most basic level, the denial of a constitutionally enshrined voice is a denial of the Australian instinct for a fair go. Despite all the tests it is put through, the instinct for a fair go remains one of the great defining points of our national character. The voice is a modest request that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples be consulted about issues and policies that directly affect them. That\u2019s what it is. It is not a third chamber. It is not deliberative. It merely seeks to put a structure around what we would all regard, as Australians, as decency, as courtesy, and as respect, that where something is going to have an impact on someone else, we talk to them. That\u2019s what the voice is. Nothing greater than that, but also nothing less. Nothing less. And it shouldn\u2019t be beyond our capacity to take the hand of friendship which has been reached out to us and is waiting to be shaken. Because that is an act of extraordinary generosity, given the history of our great nation over the last 200 plus years. Anthony Albanese: We have before us an opportunity for bipartisanship we cannot afford to miss. Our international credibility is linked to our integrity with First Nations people. The minister and the prime minister had the opportunity to do something that they will be remembered for, and we will support them. However, as Linda Burney has put it, there is a danger that the Uluru statement will end up being remembered as a noble moment, but not as a turning point, and we cannot allow that to happen. At its most basic level, the denial of a constitutionally enshrined voice is a denial of the Australian instinct for a fair go. Despite all the tests it is put through, the instinct for a fair go remains one of the great defining points of our national character. The voice is a modest request that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples be consulted about issues and policies that directly affect them. That\u2019s what it is. It is not a third chamber. It is not deliberative. It merely seeks to put a structure around what we would all regard, as Australians, as decency, as courtesy, and as respect, that where something is going to have an impact on someone else, we talk to them. That\u2019s what the voice is. Nothing greater than that, but also nothing less. Nothing less. And it shouldn\u2019t be beyond our capacity to take the hand of friendship which has been reached out to us and is waiting to be shaken. Because that is an act of extraordinary generosity, given the history of our great nation over the last 200 plus years. Anthony Albanese: Rates of First Nations people in custody are still way too high. First Nations adults are just 2% of the population, but they make up 27% of the prison population. Suicide, particularly among young people, is still ripping families and communities apart. The number of children being put in out-of-home care is a national shame, and is a consequence of policy failure by governments. We want to work with the government, but we do expect some urgency, passion and diligence to be brought into this space. We cannot keep coming back here, year in, year out, wringing our hands. The new way forward has to be led by First Nations people in meaningful and mutually agreed partnerships. That way forward has been mapped out for us in the Uluru statement, a document of unadorned power to which Labor is fully committed. That way forward is voice, truth telling and agreement making. When the member for Hasluck was appointed minister for Indigenous Australians, Labor welcomed it as the right decision, and we wish him well. Indeed, when I spoke at a festival in east Arnhem Land last year, I expressed the hope that his colleagues would give him the support that he needed, and that he deserved. I am concerned that this process may end in disappointment. In regards to that post a little bit ago about the MPs who are doctors being called to a situation, Rob Harris from the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald reports Darren Chester had collapsed. Chester has not had a break \u2013 his electorate of Gippsland was seriously affected by the summer bushfires, and his return to parliament began with leadership wobbles in the Nationals. Hope he is OK. Anthony Albanese says while the national apology to Indigenous people was welcomed and well overdue, it also made clear \u201cthere was inequality and disparity that needed reconciliation\u201d. That there were key indicators showing the disadvantage resulting from more than two centuries of dispossession, discrimination, racism, and sometimes violent oppression. This was an indictment upon us as a modern nation. There were many gaps, but some appeared more urgent than others. These indicators include life expectancy, child mortality, school attendance, reading and numeracy, employment, early childhood, and the attainment of year 12 or equivalent. Practical measures with targets. After 12 years, it is tragic that we aren\u2019t on track for five of these seven targets, including life expectancy, child mortality and employment. It is an indictment that, of all of these targets, we are on track for only two. The problem was not that the targets were too ambitious. They were not. They were modest. And in the spirit of Paul Keating\u2019s 1992 Redfern speech, the failure to meet the target is our failure. Our failure, not theirs. The fact is that the two targets that are being met are welcome, particularly the finishing of year 12, as the prime minister has said. What that shows is that progress is possible. But the fact is, also, we can and we must do better. We speak of closing the gap, but the truth is that on so many of these measures, there is a gap. It\u2019s a chasm. Anthony Albanese is delivering his response to the latest report: Since 2008 I have sat in this place on this day and I have listened to fine speeches from prime ministers and opposition leaders alike. And afterwards, so often, I have heard members of the press gallery say that days like \u2018today\u2019 show the parliament at its best. But, Mr Speaker, if this day adds up to nothing but sentiment and speeches, if this occasion becomes merely a ceremonial renewal of good intentions and a promise to do better next time, that is so far short of parliament at its best. So far short of Australia at our best. Because in the end, it is not the prime minister\u2019s voice or the opposition leader\u2019s voice that should be heard on this day on this issue. It is the voice of the First Australians. It is the voice of over 60,000 years of culture, of story, a community, of kinship. It is the voice articulating the torment of our powerlessness from the Uluru statement that must be heard. Over 60,000 years of love for this country, their country, our country, the continent that we share; enshrining the voice in our constitution is a great and unifying mission. More than a century overdue. But that recognition is not the end of the road. It must be the clarion bell of a change from what has been; enshrining the voice to parliament will be the work of one successful referendum. But listening to the voice, ensuring the voice is heard in this House and Senate, ensuring the voice speaks in the design and delivery of policy, ensuring the voice advocates the rights and interests of First Nations peoples, that is a task of national political leadership. Scott Morrison finishes his speech: This goes to the heart of who we are. In partnership with Indigenous Australians, with respect for their wisdom and capabilities, and appreciation for their grace towards their fellow Australians, we are beginning this next chapter in Closing the Gap. To see the gap, to see the challenges, to see the opportunities, to understand the hope, to see the way through Indigenous eyes. A chapter which allows us to believe in a day when Indigenous children of this land have the same opportunities as every other Australian child. Scott Morrison: Finally, Mr Speaker, I want to be clear as prime minister: I respect constitutional recognition. In 2019 the joint committee into constitutional recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples delivered a bipartisan report. Our government adopted the four bipartisan recommendations in this report, in particular recommendation one. In order to design a voice that best meets the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the committee recommends a process of co-design between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and government be initiated in communities across Australia to design a voice that can help deliver practical outcomes for that community. This is our government\u2019s policy. It is clear from the committee\u2019s report that more work needs to be done on a voice proposal. The government has always supported giving Indigenous people more of a say at the local level. We support the process of co-design of the voice because if we are going to change the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on the ground we need [to chart] the policies that affect them. The committee did not make recommendations as to the legal form of the voice, constitutional or legislation. It recommended considering this matter after the process of co-design is complete, and that is what we\u2019re doing. We support finalising co-design. We also support recommendations about truth telling. Australians are interested in having a fuller understanding of their history, both the history, traditions and also the culture course of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and also contact between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. Scott Morrison: Indigenous young people are almost four times more likely than their non-Indigenous peers to take their own lives. Tackling suicide, all suicides, is a national priority. In tackling this national priority we are using targeted strategies. We have unveiled Australia\u2019s largest ever youth mental health and suicide prevention package. Two of the 12 trials being funded for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people specifically. In the last budget we committed $4.5m for Indigenous leaders to work on an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suicide prevention plan, plan that recognises the value of community and provide services are culturally safe and accessible and are well connected to each other and the broader community. From that came a body called proud of spirit. That will support Indigenous leadership in suicide prevention. We are working alongside community members and frontline services who serve the community selflessly with strong and open hearts. Indigenous liaison officers, Indigenous stop design nurses. In the last three years, nearly 5,000 people in more than 180 regional and remote communities have completed mental health first aid training, a program that expanded in the last budget. 89,000 people became accredited instructors. We are creating solutions that are local and developed in partnership with Indigenous communities. A few MPs have just told me that the MPs who are also doctors have just been called from the chamber. I hope everyone is OK. Scott Morrison: Mr Speaker, in days, some in this chamber will remember the government had absolute control over the lives of Aboriginal people, where they could live, where they could travel, who they could marry. Government files held details, often brutal in their brevity, that the people themselves were not allowed to know. Mr Speaker, I have one such file here with me. From the native welfare department ... A file of ... the native welfare department, the file is for a boy, a teenager. In this file are notes about for school uniforms and there is a memo to the commissioner of native welfare about whether the boy should be provided pocket money of 75 cents a week. 75 cents a week. Bureaucrats making decisions for what they paternally call a good type of lad. Think about a life where even the most basic decision-making is stripped away from you. By governance thinking that they know better. Fortunately, that boy was bigger than the times. And I am honoured that he now sits behind me as the minister for Indigenous Australians. The chamber applauds Ken Wyatt. Scott Morrison: There remains much to do. And we will do it differently by working together. By moving from a fixation with what is going wrong to a focus on strength. By going from good intentions and sky-high aspirations to local practical action driven by local leaders and local needs with clear accountability and responsibility with a clear line of sight to the community and we are acting on a commitment by all levels of government to work together. For federal, state, territory and local governments to work together. Not just the Indigenous portfolios but whole governments at every point of contact. Scott Morrison: I am saddened that we have not met the target for child mortality but I draw hope and result from the fact that we are making progress in tackling the risk factors. More Indigenous mothers are attending antenatal care in the first trimester and more are going to at least five antenatal sessions. Fewer Indigenous mothers are smoking during pregnancy. We know that if we can shift these risk factors we can keep more Indigenous babies and children alive. We may not be on track to fully close the life expectancy gap in a generation, always an ambitious target but mortality rates have improved by almost 10%. This is mostly because we have made progress in tackling the leading cause of death, the big circulatory diseases like heart disease and stroke. This is progress. But as I said, we have not made as much progress as we should have by now. Scott Morrison: This is a stark and sobering report that I have tabled. I welcome the gains. I honour the hard work across every front, and we must be careful not to speak of our First Australians as a broken people, because they are not. So many of our First Australians are out there making their way, despite the disadvantages that they have faced, and overcome, setting goals, making choices, living their lives, and showing bravely the way to others. But I don\u2019t shy away from the failures. I see the shortcomings. The targets that was set for Indigenous Australians but not by Indigenous Australians do not celebrate the achievements and aspirations of Indigenous people. They do not tell you what is happening on the ground or storing under it. They don\u2019t tell you how realistic are achievable these targets were in the first place. They reinforce the language of failing and falling short and they also mask the real progress that has been made. We must be careful not to adopt a negative mindset because on most measures we have progress. Scott Morrison: I ask, what have we been too proud to learn? What must be learned so that we can grow together? Now, a new approach to Closing the Gap provide some of the answers to this question, an approach that is built on partnership, on giving back responsibility, and approach of listening, of empowering. Of government providing the capabilities so that Indigenous Australians can make their best choices. Of all governments accepting their own accountabilities. And of owning up to a path that despite the best of intentions of all governments hasn\u2019t worked. Mr Speaker, today I make the final report of an old approach, as well as the first report of a new era. Scott Morrison: Despite the best intentions, investments in new programs and bipartisan goodwill, Closing the Gap has never really been a partnership with Indigenous people. We perpetuated an ingrained way of thinking passed down over two centuries and more, and it was the belief that we knew better than our Indigenous peoples. We don\u2019t. We also thought we understood their problems better than they did. We don\u2019t. They live them. We must see the gap we wish to close, not from our viewpoints, but from the viewpoint of Indigenous Australians. Before we can hope to close it and make a real difference. And that is the change we are now making, together with Indigenous Australians through this process. We all have in our own way sought to grapple with the consequences of 2.25 centuries of Indigenous disempowerment. What I know is that to rob a person of their right to take responsibility for themselves, to strip them of responsibility and capability to direct their own futures, to make them dependent, this is to deny them their liberty, and slowly that person will weather before your eyes. That\u2019s what we did to our first nations peoples. And mostly we didn\u2019t even know we were doing it. We thought we were helping when we replaced independence with welfare. This must change. We must restore the right to take responsibility, the right to make decisions, the right to step up, the opportunity to own and create Australians\u2019 own futures. Scott Morrison: For 12 years I have said in this chamber and listen to Closing the Gap speeches. It is a tale of hope, frustration and disappointment. A tale of good intentions, indeed, good faith. But the results are not good enough. This is sadly still true. Last year I opened this address with what I believe is a national truth and a national shame, that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia today do not have the same opportunities as all other children growing up in Australia. They never have, in Australia, never. This is the ultimate test of our efforts, that every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boy and girl can grow up in this country with the same opportunities and expectations as any other Australian boy and girl. Over decades, our top-down, government knows best approach has not delivered the improvements we all need. The prime minister is about to deliver the Closing the Gap address to the parliament. The Australia Institute has had a look at coal-fired power stations being built around the world, given the latest government party room flare up over Collinsville. Its key findings: Around Australia and in other developed regions such as western Europe and North America, there are virtually no coal-fired power stations being built. The one western European plant under construction in Germany and nine years behind schedule; the plant was originally set to open in 2011, it is now scheduled for operation in 2020. There are no coal-fired power stations under construction in the United States, Canada or Mexico. The last coal plant built in North America was completed in May 2019, a tiny 17MW combined heat and power plant on the campus of the University of Alaska. The last pre-construction coal-fired power project, the Holcomb Expansion Project, was cancelled in January 2020. There are no coal-fired power stations being built in Australia. Right to information requests reveal government advice that an ultra-supercritical coal plant in north Queensland similar to the plant being proposed would only be viable with high electricity prices and without a significant carbon price. Despite the coal power plant proposed for Queensland being promoted as a \u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018low emissions\u2019 coal plant, Shine Energy claims it is \u2018essential\u2019 for investor confidence that the Government indemnify them against any risk of a future price on carbon. Jacqui Lambie, flanked by mothers, whose sons served in the Australian defence force and later took their own lives, continues to push for a royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicides. Colleen Pillen lost her son Michael. Nikki Jamieson lost her son Daniel. Julie Ann Finney lost her son David. Lambie says a royal commission would be more effective than the permanent commission, which the government has announced, in actually addressing and tackling the issue. We want the public to know what is going on. We want this done. We want it fully investigated, and we will never, ever, get that. I don\u2019t give a stuff what the prime minister says, with his option. Because we are not important enough. All the lives that we have lost because of the hands of defence and DVA, we are not important enough to have a royal commission. That stands for nothing. It\u2019s over, PM. We\u2019ve been begging for a royal commission. We\u2019ve nearly got down on our hands on bloody knees. For god\u2019s sake, give these mothers, give these fathers who have lost their families. From the Department of Defence and from DVA, those who have lost their lives, we want a royal commission. We want an end date, we want to be able to move on with our lives, and we are only going to be able to get that from a royal commission. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 Nothing like doubling down. Kristina Keneally is up in the Senate, speaking on the failure of the government to comply with Senate orders to produce documents related to the sports grant affair. She opened with this. It might sound familiar to politic watchers: \u201cI\u2019ll leave that stuff in the bubble.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t comment on gossip or stories about other stories.\u201d \u201cI just reject the premise of the question.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll put your editorial to one side and your commentary on it.\u201d These aren\u2019t my words \u2013 they are the words of prime minister Scott Morrison. From AAP: The Morrison government has been \u201cmissing in action\u201d as racism worsens in Australia, says Labor\u2019s multicultural affairs spokesman Andrew Giles. Giles will use a speech in Sydney to warn against the \u201ccreeping normalisation of hate and racism in Australia\u201d, and call on the government to back a new national campaign to combat growing xenophobia. \u201cAustralia\u2019s government has been missing in action,\u201d the federal Labor MP will say on Wednesday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s on Facebook or in the supermarket, whether it\u2019s on the football field or on the street, or the disadvantage experienced by our First Peoples \u2013 racism persists in Australia.\u201d He will say there had been attacks on people of Asian appearance in Melbourne and Sydney, a spike in attacks on Australian Muslims, and \u201cnear-constant denigration\u201d of African-Australians in the media. Businesses in a predominantly Chinese community in Melbourne\u2019s east have seen a 70% drop in business. \u201cNo doubt because of fear and misinformation about the coronavirus,\u201d Giles will say. \u201cThe truth is that racism in Australia is on the rise.\u201d Not even parliament was immune, he said, pointing to the support Coalition senators gave to One Nation leader Pauline Hanson\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s OK to be white\u201d motion. \u201cThese actions carry heavy consequences,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout doubt racism can take a real and lasting toll on individual lives and communities.\u201d Giles will also point to Daily Telegraph columnist Tim Blair referring to former race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane as \u201crace hustler Tim Sudafednasalspray\u201d. Soutphommasane has continued to remain outspoken on race issues in Australia. \u201cAt first, I thought it was a mistake,\u201d Giles will say. \u201cIt was racism, pure and simple.\u201d Liberal backbench senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells seems to be in the cohort of Coalition politicians who are keen to talk up arson in response to the summer bushfire crisis, at the detriment of talk on climate change. In a speech in the adjournment debate on Tuesday night, Fierravanti-Wells warned of \u201ceco-terrorism\u201d behind the summer\u2019s fires, quoting the go-to article by Monash academic Dr Paul Read that arson is behind 87% of fires. As we have pointed out before, the so-called \u201carson emergency\u201d myth has been propagated by rightwing pundits and media keen to distract from experts pointing out that conditions for the fires had been exacerbated by climate change. Read himself told Mashable he was angry at how his research had been twisted to gloss over the environmental factors. \u201cTo incite fires of the size and scale of 2019/20 you\u2019d need a sudden doubling of arson activity or a single person working across states. Climate change is here to stay.\u201d Nevertheless, Fierravanti-Wells is convinced the number of fires \u201csuggests a level of coordination\u201d and has called on the government to use the data retention laws to snoop on the call records of those who have been arrested for arson over the summer to check coordination. She also wants \u201ceco-terrorism\u201d to be on the agenda of the national security of cabinet. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, spoke to the ABC this morning about why there has been so little progress in Closing the Gap: Well, there\u2019s multiple factors. We don\u2019t deliver the services on the ground. We\u2019ve got to work much more closely with states and territories. The Aboriginal communities must be involved in this process; our peaks is certainly involved. But at the local levels, that\u2019s where we have to turn our attention to, because parents are the first educators in a child\u2019s life. Community is important. We don\u2019t engage with them as well as we should. And certainly in the refresh of the Closing the Gap, working with the 47 peak organisations, we\u2019re having very real talks around how do we change the agenda. In the Senate, senators are arguing over the government not producing documents related to the sports grant affair. The government has missed another deadline, by refusing to put in documents, including legal advice, of the sports grant program. It\u2019s all being covered under cabinet-in-confidence. Most of the government senators have left the chamber. Given the government is still arguing about building new coal-fired plants, Sabra Lane asks Alan Finkel what he thinks about new coal-fired plants in general. New coal-fired plants would be probably generating electricity with emissions levels, not dissimilar to the average emissions on the Australian electricity system today, but that average is going to be going down and down and down, so you would have that coal-fired station operating at a higher level. I think the attention really should be on low-emissions technologies, such as solar and wind, but they need to be supported. In the long term, they will be supported by batteries and pumped hydro, and hydrogen which has been stored to regenerate electricity, but that takes a lot of time. So for 10, 20, maybe even 30 years, the most efficient way to bring a lot of zero-emission solar and wind into the system is to support it with natural gas. Because natural gas is a much lower-emissions technology, even though it\u2019s a fossil fuel, it\u2019s much lower than coal, and it\u2019s much more flexible in terms of only being used when there is a shortage of solar and wind. On his role, Finkel says it is to advise the government based on \u201cthe science and technological evidence\u201d. The scientific recommendation is that the planet needs to decarbonise, needs to reduce its emissions. In Paris, the accepted position was to achieve zero emissions by the second half of this century. Not specifically 2050. Actually decarbonising the whole planet by 2050 would be very, very difficult. On the argument that \u201cAustralia\u2019s emissions are too small to matter\u201d, Alan Finkel said if we took that attitude to everything \u2013 for example, ignoring water restrictions because we were just one household \u2013 \u201call of a sudden we would have a water shortage\u201d. He said our contribution might be small, but when it has been done, globally, it has been \u201cvery well regarded\u201d. Alan Finkel was asked what the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d was for the climate fights in parliament and said he hoped it was \u201cevidence-based, technology driven\u201d. Finkel said he came at the issue \u201cnot from a political perspective\u201d but based on his experience as a scientist and engineer. \u201cThe main point I will make in my speech today, is the sweet spot for attention is the energy sector. I don\u2019t mean energy as in electricity, I mean the petrol we use in our vehicles, and the natural gas we use for heating up our buildings, as well as the electricity sector itself. They represent nearly three-quarters globally, of emissions of carbon dioxide,\u201d he told AM. \u201cThree-quarters of global warming gasses, actually. So if we could reduce that down to zero, that would have a massive positive benefit for us.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel is delivering today\u2019s National Press Club address. He spoke to Sabra Lane on ABC AM this morning and was asked what impact climate change had on the summer bushfires: Climate change of course is driven by global warming and we have seen temperatures in Australia rise nearly 1.5C above the mid-century average from last year and associated with that, we have also seen the national forest fire index increase since it was done in 1950. The number of fire hazard days is continually increasing. Also associated with that warming, you see more growth in winter, so the undergrowth load is heavier, it is a little bit faster, because of the increase in carbon dioxide, which plants of course use as food. Ultimately when the dry conditions of summer arrive, you have a very large fuel load, ready to burn. ... Climate change is driven by that steady rise in global temperatures. That is a link between climate changes and bushfires. You can\u2019t say there is a link between climate change and all events, in particular individual cyclones and individual droughts, but the steady rise in fire hazardous days in Australia, is in the opinion of people I respect and speak to, is linked to climate change.

It\u2019s the 12th anniversary of the Close the Gap Report and I certainly understand from all reports that we\u2019re not doing well and I think that there is greater work to be done in this space. There is a connection that with the policies of the Morrison government in terms of improving the lives of First Nations People. There is a connection, and in fact that connection is not being met. When we look at policies like the CDP [Community Development Program] policy, the cashless debit card, which entrenches First Nations people in poverty in this country, then of course we\u2019re not going to see the outcomes that we want to see in health, in education, in housing, in life expectancy. I call on the Morrison government to connect these very important policies. It\u2019s been five years when Tony Abbott got rid of $500m to the Aboriginal Affairs budget in this country, and we have seen year after year, a breaking down even further into poverty, into disadvantage for First Nations people. And the Coalition government has to see this connection. There\u2019s also a connection between calling for a voice to the federal parliament, calling for a voice to be in the constitution. All of these things are connected to Closing the Gap and improving the lives for First Nations People. And I call on the federal government, I call on Ken Wyatt as the minister for First Nations people in this country to be serious about this job, to be very serious. There is no doubt no doubt, there is sincerity in terms of Ken Wyatt\u2019s push to see a better way of life for people. But it\u2019s not happening, and the reason why it\u2019s not happening is because of the chaos and the dysfunction in the Coalition party, the fact that the Nationals can go away and worry about themselves and not care about the people of the land and the country. The fact that they\u2019re so obsessed with their own concerns when there are people in desperate need, not just First Nations people but people who are recovering from the bushfires who are wanting to know what their future is. That dysfunction is being carried out in what we saw take place in the Coalition party room yesterday when senators opposed a move of, any move, for a referendum for First Nations people in this country and that\u2019s an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute disgrace. And I call on those senators to stand up in the Senate today and have that debate. And they know who they are. The Mineral Council of Australia says it is happy to meet with Adam Bandt (see previous post). Chief executive officer Tania Constable said: The MCA supports continued action on climate change, Australia\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement and a technology-neutral transformation to a low-emissions global economy. Accelerating investment in low-emissions technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy is crucial in meeting the Paris agreement\u2019s climate goals. Australian mining businesses are working together to make our contribution to lowering emissions, including reducing the emissions from minerals extraction and processing, investment in low-emission technology, energy-efficiency initiatives and increasing the use of renewable energy in operations. All sectors of the economy need to contribute to reducing emissions. The MCA will soon release a detailed climate action plan which complements the already strong efforts by our members on climate change. It represents a long-term commitment by the MCA to help support members manage and reduce their emissions. The global transition to low emissions technologies \u2013 including solar, wind, batteries, gas, advanced coal and nuclear energy \u2013 depends on the metals and raw materials provided by the minerals sector. A thriving minerals sector focused on effective and pragmatic climate action is essential to mobilise the solutions required to address climate change. Asked on Adelaide radio 5AA\u2019s two-tribes-which-became-one-tribe segment (doesn\u2019t look like the Coalition put another person up after Christopher Pyne retired) if Labor was helping the rebel Nationals \u201cdestabilise\u201d the government, Anthony Albanese said: Well, the fact is this is the Muppet Show, the sequel, is what we\u2019re seeing here. After Scott Morrison himself, when he became prime minister, described their operation as the Muppet Show. And it just continues on and on. The Liberals are fighting each other. The Nationals are fighting each other. And the Liberals are fighting the Nationals. It is chaos, the Coalition, here at the moment. And it\u2019s not up to us to unify them. That\u2019s the job of Scott Morrison. It seems he\u2019s incapable of doing so. The toxic battle between the McComacks and the not-McCormacks in the National party room continues. Nationals leader Michael McCormack\u2019s office has been subjected to another damaging leak. The Courier Mail reports McCormack\u2019s office had supported MPs slugging taxpayers for flights and accommodation in Melbourne for the Nationals centenary celebrations, by scheduling a party room meeting in the city for the same time. That looks like it has been put on hold now, with McCormack telling the paper through a spokesperson that the trip was dependent on advice from the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority. There are a lot of moving parts in climate change at the moment. The government is having another round of ructions about whether to pivot to more credible policies or provide taxpayer support for coal-fired power. The business groups who once played a prominent role in scuttling climate action are performing a significant about face, demanding government put Australia on the path of net zero emissions by 2050. Labor is creeping towards some broad statements of principle in its post-election policy. The independent Zali Steggall has produced a climate policy bill she hopes can be a grand bargain \u2013 in the event it can ever get to the floor of the parliament. The Greens have shifted too. The new leader Adam Bandt is talking about a green new deal\u2013 which pushes climate action into a broader economic framework. With business shifting, Bandt has decided to fire off a letter to the major organisations: the BCA, AI Group, the Minerals Council, seeking backing for a new green deal to (as he puts it) \u201caddress the twin crises of economic stagnation and the climate emergency\u201d. The deal would see the phasing out of fossil fuels. (One suspects the Minerals Council may have some reservations.) Bandt\u2019s letter says: We want to work with you to create an environment where business can flourish with cheap energy and government on its side. I urge you to be part of developing an agreed roadmap so that it can be implemented when the Greens are again in balance of power. People are sometimes unsure what the Greens think about jobs and the economy. My goal is to make it clear that a Green New Deal means jobs and prosperity. Labor and the Greens are not letting up as they pursue the government for copies of its legal advice on the bungled robodebt program. Last week, it emerged the government was told in legal advice that the scheme was \u201cunlawful\u201d \u2013 though it remains unclear when it was received. This is vital because it would indicate whether the government continued to operate the scheme in the knowledge it was potentially unlawful. Last evening, the Senate passed an interim report from the ongoing inquiry into the robodebt program, demanding copies of the legal advice and other records. The Coalition argues that it should keep the documents secret because it is facing ongoing legal action in the form of the Gordon Legal class action, and that past Coalition and Labor governments have generally declined to provide privileged legal advice. It can choose to defy the order \u2013 as occurred in November over a regional grants program. This is the motion, supported by all the non-government senators, which will strip Mathias Cormann of his role representing the prime minister in the Senate, if it is passed (which it will be, given all the minors have signed it too) I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move that: (1) the Senate notes: (a) On 5 February 2020 the Senate ordered the minister representing the prime minister to table the final report provided by the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Phillip Gaetjens, to the prime minister in relation to the application of the statement of ministerial standards to the former minister for sport, the honourable senator McKenzie\u2019s, award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Program, (b) On 6 February 2020 the minister representing the prime minister tabled a letter making a public interest immunity claim grounded in the preservation of the confidentiality of cabinet deliberations, (C) The document is a final report prepared outside of the cabinet room and has no capacity to reveal deliberations inside the cabinet room, (d) The Senate does not accept the public interest immunity claim made by the minister representing the prime minister; and (2) Until the final report provided by the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Phillip Gaetjens, to the prime minister in relation to the application of the statement of ministerial standards to the former minister for sport, the honourable senator McKenzie\u2019s, award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Program, is tabled, or 6 March 2020, whichever is the earlier, senator Cormann be prevented from: (a) being asked or answering questions which may be put to ministers under standing order 72(1) where such questions are directed to the minister representing the prime minister, (b) representing the prime minister before a legislative and general purpose standing committee, including during consideration of estimates, and (c) sitting at the seat at the table in the Senate chamber that is ordinarily reserved for the leader of the government in the Senate. Late yesterday, the non-government senators decided to play hardball with the government. Either it releases the PM&amp;C report Scott Morrison\u2019s former chief of staff turned departmental head wrote on the sports grants affair, or Mathias Cormann will be stripped of his role representing the prime minister in the Senate. That\u2019s a pretty big deal. It means Cormann could not represent Morrison in question time, or upcoming Senate estimates, where he is considered one of the best defensive blockers for the government in the business. It also means he couldn\u2019t sit in the chair reserved for the leader of the government in the Senate \u2013 which is just bad optics. The motion to make this happen will be voted on today. It\u2019s co-signed by Penny Wong, Jacqui Lambie, Larissa Waters, Pauline Hanson and Rex Patrick. That\u2019s Labor and all the minor parties and independents, which gives the motion the numbers to pass. That motion will be voted on at 3.30pm. That won\u2019t grind the government to a halt, but it will be embarrassing for the government and creates a pretty strong precedent. The Senate did not come to play. Also not great for the government \u2013 the latest Closing the Gap report. With little to no progress made on five of the seven targets, the government is looking for a new approach. From Sarah Martin\u2019s story: Following on from pledges in 2019 to \u201crefresh\u201d the Closing the Gap targets, Morrison will tell parliament that the latest report does not accurately reflect the progress that is being made on the ground, where on all measures \u201cthings are better than they were\u201d. He says the Closing the Gap process has reinforced \u201cthe language of failing and falling short\u201d and masked the \u201creal progress\u201d being made. The targets don\u2019t celebrate the strengths, achievements and aspirations of Indigenous people. They don\u2019t tell you what\u2019s happening on the ground, or stirring under it (and) they don\u2019t tell you how realistic or achievable these targets were in the first place,\u201d Morrison is expected to say on Wednesday, according to extracts of his draft speech. We\u2019ll have that and the rest of the day\u2019s events. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. I am yet to have a coffee, so you have about 25% of me, which is not bad for a Wednesday. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

It very adversely affects my constituents,\u201d Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, told the Commons, to which Boris Johnson replied: \u201cEvery single infrastructure project is opposed at these critical moments. We have got to have the guts and the foresight to drive it through.\u201d * * * Crunch time \u2013 The town of Arteixo Galicia has its own unique reason to toast Parasite\u2019s Oscar-night triumphs: the South Korean film featured its locally made Bonilla a la Vista patatas fritas brand, and sales are booming as a result. Bonilla a la Vista was founded in 1932 when Salvador Bonilla began travelling around Galicia to sell his crisps and churros at fairs. His son C\u00e9sar still heads the family business at the age of 87. \u201cWe\u2019ve always used good potatoes, good olive oil and sea salt \u2013 that gives them a great taste and texture,\u201d he said. Today in Focus podcast: Back from the brink of death The anti-overdose drug naloxone has been in clinical use since the 1970s but not always where it\u2019s needed most. The Guardian\u2019s Jamie Grierson visited Redcar in North Yorkshire where a group of former drug users provide at-risk people with kits that could save their lives. Plus George Monbiot on Storm Ciara and the flooding that has once again devastated parts of England. Lunchtime read: Regrets, we all have a few We spend on average 110 hours a year considering what might have been \u2013 from loves lost to jobs we should have pursued. But it is possible to escape this cycle, writes Amy Fleming. Sport The Rugby Football Union is to cut its funding of the Championship by 50%, throwing England\u2019s second tier into turmoil and handing \u201cring-fencing to the Premiership on a plate\u201d. UK Sport has begun an unprecedented comprehensive review into UK Athletics after admitting it had \u201cmajor concerns\u201d following a series of crises, scandals and poor decisions that have plunged the organisation into disarray. Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by Tottenham in November, says he would relish another opportunity to manage in the Premier League. Tiger Woods has been approached by the organisers of a proposed Premier Golf League, but admits he is still trying to \u201cfigure it all out\u201d. Concern is growing at Sheffield Wednesday about South Yorkshire police\u2019s methods at matches following the shocking incident on Saturday when an officer struck a 16-year-old supporter over the head with a baton. The Six Nations and the private equity firm CVC\u2019s impending deal is threatening to take some games off free-to-air TV, and that could be a dangerous move, writes Andy Bull. And an Italian football referee has been banned from officiating or attending football matches for one year after headbutting a goalkeeper following a regional league match. Business Complaints about high-cost loans have shot up by 250%, figures from the financial ombudsman show. The ombudsman dealt with 4,535 new cases about so-called instalment loans, which have replaced payday loans in the wake of the collapse of Wonga, during the three months to 31 December 2019. Asian shares rose again in the wake of strong gains in Europe and the US in the previous session. The FTSE is set for a modest gain this morning while the pound is on $1.296 and \u20ac1.188. The papers Much ado about HS2 and the news we have been awaiting for days. The Guardian reports that the PM \u201cstakes his reputation\u201d on the transport \u201cspine\u201d. Our front-page picture is Steve Walsh who unknowingly caught and spread the Covid-19 virus. The Metro calls the rail line \u201cHigh Spend 2\u201d \u2013 the i, \u201cHigh Speed North\u201d. The FT says Boris Johnson\u2019s decision \u201cpromises revolution in transport\u201d while the Express calls it \u201cHis biggest gamble yet\u201d. The Telegraph carries the BBC chairman\u2019s warning that \u201cScrapping licence fee will weaken the nation\u201d. The Times says Boris Johnson is understood to be \u201cfurious\u201d after deportations to Jamaica were challenged in the courts: \u201cDangerous criminals out in days, No 10 fears\u201d. The Mirror splashes with Steve Walsh, the Covid-19 survivor: \u201cDon\u2019t turn me into a scapegoat\u201d. The Mail reports on \u201cOur old-age health crisis\u201d as diagnosed by the new chief medical officer. The Sun promotes an \u201cexclusive\u201d on Paul Hollywood\u2019s past love life.

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin has bounced back above $10,000 (\u00a37,731), fuelled by investors seeking a safe haven amid fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus. On Sunday, bitcoin rose above $10,000 for the first time since September and by Wednesday was trading at $10,335 on the Luxembourg-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. It marks a significant shift in fortunes for the 10-year-old cryptocurrency, which hit a low of $3,196 in December 2018. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have joined gold as a safe-haven asset at times of economic or political uncertainty. Trading in the cryptocurrency has been highly volatile and even after its latest bull run it remains well below its all-time high in late 2017, which was just short of $20,000. While the coronavirus, which has been officially named Covid-19, is considered a factor in its latest surge, the main driver in the short-term is mostly attributed to the upcoming bitcoin \u201chalving event\u201d in May. This will result in the number of bitcoins available to so-called \u201cminers\u201d being cut by half.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Panic has set in across Hong Kong over the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,115 and infected over 45,000 across the world, mostly in China.

Johnny Lau, a political commentator on Chinese politics, said the lack of trust in the Hong Kong government has extended to Beijing and as Carrie Lam, the region\u2019s chief executive, is deeply unpopular but supported by Beijing \u201cpeople will be sceptical towards Beijing\u2019s policy towards Hong Kong\u201d. \u201cThis shows that Hong Kong\u2019s political future is only heading for self-destruction,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2020. The level of distrust in the government has risen to an all-time high since 1992, not fallen to an all-time low as an earlier version stated.",

      "bodyText": "Cambodia has agreed to let a cruise ship that has been turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard may have the coronavirus to dock and disembark its passengers, the ship\u2019s operator has said. The MS Westerdam, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, will dock at the Cambodian sea port of Sihanoukville on Thursday, Holland America Line said. The ship \u2013 which says it has no sick passengers \u2013 has been turned away from Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, prompting fears prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement that it could run out of food as it searched for a port. \u201cWe will immediately begin making our way to Sihanoukville in Cambodia,\u201d Westerdam captain Vincent Smit told passengers. \u201cThere will be a brief health inspection on board by the Cambodian authorities which will take place at anchor just before we arrive.\u201d The ship is expected to arrive in Cambodia at about 7am (0000 GMT) on Thursday, he said. Crew members staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit We Are Family by Sister Sledge. Stephen Hansen, a Canadian on board the Westerdam with his wife, said they had joined the ship on 16 January in Singapore and were originally scheduled to get off in Yokohama, its intended final destination. \u201cPassengers are OK but anxious for a resolution,\u201d Hansen told the Guardian in a message before the Cambodia decision was announced. \u201cIf it goes on much longer the ship will run low on food, fuel and medications. \u201cDay-to-day life onboard is still pretty typical for a cruise. There are no restrictions on movement, eats etc. Generally the mood is still OK but each new rejection/disappointment brings increased frustration and anxiety.\u201d Hansen, from Vancouver, said the crew were doing an \u201camazing job trying to keep life normal and passengers happy. A few passengers have become angry and are venting on social media but I think most are trusting that it will all work out OK soon.\u201d \u201cThat said, this has become a political issue and our governments need to step in our behalf. Maybe they already are but we have no news of that.\u201d There are no confirmed cases of the virus onboard the Westerdam, but it stopped in Hong Kong less than two weeks ago, which is within the incubation period of the virus. The passengers include 650 from the US, 271 from Canada, 127 from the UK and 91 from the Netherlands, with smaller numbers of people from Australia, Germany, China and other countries. Officials in Japan, meanwhile, said another 39 people onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner had been diagnosed with the virus, with one quarantine officer also infected, bringing the total number of cases to 175. In all, Japan has confirmed 203 cases, prompting South Korea on Tuesday to \u201cstrongly advise\u201d its citizens not to travel to Japan and several other countries in Asia. The Diamond Princess, which is docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, will remain quarantined until at least 19 February, although media reports said plans were being made to remove older passengers and those with chronic health conditions not connected to the virus before then. Officials said it would take time to work out where they could be sent. About 3,700 people are onboard the cruise ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. \u201cOut of 53 new test results, 39 people were found positive,\u201d Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, told reporters, adding that four passengers diagnosed earlier were in a serious condition. Kato said in parliament that he wanted to expand testing to all passengers and crew onboard, and that authorities could muster resources to do more than 1,000 tests a day. The ship has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship last month in Hong Kong.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Schools in the area are also taking precautions.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap Investors are driving global stock markets higher on hopes that the coronavirus will ease soon. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has hit a fresh record high today, as has Germany\u2019s DAX, and Wall Street is also at a fresh peak. The rally follows signs that the infection fate for Covid-19 may be slowing. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 28 points or 0.4% in late trading, at 7527 points. The oil price has also been lifted today; Brent crude is now 3% higher on expectations of higher demand (if China can get a firm grip on the outbreak). But there are also fresh signs that the infection is hitting economic growth and corporate profits. S&amp;P Global has predicted that growth in the UK and the Eurozone will be hit, perhaps 0.2% lower than expected this year. Manufacturing will bear the brunt, they say, due to disruption as Chinese factories. Deutsche Bank has suggested that Germany\u2019s economy could be pulled into recession by the crisis. Cruise operator Carnival has warned that its profits will suffer this year, as it cancels voyages from China and across Asia. Mobile World Congress, one of the world\u2019s biggest business conferences, is also in doubt. A string of top exhibitors have withdrawn, including BT and Nokia today. Here\u2019s a reminder of just how bad conditions are in Hong Kong: In New York, stocks have hit fresh record highs as investors bank on the coronavirus crisis easing. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 206 points, or 0.7%, at 29,482 -- a new record. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both at new peaks too, up around 0.4% this morning. This follows gains in Europe and Asia today, on the back of signs that infections in China are slowing (although some experts are urging caution). Newsflash: Cruise company Carnival has warned that the coronavirus crisis will hit its earnings this year. In a statement to the City, Carnival says that it has suspended sailings from ports in China. This is now resulting in voyages from other parts of Asia also being cancelled. And while Carnival can\u2019t see the full impact yet, it expects a \u201cmaterial\u201d impact on results this year. It told shareholders: Travel restrictions as a result of Coronavirus necessitated the suspension of cruise operations from ports in China, as was previously announced, and are now resulting in the cancellation of voyages in other parts of Asia. Significant events affecting travel typically have an impact on booking patterns, with the full extent of the impact generally determined by the length of time the event influences travel decisions. As a result of Coronavirus, the company believes the impact on its global bookings and cancelled voyages will have a material impact on its financial results which was not anticipated in the company\u2019s previous 2020 earnings guidance. Carnival adds that profits would take a larger hit if it was forced to suspend all Asian operations until the spring (this isn\u2019t planned, yet). Since the situation continues to evolve, the company is currently unable to determine the full financial impact on its fiscal year 2020. However, while not currently planned, if the company had to suspend all of its operations in Asia through the end of April, this would impact its fiscal 2020 financial performance by $0.55 to $0.65 per share, which includes guest compensation. In addition, the impact on global bookings will further affect the company\u2019s financial performance. The company is currently evaluating contingency plans to mitigate the impact and will provide an update with its first quarter 2020 earnings release in late March. Back in December, Carnival predicted it would earn between $4.30 and $4.60 per share this year, so it\u2019s now suggesting they could be more than 10% lower. More than 50,000 companies worldwide have at least one key supplier based in regions of China hit by the coronavirus. Millions more have some relationship with such suppliers. That\u2019s according to a new report from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the data analytics company, into the impact which coronavirus will have on global supply chains, and businesses around the world. It found that: At least 51,000 (163 Fortune 1000) companies around the world have one or more direct or Tier 1 suppliers in the impacted region, and at least five million companies (938 Fortune 1000) around the world have one or more Tier 2 suppliers in the impacted region. \u2022 The top five major sectors that account for over 80 percent of the businesses within the impacted provinces include services (personal and business), wholesale trade, manufacturing, retail, and financial services. Among these sectors, services, wholesale, and manufacturing account for approximately 65 percent of the businesses in the impacted region The report also flags up that 49,000 companies with foreign headquarters operate in the affected area. Almost half are from Hong Kong, but firms from Japan and the US also have a significant presence. The organisers of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) have just said that are monitoring \u201cthe fast-changing\u201d development of the coronavirus. In a statement issued after a string of attendees pulled out, the GSMA telecoms industry group said: \u201cThe novel coronavirus is a fast-changing situation, which GSMA is monitoring closely. This includes regularly meeting with global and Spanish health experts \u2013 as well as our partners \u2013 to ensure the wellbeing of attendees. \u201cWe have already implemented additional health measures ahead of MWC 2020 and will continue to seek expert medical advice on a frequent basis. Vodafone aren\u2019t waiting for a decision... they\u2019ve just pulled out of MWC too! The organisers of Mobile World Congress are holding a conference call now to decide whether to cancel the event or press on, Reuters reports. The flurry of companies pulling out due to the coronavirus (including BT and Nokia today) could force them to call the Barcelona set-piece event off..... Back in the markets, US stocks are expected to hit fresh record highs when Wall Street opens in under 90 minutes. Energy stocks will have a good day, judging by the rally in gas and crude oil price today. Uh oh.... Deutsche Bank has predicted that the coronavirus could drive Germany\u2019s economy into a recession this year. Bloomberg has the story: \u201cWe expect the coronavirus to dampen gross domestic product by 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter, making a technical recession highly possible in the winter half-year,\u201d a study published by Deutsche Bank Research says. The economists said that the coronavirus \u201cposes a risk to the global recovery, as hopes rest on a recovery in the Chinese economy.\u201d Germany\u2019s export-driven economy is heavily reliant on China, its most important trading partner. Germany\u2019s exporters already felt the effects of the cooling Chinese economy in 2019, and its car manufacturing industry is particularly vulnerable to any weakening demand from the enormous Chinese automotive market. Germany\u2019s GDP report for the fourth quarter of 2019 is published on Friday. Economists predict growth of just 0.1%, but a negative reading would put it half-way into recession. Deutsche Bank\u2019s warning chimes with S&amp;P\u2019s forecast this morning that the UK and the eurozone will suffer a growth hit. Another casualty: Meanwhile in the eurozone.... Greek bonds have hit a new record high. The yield (or interest rate) on ten-year debt issued by Athens has dropped below 1% for the first time ever. Investors will get just 0.95% per year on the bonds, showing they are seen as a pretty safe bet these days. For comparison, they spiked over 30% in 2012 before investors agreed to write off much of Greece\u2019s loans as part of its second bailout. This is also a sign that investors are chasing yield where they can get it -- and banking that the Greek crisis can\u2019t return.... Charlie Kronick, oil advisor from Greenpeace UK, has some questions for BP\u2019s new CEO Bernard Looney about his new plan to get to \u2018net zero\u2019 by 2050: \u201cBP\u2019s \u2018ambitions\u2019 and \u2018aims\u2019 all seem to apply to Looney\u2019s successors, and leave the urgent questions unanswered. How will they reach net zero? Will it be through offsetting? When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can\u2019t burn? What is the scale and schedule for the renewables investment they barely mention? And what are they going to do this decade, when the battle to protect our climate will be won or lost.\u201d Ron Bousso of Reuters thinks BP\u2019s plan is \u201cvery ambitious\u201d: But Adam Vaughan of New Scientist (and one of this parish) points out that BP\u2019s plan is light on detail: Breaking away from coronavirus and the markets.. oil giant BP has just announced plans to become a net zero carbon emitter within 30 years. BP is promising to reorganise its structure, and to \u201cplay its part\u201d in helping the world transition to net zero. Its plans will cover the greenhouse gases it creates itself, and the carbon dioxide emissions in the oil and gas it produces. The move follows sustained pressure from activists, who have targeted the company as a major cause of rising temperatures (and who have blasted its efforts to \u2018greenwash\u2019 its image through sponsorship deals). Here\u2019s some details: Five aims to get BP to net zero: Net zero across BP\u2019s operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. Net zero on carbon in BP\u2019s oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. 50% cut in the carbon intensity of products BP sells by 2050 or sooner. Install methane measurement at all BP\u2019s major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and reduce methane intensity of operations by 50%. Increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time. Five aims to help the world get to net zero: More active advocacy for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing. Further incentivise BP\u2019s workforce to deliver aims and mobilise them to advocate for net zero. Set new expectations for relationships with trade associations. Aim to be recognised as a leader for transparency of reporting, including supporting the recommendations of the TCFD. Launch a new team to help countries, cities and large companies decarbonise. However, BP is also promising to remain financially strong, generating cash and paying dividends -- doing that while moving to clean energy will be tough..... BT, the UK telecoms company, has just pulled out of Mobile World Congress too! Just in: Nokia has joined the swelling ranks of companies pulling out of the world\u2019s largest mobile phone conference, due to the coronavirus. The Finnish mobile firm has dropped plans to attend Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, after carrying out \u201ca full assessment of the risks related to a fast-moving situation\u201d. Nokia says this is a \u201cprudent decision\u201d, given concerns that Covid-19 could potentially spread at MWC (as delegates from around the world will be massing for the event), adding: While the health and safety of our employees is our absolute priority, we also recognize that we have a responsibility to the industry and our customers. In view of this, we have taken the necessary time to evaluate a fast-moving situation, engage with the GSMA and other stakeholders, regularly consult external experts and authorities, and plan to manage risks based on a wide range of scenarios. The conclusion of that process is that we believe the prudent decision is to cancel our participation at Mobile World Congress. Nokia is joining Sony, Intel, Amazon, Ericsson, LG and Nvidia on the sidelines. European stocks are holding firm at record levels today, despite disagreement over whether the coronavirus outbreak is actually easing. The Stoxx 600 (made up of Europe\u2019s 600 largest companies) is still trading at a new peak, up 0.44% or 1.87 points at 430. The basic materials sector is leading the way, up 1%, followed by consumer stocks (+0.9%), and energy (+0.85%). It\u2019s quite a rally, given the global economy had already slowed last year before the coronavirus struck. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe, suggests investors are gripped by a Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO): There\u2019s no stopping these markets, it seems, with Europe back in record territory on the tiniest sliver of good news in regard to the, newly-named, COVID-19. Stock market investors are relentless, their ability to see the bull in any situation rivals only that of bitcoin enthusiasts, who can, it seems, make a bullish crypto argument for any and every newsworthy event. Yesterday saw the first deceleration in new COVID-19 cases in China, apparently a clear sign that the dawn is upon us. While I desperately hope that this is the case, one day of fewer reported cases is not exactly cause for celebration. The last weeks have been brutal and the number of cases and death toll have accelerated at a frightening rate. It\u2019s far too early to declare victory, but in the era of FOMO trading, investors are doing just that. It\u2019s now hoped that, as far as the economy is concerned, we\u2019re just facing a bad quarter that could wipe around 1% of full year Chinese growth. I\u2019m sure the data over the coming , weeks will enlighten us further on this but, should that turn out to be true, that seems perfectly manageable. Although companies in the country may not be so fortunate. Cryptocurrencies have also benefitted from anxiety over coronavirus, with bitcoin hitting $10,000 this week. Here\u2019s the latest: Oh dear. Eurozone industry had even worse December than we thought. Output from euro area manufacturers shrank by 2.1% during the month, and was over 4% lower than in December 2018. That extends a long run of falling production, as the US-China trade war and the weakening domestic economy hit demand. Coronavirus is not going to make 2020 any easier either.... Last night, S&amp;P Global warned that the spread of coronavirus will reduce US growth in the first quarter to just 1%, down from a previous forecast of 2.2%, However, it also eyed a recovery later in the year - unless the outbreak worsened. Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&amp;P Global, predicted: \u201cWe expect most of the drag on U.S. growth to be in the first quarter, with a smaller hit in the second quarter and a rebound in the latter half.\u201d The coronavirus crisis is likely cut 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off growth in the UK economy, and in the eurozone, this year, according to analysts at S&amp;P Global Ratings. They predict that growth will suffer, due to lower exports to China and weaker business investment. Britain\u2019s economy only grew by 1.4% in 2019, while the eurozone expanded by just 1.2%, so a 0.2 percentage point cut could hurt. But while some sectors, such as carmaking, will be hit, the wider economy could be more resilient. Sylvain Broyer, S&amp;P Global Ratings chief economist for EMEA, explains: \u201cThe coronavirus, which has triggered lockdowns in some parts of China, poses a risk of disruption to the European value chain, amplified by the current low levels of European inventories especially in the car sector, following four consecutive quarters of contraction.\u201d German manufacturing sector is particularly vulnerable, the report says. Production of computers and electronics, electrical equipment, machinery equipment, and car could all be hit by weaker demand from China. However, the eurozone is in better shape to ride out Covid-19 than it was 17 years ago when Sars hit, Broyer argues: \u201cIn 2003, the unemployment rate was on the rise across the continent. Today, European unemployment is close to an all-time low. Moreover, by lowering global growth expectations, the coronavirus has weighed on the oil price, which will lend support to households\u2019 purchasing power in Europe. Just in! Ofcom has appointed Melanie Dawes, one of the UK\u2019s most senior civil servants, as its new chief executive. Dawes takes over from Sharon White who left at the end of November to take up the role of chair at John Lewis. This calls for a hat-tip for my colleague Mark Sweney, who revealed back in November that 53-year-old Dawes, who is married to former Daily Telegraph deputy editor and chief political commentator Benedict Brogan, was the preferred candidate. Even if the coronavirus crisis does ease, it has already caused significant economic harm in China and beyond. Economists at UBS have predicted that Australia\u2019s economy could shrink by 0.1% in the current quarter, as exports of commodities and agricultural goods to Chinese customers take a hit. Apologies.... Italy\u2019s stock exchange is at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, not a full-blown record high as first reported (now corrected below...) The oil price is also rallying today, reflecting optimism that Covid-19 will not derail the global economy. Brent crude has jumped by almost 2.5% to $55.30 per barrel, from $54/barrel last night. It had been worth around $66/barrel three weeks ago, before falling steadily as the coronavirus crisis deepened. There\u2019s also some chatter in the markets that oil producers could implement an emergency supply cut to cushion the impact of the outbreak. Opec members such as Saudi Arabia are keen to curb production to prop up prices, but Russia (which isn\u2019t part of the cartel) aren\u2019t yet convinced.... The sight of Chinese workers returning to the office or factory after the Lunar New Year is also reassuring the markets. Mark Haefele, CIO at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the Chinese economy could bounce back this year, although growth could really suffer in the short term. The economic impact of the outbreak should be limited to the first quarter, in our base case. For China, we expect a 100-200bps hit to GDP growth in the first quarter, taking the rate of expansion down to 4-5%. But for 2020 as a whole, we see pent-up demand driving a recovery and expect an impact of around 50bps.\u201d All the major European stock markets are higher today in early trading, with Germany hitting record level. Italy has touched an 11-year high (corrected), which also helped to lift the Stoxx 600 to its new peak. UK FTSE 100: Up 10 points or 0.15% at 7,509 Germany\u2019s Dax: Up 44 points or 0.33% at 13,672 *RECORD HIGH* Italian FTSE MIB: Up 108 points or 0.4% at 24,797 Spain\u2019s IBEX: Up 12 points or 0.1% at 9,895 France\u2019s Cac: Up 18 points or 0.3% at 6,073 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic are touching record highs today, as optimism grows that the coronavirus crisis won\u2019t badly hurt the global economy. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index of top European shares has just opened at a new record high, with Germany\u2019s DAX leading the charge higher. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also hit record levels, and we\u2019re expecting further gains today. The rally comes as the number of new cases of Covid-19 (as it\u2019s now known) slowed. Some 2,105 new cases were reported in China today, the lowest daily increase since 30 January, lifting the total to 44,670. Perhaps significantly, the number of new cases in Hubei (where the outbreak began) also dipped. One government epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, has suggested that the outbreak could be over by April - a claim other experts fear is too optimistic. But even though new suspected cases are cropping up every around the world (from cruise ships to an Oxfordshire prison), investors are increasingly confident that the virus will be contained. There\u2019s lots of talk about \u201cV-shaped\u201d recoveries today, and optimism that global supply chains will bounce back from the mass closure of factories seen across China in recent weeks. Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG, explains: The newly termed \u2018COVID-19\u2019 virus continues to keep the market and central bankers vigilant. Wall Street charged on to record, running by the same theme from the start of the week on expectations that the coronavirus containment efforts could keep odds of a pandemic at bay. But.... are investors simply too complacent? Neil Wilson of Markets.com advises caution, especially as Beijing has tweaked how it reports new cases of the virus. The hope is airlines and industry will be back online soon. I\u2019d be cautious about this. We\u2019re also mindful of secondary and tertiary outbreaks in Europe and North America even as new cases slow in China. The rally is also being driven by confidence that central banks will maintain loose monetary policy. Yesterday, Fed chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US economy was in a good place, without suggesting rate rises were on the cards. Even that wasn\u2019t enough for Donald Trump, who gave Powell another Twitter blast for making the dollar too pricey. Also coming up today The latest eurozone factory data is likely to show a big fall in output in December, given we\u2019ve already seen weak surveys from Germany, France and Italy. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone industrial production data for December; output expected to shrink by 1.9% year-on-year 3pm GMT: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifies to the Senate banking committee",

And: \u201cWe have delivered a $7.1bn surplus for 2019-20 which is what this budget is all about.\u201d</p> <p>But a week ago in another interview with <a href=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/interview-leigh-sales-730-abc-1\">Leigh Sales, Frydenberg was suggesting</a> \u201cdelivering a budget surplus is not our primary focus\u201d.</p> <p>Funny that. It\u2019s amazing how things stop becoming a priority when the likelihood of them occurring diminishes.</p> <p>Of course that \u201c$7.1bn\u201d surplus was revised down in the December midyear economic and fiscal outlook to $5bn, and the projected surplus for 2020-21 of $11bn was slashed to $6.1bn. And both these downgrades occurred before the bushfires really took hold in the south-east of Australia and before anyone had heard of coronavirus.</p> <p>We already know the budget surplus is in danger. The latest <a href=\"https://www.finance.gov.au/publications/commonwealth-monthly-financial-statements/2020/mfs-december\">monthly financial statements</a> released by the finance department show that the deficit for the year to the end of December was $15.2bn, some $1.2bn larger than the $14.05bn estimated in the Myefo.</p> <p>This time a year ago the budget balance was running <a href=\"https://www.finance.gov.au/publications/commonwealth-monthly-financial-statements/2019/mfs-december\">$1.6bn better</a> than expected in the 2018 Myefo; it ended up being $4.5bn better.</p> <p>So for the deficit at this stage to be worse than expected is not good \u2013 especially given the latest figures come from before the impact of the virus.</p> <p>The big reason the surplus is toast is the reliance the budget has on company tax. Already the level of company tax for the first six months of this financial year is $500m down on what was predicted. That is going to go down more, and the budget has less room to adjust than it did in the past.</p> <p>In 2003 when the Sars virus hit, company tax accounted for just on 16% of total revenue. Now it accounts for 19.6%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Company tax revenue\">  <iframe title=\"Company tax revenue \" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/02woB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That difference is the equivalent of about $18bn extra in tax collected in current dollars.</p> <p>And the major reason for that increase is iron ore exports to China.</p> <p>Back in 2003 iron ore and coal accounted for only about 23% of all of Australia\u2019s goods exports. Now it is just under half:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Share of total goods exports \u2013 rural, ores and coal\">  <iframe title=\"Share of total goods exports - rural, ores and coal\" aria-label=\"Interactive area chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xd2CN/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And a massive share of those exports head to China \u2013 38% of our merchandise exports go to China compared with just 8.4% back in 2003:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual merchandise exports to China\">  <iframe title=\"Annual merchandise exports to China \" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/E6nch/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And it is not just exporting goods that has become much more important.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s education and tourism industries have also grown, and again they have grown on the back of China.</p> <p>In 2003 Chinese accounted for only 4% of short-term visitors; now it is the biggest source with 15% of the total. And the total number has risen from about 200,000 a year to 1.46 million now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Short-term arrivals - top 5 countries\">  <iframe title=\"Short-term arrivals - top 5 countries\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Zx0dN/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And of course these are not just tourists. Over the period since 2003, foreign students have surged into our higher education sector, and China has led the way.</p> <p>In 2003, the 60,000 Chinese student enrolments accounted for 20% of all foreign students; last year the 260,500 Chinese students accounted for 27%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chinese enrolments in education\">  <iframe title=\"Chinese enrolments in education \" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mTKYJ/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>All up this adds to our exports being much more important to our economy than they were in 2003.</p> <p>Our exports now make up 23% of our total GDP, and last year essentially accounted for 45% of the growth in our economy. That is good when the domestic economy is struggling as it currently is \u2013 because our economy is largely protected from a recession because China wants our iron ore. But if that comes to a halt \u2026</p> <p>The other concern is that it is not just Australia that relies more on China but the rest of the world as well.</p> <p>In 2003 China\u2019s economy was growing much faster than it is now, but it was much smaller. It accounted for just 4.3% of the world\u2019s economy. Now it makes up 16.3%, and is second only to the US:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"China annual GDP growth\">  <iframe title=\"China annual GDP growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IP8eD/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It means the global economy is in greater danger of slowing due to the virus than happened during the Sars outbreak.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean we are about to have a recession. We don\u2019t need to talk ourselves into one \u2013 and if you hear of friends who are worried about going shopping or eating at restaurants because of the virus you can tell them they don\u2019t need to worry. And that is one problem with economic shocks \u2013 rationale behaviour cannot always be counted on.</p> <p>But one thing we can all count on: as the likelihood of the budget surplus slips away, the government will continue to suggest that a surplus is not as important as it once vehemently believed it was.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul>",

Of course that \u201c$7.1bn\u201d surplus was revised down in the December midyear economic and fiscal outlook to $5bn, and the projected surplus for 2020-21 of $11bn was slashed to $6.1bn. And both these downgrades occurred before the bushfires really took hold in the south-east of Australia and before anyone had heard of coronavirus. We already know the budget surplus is in danger. The latest monthly financial statements released by the finance department show that the deficit for the year to the end of December was $15.2bn, some $1.2bn larger than the $14.05bn estimated in the Myefo. This time a year ago the budget balance was running $1.6bn better than expected in the 2018 Myefo; it ended up being $4.5bn better. So for the deficit at this stage to be worse than expected is not good \u2013 especially given the latest figures come from before the impact of the virus. The big reason the surplus is toast is the reliance the budget has on company tax. Already the level of company tax for the first six months of this financial year is $500m down on what was predicted. That is going to go down more, and the budget has less room to adjust than it did in the past. In 2003 when the Sars virus hit, company tax accounted for just on 16% of total revenue. Now it accounts for 19.6%: That difference is the equivalent of about $18bn extra in tax collected in current dollars. And the major reason for that increase is iron ore exports to China. Back in 2003 iron ore and coal accounted for only about 23% of all of Australia\u2019s goods exports. Now it is just under half: And a massive share of those exports head to China \u2013 38% of our merchandise exports go to China compared with just 8.4% back in 2003: And it is not just exporting goods that has become much more important. Australia\u2019s education and tourism industries have also grown, and again they have grown on the back of China. In 2003 Chinese accounted for only 4% of short-term visitors; now it is the biggest source with 15% of the total. And the total number has risen from about 200,000 a year to 1.46 million now: And of course these are not just tourists. Over the period since 2003, foreign students have surged into our higher education sector, and China has led the way. In 2003, the 60,000 Chinese student enrolments accounted for 20% of all foreign students; last year the 260,500 Chinese students accounted for 27%: All up this adds to our exports being much more important to our economy than they were in 2003. Our exports now make up 23% of our total GDP, and last year essentially accounted for 45% of the growth in our economy. That is good when the domestic economy is struggling as it currently is \u2013 because our economy is largely protected from a recession because China wants our iron ore. But if that comes to a halt \u2026 The other concern is that it is not just Australia that relies more on China but the rest of the world as well. In 2003 China\u2019s economy was growing much faster than it is now, but it was much smaller. It accounted for just 4.3% of the world\u2019s economy. Now it makes up 16.3%, and is second only to the US: It means the global economy is in greater danger of slowing due to the virus than happened during the Sars outbreak. That doesn\u2019t mean we are about to have a recession. We don\u2019t need to talk ourselves into one \u2013 and if you hear of friends who are worried about going shopping or eating at restaurants because of the virus you can tell them they don\u2019t need to worry. And that is one problem with economic shocks \u2013 rationale behaviour cannot always be counted on. But one thing we can all count on: as the likelihood of the budget surplus slips away, the government will continue to suggest that a surplus is not as important as it once vehemently believed it was.

But without a free press, elections or much space for civil society, there are few ways for citizens to hold their rulers accountable. Instead, local officials answer only to a party hierarchy that puts a premium on stability and economic growth.</p> \n<p>Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute, said: \u201cChina is not a poor country; it has in general terms an efficient government in place. But the incentives are not for a health director (for example) to respond to public health crises in Wuhan first and foremost. The incentive is to do what the party wants \u2026 and not embarrass the party.\u201d</p> \n<p>The cost of trying to curb the coronavirus when it first emerged \u2013 high-profile moves to close the market where it originated, cull and destroy livestock, quarantine and compensate victims, cancel mass festivities for the new year \u2013 would have seemed a risky gamble for little reward.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat might have ended it, or not,\u201d Tsang said. \u201c[But] since you stopped the virus from developing, you have nothing to show. You quashed a potential threat that may not have existed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even when the government reversed course and announced a crisis, it appeared to be focused on managing its image as well as the disease, he said. It could have deployed medics and a field hospital to Wuhan almost overnight rather than building new hospitals.</p> \n<p>It is unclear why they chose not to do so. But a country setting up field hospitals looks like one in crisis. A government expanding hospitals looks like one in control. \u201cTen days is a very long time when you are looking at a public health crisis like that,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut a new hospital built from the ground up, that\u2019s a world record.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6029cb6636a17e5385bb2973970563710c43a250\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6029cb6636a17e5385bb2973970563710c43a250/595_457_2405_1443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diggers begin constructing a new 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in record time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diggers begin constructing a new 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in record time.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Questions about China\u2019s transparency still hang over efforts to manage the disease. Some scientists are concerned about its spread in areas that have become new hubs of the disease. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/hundreds-of-miles-from-hubei-another-30-million-chinese-are-in-coronavirus-lockdown/2020/02/07/03a08282-48b9-11ea-8a1f-de1597be6cbc_story.html\">Zhejiang</a> and Guangdong province \u2013 both industrial centres \u2013 have reported more than 1,000 cases, as has inland Henan province.</p> \n<p>That is higher than the number of cases reported in Hubei province when the lockdown of Wuhan was announced in January. But with the economy badly strained by the long shutdown, Chinese authorities are urging people to start heading back to work in \u201corderly\u201d fashion in these areas.</p> \n<p>There have also been doubts about the accuracy of the tally of cases, after many families reported struggling to get testing for sick relatives.</p> \n<p>The test numbers may be accurate, and disease control measures in place elsewhere may be sufficient to control a virus that scientists already understand much better than they did a few weeks ago. But if China cannot address the systemic failings that allowed the outbreak to fester originally, it may struggle to control this epidemic, avert the next one and secure the global trust and cooperation needed to fight disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no one quick fix to the Chinese system to make it respond better next time,\u201d said Hung. \u201cBut if there is one single factor that could increase the government\u2019s responsiveness to this kind of crisis, [it would be] a free press.\u201d</p>",

As the city was locked down, authorities promised that thousands of doctors would be on hand to treat 2,600 patients on the facilities\u2019 wards. Timelapse videos tracked the almost incomprehensibly fast construction of the hospitals, and state media celebrated their opening in early February. The only thing missing a week later? Patients. Four days after its opening, the larger Leishenshan hospital had only 90 patients, on wards designed for 1,600, but was reporting no spare beds, Wuhan city health data, first reported by the Chinese magazine Caixin, showed.

Just over a month later he became one of the youngest victims of the coronavirus. His death made him a household name and triggered a rare discussion in China about freedom of speech. In a biting essay that laid the blame for the crisis with President Xi Jinping, a dissident intellectual claimed China\u2019s centralisation and culture of silence had played a key role in the spread of the disease. \u201cIt began with the imposition of stern bans on the reporting of factual information that served to embolden deception at every level of government,\u201d Xu Zhangrun wrote in his essay Viral Alarm, When Fury Overcomes Fear, according to a translation by Geremie Barm\u00e9 on the website ChinaFile. \u201cIt only struck its true stride when bureaucrats throughout the system shrugged off responsibility for the unfolding situation while continuing to seek the approbation of their superiors,\u201d Xu continued. \u201cThey all blithely stood by as the crucial window of opportunity to deal with the outbreak of the infection snapped shut in their faces.\u201d The problems of officials trying to cover up scandals or mistakes are not unique to China. But without a free press, elections or much space for civil society, there are few ways for citizens to hold their rulers accountable. Instead, local officials answer only to a party hierarchy that puts a premium on stability and economic growth. Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute, said: \u201cChina is not a poor country; it has in general terms an efficient government in place. But the incentives are not for a health director (for example) to respond to public health crises in Wuhan first and foremost. The incentive is to do what the party wants \u2026 and not embarrass the party.\u201d The cost of trying to curb the coronavirus when it first emerged \u2013 high-profile moves to close the market where it originated, cull and destroy livestock, quarantine and compensate victims, cancel mass festivities for the new year \u2013 would have seemed a risky gamble for little reward. \u201cThat might have ended it, or not,\u201d Tsang said. \u201c[But] since you stopped the virus from developing, you have nothing to show. You quashed a potential threat that may not have existed.\u201d Even when the government reversed course and announced a crisis, it appeared to be focused on managing its image as well as the disease, he said. It could have deployed medics and a field hospital to Wuhan almost overnight rather than building new hospitals. It is unclear why they chose not to do so. But a country setting up field hospitals looks like one in crisis. A government expanding hospitals looks like one in control. \u201cTen days is a very long time when you are looking at a public health crisis like that,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut a new hospital built from the ground up, that\u2019s a world record.\u201d Questions about China\u2019s transparency still hang over efforts to manage the disease. Some scientists are concerned about its spread in areas that have become new hubs of the disease. Zhejiang and Guangdong province \u2013 both industrial centres \u2013 have reported more than 1,000 cases, as has inland Henan province. That is higher than the number of cases reported in Hubei province when the lockdown of Wuhan was announced in January. But with the economy badly strained by the long shutdown, Chinese authorities are urging people to start heading back to work in \u201corderly\u201d fashion in these areas. There have also been doubts about the accuracy of the tally of cases, after many families reported struggling to get testing for sick relatives. The test numbers may be accurate, and disease control measures in place elsewhere may be sufficient to control a virus that scientists already understand much better than they did a few weeks ago. But if China cannot address the systemic failings that allowed the outbreak to fester originally, it may struggle to control this epidemic, avert the next one and secure the global trust and cooperation needed to fight disease. \u201cThere is no one quick fix to the Chinese system to make it respond better next time,\u201d said Hung. \u201cBut if there is one single factor that could increase the government\u2019s responsiveness to this kind of crisis, [it would be] a free press.\u201d",

They have also suggested avoiding close contact with people who are unwell.</p> \n<p>However, some readers have gone beyond official recommendations, from wearing masks in public to stockpiling food.</p> \n<p>Ian*, 41, who runs a computer services business in Brighton, was one of several people who said they had purchased goggles: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to panic, but let\u2019s not be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cI even have a half-mask respirator, though I hope I never need to use it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60387d1805c2af7261b94f2e404c205067139364\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60387d1805c2af7261b94f2e404c205067139364/689_165_2723_2723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goggles, face masks, gloves and hand gel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goggles, face masks, gloves and hand gel bought by Ian.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s definitely overkill, I need to make sure people can work from home if necessary, to minimise chances of infection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even among those who are less worried, several people said they had started stockpiling food and other supplies, such as instant noodles. </p> \n<p>Rory, 43, an assistant director in the film and TV industry from Edinburgh, said: \u201cI\u2019ve started a small stockpile of canned and dried food. I\u2019m trying to prepare for a 14-day quarantine or a minor interruption of food supply. My main worry is a food shortage due to panic buying in a few weeks\u2019 time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"029d6e71404368aaae7f8365645ac1d435f209e5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/029d6e71404368aaae7f8365645ac1d435f209e5/0_301_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canned food, face masks, toilet rolls and rice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canned food, face masks, toilet rolls and rice are some of the items Rory has stockpiled.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Elsewhere in the country, people are ramping up precautions. Mark*, 69 and retired from the Isle of Wight, said he was cancelling plans in June. \u201cMy wife and I were going to go to Santander by sea, then travel around Spain by train.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve postponed it now because of the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK climbed to eight on Monday, Guardian readers from across Britain have told of their reactions to the outbreak. The majority of those who got in touch seemed to be under the impression that the risk of becoming infected in Britain had become more concrete, and many reported having stocked up on hand sanitisers, face masks and disposable gloves. Public Health England has recommended that UK citizens focus on good respiratory hygiene, including covering air passages when sneezing, binning used tissues quickly and washing hands with soap often. They have also suggested avoiding close contact with people who are unwell. However, some readers have gone beyond official recommendations, from wearing masks in public to stockpiling food. Ian*, 41, who runs a computer services business in Brighton, was one of several people who said they had purchased goggles: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to panic, but let\u2019s not be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cI even have a half-mask respirator, though I hope I never need to use it. \u201cWhile it\u2019s definitely overkill, I need to make sure people can work from home if necessary, to minimise chances of infection.\u201d Even among those who are less worried, several people said they had started stockpiling food and other supplies, such as instant noodles. Rory, 43, an assistant director in the film and TV industry from Edinburgh, said: \u201cI\u2019ve started a small stockpile of canned and dried food. I\u2019m trying to prepare for a 14-day quarantine or a minor interruption of food supply. My main worry is a food shortage due to panic buying in a few weeks\u2019 time.\u201d Elsewhere in the country, people are ramping up precautions. Mark*, 69 and retired from the Isle of Wight, said he was cancelling plans in June. \u201cMy wife and I were going to go to Santander by sea, then travel around Spain by train. \u201cWe\u2019ve postponed it now because of the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. It makes no sense to travel unnecessarily until the virus is under control,\u201d he said. Various people, from Hampshire to Manchester, expressed their refusal to travel to London, as they suspected the risk of contagion may be higher there. Mary, a 29-year-old accountant from London, appears to agree, and wears an N95 mask wherever she goes. \u201cI have stopped going to the gym, as in my opinion it is one of the more densely crowded areas. I\u2019ve also stopped using public transport and where possible I\u2019m driving. Where I can\u2019t drive, I will either walk or use a bicycle. Social events are pretty much all cancelled,\u201d she said. In other UK cities, people are increasingly concerned about leaving the house. Cathy*, 27, a wealth analyst from Birmingham, is contemplating whether she might need to work from home at some point to avoid the city centre, while James, 41, a stay-at-home dad from Swansea, is trying to limit his children\u2019s exposure to the wider public. \u201cWe have started to row back on social engagements and have stopped taking our children to their regular hobby classes,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>African health authorities are stepping up preparedness for coronavirus after the head of the World Health Organzation described the outbreak as a \u201cvery grave threat for the rest of the world\u201d.</p> \n<p>Although the number of cases in China appeared to have stabilised and started to decline, \u201cthis outbreak could still go in any direction,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Speaking after the WHO\u2019s decision not to describe the status of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a public health emergency of international concern, Tedros emphasised the need to improve health systems against the new coronavirus and other deadly outbreaks.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur greatest fear remains the damage the coronavirus could do in a country like DRC,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Around the world</a>, there are now more than 60,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, as the disease is now being called officially, and almost 1,400 deaths.</p> \n<p>But the numbers outside China are relatively small, with just over 500 cases in 24 countries and one death in the Philippines. Person-to-person transmission outside China was still happening in only about 22% of cases, said Dr Michael Ryan, WHO\u2019s head of emergencies. \u201cWe have a window of opportunity to shut this virus down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ryan also urged caution after one Chinese scientist predicted that the epidemic would be over by April. Huge efforts by China to contain the virus may have had an effect, but while the slowdown \u2013 and the apparently less aggressive behaviour of the virus outside China \u2013 buys time, it does not necessarily mean it will be brought under control.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is no guarantee,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to speak about numbers or dates. We need to focus on the task. I think it\u2019s way too early to try to predict the beginning, middle or the end of this epidemic right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of African countries that can test for the virus tripled to 15 this week, with more expected to have testing labs up and running in the coming days. The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said health centres were on \u201chigh alert\u201d for new cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/interactive-coronavirus-tracker\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in any of Africa\u2019s 54 countries so far, but experts say a case is inevitable, given the large amount of traffic between the continent and China.</p> \n<p>Michel Yao, the WHO\u2019s head of emergency operations in Africa, warned it could happen \u201cat any time\u201d, adding that most hospitals would be unable to cope with large numbers requiring intensive care.</p> \n<p>Roughly 15% of patients infected with the virus require hospital treatment, up to a quarter need intensive care and 5-10% require mechanical ventilation, according to WHO scientists.</p> \n<p>More than 1,000 people have died of the disease in China, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/coronavirus-china-reports-fall-in-infections-but-experts-remain-cautious\">almost </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/coronavirus-china-reports-fall-in-infections-but-experts-remain-cautious\">45,000 cases</a> have been confirmed.

      "bodyText": "African health authorities are stepping up preparedness for coronavirus after the head of the World Health Organzation described the outbreak as a \u201cvery grave threat for the rest of the world\u201d. Although the number of cases in China appeared to have stabilised and started to decline, \u201cthis outbreak could still go in any direction,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday. Speaking after the WHO\u2019s decision not to describe the status of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a public health emergency of international concern, Tedros emphasised the need to improve health systems against the new coronavirus and other deadly outbreaks. \u201cOur greatest fear remains the damage the coronavirus could do in a country like DRC,\u201d he said. Around the world, there are now more than 60,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, as the disease is now being called officially, and almost 1,400 deaths. But the numbers outside China are relatively small, with just over 500 cases in 24 countries and one death in the Philippines. Person-to-person transmission outside China was still happening in only about 22% of cases, said Dr Michael Ryan, WHO\u2019s head of emergencies. \u201cWe have a window of opportunity to shut this virus down.\u201d Ryan also urged caution after one Chinese scientist predicted that the epidemic would be over by April. Huge efforts by China to contain the virus may have had an effect, but while the slowdown \u2013 and the apparently less aggressive behaviour of the virus outside China \u2013 buys time, it does not necessarily mean it will be brought under control. \u201cIt is no guarantee,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to speak about numbers or dates. We need to focus on the task. I think it\u2019s way too early to try to predict the beginning, middle or the end of this epidemic right now.\u201d The number of African countries that can test for the virus tripled to 15 this week, with more expected to have testing labs up and running in the coming days. The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said health centres were on \u201chigh alert\u201d for new cases. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in any of Africa\u2019s 54 countries so far, but experts say a case is inevitable, given the large amount of traffic between the continent and China. Michel Yao, the WHO\u2019s head of emergency operations in Africa, warned it could happen \u201cat any time\u201d, adding that most hospitals would be unable to cope with large numbers requiring intensive care. Roughly 15% of patients infected with the virus require hospital treatment, up to a quarter need intensive care and 5-10% require mechanical ventilation, according to WHO scientists. More than 1,000 people have died of the disease in China, where almost 45,000 cases have been confirmed. Fewer than 500 cases have so far been confirmed in countries and territories outside China. \u201cThe lack of reagents is what delayed the capacity in African countries for confirmation,\u201d said Yao. \u201cWe are working around the clock to ensure they receive reagents (so they can test for the virus).\u201d About 45 suspected cases in Africa have been reported to the WHO so far, with Ethiopia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Botswana among the countries affected. A total of 35 of those cases were found to be negative, while the remaining 10 have been placed in quarantine until tests are carried out. A week ago, only six laboratories in Africa, including the Institut Pasteur in Senegal and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, were able to test for the virus, raising concern that undetected cases might already exist. Last weekend, Africa CDC ran a workshop in Senegal for scientists in 15 countries, sending them home with diagnostic tests including reagents. Seven of the countries now able to run tests are on the WHO\u2019s priority list of countries that are especially vulnerable, mainly because of their contact with China. They include Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. The WHO is also sending kits to 29 laboratories on the continent. Asked about the ability of health systems in African nations to cope with the intensive care needs of a coronavirus outbreak, Yao said it would present \u201cquite a challenge\u201d. \u201cI can tell you straight away the capacity to manage a large number of patients is not there in many African countries. We remain concerned. That\u2019s why we are ensuring heath systems are on high alert,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the exception of large countries like Kenya and South Africa, most African hospitals have very limited intensive care facilities. A hospital may have only 10 beds capable of intensive care. Imagine having a cluster of cases that requires intensive care. That could be quite a challenge.\u201d Yao, who was involved in dealing with the Ebola outbreak in 2014-16, and more recently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said NGOs such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Samaritan\u2019s Purse were providing technical guidance on setting up treatment centres. A teleconference is planned with regional partners this week to discuss treatment capacity, he said. \u201cIf we have a scenario where we have a large number of cases, we want NGO partners to increase the capacity and to provide equipment like oxygen and respiratory machines. They have the ability to deploy treatment centres in a very short time.\u201d Ryan told a press conference on Monday: \u201cWhen you consider that 90% to 100% of patients in hospital require supplemental oxygen, 20% to 25% of those patients require intensive care and 5% to 10% of patients may require some form of mechanical ventilation, that\u2019s a huge demand on a system.\u201d John Nkengasong, the director of Africa CDC, said the increased ability to test for the virus in Africa would encourage those with suspected symptoms to come forward, adding that one theory for not seeing cases in Africa was a shortage of testing facilities. \u201cThe hope is that this new turnaround time, in hours rather than days, [will make] people feel, if they have the symptoms, they will report for testing,\u201d Nkengasong said. \u201cIf you keep someone for days, human behaviour suggests people will stay away.

At this point, they didn\u2019t think Dad needed testing because he wasn\u2019t showing any symptoms.\u201d The family were then told that all three needed testing and that they should drive to the Royal Surrey County hospital in Guildford, where they would be met. \u201cThe level of disorganisation from PHE was terrible,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cWe were told there would be a space for us to park, but there wasn\u2019t. We looped the car park and after 5-10 minutes people in protective gear were walking towards us shouting at people to get out of the way.\u201d Zoe, who works at a school, said the tests were quite straightforward. Their temperatures were taken, as well as nose and throat swabs, urine samples, blood pressure and blood tests. The family were given the all clear. \u201cWe\u2019re so relieved,\u201d said Jemima. \u201cThe most stressful part was thinking we could have been infecting other people during the time when PHE advised us it was fine to go outside.\u201d Another reader, Steve, told the Guardian that he had been given contradictory advice by the NHS 111 helpline, Public Health England and his GP about who could refer him for testing after he developed symptoms following a trip to Singapore. \u201cI believe that the miscommunications and lack of a joined-up approach caused a delay in my testing of 24 hours and that if my wife had not directly contacted our local NHS hospital (against the advice given by NHS 111 and Public Health England), then I could still be waiting to be tested,\u201d he said. He said his GP did not feel that testing was urgent and that the hospital doctor removed his protective equipment when testing him. \u201cI\u2019m now continuing to self-isolate at home while waiting for Public Health England to provide the results of my testing, but with no confidence that this will be done in a reasonable timescale,\u201d he said. One reader said she developed symptoms after returning to the UK from the Philippines. She put herself into quarantine following advice from 111, but has no way of taking herself to get tested at a hospital. \u201cThey are asking me to get a friend to take me to the hospital to get tested,\u201d she said, suggesting this was counterintuitive as the friend could get infected.",

So we don\u2019t have enough evidence at this stage to say that it is spreading in London - we have had an introduction of the virus to London from an individual that has travelled from China but as yet, no reported human-to-human transmission as a result of this new case.</p> \n   <p>There always remains the risk of introduction of cases into the UK from international travellers and it is difficult to predict where future introductions may occur. So it\u2019s not surprising that there is a case in London since it is the main UK hub for international travellers.</p> \n   <p>What needs to be done at this stage is to carry out contact tracing, in a similar way that has been done for other cases, in order to detect any contacts as rapidly as possible and if they show symptoms of the disease, follow the necessary protocols to minimise the risk of them causing further infections.</p> \n   <p>It is important of course that people remain vigilant and minimise their own risk of being infected but at this stage it is too early to say the extent of the risk of onward transmission as a result of this new case.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Dr Michael Head</strong>, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said<strong>:</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If confirmed, it is not surprising that London has seen its first case of the coronavirus. It\u2019s a city of over 10 million people with several major international airports. Both London and the rest of the UK can expect to see more cases, though hopefully these will continue to be isolated cases and seen in small numbers.</p> \n   <p>It should also be noted that, of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% of those tested have been negative for the coronavirus. Thus, risks to Londoners and UK residents remain low though people should continue to keep an eye on guidance for the general public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e44515a8f0811db2faf6890\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/samuel-gibbs\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T19:27:23.262Z\">7.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Today marked the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/12/mobile-world-congress-axed-coronavirus-fears\">cancellation of MWC</a> in its 33-year history.

      "bodyText": "Senior scientific figures have played down the significance of the confirmation that a case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the UK\u2019s largest population centre. Dr Michael Tildesley, associate professor in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Warwick, has said: It has been confirmed this is a case where an individual has travelled from China and has been detected whilst in London. So we don\u2019t have enough evidence at this stage to say that it is spreading in London - we have had an introduction of the virus to London from an individual that has travelled from China but as yet, no reported human-to-human transmission as a result of this new case. There always remains the risk of introduction of cases into the UK from international travellers and it is difficult to predict where future introductions may occur. So it\u2019s not surprising that there is a case in London since it is the main UK hub for international travellers. What needs to be done at this stage is to carry out contact tracing, in a similar way that has been done for other cases, in order to detect any contacts as rapidly as possible and if they show symptoms of the disease, follow the necessary protocols to minimise the risk of them causing further infections. It is important of course that people remain vigilant and minimise their own risk of being infected but at this stage it is too early to say the extent of the risk of onward transmission as a result of this new case.\u201d Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said: If confirmed, it is not surprising that London has seen its first case of the coronavirus. It\u2019s a city of over 10 million people with several major international airports. Both London and the rest of the UK can expect to see more cases, though hopefully these will continue to be isolated cases and seen in small numbers. It should also be noted that, of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% of those tested have been negative for the coronavirus. Thus, risks to Londoners and UK residents remain low though people should continue to keep an eye on guidance for the general public. Today marked the first cancellation of MWC in its 33-year history. Due to take place on the week of 24 February in Barcelona, the gathering of 100,000 of the world\u2019s mobile industry is the largest and most important of its kind, where deals are hammered out and new products from smartphones to telecommunications equipment are shown off. A mental health centre in Hove is going through a deep clean after a patient with flu-like symptoms had to be treated. It\u2019s understood the female patient had recently returned from Hong Kong, which Public Health England say is on the coronavirus warning list. The woman was treated at the unit, the Haven Annexe at Mill View hospital, and is believed to have since left the centre. Mobile World Congress, one of the most important events in the tech industry calendar, has been cancelled due to concerns over the global spread of the coronavirus, organisers have said. The news comes after a series of big names \u2013 among them Facebook, Cisco Systems, and Intel \u2013 pulled out of the conference citing similar concerns. Spanish and Catalan authorities had insisted it would go ahead. John Hoffman, the chief executive of the event\u2019s organiser \u2013 the GSMA \u2013 has said: With due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country today, the GSMA has cancelled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event. He added that his \u201csympathies at this time are with those affected in China, and all around the world\u201d. Referring to the diagnosis in London that emerged less than an hour ago, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said: One further patient in England has tested positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), bringing the total number of cases in the UK to nine. This virus was passed on in China and the patient has now been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 in London. Dr Tedros has defended the reaction of the Chinese authorities to the outbreak. We were in this board room for a board meeting and almost all members states were praising China for what it did. And they had a reason ... China took action massively at the epicentre, at the source of the outbreak, in shutting down Wuhan city. And that helped prevent cases from being exported to other provinces in China and the rest of the world. And I remember a board member from the UK saying, verbatim, \u2018this is heroic\u2019. Because when you shut down a city like that it has consequences \u2013 economic and so on \u2013 serious consequences. The WHO officials are asked why the numbers of diagnoses is stabilising but the death rate is going up. Dr Ryan says that this is because the length of the illness is comparatively long, so we are now seeing the \u201cend of life moments\u201d of those who were diagnosed weeks ago. Ryan says that fewer than a quarter of the cases outside China were transmitted outside China. In only eight cases globally have they failed to find a plausible explanation for the transmission. Asked about reports that the Chinese authorities silenced those warning of the virus at the end of last year, Dr Michael Ryan says that the country\u2019s government notified WHO as soon as there was evidence of the outbreak. He said that given the country\u2019s huge population and the fact that the symptoms are so similar to influenza, the speed of the identification of the outbreak was impressive. \u201cNow is not the time for recrimination, now is not the time for forensics, now is the time to fight this virus,\u201d he said. Asked about reports that the coronavirus epidemic could be over by April, Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, says he would love to be able to predict the future, \u201cbut we need to be cautious\u201d. He says that evidence of the stabilisation of cases is very reassuring. \u201cWe expect to see the virus come under control but we\u2019re not going to talk about numbers or dates ... It\u2019s way too early to predict the beginning, the middle or the end of this epidemic.\u201d Prof Robert Steffen from the Ebola emergency committee says there is no room for complacency when it comes to tackling the Ebola outbreak. He says the \u201cglobal solidarity\u201d mentioned by Dr Tedros is lacking in the case of Ebola and that more international help is needed. The WHO is doing further investigations about the origins of the new coronavirus and how the transmission of conditions from animals to humans can be prevented, says Dr Tedros. Dr Tedros says that Cambodia has agreed to accept the Westerdam cruise ship that has been stranded at sea for several days. He said that outbreaks can bring out the \u201cbest and the worst in people\u201d. Stigmatising people and nations does nothing but harm the response, he said. The Guardian has confirmed that a coronavirus case has been diagnosed in London. The victim is understood to be a woman and is on her way to hospital, a source said. The World Health Organization is holding a press conference about the outbreak of Ebola in the DRC and the coronavirus outbreak. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says that just as the Ebola outbreak appears to die down, we are having to fight another fire on a different front. The Sun is reporting that the first coronavirus case has been confirmed in London. The paper cites a source at City Hall saying the victim is a Chinese national and was diagnosed this afternoon. All 83 people who were being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital, in the Wirral, have been told their test results for coronavirus came back negative. The BBC reported that they all expect be free to leave the accommodation \u2013 which they had been staying in for the past fortnight \u2013 tomorrow morning. Coronavirus tests for two prisoners in Oxfordshire have come back negative. The men, who are inmates at HMP Bullingdon, near Bicester, had been kept in isolation. Access had been restricted to the wing where the affected prisoners were. One of the prisoners has been named as Mark Rumble, who had recently been transferred from a jail in Thailand. Patcham care home on the outskirts of Brighton has confirmed it has reopened after it was closed following the discovery that a care worker diagnosed with the virus had visited it. A spokesman said: \u201cWe are pleased that the home is now reopened to visitors. Thanks must go to Public Health England for its support and advice over the last few days, to all the families and visitors who have been patient and understanding, to our staff who have been superb, and last, but not least, to our residents who have been good-natured and uncomplaining throughout.\u201d Pupils and staff at at least nine schools in Brighton, Hove and Eastbourne are self-isolating as a precaution after recent cases of coronavirus were diagnosed in the area. Parents in Sussex have been told by Public Health England (PHE) that either a staff member or student has been advised to stay home from the schools for 14 days, PA Media has reported. In a letter sent to parents on Tuesday evening, Varndean School in Brighton said a \u201cperson from our school community\u201d had been advised to self-quarantine after coming into contact with a potential case of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Headteacher William Deighan said the school remained open, adding: \u201cHowever, I realise that during this worrying time that you may want to make your own decisions about school attendance. \u201cI can confirm that absences you inform us of will be authorised at this time. \u201cThe local authority has confirmed to us that Public Health England and the office of the Chief Medical Officer are clear in their advice that schools do not need to close.\u201d Nearly 200 people in the US state of Georgia have been placed in isolation amid fears about the spread of coronavirus. The residents, who have recently travelled to China, have been told to self-monitor for symptoms while staying at home for two weeks. So far, no one in the state has tested positive for the virus. The Atlanta-based airline Delta Air Lines has suspended all flights between the US and China until 30 April due to concerns about coronavirus. A paper in the Lancet medical journal, published online, should dispel some of the worries around reports of some babies born to women who have fallen ill with what is now being called COVID-19 also being diagnosed with the infection. The authors say preliminary evidence suggests the new coronavirus cannot be passed to the baby in the womb. It\u2019s a small study of just nine pregnant women who fell sick in the third trimester of pregnancy in Wuhan and gave birth by caesarean section, but reassuring all the same. None of the women or their babies died. Samples of amniotic fluid from mothers, plus cord blood and throat swabs from six of the newborns, showed no trace of the virus. The study follows news that a newborn tested positive for the coronavirus within 36 hours of birth to a mother who was sick. The authors say they cannot be sure on the basis of nine cases that transmission in the womb is never possible \u2013 and they also cannot rule out transmission of the virus during birth. \u201cThere is limited information about the virus in pregnant women. This is important to study because pregnant women can be particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, because they are immunocompromised and because of pregnancy-related physiological changes which could leave them at higher risk of poor outcomes,\u201d said Prof Huixia Yang from the Peking University First Hospital in China, a co-author of the paper with Wuhan-based doctors. \u201cAlthough in our study no patients developed severe pneumonia or died of their infection, we need to continue to study the virus to understand the effects in a larger group of pregnant women.\u201d The women were treated with oxygen support and antibiotics and six were given an antiviral treatment, the paper says. Dr Jie Qiao, from the Peking University Third Hospital, who was not involved in the study, writes in a comment in the journal that the effect of the new coronavirus on pregnant women appears to be less damaging than Sars, which caused numerous miscarriages and complications for the babies after birth. Hi, Amy Walker here taking over the blog from my colleague Simon Murphy. Patients who were treated by the two Brighton GPs who have been diagnosed with coronavirus have been traced by health officials, the BBC has reported. The 12 individuals were seen across four different buildings in East and West Sussex \u2013 at a nursing home, an A&amp;E department and two medical practices. Both doctors had stayed in the same French ski chalet as Steve Walsh, the British man who has been linked to 11 cases of the virus. They are now in isolation, while the GP practices where they worked have reopened following a deep clean. Their recent patients have been traced and advised by Public Health England, and Patcham nursing home in Brighton has closed to visitors as a precaution. The cruise operator Carnival has warned its shareholders that the coronavirus outbreak will have a \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on its financial results this year. The firm owns MS Westerdam luxury cruise ship which is finally being allowed to dock in Cambodia after being turned away by five countries despite having no sick passengers. In a statement to the City, Carnival explained that it has already scrapped sailings from China. This is now having a knock-on impact, forcing voyages in other parts of Asia to be cancelled, hitting revenues and profits. Understandably, Carnival still doesn\u2019t know the full impact of the crisis. But IF it were forced to cancel all operations in Asia until the end of April (which isn\u2019t currently planned), it would lose up to $0.65 per share in profits. Carnival had been expecting to make $4.30 to $4.60 per share this year, so this would be quite a dent to earnings. Such wide-ranging cancellations are still hypothetical at this stage, but it\u2019s a sign of the financial damage which coronavirus could cause. More than 100 people have been tested for coronavirus so far in Scotland \u2013 but no one has yet been diagnosed with the disease. There have been 106 negative tests north of the border, according to figures released by the Scottish government. It represents an increase of 24 from yesterday and 49 more than Monday. By last night, a total of 1,358 people had been tested for coronavirus in the UK, eight of whom had so far tested positive, the UK Department of Health said. Steve Walsh, the British businessman linked to several cases of coronavirus, has spoken of his happiness at returning home after recovering from the disease. In a statement, Walsh said: \u201cI\u2019m happy to be home and feeling well. I want to give a big thank you to the NHS who have been great throughout and my thoughts are with everyone around the world who continues to be affected by the virus. It\u2019s good to be back with my family \u2026\u201d BT has joined Nokia on a growing list of tech firms that have pulled out of a major mobile phone conference in Spain over coronavirus fears. The Mobile World Congress, which normally attracts more than 100,000 visitors, is due to take place at the end of the month in Barcelona. BT said today that withdrawing from the event was the \u201cmost responsible decision\u201d it could make. Earlier, Nokia said it would be \u201cprudent\u201d for the company to withdraw from the trade show to ensure the safety of its staff. Amazon, LG, Sony, Intel and Facebook have already withdrawn from the event. More news from Russia, where it has emerged that one patient jumped out of a hospital window in a bid to escape quarantine and another broke out by disabling an electronic lock. Two Russian women kept in isolation over fears they had coronavirus say they fled claiming that doctors were uncooperative and poor conditions, AP reports. The two women had both recently returned from Hainan, a tropical region of China popular with Russian tourists. The county, which has only had two confirmed reported cases of the disease to date, has hospitalised hundreds of people who have returned from China as a precaution to stop the disease spreading. But many of those quarantined have complained of dire conditions in hospital isolation rooms and lack of cooperation from doctors, who they say are uncertain about quarantine protocols. A coronavirus victim who unwittingly spread the disease overseas has made a full recovery, it has been announced. Steve Walsh, 53, who is thought to have caught the virus in Singapore before spreading it to others during a ski trip to the Alps, was being treated at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. But, following two negative tests for the virus 24 hours apart, it has been confirmed the father-of-two, a scout leader from Hove, has been discharged. He is linked to five other people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. Prof Keith Willett, an NHS strategic incident director, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say that \u2013 following two negative tests for coronavirus, 24 hours apart \u2013 Mr Walsh has been discharged from Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, having made a full recovery following his treatment. \u201cMr Walsh\u2019s symptoms were mild and he is no longer contagious, and poses no risk to the public. He is keen to return to his normal life and spend time with his family out of the media spotlight. \u201cI would like to thank the clinical team who treated Mr Walsh in hospital, as well as all the NHS staff who are working hard with other health organisations to limit the spread of coronavirus and treat the small numbers who have contracted the illness.\u201d Chinese academics have launched an online petition challenging Beijing on freedom of speech in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the South China Morning Post reports. They are calling for the day whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang died to become a national day for freedom of speech, and want the government to protect freedom of speech. The death of Li, who was threatened by security forces after he tried to warn other doctors about the virus that killed him, prompted an outpouring of grief and anger, and a rare debate about censorship. Controls on the press and social media are a highly sensitive topic in China, where a vast official censorship system closely controls the online conversation, and the ruling Communist party has been tightening its grip on all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. The petition is addressed to the National People\u2019s Congress, a largely rubber-stamp legislature that normally meets in March although the gathering this year may be delayed by the coronavirus crisis. Among the high-profile signatories are the dissident academic Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, who has published a rare public essay attacking President Xi Jinping over China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis. His colleague, the sociologist Guo Yuhua, told the SCMP the petition might be \u201canother gesture that might not go very far before it\u2019s stifled, but it\u2019s important to take a stand \u2026 These days, one must speak up regardless of practicality.\u201d The veteran journalist Chen Min said he felt morally bound to add his name to the petition, even though it could trigger a crackdown from authorities. Two citizen journalists who were reporting on the ground in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, have gone missing and are feared to have been detained by authorities. \u201cIt is inexcusable for an intellectual not to step up in the face of a national crisis like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone has to pay a price for [signing this petition] on such a rational set of demands, then it really shows all sanity has been lost.\u201d News that the MS Westerdam, which has been turned away from five countries over coronavirus fears despite having no sick passengers, will finally be allowed to dock in Cambodia will come as a relief to those onboard. Here\u2019s a video diary made by one passenger, Angela Smith, before it emerged that the ship would be able to dock in Sihanoukville, on the country\u2019s south-west coast, on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Smith, a business consultant from Georgia in the US. \u201cWe\u2019ve been floating around for about two weeks now\u2026\u201d Confirmation is in: the Chinese Grand Prix has been postponed due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The sport\u2019s governing body, FIA and F1, issued a statement this morning over the event, which was due to take place on 19 April, saying: As a result of continued health concerns and with the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus as a global health emergency, the FIA and Formula One have taken these measures in order to ensure the health and safety of the travelling staff, championship participants and fans, which remains of primary concern.\u201d Outside Worthing hospital on Wednesday morning, patient Charlotte Hewitt said \u201cnobody\u2019s panicking\u201d over the confirmation that a healthcare worker there has tested positive for coronavirus. The 18 year-old was originally admitted as a day patient but kept in with an unrelated illness, told the Guardian: \u201cThere is one room inside boxed off but aside from that everyone is calm inside. I don\u2019t even see anyone visiting or any of the patients wearing masks. All you are being asked to do is constantly wipe your hands with gel if you out and when you come back in again. I am not worried about being treated inside the hospital because everything seems to be under control.\u201d Nearly seven in 10 people in the UK support travel bans to coronavirus-infected countries and stopping flights to and from China, according to a poll that demonstrates the country is in favour of strong containment measures. Eighty-seven per cent of people in the UK back mandatory screening for those travelling from infected countries and 84% support quarantine for those infected. Meanwhile, 68% of approximately 1,000 people surveyed by Ipsos Mori last week are in favour of stopping flights to and from China and imposing travel bans to countries where people have been infected. The poll, which also surveyed the views of people across seven other major economies, found that more than one in two people in Japan (66%) and more than half of those in Australia (61%) and the US (55%) are concerned about the threat of the outbreak. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are among a slew of airliners to suspend flights to China. Concern is lower in Germany (47%), the UK (43%) and Canada and Russia (both 42%). The CEO of Ipsos Mori, Ben Page, said: This new survey shows there is significant concern about Coronavirus across the world and most people in the eight countries we surveyed do not feel that the virus has been contained. The majority of Britons support strong measures like banning flights, imposing quarantine for those infected and locking down transport systems to prevent the spread. This virus is likely to have a widespread impact upon the globe \u2013 on people\u2019s health, but also, potentially, on the global economy, as supply chains are so much more interlinked than they were at the time of the Sars outbreak.\u201d The Ipsos survey was conducted online from 7-9 February among 8,001 adults aged 16-74 in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the UK and the US. A cruise ship that has been turned away from five countries over coronavirus fears despite having no sick passengers will finally be allowed to dock in Cambodia. The MS Westerdam, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, will dock at Sihanoukville on Thursday, where those onboard will be allowed off, the Holland America Line has confirmed. The ship has already been turned away from Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines. A British honeymooner who caught coronavirus on a cruise ship says he has since tested negative for the disease. Alan Steele was moved to a hospital last Friday from the Diamond Princess cruise ship stationed off the coast of Japan after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. But on Wednesday he announced he has since tested negative for the disease and hopes to be released from quarantine pending a second test. \u201cJust received great news \u2026 my test showed negative to virus and have now been swabbed for 2nd test if that comes back negative I get released,\u201d Steele posted on Facebook. His wife, Wendy, is still onboard the ship. An A&amp;E worker who tested positive for coronavirus treated patients for two days before being diagnosed, according to a memo sent to hospital staff. The staffer at Worthing hospital, who was confirmed to have the virus yesterday, is one of eight people in the UK with the disease. The healthcare worker treated \u201ca small number of patients\u201d on 4-5 February, according to the Argus. The memo says: It has been confirmed that a healthcare professional who works regularly in the Accident and Emergency Unit (A&amp;E) at Worthing hospital has tested positive for coronavirus (2019-nCov). They treated a small number of patients on 4th and 5th February before they became unwell, followed advice and self isolated. Public Health England is contacting all patients seen by this healthcare worker, and all colleagues who came into contact with them, to advise on the precautions they need to take. The risk to other staff is extremely low. The hospital is also following PHE guidance and all services are operating normally.\u201d In a separate case, a locum doctor working in Brighton and Hove is also understood to have tested positive for coronavirus. All NHS services in the city are running, it has been confirmed. Two GP practices had closed yesterday for cleaning over coronavirus fears but are now open with some appointment disruption. A spokesman for NHS Brighton and Hove CCG added: \u201cAll other NHS services in Brighton and Hove are open as usual and measures are in place to ensure the safety of all patients and NHS staff while also ensuring services are available to the public as normal. \u201cFollowing the announcement last week that one of the confirmed 2019 novel Coronavirus cases in the UK is from the Brighton and Hove area, Public Health England is carrying out a thorough risk assessment to trace this individual\u2019s movements in the last fortnight.\u201d Bad news for F1 fans as the Chinese Grand Prix, which was due to be held in Shanghai on 19 April, is expected to be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. The spreading virus also threatens the feasibility of the inaugural Vietnam Grand Prix set to take place on 5 April, my colleague Giles Richards reports. Shanghai is 500 miles from Wuhan, where the outbreak started. F1 management insisted last night that no decision on the race had been taken, and there has been no statement from the sport\u2019s governing body, FIA, but an announcement is expected this week. Worthing hospital, where an A&amp;E worker is among eight confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK, is warning patients displaying flu-like symptoms who have returned from China in the past two weeks to \u201clet the receptionist know immediately\u201d. A sign on the hospital\u2019s A&amp;E door reads: \u201cIf you have travelled to China in the last 2 weeks or have been in contact with anyone from the Wuhan Hubei Province in China and have any of the following symptoms please let the receptionist know immediately. Shortness of breath. Cough. Sore throat.\u201d Many people exiting the building are, not unusually, rubbing their hands with disinfectant gel but there are no masks and no sign of panic. It just looks like just an ordinary day at a small regional hospital. More on the challenging conditions onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is in quarantine in the port of Yokohama, Japan. A British couple celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary on the vessel disclosed passengers were kept awake one night due to a woman crying in her cabin. David and Sally Abel have been kept onboard the ship, which has 169 confirmed cases of coronavirus, since last Wednesday and say conditions are getting tougher. \u201cThey are looking after us very well but obviously we are confined to our cabin and it\u2019s getting harder,\u201d Sally told Sky News. \u201cWe are now into the second week, it seems an eternity to go.\u201d David added: It is more challenging, as each day progresses we are having additional people testing positive. Passengers are now getting tested, that\u2019s why we are seeing the results now on a daily basis, so it is getting people\u2019s moods down. One of the passengers in the night was keeping other passengers awake, an old lady who was crying for a couple of hours in her cabin. Life isn\u2019t as easy as it was last week \u2013 it\u2019s a bit more challenging.\u201d If they test negative for the disease, the couple say they could be off the ship within days. David explained: \u201cWe still have not been updated on 19 February \u2013 that\u2019s the disembarkation date. But it\u2019s being brought forward, we understand, for people who have not got the symptoms, who have gone through the testing with all the doctors who are onboard, and we are seeing people leave the ship \u2013 it has been happening all day long. I think we will have a quicker disembarkation, if we are cleared the correct medical way it could be brought forward as soon as another couple of days.\u201d A British prisoner suspected to have contracted coronavirus after being extradited from a Thai jail is an alleged drug dealer, it has emerged. Mark Rumble, 31, reportedly flew back to the UK on 27 January to face charges of conspiracy to supply class A drugs after his arrest by Thai police last year. The prisoner is understood to have collapsed in his cell at HMP Bullingdon, a category B prison in Oxfordshire, and rushed to hospital. At least two prisoners at the jail, which is on lockdown, have been tested for the disease. The Sun reports that Rumble, of Wallingford, Oxfordshire, was arrested in Pattaya, Thailand, last November on suspicion of drugs offences. On 20 February, he is due to enter a plea at Oxford crown court. The paper reports he is thought to deny the offences. A sliver of good news on the coronavirus outbreak, as two Chinese nationals hospitalised in Russia last month with the disease have recovered. A tourist taken to hospital in eastern Siberia has been discharged with tests showing he is no longer infected and poses no danger, local health officials told AP. A female student in western Siberia was released from hospital on Tuesday. Both patients had a mild form of the disease, according to officials. Russia, which reported two confirmed cases on 31 January, has halted most of its air traffic to China since the start of the outbreak. Trains connecting the country to China and North Korea have also been suspended. Meanwhile, Moscow has temporarily halted issuing work visas to Chinese citizens. Students who returned to their homes on holiday for lunar new year have been asked not to return to Russian universities until the end of March. A seventh Brighton and Hove school has issued a warning to parents about the coronavirus outbreak on the south coast. Two families with children at Carden Primary school have been told to self-isolate in an email sent by the school on Wednesday morning. The school is opposite to the County Oak Medical Centre, which was closed at the start of this week after a GP working there came into a contact with a Hove man who contracted but recovered from coronavirus. Today\u2019s email from the school stressed that they had been in contact with a \u201cpotential\u201d case of the virus although not a diagnosed one. \u201cWe have been advised that two families have been told by Public Health England to self-isolate for 14 days as a a precautionary measure after coming into contact with a potential coronavirus case,\u201d staff and parents were told in the email. The email continued:\u201cIf you wish to keep your child off school, this will be an authorised absence.\u201d The six other schools in Brighton and Hove with pupils or staff in self-isolation include: Balfour Primary school, Hangleton Primary school, Varndean school, Cottesmore St Mary Catholic primary school, Portslade Academy and Bevendean primary school. In addition, two other schools in Sussex in Eastbourne have released similar warnings. Passengers held in quarantine on a cruise ship in Japan are taking it in turns to spend an hour on deck at a time to get fresh air, a traveller onboard has revealed. It is a sign of the increasingly desperate measures being imposed on the Diamond Princess, which has been quarantined in Yokohama since last Wednesday. One hundred and 75 people onboard the vessel \u2013 which has more than 3,000 passengers and crew \u2013 have so far tested positive for coronavirus. The ship was put on lockdown after a man was diagnosed with the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong. Matthew Smith, a lawyer from Sacramento, California, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he and his wife had been confined to their cabin as they have a balcony and can make use of the fresh air. However, other passengers are not as fortunate. He said: We have one of the larger cabins and we have a large balcony and they are allowing some passengers out but they\u2019ve focused on the passengers that have interior cabin or \u2026 [cabins] that do not have access to fresh air. They\u2019re rotating groups to get them on the decks as frequently as possible for an hour at a time. Since we have access to fresh air all the time we\u2019re not included in that which leaves us isolated in the cabin 24 hours.\u201d However, Smith insisted the experience has not put him off cruises \u2013 this is his ninth voyage. Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog this morning to keep you up-to-date with the latest on the coronavirus outbreak. In Brighton and Hove, nearly half a dozen schools have warned parents that some pupils or staff have entered isolation after a so-called \u2018super-spreader\u2019 scout leader tested positive for coronavirus in the city. Father-of-two Stephen Walsh, who unknowingly contracted the disease on a business trip in Singapore before going on a ski trip where he is thought to have infected others, is now being held in an isolation unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. Walsh was reportedly in the Alps with two doctors who have also since tested positive for coronavirus in Brighton. Now five schools in the city have issued warnings to parents, including one of the area\u2019s biggest secondaries. Varndean School\u2019s head wrote to the parents of its 1,300 pupils, the Argus reported. \u201cWe have been informed that a person from our school community has been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate for 14 days after coming into contact with a potential coronavirus case,\u201d he wrote. I appreciate it may be concerning that someone has been told to \u2018self-isolate\u2019, however, this is a purely precautionary measure to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading. As part of self-isolation the person is not in school. Those who have been told to \u201cself-isolate\u201d are being asked to avoid other people and stay at home and not go to work or school.\u201d Meanwhile, the head of Cottesmore St Mary Catholic Primary School \u2013 which has more than 400 pupils \u2013 said yesterday that two people from the school are in self-isolation after coming into contact with a person who has coronavirus. Head teacher Rachel Breen told parents: I appreciate it may be concerning that people have been told to \u2018self-isolate\u2019, however, this is a purely precautionary measure to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading. As part of self-isolation neither person is in school. Those who have been told to \u2018self-isolate\u2019 are being asked to avoid other people and stay at home and not go to work or school.\u201d I will be handing over the blogging reins very soon so here are the main developments of the last eight hours or so. Thanks for reading: The death toll from the coronavirus is now 1,113 in mainland China after 97 victims were added today, compared with 108 the previous day. The number of new cases in China was 2,015, the lowest daily rise since 30 January, giving a national total of 44,670. Cases also fell to their lowest in weeks in Hubei province. But despite the apparent fall, experts are urging caution that the fight against the virus is being won. An additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive, plus one local official who contracted the virus while on board. Another liner, MV Westerdam, is moored off Thailand after being refused port by four countries. Passengers fear it could run out of food and fuel. A disturbing report from AFP says doctors in Wuhan are exhausted and shortages mean they don\u2019t have proper protective clothing. In Britain, a hospital worker in Worthing has tested positive Analysts say loss of Chinese tourists will see Australian economy shrink in Q1 But stock markets in Asia rose again despite fears about the impact of coronavirus on economies. The Singapore bank DBS has evacuated 300 staff from its head office over concerns about a coronavirus infection. People have been told to work from home, the South China Morning Post reports. Indonesia has rejected claims that it is allowing Covid-19 to go undetected. Scientists have expressed widespread disbelief at how the country has managed to go without not recording a single case despite its huge 260 million population and close ties to China. A study by Harvard University public health researchers this week said Indonesia should have reported a coronavirus outbreak. But the Indonesian health minister, Terawan Agus Putranto, called the report \u201cinsulting\u201d and said the country had proper testing equipment. \u201cHopefully there won\u2019t be any cases and we will keep praying, but we\u2019re being vigilant at the highest level,\u201d he said. Doctors and other medical staff are reaching exhaustion point as they work to treat huge numbers of infected people in difficult conditions without proper protection, according to a shocking story filed by the Agence France-Presse news agency. Citing anonymous staff in the stricken city, it says many doctors have had to see patients without proper masks or protective body suits, resorting to reusing the same equipment when they should be changed regularly. Some have even worn diapers to avoid having to take off the equipment and make it last longer, AFP says. One doctor at a community clinic in Wuhan said he and at least 16 other colleagues were showing symptoms of Covid-19, including lung infections and coughing. \u201cAs doctors, we do not want to work while being a source of infection,\u201d he told AFP, before adding that they had to carry on because \u201cthere is no one to replace you\u201d. The story contrasts sharply with state-backed media reports out of China, such as this from the China News Service purporting to show patients and medical staff dancing \u201cto a lively Chinese song about red flowers\u201d at a makeshift hospital in Wuhan. Justin McCurry, our Tokyo correspondent, has news of another stricken cruise ship. The MS Westerdam, carrying 2,257 passengers and crew, was turned away by Thailand yesterday because of concerns that some passengers may have coronavirus even though none have tested positive. It has already been refused port by Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines. It is moored in the Gulf of Thailand where passengers fear it may run out food and fuel. Stephen Hansen, a Canadian who is onboard the Westerdam with his wife, said: \u201cPassengers are OK but anxious for a resolution. If it goes on much longer the ship will run low on food, fuel and medications.\u201d The Australian stock market has closed within a whisker of an all-time high, the ASX200 climbing 0.47% to 7,088.2 points, just shy of the record close of 7,090.5 set last month. This is all despite predictions of a recession in Australia in the first quarter thanks to Covid-19. UBS reckons GDP will slump 0.1% as Chinese tourists are unable to visit Australia. And they say it could be even worse, possibly as low as -0.5%. See the post below. In Tokyo, the Nikkei has gained 0.57%, Seoul is up 0.54% and in China the Shanghai Composite has lifted 0.59% and the Hang Seng is 0.99% to the good. Elsewhere, the US dollar slipped, reflecting more confidence around the markets, and Brent crude rose 1.74% to $54.95 per barrel. General Motors will suspend production at its factory in South Korea because of supply problems due to the coronavirus outbreak in China. The company told Agence France-Presse that one of the two assembly lines at GM Korea\u2019s Bupyeong complex, west of Seoul, which can make over 400,000 vehicles annually, will be closed next Monday and Tuesday due to shortages of parts. GM Korea heavily relies on China for the wiring harnesses that connect vehicles\u2019 complex electronics. Hyundai said last week that it had suspended operations at its huge manufacturing complex in the coastal city of Ulsan while in Japan Nissan said it was suspending operations at its Kyushu plant from 14-17 February because of supply shortages from China. A Brazilian model has been talking about how she had to abandon a budding modelling career in Wuhan when the virus struck. Adrielly Eger, 18, is in quarantine at the Anapolis airbase in the Brazilian state of Goias along with 33 other people repatriated from China on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re all relaxed now,\u201d she told Associated Press. \u201cFor many, the repatriation came as a major relief. It was a risky situation there and we were very exposed. We didn\u2019t know if it was safe to go out in the streets,\u201d she recalls. Eger was in Wuhan for a three-month contract that ended when the city went into lockdown last month. A Chinese marathon runner has completed a 50km run around his living room in order to relieve the boredom of coronavirus lockdown, writes Naaman Zhou. Pan Shancu, from the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, completed 6,250 laps of track consisting of two large tables set up inside his apartment. \u201cI have not been outside for many days, today I cannot bear sitting down any more!\u201d he posted last week. \u201cOne lap is about 8m \u2013 I ran 50km, did it in 4:48:44, sweated all over, feels great!\u201d Check out the full story here: China Daily is reporting that officials from Wuhan have been reprimanded for failing to ensure people with Covid-19 received proper hospital treatment. In an interesting snapshot of what is happening on the ground in Wuhan, it says that Gao Yu, a Beijing official who has been parachuted into Wuhan to supervise the fight against the virus, delivered the dressing down on Monday to Chen Xiexin, vice-mayor of Wuhan, and Lin Wenshu, head of the city\u2019s Hongshan district. It follows an incident \u201cin which some severely ill patients in Wuchang were scheduled to be transferred to a hospital on Sunday night to receive better medical treatment, but the district authorities failed to organize the transfer properly and provided insufficient transport. That resulted in the patients waiting for a very long time and some of them finally lost their temper\u201d, China Daily says. \u201cOn this matter, the central government work group believes that the district government and the community should apologize to every single patient. Those who bear responsibility should be held accountable according to party discipline,\u201d Gao said. A popular posting on Twitter is these pics of health workers bearing the imprint of face masks after a day\u2019s work. Economists at UBS say Australia\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.1% this quarter thanks to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and warn that it could be even worse. They downgrade their Q1 GDP forecast to -0.1% quarter on quarter (1.5% on an annual basis) from 0.2% and 1.8% respectively. This is their weakest reading since the global financial crisis and warn that the recessionary impact could even be as great as a 0.5% contraction. Given the impact of coronavirus is worse than Sars, we still have downside risk &amp; Q1 could be 0.5% q/q. We also cut 2020 to 1.7% y/y (was 1.9%), probably below consensus; with 2021 unrevised at 2.5%. Our Q4-20 forecast of 1.9% is far below the RBA\u2019s rebound to 2.7% (&amp; 3% in 2021). The calculations are based on an expectation of a 30% slump in China\u2019s total outbound travel in 2020, with the Q1 contraction more severe. Millions of Chinese tourists visit Australia every year and are the biggest spenders when they get there. This wipes A$6bn from GDP, or 0.9% off annual growth, a plausible downside risk scenario. Given Australian q/q GDP has been rising by only ~$2\u00bdbn q/q, we now think Q1 GDP growth is likely to be negative, even with arguably still optimistic assumptions. Health officials have revised the figures released earlier. The number of new deaths reported as of midnight on Tuesday in China is 97, up two from earlier. That compares with 108 reported for Monday \u2013 a fall of 10.2% (I misreported the Monday number as 116 earlier - my apologies). The new cases probably gives us a better idea of what\u2019s happening because the number of deaths has varied a bit day to day. So as of midnight on Tuesday China\u2019s health commission says there were 2,015 new cases, compared with 2,478 on Monday \u2013 a fall of 18.6%. The number of new cases in China is now 44,653. Around the world, there are now 45,182 cases and 1,115 deaths. One more line from Australia for now. Health minister Greg Hunt was pushed by reporters about whether the government would consider changing its travel restrictions to allow students from China to come to Australia to start courses as the academic year begins. Thousands of Chinese students study in Australia. But he said the government could not \u201cchange expectations\u201d. At the moment, the position is very clear - there\u2019s a travel ban. There\u2019s no change in that travel ban. And it\u2019s the medical advice which will guide what we do. He acknowledged there was an economic price to pay but it was a case of safety first: We are very aware, like, deeply aware, of the economic consequences. But the consequences of contagion within Australia at an economic, let alone more significantly a human level, would be extraordinary. And so that\u2019s why we have that clear set of strategic priorities that guide the NSC. Still with that Australian government press conference where the foreign minister Marise Payne was asked about the hundreds of Australians stuck on the Diamond Princess, and those 11 Australians who have tested positive for the virus and who are now being treated in hospitals in Japan. She it was a \u201cvery stressful\u201d situation for those on the ship but she said the quarantine process was needed to stop the spread of the coronavirus on the vessel. It was being managed by the Japanese authorities and Australia would not be trying to bring its citizens home yet. We are working cooperatively with them. No country has indicated it intends to carry out an assisted departure of citizens from Japan,and Australia most certainly doesnot intend to do that. We realise that the situation on the ship is very stressful for those who are there. The Japanese authorities are doingan extraordinary job, both with thepatients, but also those who are in quarantine on the ship, and it is a difficult situation... And we really feel for thosepeople who are in that situation. The Australian foreign minister also fielded questions about further evacuations, in particular about Chloe Luo, the toddler who we have reported about exclusively today. But she said that Australia was not currently considering any more rescue flights from Wuhan, having already removed 538 Australians from the city. She implied that the problem was that Chloe had to be accompanied by an Australian citizen or resident and the problem is that her relatives in China do not fit the bill. We have worked very hard, including taking over 10,000 calls, to deal with these issues to support those families. Our effort has been to try to keep families together where possible. And so, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to assist those Australians to leave Wuhan who are cleared for departure by Chinese travel authorities. Now, that does not include family members of Australian children who are Chinese nationals and who are not Australian permanent residents. In that case, it makes it very complex, where a child is unaccompanied for an entire journey to Australia, potentially for a period of quarantine, and our strong advice is that children in this situation are best to remain in the care of their families, in Wuhan or in Hubei province, while China\u2019s travel restrictions are in place. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, and health minister Greg Hunt are talking in Canberra now. Payne said the government was maintaining its level 4 travel advice for China \u2013 that is advising Australia \u201cdo not travel\u201d to China. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said today that Japan will bar foreign travellers from Zhejiang province from tomorrow [Thursday] in a further attempt to contain Covid-19. Entry will also be denied to holders of Chinese passports issued in the eastern Chinese province, Abe said. Zhejiang province, which is on the east coast of China, south of Shanghai, has the equal second-most number of confirmed cases outside Hubei with 1,117 so far although the area has not recorded any deaths. When counting the people infected on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, Japan has the most cases outside China with 201 (26, plus 174 on the ship and one quarantined officer). Japan has already barred visitors from Hubei province, where the capital Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak. Naaman Zhou, one of our reporters in Sydney, has been writing about the moving case of the 18-month-old Australian girl who is trapped in Hubei. Chloe Luo\u2019s parents sent her to China in January to stay with her grandmother in order to escape the bushfires then sweeping the Australian capital Canberra where the family lives. After her grandmother fell sick with a cold, not related to coronavirus, Chloe is being looked after by her great aunt in Suizhou, near Wuhan. Chloe\u2019s parents, Yufei Luo and Yi Zhao, who live in the Canberra suburb of Ngunnawal, say they were willing to fly into Suizhou but the Australian government is not organising any more rescue flights after already laying on two missions to evacuate Australians from the stricken province. They have pleaded to be able to bring their child home. Yufei told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe thought to send her back just for a couple of weeks, just a month, until the smoke was gone,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe tried to give her better conditions. Then everything happened in Wuhan.\u201d And talking of that propaganda push, here are some examples from social media, including this fascinating one about \u201canother busy day\u201d in the fight against the virus in Wuhan No 4 hospital. CGTN news talks to a nurse, Xu Xinchen, as he goes about his night shift at the hospital, describing problems such as a shortage of protective suits for staff and the difficulties of taking blood from people while wearing large protective goggles. And this one about about to look after your pets. And robots helping out... And Wuhan locals pitching in to help medical staff get to work ... A wave of positive propaganda about the slowdown in infections has swamped the media in China, according to the seasoned China expert, Bill Bishop. Bishop, an American who publishes a regular newsletter about China, Sinocism, wrote on Tuesday that the official media \u201cis in full positive energy mode trying to spread that word that while the battle is still raging victory is within reach\u201d. Today\u2019s figures \u2013 as mentioned in the blog below \u2013 would appear to bear that out and come closely on the heels of comments by China\u2019s China\u2019s senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, suggesting the coronavirus outbreak may be over by April. Bishop notes, however, that an end to the lockdown still affecting millions of people in China, and especially in Hubei, may tell a greater part of the story. He writes: Let\u2019s all hope that we are near the peak, but relaxations of quarantine and other restrictive policies may be a better tell than the official data ... Then again, the central government is clearly very concerned about the economic impact and appears to be pushing local governments to get business back up and running as fast as possible. There is the risk if that people go back to work too quickly there could be a second wave of cases D Stock markets across Asia Pacific have risen this morning as the financial world continues to shrug off any concerns that Covid-19 could derail the global economy. The ASX200 is up 0.4% in Sydney while the Nikkei is 0.3% to the good. Seoul is flat. Chinese markets open in about 40 minutes. The strong showing follows a surge in markets across Europe and the US on Tuesday. MSCI\u2019s all-world stock index gained 0.44% to hit a record high, as did the STOXX 600 index in Europe, the blue-chip DAX in Germany and the S&amp;P/TSX Composite in Canada. Oil prices have also recovered some ground today on hopes that the outbreak is easing. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 74 cents to close at $54.01 a barrel. Coronavirus could reduce Chinese purchases of US food prooduce required under phase one of the US-China trade deal, White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said on Tuesday night in Washington, Reuters reports. O\u2019Brien told an event at the Atlantic Council: \u201cWe expect the phase 1 deal will allow China to import more food and open those markets to American farmers, but certainly as we watch this coronavirus outbreak unfold in China it could have an impact on how big, at least in this current year, the purchases are.\u201d Under the deal signed in January, which took months to negotiate, China agreed to buy more US agricultural goods in exchange for the US dropping tariffs on manufactured goods going the other way. Japan\u2019s health ministry says that 39 more people on board the cruise ship have been confirmed as having the coronavirus. In addition, a quarantine official who was collecting forms on the ship has been infected. Katsunobu Kato said the total of people infected on the ship was now 174. Four are in a serious condition. Out of 53 new test results [on passengers and crew], 39 people were found positive. At this point, we have confirmed that four people, among those who are hospitalised, are in a serious condition, either on a ventilator or in an intensive care unit. We have to careful with the figures, but it looks like good news today with a discernible fall in the rate of deaths and the spread of the disease in China. There were 95 deaths reported overnight according to health officials and Chinese news sites. That\u2019s down from 108 reported for Monday - a drop of almost 20%. New cases reported for the Chinese mainland on Tuesday is 1,696. That is down from a peak of over 3,000 new cases on 4 February and the lowest number of new infections since 1,347 were reported on 31 January. However, we have to treat the new cases with a dose of scepticism as Chinese authorities appeared yesterday to change the way these were counted. Previously anyone diagnosed with the virus was included as a new case, but from now on only people with symptoms of the infewction are included in the number. (See yesterday\u2019s blog here) The global death toll is now 1,113 once you include one in Hong Kong and one in Philippines. The number of cases around the world is now 44,815 Welcome to our rolling coverage of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The death toll in China rose by 95 on Tuesday, according to news sites in the country, making a total of 1,111 on the mainland. But a smaller increase than yesterday. Confirmed new cases in China rose by 1,696, also a smaller increase in what appears to be a slowing of the contagion. The World Health Organization says the virus is \u201cpublic enemy number one\u201d and poses a greater threat than terrorism. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a meeting of experts in Geneva that a vaccine for the virus, now named Covid-19, could be 18 months away 39 more cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship anchored off Yokohama in Japan, the Japanese health ministry says A hospital emergency unit worker has been confirmed as one of the eight people with the virus in the UK. The world\u2019s annual tech industry fest, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, will go ahead despite Intel and Vivo pulling out. A global index of leading stocks hit a record high on Tuesday, helped by China\u2019s senior medical adviser suggesting the coronavirus may be over by April. The parents of an Australian toddler stuck in the stricken Chinese province of Hubei have pleaded with the Canberra government to evacuate her. US national security adviser says the virus could impact the US-China trade deal",

As schools in Brighton, where two GP surgeries have already closed because of the outbreak, instructed pupils to self-isolate, there were warnings that the public should be prepared for the coronavirus \u2013 now named Covid-19 \u2013 to spread further. Dr Paul Cosford of Public Health England said that more cases were now highly likely and that a growing number of people travelling into British airports could be infected. Meanwhile more public events around the world were being cancelled in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, which can lead to pneumonia and has so far killed more than 1,100 people in China alone. On a day of fast-moving developments: \u2022 A major technology trade fair, the MWC in Barcelona with 100,000 attendees due to begin next week, was cancelled, as was April\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix. \u2022 A cruise ship that was turned away from five countries was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia. \u2022 Cases fell to their lowest in weeks in Hubei province \u2013 but experts urged caution over claims that the fight against the virus was being won. \u2022 An additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship tested positive, plus one local official who contracted the virus while on board. \u2022 At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative, while the Guardian understands that all those quarantined in Milton Keynes since Sunday have also tested negative. Health bosses speculate that the virus will continue to spread in the UK until it peaks in the summer, later than the previous assumption that it would peter out in the late spring.
