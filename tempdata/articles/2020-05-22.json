(Voter fraud is actually very rare.)</li> <li><strong>Congressman John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the next director of national intelligence. </strong>Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination was approved in a party-line vote of 49-44, making the staunch Trump ally the first director of national intelligence to be confirmed in a partisan fashion. </li> <li><strong>Michael Cohen was released from prison because of coronavirus concerns. </strong>The former Trump lawyer and fixer was released early to home confinement as concerns mount about the potential spread of coronavirus in prisons.</li> </ul> <p>Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ec6e8a98f08a1782fa7f43e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T20:49:28.492Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Delivering remarks at the Ford plant, <strong>Trump </strong>repeated the false claim that he was named Michigan Man of the Year before taking office.</p> <p>CNN has a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/21/politics/fact-check-trump-michigan-man-of-the-year-again/index.html\">thorough debunking</a> of that claim:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Trump started telling versions of the Man of the Year story two days before Election Day in 2016, when he was making a successful effort to win a state no Republican presidential candidate had carried since 1988. <br></p> <p>Journalists tried and failed to figure out what he was talking about.

An updated evening news summary: Trump chose not to wear a face mask during his tour of a Ford manufacturing plant in Michigan, despite a company policy to do so. The president claimed he had worn a mask \u201cin the back area\u201d of the plant, something the company confirmed, but he said he did not want to give reporters \u201cthe pleasure\u201d of seeing him wear it. Baltimore\u2019s mayor asked Trump to reconsider his planned trip to the city, which is still under a stay-at-home order. \u201cI wish that the president, as our nation\u2019s leader, would set a positive example and not travel during this holiday weekend.\u201d Democratic mayor Bernard Young said. A spokesman for the president said he would not change his plans. Trump reiterated his criticism of vote by mail. A day after threatening to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada over their efforts to expand vote by mail, the president falsely claimed that mail-in ballots are very susceptible to fraud. (Voter fraud is actually very rare.) Congressman John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the next director of national intelligence. Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination was approved in a party-line vote of 49-44, making the staunch Trump ally the first director of national intelligence to be confirmed in a partisan fashion. Michael Cohen was released from prison because of coronavirus concerns. The former Trump lawyer and fixer was released early to home confinement as concerns mount about the potential spread of coronavirus in prisons. The man who filmed the killing of unarmed jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia was arrested and charged with felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Attorneys representing Arbery\u2019s family had previously called for William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan Jr. to be arrested because he helped trap Arbery as he was trying to flee from the two white men who later killed him. \u2018How racist was Henry Ford?\u2019 Trump\u2019s praise of Henry Ford\u2019s \u201cbloodlines\u201d at the Ford Factory has prompted an online discussion of just how racist and harmful the auto company founder was. Yes, a giant portrait. As the Washington Post reported in 1998: \u201cI regard Henry Ford as my inspiration,\u201d Hitler told a Detroit News reporter two years before becoming the German chancellor in 1933, explaining why he kept a life-size portrait of the American automaker next to his desk. At Ford, Trump said he wore a mask in private; took it off in public Journalist Bill Ritter, an anchor for an ABC news channel in New York City, initially shared a photograph of Donald Trump wearing a mask during a private viewing of Ford cars at a Ford plant in Michigan. The president did not wear the mask for the public part of his tour. But Ritter later deleted the tweet with the photograph, explaining that ABC had initially released the photograph, then \u201cruled that they weren\u2019t yet able to confirm the photo.\u201d Images of the president during the public tour without his mask have been shared widely. Trump will ignore Baltimore mayor\u2019s request not to visit city A spokesperson for the president said he would continue with his planned visit to a national landmark to honor veterans, despite Baltimore\u2019s mayor asking the president to stay home. Baltimore is a majority-black city that had more than 4,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases Tuesday, the Baltimore Sun reported, as Maryland overall saw a single day high of 1,784 new reported cases. Trump has previously maligned the city publicly as a \u201crat and rodent-infested mess\u201d, and a \u201cdangerous and filthy place\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live\u201d. The man who filmed the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, the unarmed Georgia jogger killed in February, was arrested Thursday and charged with felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. The man, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan Jr, age 50, had maintained he was not involved in Arbery\u2019s death in the Satilla Shores neighborhood, and merely recorded the now widely-circulated video of Gregory and Travis McMichael chasing down and killing Arbery. Attorneys representing Arbery\u2019s family had called for Bryan to be arrested because he helped trap Arbery, who was fleeing the McMichaels. The other two men were arrested earlier this month and face charges of murder and aggravated assault. Law enforcement in the area faces heavy scrutiny for their handling of the case. A local prosecutor recommended not bringing charges against the McMichaels in April before recusing himself from the case. Ford Motor Company: We asked Trump to wear a mask A spokesperson for Ford released a statement saying that Trump had worn a mask during part of his visit to a Michigan plant, but that he later removed it. Ford\u2019s executive chairman personally encouraged Trump to wear a mask, the company said. \u201cBill Ford encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived. He wore a mask during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years. The President later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.\u201d Trump praises Henry Ford\u2019s \u2018bloodlines\u2019 It\u2019s not particularly surprising that Trump might praise Henry Ford during his visit to a Ford plant in Michigan. But Trump\u2019s particular phrasing has raised some eyebrows, given that Ford was a notorious anti-Semite who used his wealth and influence to spread dangerous lies about Jewish people. He talked about the company\u2019s \u201cbloodlines\u201d and Ford\u2019s \u201cgood blood\u201d. PBS has an interview with a scholar who provides more context on Ford\u2019s antisemitism and its impact: In 1918, Henry Ford purchased his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent. A year and a half later, he began publishing a series of articles that claimed a vast Jewish conspiracy was infecting America... As one of the most famous men in America, Henry Ford legitimized ideas that otherwise may have been given little authority. Trump on reopening churches and America\u2019s \u2018incredible comeback\u2019 Wrapping up a speech at a Ford manufacturing plant in Michigan, Trump promised that he was working on plans to allow churches to hold Sunday services again, and \u201cyou\u2019re going to see something come out very soon.\u201d As the reported death toll nears 100,000, the president said the country was ready to bounce back. \u201cThis country is poised for an epic comeback,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is going to be an incredible comeback. Just watch. It\u2019s already happening.\u201d \u201cAmericans who need and want to return to work should not be vilified,\u201d he said, likely a reference to the harsh public reactions to the predominantly white Americans who have staged large and sometimes volatile protests in Michigan and other states. For many Americans, he said, especially those who work with their hands, \u201cworking remotely is just not an option.\u201d In states like Georgia that have already begun to reopen, the numbers of coronavirus cases are going down, Trump claimed, \u201cand very substantially down\u201d. But as the Atlantic\u2019s Ed Yong has explained yesterday, there\u2019s a weeks-long lag between the time states make decisions, and the time those decisions translate into more or fewer cases. \u201cMay\u2019s declining cases are the result of April\u2019s physical distancing, and the consequences of May\u2019s reopenings won\u2019t be felt until June at the earliest,\u201d he wrote. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over a blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump chose not to wear a face mask during his tour of a Ford manufacturing plant in Michigan, despite a company policy to do so. The president claimed he had worn a mask \u201cin the back area\u201d of the plant, but he said he did not want to give reporters \u201cthe pleasure\u201d of seeing him wear it. Baltimore\u2019s mayor asked Trump to reconsider his planned trip to the city, which is still under a stay-at-home order. \u201cI wish that the president, as our nation\u2019s leader, would set a positive example and not travel during this holiday weekend.\u201d Democratic mayor Bernard Young said. Trump reiterated his criticism of vote by mail. A day after threatening to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada over their efforts to expand vote by mail, the president falsely claimed that mail-in ballots are very susceptible to fraud. (Voter fraud is actually very rare.) Congressman John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the next director of national intelligence. Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination was approved in a party-line vote of 49-44, making the staunch Trump ally the first director of national intelligence to be confirmed in a partisan fashion. Michael Cohen was released from prison because of coronavirus concerns. The former Trump lawyer and fixer was released early to home confinement as concerns mount about the potential spread of coronavirus in prisons. Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Delivering remarks at the Ford plant, Trump repeated the false claim that he was named Michigan Man of the Year before taking office. CNN has a thorough debunking of that claim: Trump started telling versions of the Man of the Year story two days before Election Day in 2016, when he was making a successful effort to win a state no Republican presidential candidate had carried since 1988. Journalists tried and failed to figure out what he was talking about. (For one, the state does not have an official Man of the Year award. For two, Trump had never lived in Michigan.) ... Then a former Republican congressman from Michigan, Dave Trott, contacted CNN and other news outlets to solve the mystery. Trott offered a convincing explanation: Trump was talking about his speech at an event Trott had organized, a Lincoln Day dinner for Republicans in Oakland County, Michigan, in 2013. There, Trott said, Trump gave a \u2018rambling\u2019 address resembling the one he says he did -- and Trott gave him a framed copy of Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and other gifts. But Trott did not give him any Man of the Year award, and nor did anyone else. Trump said he thought his reelection campaign would be able to start holding outdoor rallies again \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d \u201cWe got to get back to the rallies,\u201d Trump stold reporters while touring the Ford plant in Michigan. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be sooner rather than later.\u201d Trump said his campaign would look for \u201cbig, outdoor\u201d venues to hold the events. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna have a stadium where you\u2019re supposed to have a person, then seven empty seats,\u201d the president said. Again, public health experts have urged caution when relaxing social distancing guidelines, which have prohibited large events like rallies, out of concern about a potential surge in coronavirus infections. Trump showed off the mask he allegedly wore in the \u201cback area\u201d of the Ford manufacturing plant, although he was seen maskless when taking questions from reporters. \u201cI like it very much,\u201d Trump said of the mask as he displayed it to reporters. \u201cHonestly, I think I look better in the mask,\u201d the president added, saying he took it odd because he was about to deliver a speech. Asked about Trump not covering his face despite a company policy to do so, the Ford chairman said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to him.\u201d Trump claimed that he had worn a mask \u201cin the back area\u201d of the Ford manufacturing plant but not while he was visible to the reporters who traveled to Michigan with him. \u201cI had one on before,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d Asked why he took the mask off, the president argued it was \u201cnot necessary\u201d for most of the tour because he is regularly tested for coronavirus. But public health experts have previously said even those who have previously tested negative for coronavirus should still cover their faces, as the CDC has recommended. The moment of truth has arrived, and the president is ... not wearing a mask as he tours a Ford manufacturing plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, despite a policy requiring face coverings. Trump toured the facility, which has been repurposed to make ventilators for coronavirus patients, with multiple Ford executives, who were wearing masks. Michigan\u2019s attorney general Dana Nessel wrote an open letter to Trump yesterday, saying the president had \u201cnot only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral responsibility\u201d to wear a mask during his tour. \u201cWhile my Department will not act to prevent you from touring Ford\u2019s plant, I ask that while you are on tour you respect the great efforts of the men and women at Ford \u2014 and across this State \u2014 by wearing a facial covering,\u201d Nessel wrote. \u201cIt is not just the policy of Ford, by virtue of the Governor\u2019s Executive Orders. It is currently the law of this State.\u201d Speaking during his visit to Michigan this afternoon, it looks like the president is putting pressure on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue guidelines of some kind that will indicate it\u2019s okay to restart in-person church services. He made an eyebrow-raising statement a little earlier when he told a gathering of African American leaders: \u201cWe are opening our churches again. I think the CDC is going to put something out very soon, spoke to them today. I think they are going to put something out very soon. We got to open our churches.\u201d The president said the guidance was expected today or tomorrow. \u201cI said you better put it out and they\u2019re doing it and they\u2019re going to be issuing something today or tomorrow and churches are going to get our churches open,\u201d Trump said. Leading federal public health officials have repeatedly urged caution about easing social distancing restrictions, warning it could cause a surge in coronavirus infections. Klobuchar being vetted as possible VP choice. No surprise in these reports, obviously, it would be a total shock if Joe Biden wasn\u2019t strongly considering Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar to be his running mate. But, while not officially confirmed, it\u2019s always interesting to hear these things on the political grapevine. Klobuchar would be an asset to Biden as a moderate mid-westerner appealing to swing voters in key states such as Michigan and Wisconsin. She had a not-too-shabby campaign and was a hit at some of the Democratic debates with her pithy common sense approach, but struggled in the primaries and dropped out and endorsed Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday. Biden has pledged to select a woman as his vice-presidential running mate. He is under pressure to pick a woman of color, but there is a relatively long and varied list of contenders for the ticket. Trump is now participating in a listening session with African-American leaders at a Ford manufacturing plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which has been repurposed to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients. During the listening session, the president is sitting in front of a backdrop with the slogan \u201cTransition to Greatness.\u201d Trump has repeatedly said in recent weeks that the US is \u201ctransitioning to greatness\u201d in an effort to put the emphasis on the country\u2019s very gradual reopening, even as the coronavirus death toll approaches 100,000. Alumni of presidential campaigns have said the slogan is an attempt to deflect attention away from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has been widely criticized, and downplay economic distress as he seeks reelection. Nearly three quarters of social media users think Trump should be banned or suspended from platforms for spreading false information about coronavirus. According to a Morning Consult poll of 2,044 social media users, 37% say Trump should be banned for spreading such information, while 36% say he should be temporarily suspended. There were marked partisan divisions in the polling results. While 23% of Republicans said the president should be banned, 47% of Democrats said the same. Twitter announced last week that it would apply a new label to tweets containing misleading information about the pandemic. However, the platform chose not to apply the label to multiple tweets from prominent Trump allies citing a press release that falsely claimed hydroxychloroquine has shown to be an effective treatment against coronavirus. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale was one of the people circulating the statement from a widely criticized anti-vaccine group. Trump lashed out against Fox News over Twitter, complaining that the network \u201cis doing nothing to help Republicans, and me, get re-elected on November 3rd,\u201d which of course is not actually the job of a news outlet. The president said some Fox News hosts and commentators, such as anchor Neil Cavuto and former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile, \u201crepeat the worst of the Democrat speaking points.\u201d Cavuto expressed alarm earlier this week when Trump said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus, even though the FDA has said the anti-malaria drug should only be used as a potential coronavirus treatment in hospital settings. \u201cIf you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worst-case scenario you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you,\u201d Cavuto said Monday. \u201cI cannot stress that enough. This will kill you.\u201d Trump responded to Cavuto\u2019s concerns by retweeting allies who called the an \u201cidiot,\u201d \u201cfoolish,\u201d \u201cgullible\u201d and \u201can asshole.\u201d The Baltimore mayor is urging Trump to reconsider his planned visit to the Fort McHenry National Monument on Monday because the city remains under a stay-at-home order. The White House announced last night that the president and first lady would participate in a Memorial Day ceremony at the site \u201cto honor the American heroes who have sacrificed their lives serving in the US armed forces\u201d. But the Democratic mayor, Bernard Young, implored the president to reconsider the visit as the city continues to work to keep the spread of coronavirus under control. \u201cThe city of Baltimore remains under a stay-at-home order that was put in place to help safeguard our residents from the dangers associated with Covid-19,\u201d Young said in a statement. \u201cI wish that the president, as our nation\u2019s leader, would set a positive example and not travel during this holiday weekend.\u201d Young said that the city would \u201cbe prepared\u201d if Trump decided to go ahead with his visit. This is only the latest clash between Trump and Baltimore, which is about 40 miles from the White House. The president called the city a \u201crat and rodent-infested mess\u201d last year, during a clash with the late Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings. Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, threatened to subpoena secretary of state Mike Pompeo over documents provided to two Senate committees regarding an investigation related to Joe Biden. \u201cI am deeply concerned by what appears to be a partisan misuse of Department of State resources to assist Senate Republicans in a political smear of Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Engel wrote in a letter to Pompeo. Engel said that, days after the conclusion of Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, the state department handed over thousands of pages of documents to Senate Republicans \u201cto manufacture baseless, blatantly political attacks\u201d against Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. The New York Democrat noted that the release of documents came after the state department spent months refusing to cooperate with congressional subpoenas related to the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI formally requested on May 14 that you provide me with copies of the documents which the Department has provided to the two Senate Committees and formally request that you provide these to my Committee,\u201d Engel wrote. \u201cHowever, if the requested documents are not produced in full by the close of business on June 1, 2020, then I am prepared to issue subpoenas for the relevant documents and the testimony of relevant Department officials.\u201d The Senate homeland security committee voted along party lines yesterday to approve a subpoena to a Democratic public relations firm in connection to the Biden investigation, sparking Democratic accusations that Republican senators were \u201c\u2018doing the president\u2019s personal bidding.\u201d Trump said it \u201clooks like\u201d the next G7 summit will be held in person in Washington, even though the city is currently still under a stay-at-home order. \u201cIt looks like the G7 will be on, a full G7, and we\u2019ll be announcing something early next week,\u201d the president told reporters before leaving for Michigan. Trump said the summit, which was previously scheduled to begin at Camp David on June 10, would be held \u201cprobably at the White House but maybe a little combination at Camp David, but primarily at the White House.\u201d The White House said in March that the summit would take place via video teleconference, as other recent G7 meetings have been conducted. But Trump reversed that yesterday, saying in a tweet that he was \u201cconsidering\u201d holding the summit in person, despite potential health concerns about having world leaders travel internationally in the middle of a global pandemic. Representatives for French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said they would consider traveling to Camp David for the summit, health conditions permitting. In a moment of very confusing wording, Trump told reporters he had tested \u201cvery positively\u201d for coronavirus, meaning he had tested negative. \u201cI tested very positively,\u201d Trump said of his coronavirus test this morning. \u201cI tested positively toward negative, right? So I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative.\u201d Got that, readers? The president is regularly tested for coronavirus, as are his staff members and guests, as well as reporters who attend the White House briefings. Two White House staffers, including own of the president\u2019s military valets, tested positive for coronavirus earlier this month, raising concerns about the spread of the virus in the West Wing. Trump once again lashed out against states seeking to expand absentee voting options to limit the potential spread of coronavirus at polling places. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to do mail-in ballots because it\u2019s going to lead to total election fraud,\u201d Trump said before traveling to Michigan to tour a Ford manufacturing plant. Yesterday, the president threatened to withhold funding from Michigan over its decision to mail absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to do mail-in ballots. We don\u2019t want anyone to do mail-in ballots,\u201d Trump said. The president, who voted remotely in Florida\u2019s primary earlier this year, said it was acceptable in some circumstances to vote by mail, but he argued it should not be a widespread practice. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take any chances with fraud in our elections,\u201d Trump said. Voter fraud is very rare, and some of the president\u2019s critics have suggested he is actually trying to drive down turnout in the 2020 election, even though it\u2019s unclear how expanded absentee voting would affect turnout. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Michael Cohen was released from prison over concerns about coronavirus. The president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer was released early to home confinement and said in a tweet, \u201cThere is so much I want to say and intend to say. But now is not the right time. Soon.\u201d Trump is traveling to Michigan to tour a Ford manufacturing plant. The president has repeatedly clashed with Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and threatened to withhold funding from the state over efforts to expand vote by mail. John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the next director of national intelligence. The Republican congressman was approved on a party-line vote of 49 to 44, making the staunch Trump ally the first director of national intelligence to be confirmed in a partisan fashion. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Congressman John Ratcliffe has been confirmed as the next director of national intelligence in a straight party-line vote. The final vote was 49-44, with even moderate Democratic senators like Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin refusing to back the Trump ally\u2019s nomination. The vote makes Ratcliffe the first director of national intelligence to be confirmed along party lines. In comparison, Trump\u2019s first director of national intellifence, Dan Coats, was confirmed in a vote of 85-12. Ratcliffe will replace acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, whose lack of experience in the intelligence community had sparked serious concerns about keeping him in the role. However, Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination had also been criticized by Democrats, given the Texas congressman\u2019s minimal intelligence experience. Ratcliffe was forced to withdraw from consideration for the role last year but was formally nominated earlier this year. Ratcliffe\u2019s confirmation will permanently install a staunch Trump ally as a top leader in the intelligence community, which the president has repeatedly criticized for its conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, indicated he would soon speak publicly after being released from prison to home confinement. \u201cI am so glad to be home and back with my family,\u201d Cohen said in a tweet shortly after arriving back at his New York apartment. \u201cThere is so much I want to say and intend to say. But now is not the right time. Soon.\u201d Cohen pleaded guilty to bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance law violations in 2018 in connection to a hush-money scheme during the 2016 election, which was meant to silence women who said they had had extramarital affairs with Trump. In his explosive 2019 appearance before Congress, Cohen said Trump had directed him to lie about a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels and predicted the president would not allow for a peaceful transition of power if he lost his bid for reelection. The Senate foreign relations committee has advanced the nomination of Michael Pack to lead the US Agency for Global Media, even though the conservative filmmaker is under investigation by the DC attorney general. Pack\u2019s nomination was approved by the committee on a party-line vote of 12-10, with Democrats pushing for the vote to be postponed to address concerns about the investigation into Pack. Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate foreign relations committee, said yesterday he had been notified the DC attorney general was \u201cactively investigating\u201d allegations that Pack had illegally funneled money from his nonprofit group to his for-profit film company. The Republican chairman of the panel, senator Jim Risch, said he would stand down on the nomination if the department of justice asked him to, but apparently the department did not intervene. Pack still needs to be approved by the full Senate, and Republicans can only afford to lose three votes on his nomination to get him confirmed. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and fixer, has arrived at his New York home after being released from prison. Photographers were present to capture Cohen, who was wearing a mask, entering his apartment, where he will serve out the remainder of his prison sentence. Cohen began serving his sentence last May and was originally scheduled to be released in November 2021, but he was granted home confinement out of concerns about the spread of coronavirus at prisons. Another one of the president\u2019s former associates, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, was also released to home confinement last week. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, predicted the US economy would \u201cbottom-out\u201d during the second quarter of the year and see a \u201cgigantic increase\u201d in the fourth quarter. However, many public health experts have warned that the country could see a second wave of coronavirus cases at the end of the year, which could cause more economic devastation. Economists now also fear that the job losses caused by the pandemic may be much longer-lasting than previously thought. \u201cI hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,\u201d Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, told the New York Times. \u201cFirms intend to hire these people back,\u201d Bloom added. \u201cBut we know from the past that these aspirations often don\u2019t turn out to be true.\u201d The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, acknowledged that another coronavirus relief bill will likely be necessary in the coming weeks. \u201cI think there is a strong likelihood we will need another bill,\u201d Mnuchin said during a forum hosted by the Hill. But the cabinet member said he thought Congress should closely consider what funding is needing, arguing that unemployment insurance should be adjusted. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told House minority leader Kevin McCarthy yesterday that he would not support extending funding to give Americans additional unemployment insurance, which was included in the House bill passed last week. Another 2.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total number of unemployment claims since the start of the coronavirus crisis to nearly 39 million. The US has issued notification that it intends to leave the Open Skies Treaty, an agreement of 34 states made in the wake of the cold war that allows Russia, former Soviet bloc countries and the west to make reconnaissance flights over each other\u2019s territory, to promote transparency and trust and reduce the risk of war by miscalculation or accident. The US has informed the other 33 state parties to the treaty of its intentions \u2013 the calls between US and UK officials are set for today \u2013 and it is expected to serve its formal six-month notice of withdrawal. Washington has accused Russia of infringements, imposing limits on some overflights, but no other party to the agreement thought those issues were serious enough to ditch the treaty. It is the latest of a string of arms control agreements Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from, and there may well be more to come. The decision on the Open Skies Treaty was already made in principle last month. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, mocked the House for not calling members back to Washington amid the coronavirus crisis. The Kentucky Republican said House members were like senators\u2019 \u201cabsentee neighbors across the rotunda\u201d. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m wondering if we should send senators over there to collect their newspapers and water the plants,\u201d McConnell joked. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, was quick to point out the House passed a $3tn coronavirus relief package this week, while the Senate has not taken up any additional relief bills. Yesterday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, also triggered the remote voting provisions passed by the House last week, allowing members to vote by proxy. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their job. They\u2019ve passed a major bill,\u201d Schumer said of House members. \u201cSenator McConnell says, \u2018Let\u2019s wait. Let\u2019s pause.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t see immediate urgency. Well, Americans do.\u201d Schumer went on to criticize his Republican colleagues for moving ahead with controversial nominations and an investigation related to Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter as the coronavirus crisis continues. \u201cThis is such a gross misuse of power of the majority,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWhile unemployment reaches astronic levels, the Senate Republican caucus is off on a wild goose chase. The conspiracy caucus is back with a vengeance.\u201d Oregon Republicans have nominated someone who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory to face off against Democratic senator Jeff Merkley in November. Jo Rae Perkins, who defeated three other Senate candidates on Tuesday, said in a now-deleted video, \u201cI stand with President Trump. I stand with Q and the team. Thank you Anons, and thank you patriots. And together, we can save our republic.\u201d The QAnon theory has been embraced by some of the president\u2019s supporters and centers on an alleged government agent named \u201cQ\u201d, whose top security clearance has provided insight into a deep-state conspiracy involving everyone from Hillary Clinton to special counsel Robert Mueller. In a statement released last night, Perkins downplayed her support for the conspiracy theory. \u201cTo be very clear, I do not believe everything from Q/Anon and would never describe myself as a follower, but I also do not believe in infringing upon any outlet\u2019s right to discuss news or topics,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cMy slogan, For One Oregon, has nothing to do with conspiracy theories or media bias, but rather, has long been my commitment to being a civil servant for all of Oregon, not just some as has been the case under Jeff Merkley\u2019s tenure.\u201d But Perkins is unlikely to win the November election. The seat has been rated as safely Democratic by Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, and Merkley won his last race in 2014 by 19 points. Joe Biden released a statement criticizing Trump for \u201cencouraging division\u201d in Michigan, which the president is visiting today to tour a Ford manufacturing plant. The presumptive Democratic nominee specifically cited Trump\u2019s threat to withhold funding from Michigan over the state\u2019s efforts to expand vote by mail. \u201cFor the last three years, Donald Trump has turned his back on Michigan\u2019s working families,\u201d Biden said in the statement. \u201cHis delayed, erratic, and corrupt response to the pandemic has been no different.\u201d Biden also praised the work of Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who has been frequently named as a potential running mate for Biden. \u201cAs Michiganders were being forced to flee their homes and small businesses, Governor Whitmer got right to work, declaring a state of emergency and deploying the national guard,\u201d Biden said. He continued: \u201cAnd I know that under the leadership of Governor Whitmer and Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, Michigan\u2019s best days are still ahead.\u201d Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and fixer, is expected to be released from prison today to serve out the remainder of his sentence at home. The AP reports: Cohen has been serving a federal prison sentence at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He will be released on furlough with the expectation that he will transition to home confinement to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, the person said. Cohen, 53, began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021. A number of prison inmates have been released to home confinement out of concern about coronavirus outbreaks at prisons. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was also released from prison last week. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer sent a letter to Trump asking him to lower flags to half staff when the US coronavirus death toll surpasses 100,000. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 93,439 Americans have died from coronavirus, and the death toll is expected to reach 100,000 in the coming days. \u201cOur hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families,\u201d the Democratic congressional leaders wrote in their letter to Trump. \u201cRespectful of them and the loss to our country, we are writing to request that you order flags to be flown at half staff on all public buildings in our country on the sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths. It would serve as a national expression of grief so needed by everyone in our country.\u201d The request should be rather straightforward, but it will be interesting to see how the president, who has insisted the country is already \u201ctransitioning to greatness\u201d even as the death toll continues to climb, will respond. Even as nearly 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment beneifts, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has reportedly said he does not want the next coronavirus relief bill to include money for additional unemployment benefits. Politico reports: The Senate majority leader told the House GOP minority in an afternoon phone call that he is comfortable waiting to see how the nearly $3tn in coronavirus spending previously approved plays out before moving forward on the next relief legislation. And he told them the ultimate end-product won\u2019t look anything like House Democrats\u2019 $3tn package passed last week, according to a person briefed on the call. While McConnell conceded more aid may be necessary in the coming weeks, he also repeated his insistence that liability reform be included in the next round of legislation to minimize lawsuits. And he said the $600 weekly boost in unemployment benefits won\u2019t continue \u2013 a vow he hadn\u2019t previously made. McConnell and the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, have seemed comfortable with slow-walking the next relief bill, while the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has insisted Americans need more economic relief now to help offset the business closures caused by the pandemic. A majority of Americans appear to agree with Pelosi. A poll released earlier this month showed that 74% of likely voters in battleground states supported sustained government payments during the pandemic, which should get the president\u2019s attention. Another 2.4 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week even as states across the US began opening up for business again, betting that the coronavirus pandemic is now under control. The latest figures from the Department of Labor mean close to 39 million Americans have lost their jobs in just nine weeks. The rate of weekly losses has slowed sharply from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April but remains at levels unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. This week the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he expects unemployment to continue to rise as the pandemic takes its toll but warned of \u201cpermanent damage\u201d to the economy if the lockdowns continue too long. The weekly jobless claims are seen as a proxy for layoffs but they do not necessarily give the most accurate picture of the unemployment situation. A claim is an application for unemployment benefits and not every person who is laid off immediately applies for benefits. The weekly unemployment claims are also still being impacted by a backlog collapse of claims that overwhelmed many state systems. Good morning, live blog readers. Donald Trump is set to visit a Ford manufacturing plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, today, which has been repurposed to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients. The visit comes amid tensions between the president and the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who Trump has nicknamed \u201cHalf Whitmer\u201d. The president has expressed support for protesters who have repeatedly gathered at the Michigan state capitol to protest Whitmer\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. The president even threatened to withhold funding from Michigan yesterday after the Democratic secretary of state announced she would send absentee ballot applications to every registered voter. The Michigan attorney general has also sent Trump an open letter saying he has a \u201clegal responsibility\u201d to wear a mask during the Ford tour because the plant has a policy mandating face coverings. The president has been resistant to wearing a mask during other recent trips, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guidance that Americans should cover their faces to limit the spread of the virus. All of this comes as Trump looks ahead to the general election in November, when he will almost certainly need to carry Michigan (which he narrowly won in 2016) to secure a second term. It should make for an interesting and tense day for the president, not to mention his Michigan hosts. Stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "More than a thousand workers in the struggling retail industry are at risk of losing their jobs after the owners of discount department store chain Target decided to close as many as 75 stores. The decision, revealed on Friday morning by West Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers, was immediately blasted by the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, who said Australians should boycott the company. \u201cIf they want to turn their back on the most vulnerable, it just goes to show that corporate Australia has lost its way, morally,\u201d he said. He said the decision to close 52 country stores, a move which could leave some regional areas without a department store, showed the company \u201cdon\u2019t give a rat\u2019s about us\u201d. \u201cI think Australians should vote with their wallets and not got near them,\u201d he said. In addition to the closures, up to 90 more stores are to be converted to Kmart stores, which are also owned by West Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers. Some staff are to be deployed to Kmart stores but the closures and mergers are expected to result in the loss of between 1,000 and 1,300 jobs over the coming year. The store closures and mergers take in more than half of Target\u2019s 284 outlets across Australia. Target was already struggling before the coronavirus pandemic smashed retail trade, while Kmart and another Wesfarmers chain, Catch, were growing. Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott said the company had tried to fix Target for the past decade but it had suffered from the rise of internet shopping and an influx of competition from overseas specialty retailers who have entered the Australian market. \u201cThe retail market is fiercely competitive, especially in the mid-market apparel area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have made every effort within Wesfarmers to find a sustainable way forward for Target.\u201d He acknowledged that closing Target Country stores could leave some regional areas without a department store. \u201cIt\u2019s not a decision we\u2019ve made lightly and if we could find an economic way to service those communities we would have done so,\u201d he said. He said Littleproud\u2019s comments were \u201cprobably spurred by disappointment\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed with what\u2019s happening with jobs in Australia at the moment,\u201d he said. Wesfarmers said it would take costs and write downs totalling as much as $1.3bn this year, including the cost of shutting the Target stores. The future of the remaining Target stores remains up in the air, with the company conducting an \u201cassessment of strategic options for a commercially viable Target and its remaining store network\u201d. \u201cFor some time now, the retail sector has seen significant structural change and disruption, and we expect this trend to continue,\u201d Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott said. \u201cWith the exception of Target, Wesfarmers\u2019 retail businesses are well-positioned to respond to the changes in consumer behaviour and competition associated with this disruption.\u201d Wesfarmers will also close its Anko homeware and clothing stores in the US. Between 10 and 40 large Target stores and 52 of the 100 smaller Target Country outlets are to be converted to Kmarts. Between 10 and 25 large Target stores and the remaining Target Country stores are to close. About half of the 400 jobs at Target\u2019s head office are expected to be lost. Ian Bailey, the managing director of the Kmart group, which includes Target, said Wesfarmers still believed Target \u201chas a future as a leading retail brand in Australia and is much loved by many customers, but a number of actions and changes are required to ensure it is fit for purpose in a competitive, challenging and dynamic market, including a smaller number of stores and a stronger online business\u201d.",

The UK\u2019s death toll is 36,124, with 252,246 infections.</p> <h2>China abandons GDP target in due to \u2018great uncertainty\u2019</h2> <p>Beijing has taken the rare step of not setting a GDP target for the first time since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Instead, given \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, China said it would \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d, Premier Li Keqiang told the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress. He also said governments at all levels should \u201ctighten their belts\u201d, and that all types of surplus, idle and carryover funds would be withdrawn and re-allocated, to be put to better use. China reported four new cases of Covid-19 on Friday.</p> <h2>Trump doesn\u2019t wear mask at factory visit</h2> <p>The US president toured a Ford plant in the battleground state of Michigan which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment. He did not wear a face mask in front of TV cameras. This was despite Ford on Tuesday saying its policy was that all visitors must wear them. Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras: \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d Trump said. Earlier Trump said there would be an announcement \u201cvery soon\u201d on reopening churches to the public.</p> <h2>Brazil passes 20,000 deaths</h2> <p>Latin America\u2019s biggest country passed the grim milestone with a record one-day death toll of 1,188, taking the confirmed total to 20,047. The country has 310,087 infections, third behind the US (1,577,287) and Russia (317,554).

The authorities have asked the military and the police to prevent arrivals in Jakarta.</p> <h2>Russia\u2019s industrial output drops 6.5% in April</h2> <p>The country\u2019s economic performance was hit by the coronavirus lockdown. The state statistics agency said \u201cconsumer demand fell for a range of goods and services\u201d. However, Russia\u2019s commodities sector only decreased by 3.2% year-on-year, and oil production actually grew by 0.2%. Pharmaceutical industries grew by 13.5%, year-on-year.</p> <h2>South Korea reports 20 new cases</h2> <p>The new coronavirus cases came as health authorities worked to contain the cluster connected to Seoul nightclubs. South Korea has had a total of 11,142 infections and 264 deaths.</p> <h2>Australian\u2019s most populous state further eases restrictions</h2> <p>New South Wales has announced cafes and restaurants will be allowed to have up to 50 patrons from 1 June, up from 10 currently allowed. Australia has had remarkable success in flattening the curve of infections from the coronavirus. The country of 25m has recorded 101 deaths and just over 7,000 cases and is now consistently reporting fewer than 20 new cases a day. </p> <h2>Tributes flow for former White House butler who died from Covid-19</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/first-families-pay-tribute-former-white-house-butler-wilson-jerman-dies-covid-19\">Wilson Jerman, who has died from Covid-19, aged 91,</a> was a fixture in the White House under 11 presidents.

The government trial will initially examine saliva antibody tests \u2013 which detect if someone has previously had Covid-19 \u2013 before being expanded to antigen tests showing current infections if it proves successful. The Guardian has also learned that the government is in advanced discussions with one of the biggest saliva test companies in the US about getting approval for its product to be used in the UK.

But there are varying degrees of catastrophic situations right now. It\u2019s hard for artists to be front-page news when they\u2019re talking about mass infections at meatpacking plants, or healthcare workers, or the Indigenous population. It\u2019s hard to say: \u201cGuys, what if the folk festival scene breaks down?\u201d I\u2019m sort of being tough love with our community. While I wish the government would swoop down and fix everything, I\u2019m not afraid there\u2019s not going to be a music scene. Some venues will survive and some won\u2019t; the people that survive survive, the people that don\u2019t, they find something in the ashes and build something different.</p> <p><strong>Is there a positive side to this?</strong></p> <p><strong>Quin</strong> We were already talking about the climate crisis, the cost of shipping gear and flights, travelling the globe, building this huge production; how long can we sustain that model? I feel inspired as a small business owner to be thinking about what my future business looks like. How can we build something that will thrive? That actually feels really exciting.</p> <p><strong>Garratt</strong> It\u2019s really forced me into myself, and I\u2019m not in a great place at the moment, so that hasn\u2019t helped my creativity whatsoever. Being up in [my studio] feels like I\u2019m torturing myself because I\u2019m not necessarily giving a good part of myself. Like Sara, the thing I\u2019ve been really able to thrive in is thinking about how we create new ideas that end up being sustainable whether everyone\u2019s inside or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/22/murder-capital-review-bristol\">The Murder Capital review \u2013 people really need this band</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>McGovern</strong> I\u2019ve found myself able to write again and to reconnect with the reason why I started playing music as a child, which was to connect with myself emotionally. Writing full songs over emails doesn\u2019t work for us \u2013 there\u2019s too much of a human element in what we do \u2013 but having the time to spend the entire day coming up with a guitar line or a vocal melody, there\u2019s no immediate pressure from something around you, that\u2019s been interesting. It\u2019s a bleak positive.</p> <p><strong>Eyre</strong> When the reality of how long this was going to last settled in, I didn\u2019t want to pressure myself to be creative, but I think by having no pressure I\u2019ve been able to enjoy Zoom writing sessions and have fun with the people I work with regularly. I already had a bunch of songs ready to go; if anything, lockdown has allowed the pressure to be taken off the release of them. There\u2019s no worry about a \u00a370k music video or marketing strategy or how many bloody TikToks, I\u2019ve just enjoyed being able to put music out. The expectation is different. It has allowed everybody to relax and be creative about how we\u2019re presenting stuff and making stuff to keep our fanbases engaged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78dd3db174830e8ca1b1278d455cc14797e185c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78dd3db174830e8ca1b1278d455cc14797e185c8/59_347_1156_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tegan and Sara (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tegan and Sara (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trevor Brady</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you feel a pressure to constantly create content for your fans?</strong></p> <p><strong>Quin:</strong> My hesitation is that it\u2019s a form of labour we do for free that is generating money for Instagram and Facebook and Twitch. I know it\u2019s not cool to be a sell-out and to say you need money and you want your fans to pay for things, but I feel as artists we need to be comfortable being transparent about that. I\u2019m inspired by people doing livestreams and making content, but I don\u2019t feel inspired to do it, because I hate playing concerts to people holding up their cellphones, and I don\u2019t want to play a concert to my cellphone.</p> <p><strong>Garratt:</strong> It\u2019s a technical experience, not an emotional one. But I don\u2019t have a choice not to do it because I\u2019m putting an album out and I want as many people to experience it in as honest a way as I can create. I\u2019m lucky in that I can recreate it in the studio pretty accurately, but I would absolutely swap that sofa over there for a couple of warm bodies.</p> <p><strong>McGovern:</strong> I don\u2019t turn my nose up at that stuff in any way, but I don\u2019t know how we could achieve it in a way that we would be happy with. There\u2019s no point in doing it if we don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. I\u2019ve seen some great ones though \u2013 I\u2019ve got great comfort from watching James Blake\u2019s Instagram Lives.</p> <p><strong>We live in an age where fans expect to be more directly connected with artists via social media, which can be a fraught relationship. Has lockdown made that relationship better or worse?</strong></p> <p><strong>Eyre:</strong> I\u2019ve always had a direct relationship with my fanbase. I was really active on Twitter before Instagram was a thing, and I\u2019m still pretty personable. To be honest, I think that was a mistake on my part early on, because they expect so much more of me now. But I think lockdown is providing a more intimate experience for them \u2013 you\u2019re literally letting fans into your home, you\u2019re wearing the same clothes twice, there\u2019s not a glam team. And in the same way that they\u2019re relying on us to keep them entertained, as an artist I\u2019m sort of relying on them \u2013 the song I released a couple of weeks ago is not a single, I played a demo of it on my [Instagram] story and everyone wanted us to put it out, so we did it just for fun, haven\u2019t pushed it anywhere. I think, ultimately, it\u2019s made us closer.</p> <p><strong>McGovern:</strong> I\u2019ve stepped further and further away from it. We did a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/10/tim-burgess-twitter-listening-parties\">Tim Burgess Listening Party</a> on Twitter, which was nice, but I\u2019ve actually turned my phone off now. It\u2019s been off for eight to 10 days, and it feels good, to be honest. My attention span wasn\u2019t there to read a novel if I wanted to do that, so I thought: fuck that, I\u2019m going to turn the thing off. I\u2019ve bought a Nokia 105 for when I get out.</p> <p> <strong>Spotify has introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/23/spotify-tip-jar-musicians-pay-fans-donate-artists\">a tip jar for artists</a> \u2013 what are your thoughts? There has been a lot of talk about how unfair to artists the royalty system on streaming services is; is this the time to change it? If so, how?</strong></p> <p><strong>Garratt</strong> It\u2019s offensive to artists that are putting the music on that platform and it\u2019s offensive to the consumer. It\u2019s a platform owning up to the fact that there\u2019s an issue, and the Band-Aid they are putting around that issue is to make it the consumer\u2019s problem to fix it.</p> <p><strong>McGovern</strong> It\u2019s a load of fucking horseshit. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying: a PR cover-up for a situation where we\u2019re not being paid clearly for having our music on their platform.</p> <p><strong>Quin</strong> We don\u2019t ask people to go to the grocery store and make a decision on how much they\u2019re going to spend on a loaf of bread; it costs whatever it costs. Instead of asking consumers to solve the problem, the industry needs to have a reckoning about the way we value music, and that needs to be platform-wide. All the different streaming platforms, the record labels, the publishers, the artists who own their masters \u2013 we have to decide what music costs and then go collectively to the consumers and say: \u201cThis is how much a loaf of bread costs.\u201d It would be good PR for Spotify: \u201cWe\u2019re going to increase everyone\u2019s subscription by a couple of bucks and instead of us putting those dollars back into our nest, we\u2019re going to distribute that money in an equitable way to the people that create the music.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Pritchard</strong> Spotify is the whipping boy for the whole cultural problem, but compared to other digital platforms that don\u2019t even have the decency to identify themselves as streaming services, it has at least tried to monetise things for artists. The problem lies in the obstructions that lie between the digital service providers and the artists; it\u2019s with the rights holders, it\u2019s with the majors. And they\u2019re all under non-disclosure agreements; you can\u2019t get anywhere with it because you can\u2019t get any straight answers. The consumer doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and they have to know or the change will never happen.</p> <p><strong>Before the pandemic, some advances were being in made in areas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/11/music-festivals-agender-equality-wireless-green-man-slam-dunk-male-lineups\">such as gender imbalance and representation</a>. Is there a danger this will slip off the agenda as the industry focus</strong><strong>es on getting back on its feet?</strong></p> <p><strong>Eyre</strong> I don\u2019t see why it should make any difference. Those conversations shouldn\u2019t be deemed less important while trying to rebuild and make a better future for music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1816349f772828fbe40cd75170799b712dd30193\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1816349f772828fbe40cd75170799b712dd30193/0_565_1997_1198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Murder Capital (McGovern, centre).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Murder Capital (McGovern, centre).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>McGovern</strong> Hopefully it gives people time to get a wider perspective on those things. I always feel like 50-50 lineups \u2026 it\u2019s moving in the right direction, but I think it\u2019s neglecting the major problem of the way women are spoken to from a young age, from their parents and in the classroom, and the way they perceive what a viable career is and what industries they\u2019re welcomed into.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/18/tegan-and-sara-people-never-talk-about-women-and-drug-use-positively\">Tegan and Sara: \u2018People never talk about women and drug use positively\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Quin</strong> What I rarely hear is what we\u2019re going to do with young men to teach them how to be better as adults when they get these jobs, or become members of bands, how they can be better allies, how they can use their power. While it\u2019s lip service to say we\u2019re going to reach gender parity on festivals, I think it\u2019s really in your court, the festival programmers and music programmers. You can tell an eight-year-old girl she can be a mixing engineer or an EDM artist, but if every time we look at a Coachella lineup it\u2019s all men making money on the DJ sets or whatever, it\u2019s hard to inspire young women until those things change.</p> <p><strong>Name one thing you want to change in the music industry after this?</strong></p> <p><strong>Quin</strong> Tegan said she\u2019s thinking about how to make our digital footprint more meaningful and our carbon footprint smaller. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re moving forward. The future is going to require us to do a lot more online interaction and have more connection with our fans in a way we never did before. I want to make sure we\u2019re not doing it out of obligation and just to market things. I want to feel we\u2019re connecting back with an audience we love.</p> <p><strong>Pritchard</strong> More understanding, more transparency across the board: between artists, consumers, digital platforms, government, venues. More mutual support.</p> <p><strong>McGovern</strong> I hope musicians and fans realise how special the live show is and don\u2019t take it for granted ever again. I just hope everyone steps outside of themselves and realises what\u2019s going on around them and how special that connectivity is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff826ca5af5d7a903bf14d1d577d6938458f9f32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff826ca5af5d7a903bf14d1d577d6938458f9f32/0_939_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Garratt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Garratt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Wangner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Eyre</strong> My relationship with my label has shifted because we\u2019re having to communicate over Zoom; the amount of time we\u2019ve saved not having to travel and try and get 15 people in a room! I feel like my label are more engaged than ever because they\u2019ve got more time. I\u2019d like to see a more relaxed energy from major labels about what they\u2019re putting out, not stressing too much about radio plays and streaming. It\u2019s brought it all back to releasing music and seeing what happens.</p> <p><strong>Garratt</strong> I don\u2019t want anyone starting out to make the same mistakes I did. The insane amount of pressure put on young artists to be a finished product before they\u2019ve even started putting their first record out, the expectation from labels, management, journalists \u2013 it\u2019s far too much. If I can speak about that publicly enough to make someone else starting out think smarter, work harder and consider the ethics of their decisions, environmentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically or whatever \u2013 I really hope that happens.</p>",

It\u2019s hard for artists to be front-page news when they\u2019re talking about mass infections at meatpacking plants, or healthcare workers, or the Indigenous population. It\u2019s hard to say: \u201cGuys, what if the folk festival scene breaks down?\u201d I\u2019m sort of being tough love with our community. While I wish the government would swoop down and fix everything, I\u2019m not afraid there\u2019s not going to be a music scene. Some venues will survive and some won\u2019t; the people that survive survive, the people that don\u2019t, they find something in the ashes and build something different. Is there a positive side to this? Quin We were already talking about the climate crisis, the cost of shipping gear and flights, travelling the globe, building this huge production; how long can we sustain that model? I feel inspired as a small business owner to be thinking about what my future business looks like. How can we build something that will thrive? That actually feels really exciting. Garratt It\u2019s really forced me into myself, and I\u2019m not in a great place at the moment, so that hasn\u2019t helped my creativity whatsoever. Being up in [my studio] feels like I\u2019m torturing myself because I\u2019m not necessarily giving a good part of myself. Like Sara, the thing I\u2019ve been really able to thrive in is thinking about how we create new ideas that end up being sustainable whether everyone\u2019s inside or not. McGovern I\u2019ve found myself able to write again and to reconnect with the reason why I started playing music as a child, which was to connect with myself emotionally. Writing full songs over emails doesn\u2019t work for us \u2013 there\u2019s too much of a human element in what we do \u2013 but having the time to spend the entire day coming up with a guitar line or a vocal melody, there\u2019s no immediate pressure from something around you, that\u2019s been interesting. It\u2019s a bleak positive. Eyre When the reality of how long this was going to last settled in, I didn\u2019t want to pressure myself to be creative, but I think by having no pressure I\u2019ve been able to enjoy Zoom writing sessions and have fun with the people I work with regularly. I already had a bunch of songs ready to go; if anything, lockdown has allowed the pressure to be taken off the release of them. There\u2019s no worry about a \u00a370k music video or marketing strategy or how many bloody TikToks, I\u2019ve just enjoyed being able to put music out. The expectation is different. It has allowed everybody to relax and be creative about how we\u2019re presenting stuff and making stuff to keep our fanbases engaged. Do you feel a pressure to constantly create content for your fans? Quin: My hesitation is that it\u2019s a form of labour we do for free that is generating money for Instagram and Facebook and Twitch. I know it\u2019s not cool to be a sell-out and to say you need money and you want your fans to pay for things, but I feel as artists we need to be comfortable being transparent about that. I\u2019m inspired by people doing livestreams and making content, but I don\u2019t feel inspired to do it, because I hate playing concerts to people holding up their cellphones, and I don\u2019t want to play a concert to my cellphone. Garratt: It\u2019s a technical experience, not an emotional one. But I don\u2019t have a choice not to do it because I\u2019m putting an album out and I want as many people to experience it in as honest a way as I can create. I\u2019m lucky in that I can recreate it in the studio pretty accurately, but I would absolutely swap that sofa over there for a couple of warm bodies. McGovern: I don\u2019t turn my nose up at that stuff in any way, but I don\u2019t know how we could achieve it in a way that we would be happy with. There\u2019s no point in doing it if we don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. I\u2019ve seen some great ones though \u2013 I\u2019ve got great comfort from watching James Blake\u2019s Instagram Lives. We live in an age where fans expect to be more directly connected with artists via social media, which can be a fraught relationship. Has lockdown made that relationship better or worse? Eyre: I\u2019ve always had a direct relationship with my fanbase. I was really active on Twitter before Instagram was a thing, and I\u2019m still pretty personable. To be honest, I think that was a mistake on my part early on, because they expect so much more of me now. But I think lockdown is providing a more intimate experience for them \u2013 you\u2019re literally letting fans into your home, you\u2019re wearing the same clothes twice, there\u2019s not a glam team. And in the same way that they\u2019re relying on us to keep them entertained, as an artist I\u2019m sort of relying on them \u2013 the song I released a couple of weeks ago is not a single, I played a demo of it on my [Instagram] story and everyone wanted us to put it out, so we did it just for fun, haven\u2019t pushed it anywhere. I think, ultimately, it\u2019s made us closer. McGovern: I\u2019ve stepped further and further away from it. We did a Tim Burgess Listening Party on Twitter, which was nice, but I\u2019ve actually turned my phone off now. It\u2019s been off for eight to 10 days, and it feels good, to be honest. My attention span wasn\u2019t there to read a novel if I wanted to do that, so I thought: fuck that, I\u2019m going to turn the thing off. I\u2019ve bought a Nokia 105 for when I get out. Spotify has introduced a tip jar for artists \u2013 what are your thoughts? There has been a lot of talk about how unfair to artists the royalty system on streaming services is; is this the time to change it? If so, how? Garratt It\u2019s offensive to artists that are putting the music on that platform and it\u2019s offensive to the consumer. It\u2019s a platform owning up to the fact that there\u2019s an issue, and the Band-Aid they are putting around that issue is to make it the consumer\u2019s problem to fix it. McGovern It\u2019s a load of fucking horseshit. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying: a PR cover-up for a situation where we\u2019re not being paid clearly for having our music on their platform. Quin We don\u2019t ask people to go to the grocery store and make a decision on how much they\u2019re going to spend on a loaf of bread; it costs whatever it costs. Instead of asking consumers to solve the problem, the industry needs to have a reckoning about the way we value music, and that needs to be platform-wide. All the different streaming platforms, the record labels, the publishers, the artists who own their masters \u2013 we have to decide what music costs and then go collectively to the consumers and say: \u201cThis is how much a loaf of bread costs.\u201d It would be good PR for Spotify: \u201cWe\u2019re going to increase everyone\u2019s subscription by a couple of bucks and instead of us putting those dollars back into our nest, we\u2019re going to distribute that money in an equitable way to the people that create the music.\u201d Pritchard Spotify is the whipping boy for the whole cultural problem, but compared to other digital platforms that don\u2019t even have the decency to identify themselves as streaming services, it has at least tried to monetise things for artists. The problem lies in the obstructions that lie between the digital service providers and the artists; it\u2019s with the rights holders, it\u2019s with the majors. And they\u2019re all under non-disclosure agreements; you can\u2019t get anywhere with it because you can\u2019t get any straight answers. The consumer doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and they have to know or the change will never happen. Before the pandemic, some advances were being in made in areas such as gender imbalance and representation. Is there a danger this will slip off the agenda as the industry focuses on getting back on its feet? Eyre I don\u2019t see why it should make any difference. Those conversations shouldn\u2019t be deemed less important while trying to rebuild and make a better future for music. McGovern Hopefully it gives people time to get a wider perspective on those things. I always feel like 50-50 lineups \u2026 it\u2019s moving in the right direction, but I think it\u2019s neglecting the major problem of the way women are spoken to from a young age, from their parents and in the classroom, and the way they perceive what a viable career is and what industries they\u2019re welcomed into. Quin What I rarely hear is what we\u2019re going to do with young men to teach them how to be better as adults when they get these jobs, or become members of bands, how they can be better allies, how they can use their power. While it\u2019s lip service to say we\u2019re going to reach gender parity on festivals, I think it\u2019s really in your court, the festival programmers and music programmers. You can tell an eight-year-old girl she can be a mixing engineer or an EDM artist, but if every time we look at a Coachella lineup it\u2019s all men making money on the DJ sets or whatever, it\u2019s hard to inspire young women until those things change. Name one thing you want to change in the music industry after this? Quin Tegan said she\u2019s thinking about how to make our digital footprint more meaningful and our carbon footprint smaller. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re moving forward. The future is going to require us to do a lot more online interaction and have more connection with our fans in a way we never did before. I want to make sure we\u2019re not doing it out of obligation and just to market things. I want to feel we\u2019re connecting back with an audience we love. Pritchard More understanding, more transparency across the board: between artists, consumers, digital platforms, government, venues. More mutual support. McGovern I hope musicians and fans realise how special the live show is and don\u2019t take it for granted ever again. I just hope everyone steps outside of themselves and realises what\u2019s going on around them and how special that connectivity is. Eyre My relationship with my label has shifted because we\u2019re having to communicate over Zoom; the amount of time we\u2019ve saved not having to travel and try and get 15 people in a room! I feel like my label are more engaged than ever because they\u2019ve got more time. I\u2019d like to see a more relaxed energy from major labels about what they\u2019re putting out, not stressing too much about radio plays and streaming. It\u2019s brought it all back to releasing music and seeing what happens. Garratt I don\u2019t want anyone starting out to make the same mistakes I did. The insane amount of pressure put on young artists to be a finished product before they\u2019ve even started putting their first record out, the expectation from labels, management, journalists \u2013 it\u2019s far too much. If I can speak about that publicly enough to make someone else starting out think smarter, work harder and consider the ethics of their decisions, environmentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically or whatever \u2013 I really hope that happens.",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kongers entered fight or flight mode on Friday, reacting with shock and anger to the Chinese parliament\u2019s push to impose national security laws in the territory. While some vowed to fight against a move they fear will end the international business hub\u2019s autonomy, others planned to flee. China announced on Thursday night that it would \u201cestablish and improve a legal framework and mechanism for safeguarding national security\u201d in Hong Kong by legislating in the National People\u2019s Congress, in effect bypassing the territory\u2019s own legislature. Many in Hong Kong said the announcement was a wake-up call that provided a fresh rallying point for a year-old anti-government movement that has lost its focus and dwindled amid the coronavirus pandemic and widespread despondency over the government\u2019s intensifying clampdown. Some said the law, which is almost certain to pass at China\u2019s rubber-stamp National People\u2019s Congress in coming days, had rekindled their fighting spirit. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the people to wake up. I am glad to see people around me starting to realise that the day has come,\u201d a professional in his 30s who took part in last year\u2019s protests told the Guardian. \u201cCome what may Hong Kongers won\u2019t give up. This will only radicalise many of the rational type,\u201d one commented in a chat group. \u201cWhile feeling there was nothing we could do but to watch Hong Kong die, this national security law came along and our fighting spirit has been rekindled,\u201d said a post on LIHKG.com, a site popular with protesters in the anti-government movement. China had warned in a 2014 policy white paper that it had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d or \u201ccomprehensive power to rule\u201d over Hong Kong. More recently, in the communique of a key Communist party meeting in November 2019, the Fourth Plenum, Beijing told the city to \u201cperfect\u201d its legal system to safeguard national security. Lau Siu-kai, a vice-president of the central government\u2019s top thinktank on Hong Kong, told a radio programme on Friday that the Chinese government had \u201cno faith at all\u201d in Hong Kong\u2019s ability to legislate a security law to deal with the political crisis and \u201cthe sense of urgency has prompted China to turn around the situation\u201d. The millions-strong, increasingly violent pro-democracy protests of 2019 were sparked by a controversial extradition bill that could have seen individuals sent to China for trial, and shocked Beijing. Seeing Hong Kong\u2019s upheavals as a potential national security threat and insisting that unrest was stirred by \u201cforeign hostile forces\u201d aiming to destabilise China, Beijing has repeatedly made it clear it wants new security legislation passed urgently. Martin Lee, the founder of the Democratic party and a senior barrister who helped draft the Basic Law, was outraged. \u201cHow can the NPC legislate on our behalf? They are totally disregarding the Basic Law and ramming this through.\u201d The Basic Law is Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, and is meant to safeguard its autonomy after the return to Chinese rule. Pro-democracy lawmakers say the move bypasses Hong Kong\u2019s legislative process and spells the end of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy that China promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. The former legislator and veteran pro-democracy activist Lee Cheuk-yan said the draft allowed Beijing to have its own national security bureau in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete disruption of the Hong Kong system of course when they impose a national security organisation in Hong Kong, set up by the Chinese Communist party in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the official start of \u2018one country, one system\u2019,\u201d said Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker. The Democracy party chairman, Wu Chi-wai, said that when China could define what constituted a crime, Hong Kong would be relegated to the role of law enforcer. Some ordinary Hong Kongers say they will urgently look into emigration. \u201cWe\u2019re sure to die. I will find a way to leave, but the most important thing is to send my kids away quick!\u201d said a parent in a chat group. On Friday, there was chaos for the third consecutive week in a key establishment-controlled committee of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, known as LegCo. Pro-democracy legislators crowded the dais, holding placards in protest against Beijing\u2019s declaration. For the third Friday in a row, legislators were physically removed from the room by security guards before the meeting was suspended.",

The president also used a speech to urge American churches to reopen.</p> \n<p>Indonesia has reported 973 new cases, its highest daily number so far.

Many Muslim countries have said they will tighten restrictions this weekend for the end of Ramadan fasting. In Egypt authorities are bringing forward the start of the existing coronavirus curfew by four hours to 5pm, and banning all public transport for six days from Sunday.

It is being seen as a move to fully take control over the territory, wracked by pro-democracy protests for the last year. Critics say it will effectively erase the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that is meant to grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. Under the territory\u2019s constitution, such laws can only be enacted by its own legislature, not imposed from outside. US lawmakers have called it \u201can unprecedented assault against Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-to-propose-controversial-hong-kong-security-measure\">called for the UK and US to retaliate</a> if Beijing goes ahead with the threat, while more protests are brewing in the territory.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Navy base attack \u2018terrorism-related\u2019 \u2013 </strong>A shooting at a Texas military base that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/21/shooting-texas-military-base-terrorism-fbi\">wounded a sailor</a> is being investigated as \u201cterrorism-related\u201d, according to the FBI. The shooter tried to speed through a gate at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on Thursday morning but security personnel put up a barrier in time. The man got out and opened fire, wounding a navy sailor on guard. The shooter was then shot dead by security personnel.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Tiny plastic scourge \u2013 </strong>Microplastic pollution in the oceans is likely to have been vastly underestimated, according to research that suggests there are many more particles than previously thought. Trawling of waters off the coasts of the UK and US found there could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/microplastic-pollution-in-oceans-vastly-underestimated-study\">up to 125 trillion surface particles</a>, against previous estimates of up to 50 trillion. Plastic pollution is known to harm fertility, growth and survival of marine life, and the number of particles may outnumber zooplankton, which underpin the marine food chain and help regulate the global climate.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Johnson drops visa surcharge Hello, Warren Murray with you on a Friday where much of the news is swirling around China. The ruling Communist party has abandoned setting a target for GDP growth for the first time in decades, citing \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead Beijing will \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d, the premier, Li Keqiang, has told the gathered members of the party at the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing today. Boris Johnson has made the first major U-turn of his premiership, announcing that NHS staff and care workers from overseas will no longer have to pay the visa surcharge levied on migrants for receiving health services. The PM had faced intense pressure not only from Labour but within his own ranks. Doctors have welcomed the development. Donald Trump defied requests from company executives and was called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general when he refused to wear a face mask during a visit to a Ford plant in Michigan. The president also used a speech to urge American churches to reopen. Indonesia has reported 973 new cases, its highest daily number so far. Millions of people in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country are preparing to mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations and gatherings. Many Muslim countries have said they will tighten restrictions this weekend for the end of Ramadan fasting. In Egypt authorities are bringing forward the start of the existing coronavirus curfew by four hours to 5pm, and banning all public transport for six days from Sunday. The Palestinian Authority has said a lockdown will be reimposed on the West Bank during the three days of the festival. Authorities in Iran have told people not to travel. Attach yourself to our global live blog for further developments and here are the main points from overnight. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Uproar over Hong Kong law bid \u2013 China\u2019s imposition of new national security laws on Hong Kong will compel the territory to enforce legislation barring subversion, separatism and other acts against the central government, it has emerged one day after Beijing\u2019s surprise announcement. It is being seen as a move to fully take control over the territory, wracked by pro-democracy protests for the last year. Critics say it will effectively erase the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that is meant to grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. Under the territory\u2019s constitution, such laws can only be enacted by its own legislature, not imposed from outside. US lawmakers have called it \u201can unprecedented assault against Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has called for the UK and US to retaliate if Beijing goes ahead with the threat, while more protests are brewing in the territory. * * * Navy base attack \u2018terrorism-related\u2019 \u2013 A shooting at a Texas military base that wounded a sailor is being investigated as \u201cterrorism-related\u201d, according to the FBI. The shooter tried to speed through a gate at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on Thursday morning but security personnel put up a barrier in time. The man got out and opened fire, wounding a navy sailor on guard. The shooter was then shot dead by security personnel. * * * Tiny plastic scourge \u2013 Microplastic pollution in the oceans is likely to have been vastly underestimated, according to research that suggests there are many more particles than previously thought. Trawling of waters off the coasts of the UK and US found there could be up to 125 trillion surface particles, against previous estimates of up to 50 trillion. Plastic pollution is known to harm fertility, growth and survival of marine life, and the number of particles may outnumber zooplankton, which underpin the marine food chain and help regulate the global climate. Another new study has found birds consume hundreds of particles a day via the aquatic insects on which they feed. Coronavirus Extra Another day, another test kit \u2026 this one checks your spit for signs of infection and is due to be trialled on 5,000 key workers in the next fortnight. Alarmingly, Prof Paul Elliott, the Imperial College London scientist leading a major government programme on home testing, thinks the invasive nasal swabbing tests currently used may be failing to detect the virus in up to 30% of cases. To grossly misuse a phrase, \u201ctoo much power disrupts\u201d: some of Britain\u2019s renewable energy generators may be paid to switch off this weekend to avoid overloading the grid, because there is not enough demand to use up all the electricity they are producing. Today in Focus podcast: A return to wilder times Sound recordist Chris Watson shares the birdsong from his English garden, while environmentalist George Monbiot looks at how the pandemic might be an opportunity for rewilding. Lunchtime read: \u2018Live music is special\u2019 \u2013 pop after Covid Festivals are cancelled, livestreams thriving \u2013 so how can music recover? Jack Garratt, Ella Eyre, Sara Quin and more talk gigs, hits and togetherness with Alexis Petridis. Sport England could yet be able to stage their entire men\u2019s international schedule during this coronavirus-affected summer following more positive noises from Cricket Australia about the prospect of sending over a team in September. Several alleged victims of sexual abuse by Yves Jean-Bart, the president of the Haiti Football Federation, say they have received death threats since claims against him were reported. Premiership Rugby\u2019s plan to resume the season at the beginning of July and play the league season to its play-off final conclusion is looking unlikely after a decision to delay a return to training for at least another two weeks. The Premier League will suffer an economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic for \u201cyears to come\u201d, with clubs facing a broadcasting bill of at least \u00a320m even if the season is completed, Manchester United have warned. A compelling new documentary on Lance Armstrong shows the former cyclist has plenty of rage but little regret. And Scottie Pippen has reportedly joined a growing chorus of former Chicago Bulls to take issue with Michael Jordan\u2019s outsized influence on The Last Dance. Business Around 30,000 pubs and restaurants may never reopen when the lockdown ends, according to a poll of the sector, as the coronavirus shock proves the last straw for businesses already suffering from declining trade. The FTSE100 is due to open down sharply this morning after rocky trading in Asia overnight amid mounting uncertainty about Hong Kong\u2019s future.

      "body": "<p>Liz Mitchell was on her laptop in her living room in Eugene, Oregon, when she got the news. Thousands of miles away, on a Taiwanese fishing boat, a fishery observer named Eritara Aati Kaierua had been found dead.</p> \n<p>Details were scant. The ship\u2019s name (Win Far No 636), the dead man\u2019s passport number, and where the boat was now headed: the port of Kiribati, a central Pacific island nation on the equator.</p> \n<p>But for Mitchell, president of the Association of Professional Observers (APO), it was sadly nothing new \u2013 another death, devoid of facts.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve recorded one or two deaths of fishery observers every year since 2015,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cAll with the same outcome: no information.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"169cd14a5c0569f4a7e883e6c5031f7f7c8aaf5d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169cd14a5c0569f4a7e883e6c5031f7f7c8aaf5d/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Mitchell\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Mitchell advocates on behalf of fishery observers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Liz Mitchell</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her non-profit organisation advocates on behalf of this little-known workforce of ocean watchdogs, who have suffered a rash of disappearances and unexplained deaths that experts say is no coincidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe playbook of each disappearance or death is the same. The news leaks out from unofficial sources. The families are told: \u2018We\u2019re looking into it.\u2019 They hear nothing. They express grief and anger and they are overwhelmed with questions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mitchell fired off emails about Kaierua to officials, urging investigators to examine the potential for foul play or medical neglect, and to preserve critical evidence. On 25 March, Kiribati police said a pathologist had found that Kaierua, a 40-year-old father of four, had died from a traumatic brain injury. They were treating his death as murder.</p> \n<p>The tragedy brought the tally of deaths or disappearances at sea among this vulnerable workforce to nine since 2015, including a Ghanaian observer whose disappearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/16/ghana-fisheries-observer-vanishes\">was reported</a> by the Guardian last year.</p> \n<p>Independent fishery observers have one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. They travel aboard fishing vessels, tracking catches \u2013 including any bycatch of endangered species \u2013 in order to preserve fish stocks.

      "bodyText": "Liz Mitchell was on her laptop in her living room in Eugene, Oregon, when she got the news. Thousands of miles away, on a Taiwanese fishing boat, a fishery observer named Eritara Aati Kaierua had been found dead. Details were scant. The ship\u2019s name (Win Far No 636), the dead man\u2019s passport number, and where the boat was now headed: the port of Kiribati, a central Pacific island nation on the equator. But for Mitchell, president of the Association of Professional Observers (APO), it was sadly nothing new \u2013 another death, devoid of facts. \u201cWe\u2019ve recorded one or two deaths of fishery observers every year since 2015,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cAll with the same outcome: no information.\u201d Her non-profit organisation advocates on behalf of this little-known workforce of ocean watchdogs, who have suffered a rash of disappearances and unexplained deaths that experts say is no coincidence. \u201cThe playbook of each disappearance or death is the same. The news leaks out from unofficial sources. The families are told: \u2018We\u2019re looking into it.\u2019 They hear nothing. They express grief and anger and they are overwhelmed with questions.\u201d Mitchell fired off emails about Kaierua to officials, urging investigators to examine the potential for foul play or medical neglect, and to preserve critical evidence. On 25 March, Kiribati police said a pathologist had found that Kaierua, a 40-year-old father of four, had died from a traumatic brain injury. They were treating his death as murder. The tragedy brought the tally of deaths or disappearances at sea among this vulnerable workforce to nine since 2015, including a Ghanaian observer whose disappearance was reported by the Guardian last year. Independent fishery observers have one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. They travel aboard fishing vessels, tracking catches \u2013 including any bycatch of endangered species \u2013 in order to preserve fish stocks. Their job, if done properly, can pit them against hostile crew, particularly if they spot activities such as illegal fishing, trafficking or shark finning. Harassment and intimidation are common. To make matters worse, jurisdictional responsibilities at sea are complex: many ships fish in international waters, or fly the flags of countries reluctant to bring prosecutions. There is no international protocol for investigating the death of an observer. In many cases observers are operating unprotected, according to a report in February by Greenpeace, the APO and the University of New York. They found that none of the 17 regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs, the global institutions in charge of fisheries) have regulations to protect the rights and safety of observers. Only four had a policy on what to do if an observer disappears or dies. Recently, fishing companies have used the coronavirus pandemic to push back against even those scant regulations \u2013 arguing against the need for third-party observers. Following pressure from the US fishing industry, claiming observers carry a threat of infection, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issues temporary waivers on the federal requirement for fishing vessels to carry observers. In an open letter last month, 19 NGOs including Greenpeace and WWF expressed concern about this development, saying any relaxation of monitoring and surveillance of commercial fisheries would allow more illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which already accounts for $23.5bn (\u00a318.8bn) and one in five wild-caught marine fish. The very reason fishery observers are needed \u2013 the difficulty of seeing what happens aboard ships in international waters \u2013 is also what makes them vulnerable.

Preliminary findings of a similar survey for 2017 and 2018 suggest the problem is continuing. \u201cIt is difficult to get a picture of trends at this stage, but I can say harassment is a continuing problem,\u201d says Kevin Bell, a staff lawyer at Peer based in Washington, DC. After reporting a spike in observer sexual assault and harassment claims earlier this year, the NOAA said it was hiring more investigators and victims\u2019 advocates to respond and had introduced a prevention programme.

Already, emissions are climbing: they will be only 4% down on the year if lockdowns are lifted next month.</p> <p>For environmentalists, it may seem tedious to have to explain yet again why it makes economic sense to save the planet \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be an economy without the environment, so if we trash it \u201cgrowth\u201d will cease to have much meaning. But we teeter on the threshold of what could be the greatest depression for centuries. People who are losing their jobs and homes, with only politicians\u2019 promises to put in their bank account, have every right to ask whether now is the time to prioritise the climate \u2013 or couldn\u2019t it wait a year or two while we sort out this catastrophe first?</p> <p>That question has a clear answer: a green recovery can produce higher returns on public spending and create more jobs in both the short term and the long term, compared to the alternative of pouring stimulus cash into the fossil fuel economy.</p> <p>Those findings come from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">study of the potential for a green recovery</a>, based on a survey of finance ministries and central bankers, and a comparison with the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, conducted by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, former World Bank chief economist Lord Stern, and leading economists from Oxford University.</p> <p>After the financial crisis in 2008, calls for a green recovery were partially successful. <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/urgently-needed-global-green-new-deal\">About 16% of the global stimulus spending was green</a>, including subsidies for renewable energy, seed funding for research and development, and new technology such as electric vehicles.</p> <p>That proportion may seem small, and the effects of the rest of the spending \u2013 much of which went on carbon-intensive projects such as concrete construction and coal \u2013 were soon apparent: carbon emissions, which had fallen 1.4%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/31/emissions-rise-un-climate-chief\">rebounded by a record amount</a> of nearly 6% in 2010.</p> <p>Yet the green stimulus bore fruit. Renewable energy expanded, and the cost of wind and solar power fell far faster than predicted, to the point where both forms of power are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/wind-and-solar-plants-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-all-big-markets-around-world-analysis-finds\">competitive with fossil fuel generation</a>, without the need for subsidy.</p> <p>If that was possible from just 16% of stimulus spending, what could be done if the proportions were reversed? We are much better prepared to create green jobs now, according to the Oxford study. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">Shovel-ready projects</a>, from insulating homes to widening cycle lanes, abound. Electric vehicle charging points are needed around the world, and the slack in public transport can be used to upgrade rail networks.</p> <p>Car companies, with government incentives, could hasten the move from petrol and diesel engines. The renewable energy industry has progressed in the last decade, making home solar installation cheap and offshore wind farms viable. All of these are labour intensive and would provide quick returns on taxpayer cash.</p> <p>There are fledgling industries that could soar with a government boost. Fatih Birol, the widely respected executive director of the International Energy Agency, points to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/hydrogen-is-the-energy-future\">hydrogen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/14/on-the-charge-why-batteries-are-the-future-of-clean-energy\">batteries</a> as two major areas \u201cnow ready for the big time\u201d.

It must be factored into the coronavirus recovery | Pradeep Philip and Will Rayward-Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If governments get it right, the structural changes needed to bring emissions to net zero in the next 30 years will come with a gain in jobs and security. But more needs to be done to ensure that people see the positive, rather than associate falling emissions with falling prosperity. Much of the public discussion so far has focused on attaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/un-chief-dont-use-taxpayer-money-to-save-polluting-industries\">\u201cgreen strings\u201d to bailouts</a> for established industries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">airlines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/us-fossil-fuel-companies-coronavirus-bailout-oil-coal-fracking-giants-bond-scheme\">fossil fuels</a> and car manufacturing. Those are certainly needed \u2013 as the failure to attach conditions after the 2008 crisis clearly shows \u2013 but can seem like punishing industries already on their knees. Workers on airlines and in shale fields are workers too, with mortgages to pay and families to care for. Shrugging off the loss of their jobs as the casualties of a cleaner future is not good enough: there must be a clear path to high-quality alternatives.</p> <p>After the financial crisis, capital did not reel for long \u2013 the initiative was soon recaptured by austerity advocates and increasingly by populists who persuaded voters in many countries that the rollback of the state was the price of fiscal stability. The same forces are still in place: Donald Trump\u2019s White House has already seized the excuse to repeal dozens of regulations on clean air and water, threatening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/earth-day-50-years-anniversary-environment-trump\">reverse environmental protections to a pre-Nixon state</a>. If things are to be different this time, people need reassurance on jobs above all, and hymns to nature must be sung to the backing hum of industry.</p> <ul> <li><p>Fiona Harvey is the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent</p></li> </ul>",

At the same time, the global economy plunged 6% and half the global workforce now face the loss of their livelihoods, says the International Labour Organisation. Getting people back to work will mean rapidly rising carbon emissions, as it did after the financial crisis of 2008, unless strong action is taken by governments. Already, emissions are climbing: they will be only 4% down on the year if lockdowns are lifted next month. For environmentalists, it may seem tedious to have to explain yet again why it makes economic sense to save the planet \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be an economy without the environment, so if we trash it \u201cgrowth\u201d will cease to have much meaning. But we teeter on the threshold of what could be the greatest depression for centuries. People who are losing their jobs and homes, with only politicians\u2019 promises to put in their bank account, have every right to ask whether now is the time to prioritise the climate \u2013 or couldn\u2019t it wait a year or two while we sort out this catastrophe first? That question has a clear answer: a green recovery can produce higher returns on public spending and create more jobs in both the short term and the long term, compared to the alternative of pouring stimulus cash into the fossil fuel economy. Those findings come from a study of the potential for a green recovery, based on a survey of finance ministries and central bankers, and a comparison with the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, conducted by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, former World Bank chief economist Lord Stern, and leading economists from Oxford University. After the financial crisis in 2008, calls for a green recovery were partially successful. About 16% of the global stimulus spending was green, including subsidies for renewable energy, seed funding for research and development, and new technology such as electric vehicles. That proportion may seem small, and the effects of the rest of the spending \u2013 much of which went on carbon-intensive projects such as concrete construction and coal \u2013 were soon apparent: carbon emissions, which had fallen 1.4%, rebounded by a record amount of nearly 6% in 2010. Yet the green stimulus bore fruit. Renewable energy expanded, and the cost of wind and solar power fell far faster than predicted, to the point where both forms of power are now competitive with fossil fuel generation, without the need for subsidy. If that was possible from just 16% of stimulus spending, what could be done if the proportions were reversed? We are much better prepared to create green jobs now, according to the Oxford study. Shovel-ready projects, from insulating homes to widening cycle lanes, abound. Electric vehicle charging points are needed around the world, and the slack in public transport can be used to upgrade rail networks. Car companies, with government incentives, could hasten the move from petrol and diesel engines. The renewable energy industry has progressed in the last decade, making home solar installation cheap and offshore wind farms viable. All of these are labour intensive and would provide quick returns on taxpayer cash. There are fledgling industries that could soar with a government boost. Fatih Birol, the widely respected executive director of the International Energy Agency, points to hydrogen and batteries as two major areas \u201cnow ready for the big time\u201d. Hydrogen, in the form of ammonia, will be key to decarbonising shipping, but take-up has been slow due to lack of investment. If governments get it right, the structural changes needed to bring emissions to net zero in the next 30 years will come with a gain in jobs and security. But more needs to be done to ensure that people see the positive, rather than associate falling emissions with falling prosperity. Much of the public discussion so far has focused on attaching \u201cgreen strings\u201d to bailouts for established industries such as airlines, fossil fuels and car manufacturing. Those are certainly needed \u2013 as the failure to attach conditions after the 2008 crisis clearly shows \u2013 but can seem like punishing industries already on their knees. Workers on airlines and in shale fields are workers too, with mortgages to pay and families to care for. Shrugging off the loss of their jobs as the casualties of a cleaner future is not good enough: there must be a clear path to high-quality alternatives. After the financial crisis, capital did not reel for long \u2013 the initiative was soon recaptured by austerity advocates and increasingly by populists who persuaded voters in many countries that the rollback of the state was the price of fiscal stability. The same forces are still in place: Donald Trump\u2019s White House has already seized the excuse to repeal dozens of regulations on clean air and water, threatening to reverse environmental protections to a pre-Nixon state. If things are to be different this time, people need reassurance on jobs above all, and hymns to nature must be sung to the backing hum of industry.

      "bodyText": "More than 15 parties, including high-profile philanthropists, have come forward to offer their support to beleaguered Sydney arts institution Carriageworks as administrators assess the future of the company. Carriageworks\u2019 administrators KPMG held the first creditors meeting this week since the organisation went into voluntary administration on 4 May after suffering an \u201cirreparable\u201d loss of income due to the shutdown of non-essential services throughout New South Wales thanks to the coronavirus crisis. The multi-arts organisation owes more than $2m to more than 140 creditors, according to documents made available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The list of creditors include some of Australia\u2019s most high-profile arts companies, such as Tasmanian museum and arts organisation Mona, Sydney Theatre Company, the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, and Indigenous performing arts organisations Marrugeku and Moogahlin. The Sydney billionaire Kerr Neilson and his daughter, Paris, have come out as members of a confidential cohort of potential funders that would help to get the organisation back on its feet as part of a bailout deal. \u201cThe vision has to come from the management and board. We are simply interested in ensuring the country has as much exposure to \u2018art\u2019 as is practicable,\u201d Neilson told Nine newspapers on Friday. Geoff Ainsworth and partner Johanna Featherstone, who have a long history of giving to the arts and particularly the visual arts sector in NSW, are also rumoured to have pledged substantial donations. The reports follow news in the wake of Carriageworks\u2019 collapse that the NSW government was considering a proposal to pass management of the space to the Opera House Trust. The board is \u201cactively working on\u201d a deed of company arrangement, the administrators noted at this week\u2019s meeting, which will involve the company receiving an injection of funds from philanthropists \u2013 and some government goodwill. One of the biggest stumbling blocks for Carriageworks\u2019 long-term security is its precarious month-by-month lease arrangement for the historic Eveleigh rail yards. Carriageworks had been in negotiations with the NSW government\u2019s arts funding body Create NSW \u2013 through which Carriageworks subleases the site from Transport NSW \u2013 for a formal long-term arrangement \u201cfor some time\u201d, the administrators noted, but no documentation or concrete agreement had been reached before the company went into administration. Carriageworks is home to eight resident arts companies whose leases are tied to Carriageworks\u2019 lease. Resident companies are also on rolling month-by-month leases, and in some cases have been for years. All of the philanthropists\u2019 offered funding is contingent upon Create NSW granting Carriageworks a long-term lease. This week, those resident companies made a joint statement calling for Carriageworks to remain an independent institution, and saying it needed a \u201cfinely tuned balance to maintain vital support for our local and national arts ecology\u201d. Create NSW also provides core funding of $2.53m annually to Carriageworks. The decision to go into voluntary administration was made in part due to uncertainty over when the next injection of government funding would occur. Carriageworks owes $432,000 in leave and superannuation entitlements to its 42 permanent and more than 90 casual staff. Many of those casual staff were told in a letter on 8 May, seen by Guardian Australia, that as the company had stood them down and had not paid them for the month of April, they would not be eligible to receive jobkeeper payments. Twelve staff remain employed on a part-time basis while the company goes through the administration process. The next creditors meeting, including a comprehensive report from the company\u2019s administrators, will be held by 9 June.",

      "body": "<p>Even the man who turned back time eventually ran out of it, denied the perfect farewell by a hip that needs replacing and a virus that has stopped everything. There is something cruel about the way it came to a close, and in what lies before him, but when he announced his retirement on Wednesday Aritz Aduriz had a message for everyone: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p> <p>In the midst of a situation \u201cfar more serious, far more painful\u201d that has caused \u201cirreparable damage\u201d, this doesn\u2019t matter, he said. And yet it does, if any of it does \u2013 that recurring theme of these past two months. Not least as a symbol of the pandemic, how it reaches everything. Of football\u2019s reach too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/far-from-the-gladdening-crowd-live-sport-is-our-collective-therapy\">what it means</a>, way beyond the medals and the money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/aritz-aduriz-announces-retirement-athletic-bilbao-prosthetic-hip\">Aritz Aduriz announces retirement and says he will have to get prosthetic hip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, doctors had told Aduriz he urgently needs an operation. He will have a prosthetic joint fitted \u2013 \u201cto be able to deal with daily life as normally as possible\u201d. He is 39. Very old for a footballer; very, very young for a hip replacement. He had resisted retirement for a long time, but he was finally due to call it a day at the end of this season. Instead, he has to stop now, at a time when stadiums stand silent. He has played 780 games, scored 285 goals and not won a major trophy, although the 2015 Spanish Super Cup \u2013 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/14/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-spanish-super-cup\">he scored a hat-trick against Barcelona</a> as the club won its first title of any kind in 30 years \u2013 certainly felt like one on the streets of Bilbao.</p> <p>Aduriz had one last chance, a dream that occupied him daily. Athletic Club had reached the Copa del Rey final. There, they would play against their Basque rivals Real Sociedad from Donostia, the city where Aduriz grew up. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/02/sport-as-song-and-song-as-sport-a-night-at-the-basque-derby-athletic-bilbao-real-sociedad-la-liga-sid-lowe\">The derby is special</a> \u2013 two clubs with a unique identity, culture and community, fans mixed together \u2013 and this was going to be the first time they had met in a cup final. And, after 20 years playing football, Aduriz\u2019s last game, his goodbye. It was perfect, as if scripted. It was not to be.</p> <p>\u201cThe time has come; I have said many times that football leaves you before you can leave it,\u201d Aduriz wrote. \u201cSadly, my body has said: enough. I can\u2019t help my teammates as I would like and as they deserve. That\u2019s the life of a professional sportsman. Simple, very simple.\u201d</p> <p>Only his career has not been simple. When he was young he surfed, snowboarded, climbed mountains and skied so well that he was runner-up in the national cross-country championships, but what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/03/aritz-aduriz-better-age-athletic-bilbao\">he really wanted was to play football</a>. As a kid he played at the local youth club Antiguoko, alongside Andoni Iraola, Mikel Arteta and the Alonso brothers, Xabi and Mikel, joining Athletic at 19. He made his B-team debut in 2000, and his first-team debut against Barcelona in 2002. And the rest, as they say, is history. Eighteen years on, he was still there.</p> <p>Not exactly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"910dc4c200a07d3c95b5fa5273eea27acf7ba652\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/910dc4c200a07d3c95b5fa5273eea27acf7ba652/0_0_3000_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aritz Aduriz dribbles past Real Madrid\u2019s Sergio Ramos during their Copa Del Rey game in January 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aritz Aduriz dribbles past Real Madrid\u2019s Sergio Ramos during their Copa Del Rey game in January 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He played three times and then was gone: to Burgos, then Valladolid. He returned in 2006 but within two years he had left again. I\u201cIt pissed me off to have to leave,\u201d he admitted, but the decision wasn\u2019t his. It hurt to depart unwillingly and when he returned in 2012 he was determined to make up for those lost years, to rebel, to resist. To <em>stay</em>. Trouble is, he was 31.</p> <p>\u201cAge is just a number,\u201d he said. And the numbers were actually improving. He arrived having scored seven league goals for Valencia the previous season and 10 the year before that. At Mallorca, he scored 12 and 11. And yet his league totals since his return read: 14, 16, 18, 20. He had played once for Spain without scoring, in 2010. In 2016 and 2017 he was recalled and played 12 times. At 35 years, 275 days he is the oldest scorer in the history of the national team. He retires having scored 66% of his first division goals over the age of 30.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee9201437fcd6e8d90e523a6e99dd082a9712a0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9201437fcd6e8d90e523a6e99dd082a9712a0f/0_288_5096_3058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s Ariz Aduriz celebrates after scoring the fourth goal against Macedonia during the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Macedonia in November 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s Ariz Aduriz (centre) celebrates after scoring the fourth goal against Macedonia during the 2018 World Cup qualifier in November 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Angel Molina/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have never seen this,\u201d said his then manager Ernesto Valverde. \u201cUsually you think: \u2018He\u2019s 35, he has to drop at same stage,\u2019 but you look at him and you just don\u2019t want the league to finish ever. He\u2019s incredible.\u201d Vicente del Bosque described him as \u201can exceptional case, unique\u201d. His current manager Gaizka Garitano called him a \u201ccompetitive animal\u201d. At perhaps the most iconic home in Spanish football, he became the biggest icon of them all.</p> <p>He did slow: next came 16 league goals, then nine. Last year, hip injury taking hold, it was only two. Athletic struggled against what would have been the first relegation in their history and he said he felt \u201cresponsible\u201d because he had not been able to help. He considered walking away while he could still walk, but wanted one more season to leave the right way. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring the curtain down like that,\u201d he said. Instead, he was all set up to bring down the curtain like this. A Copa del Rey final, a Basque derby. It was as if he had chosen his moment, managed time once more.</p> <p>And then came coronavirus. Time expanded too far even for him. The final, scheduled for April, was postponed like everything else. Only it wasn\u2019t like everything else. Plans were made to bring back the league without fans but Athletic and Real Sociedad came together to announce that when it came to the cup final they preferred to wait as long as it took. Even if it had to be next year, even if they had to forfeit a potential European place. This was a match that couldn\u2019t be played without supporters.

      "bodyText": "Even the man who turned back time eventually ran out of it, denied the perfect farewell by a hip that needs replacing and a virus that has stopped everything. There is something cruel about the way it came to a close, and in what lies before him, but when he announced his retirement on Wednesday Aritz Aduriz had a message for everyone: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d In the midst of a situation \u201cfar more serious, far more painful\u201d that has caused \u201cirreparable damage\u201d, this doesn\u2019t matter, he said. And yet it does, if any of it does \u2013 that recurring theme of these past two months. Not least as a symbol of the pandemic, how it reaches everything. Of football\u2019s reach too, what it means, way beyond the medals and the money. On Tuesday, doctors had told Aduriz he urgently needs an operation. He will have a prosthetic joint fitted \u2013 \u201cto be able to deal with daily life as normally as possible\u201d. He is 39. Very old for a footballer; very, very young for a hip replacement. He had resisted retirement for a long time, but he was finally due to call it a day at the end of this season. Instead, he has to stop now, at a time when stadiums stand silent. He has played 780 games, scored 285 goals and not won a major trophy, although the 2015 Spanish Super Cup \u2013 when he scored a hat-trick against Barcelona as the club won its first title of any kind in 30 years \u2013 certainly felt like one on the streets of Bilbao. Aduriz had one last chance, a dream that occupied him daily. Athletic Club had reached the Copa del Rey final. There, they would play against their Basque rivals Real Sociedad from Donostia, the city where Aduriz grew up. The derby is special \u2013 two clubs with a unique identity, culture and community, fans mixed together \u2013 and this was going to be the first time they had met in a cup final. And, after 20 years playing football, Aduriz\u2019s last game, his goodbye. It was perfect, as if scripted. It was not to be. \u201cThe time has come; I have said many times that football leaves you before you can leave it,\u201d Aduriz wrote. \u201cSadly, my body has said: enough. I can\u2019t help my teammates as I would like and as they deserve. That\u2019s the life of a professional sportsman. Simple, very simple.\u201d Only his career has not been simple. When he was young he surfed, snowboarded, climbed mountains and skied so well that he was runner-up in the national cross-country championships, but what he really wanted was to play football. As a kid he played at the local youth club Antiguoko, alongside Andoni Iraola, Mikel Arteta and the Alonso brothers, Xabi and Mikel, joining Athletic at 19. He made his B-team debut in 2000, and his first-team debut against Barcelona in 2002. And the rest, as they say, is history. Eighteen years on, he was still there. Not exactly. He played three times and then was gone: to Burgos, then Valladolid. He returned in 2006 but within two years he had left again. I\u201cIt pissed me off to have to leave,\u201d he admitted, but the decision wasn\u2019t his. It hurt to depart unwillingly and when he returned in 2012 he was determined to make up for those lost years, to rebel, to resist. To stay. Trouble is, he was 31. \u201cAge is just a number,\u201d he said. And the numbers were actually improving. He arrived having scored seven league goals for Valencia the previous season and 10 the year before that. At Mallorca, he scored 12 and 11. And yet his league totals since his return read: 14, 16, 18, 20. He had played once for Spain without scoring, in 2010. In 2016 and 2017 he was recalled and played 12 times. At 35 years, 275 days he is the oldest scorer in the history of the national team. He retires having scored 66% of his first division goals over the age of 30. \u201cI have never seen this,\u201d said his then manager Ernesto Valverde. \u201cUsually you think: \u2018He\u2019s 35, he has to drop at same stage,\u2019 but you look at him and you just don\u2019t want the league to finish ever. He\u2019s incredible.\u201d Vicente del Bosque described him as \u201can exceptional case, unique\u201d. His current manager Gaizka Garitano called him a \u201ccompetitive animal\u201d. At perhaps the most iconic home in Spanish football, he became the biggest icon of them all. He did slow: next came 16 league goals, then nine. Last year, hip injury taking hold, it was only two. Athletic struggled against what would have been the first relegation in their history and he said he felt \u201cresponsible\u201d because he had not been able to help. He considered walking away while he could still walk, but wanted one more season to leave the right way. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring the curtain down like that,\u201d he said. Instead, he was all set up to bring down the curtain like this. A Copa del Rey final, a Basque derby. It was as if he had chosen his moment, managed time once more. And then came coronavirus. Time expanded too far even for him. The final, scheduled for April, was postponed like everything else. Only it wasn\u2019t like everything else. Plans were made to bring back the league without fans but Athletic and Real Sociedad came together to announce that when it came to the cup final they preferred to wait as long as it took. Even if it had to be next year, even if they had to forfeit a potential European place. This was a match that couldn\u2019t be played without supporters. The final would mean little without them. It was one that couldn\u2019t be played without Aduriz, either. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I would like more than to be able to play the final,\u201d he said. Athletic made plans to extend his contract for as long as it took to cover the final \u2013 even if it was just for him to run on for a minute at the end.

We may never know the true nationality of \u201cpatient zero\u201d in Europe. And it doesn\u2019t much matter, because the true patient zero in our continent is Europe itself.</p> <p>From the first detection of the virus on European territory, Europe has been in a coma.</p> <p>Long lockdowns and home confinement concealed the gravity of the patient\u2019s condition. With the freedom to move around even within countries taken away, few dared to cross borders. Now, as countries ease restrictive measures, Europe\u2019s true state of health is becoming clear.</p> <p>This is a dystopian outcome for millions of EU citizens who live in \u2013 or regularly commute to \u2013 another EU member state. With only a handful of countries reopening their borders, an unprecedented patchwork of national restrictions, including border controls and quarantine rules, continues to make travel across the continent practically impossible. After weeks of home confinement, many of us remain trapped in our country of residence or in that of origin, unable to cross borders again. Some of us can\u2019t visit families, rejoin their loved ones, go to their places of work, or even get home.</p> <p>While EU member states have the legal right temporarily to reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public protection, and to lift them again, their decisions \u2013 as the French president Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2020/03/12/adresse-aux-francais\">pledged</a> \u2013 \u201cmust be taken as Europeans, at the European level, because it\u2019s at this level that we\u2019ve constructed our freedoms and protections\u201d.</p> <p>Yet despite <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_freemovement.pdf\">a timid attempt</a> by the European commission to coordinate the reopening of unrestricted cross-border movement within the union, the Schengen common-travel area remains in limbo, along with the lives of millions of EU citizens. If restrictions are easing, borders are not falling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/how-coronavirus-is-reshaping-europe-in-dangerous-ways\">How coronavirus is reshaping Europe in dangerous ways</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most EU countries maintain controls and quarantine regulations on new entrants. As <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/spain-restricts-arrivals-from-schengen-imposes-14-days-quarantine/\">Spain imposes 14 days quarantine on all arrivals</a>, including those from the Schengen area, France reciprocates by imposing it on all arrivals from Spain. Denmark is opening its borders to Germany, but <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20200515/danish-parties-ready-to-reopen-border-to-germany-but-not-to-sweden\">not to Sweden</a> \u2013 despite Sweden\u2019s southernmost region having a lower infection than across the Oresund bridge in Copenhagen.</p> <p>This chaotic mosaic of measures not only lacks any solid health justification \u2013 as repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak\">stated</a> by the WHO \u2013 but also contradicts what the European Union is about.</p> <p>EU citizens have the right to the same legal treatment across the union, free from any form of discrimination. So when France imposes mandatory quarantine on those arriving from Spain, but not from other countries, it is actually discriminating among EU citizens. This is equally true for Portugal whose borders are <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/portugal-to-help-emigrants-to-return-for-summer-vacations/\">selectively reopening</a> vis-a-vis \u201cthose countries with the greatest number of Portuguese\u201d. A similar discriminatory pattern also exists in Hungary which <a href=\"https://konzuliszolgalat.kormany.hu/information-on-hungarian-entry-requirements-due-to-covid-19-situation\">exempts</a> from its border controls the nationals of the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Austria, and Slovakia. Proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/what-is-the-future-for-travel-and-immigration-in-age-of-covid-19\">travel bubbles</a>, such as the Baltic bubble \u2013 allowing free travel between across the three Baltic countries also raise discriminatory concerns.</p> <p>Letting EU countries re-establish borders was wrong in the first place. Border controls \u2013 as well as selective quarantine regimes \u2013 reflect an artificial, misleading attempt at resorting to nationality as the dividing line between the healthy and unhealthy. The nation state is not the right geographical or administrative unit with which to counter a virus that is not only borderless, but also doesn\u2019t spread uniformly within any country\u2019s territory. That\u2019s why the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_freemovement.pdf\">recommended</a> lifting restrictions \u201cin areas with a comparable epidemiological situation\u201d \u2013 in other words regions, not countries.</p> <p>Ultimately the maintenance of border checks reveals an alarming lack of trust among EU countries, instigated by provisional data that lacks any comparability on how each of them handled the pandemic. Unwinding these different national measures will take some time and leave scars on \u201cpatient Europe\u201d.

      "bodyText": "They said he was German, others Italian, but then again he might have been French. We may never know the true nationality of \u201cpatient zero\u201d in Europe. And it doesn\u2019t much matter, because the true patient zero in our continent is Europe itself. From the first detection of the virus on European territory, Europe has been in a coma. Long lockdowns and home confinement concealed the gravity of the patient\u2019s condition. With the freedom to move around even within countries taken away, few dared to cross borders. Now, as countries ease restrictive measures, Europe\u2019s true state of health is becoming clear. This is a dystopian outcome for millions of EU citizens who live in \u2013 or regularly commute to \u2013 another EU member state. With only a handful of countries reopening their borders, an unprecedented patchwork of national restrictions, including border controls and quarantine rules, continues to make travel across the continent practically impossible. After weeks of home confinement, many of us remain trapped in our country of residence or in that of origin, unable to cross borders again. Some of us can\u2019t visit families, rejoin their loved ones, go to their places of work, or even get home. While EU member states have the legal right temporarily to reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public protection, and to lift them again, their decisions \u2013 as the French president Emmanuel Macron pledged \u2013 \u201cmust be taken as Europeans, at the European level, because it\u2019s at this level that we\u2019ve constructed our freedoms and protections\u201d. Yet despite a timid attempt by the European commission to coordinate the reopening of unrestricted cross-border movement within the union, the Schengen common-travel area remains in limbo, along with the lives of millions of EU citizens. If restrictions are easing, borders are not falling. Most EU countries maintain controls and quarantine regulations on new entrants. As Spain imposes 14 days quarantine on all arrivals, including those from the Schengen area, France reciprocates by imposing it on all arrivals from Spain. Denmark is opening its borders to Germany, but not to Sweden \u2013 despite Sweden\u2019s southernmost region having a lower infection than across the Oresund bridge in Copenhagen. This chaotic mosaic of measures not only lacks any solid health justification \u2013 as repeatedly stated by the WHO \u2013 but also contradicts what the European Union is about. EU citizens have the right to the same legal treatment across the union, free from any form of discrimination. So when France imposes mandatory quarantine on those arriving from Spain, but not from other countries, it is actually discriminating among EU citizens. This is equally true for Portugal whose borders are selectively reopening vis-a-vis \u201cthose countries with the greatest number of Portuguese\u201d. A similar discriminatory pattern also exists in Hungary which exempts from its border controls the nationals of the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Austria, and Slovakia. Proposed travel bubbles, such as the Baltic bubble \u2013 allowing free travel between across the three Baltic countries also raise discriminatory concerns. Letting EU countries re-establish borders was wrong in the first place. Border controls \u2013 as well as selective quarantine regimes \u2013 reflect an artificial, misleading attempt at resorting to nationality as the dividing line between the healthy and unhealthy. The nation state is not the right geographical or administrative unit with which to counter a virus that is not only borderless, but also doesn\u2019t spread uniformly within any country\u2019s territory. That\u2019s why the EU recommended lifting restrictions \u201cin areas with a comparable epidemiological situation\u201d \u2013 in other words regions, not countries. Ultimately the maintenance of border checks reveals an alarming lack of trust among EU countries, instigated by provisional data that lacks any comparability on how each of them handled the pandemic. Unwinding these different national measures will take some time and leave scars on \u201cpatient Europe\u201d. As such, they risk fuelling nationalist sentiments that were diluted by decades of European integration. As the summer approaches, the reopening of Schengen is driven more by the urge to let holidaymakers and tourists spend money than the need to ensure that EU citizens can pursue cross-border lives. But a border-free Europe is not the prerogative of tourists and interrail travellers. Free movement is an existential precondition for millions of citizens living, commuting, parenting and therefore regularly travelling between jurisdictions. The aim should not be the return to the status quo but to update and strengthen the travel-free zone to avoid it being suspended again. We Europeans were sold a dream.

As the European dream is abruptly interrupted, we don\u2019t even know when, how and from whom to reclaim it. This suggests that behind the health and financial crisis caused by Covid-19 lies a deeper and overlooked democratic emergency. After 70 years of unprecedented socio-economic interdependence, no national politician \u2013 not even among EU leaders \u2013 is accountable either to citizens living beyond their own countries\u2019 borders or to EU \u201cmobile\u201d citizens, those who exercise their right to move countries, who lack political representation. It is telling that virtually no national or EU leader has lived the European dream by experiencing it herself. Being the product of national electoral processes, our political representatives systematically lack a \u201cEuropean reflex\u201d even when facing pan-European challenges. This might have already cost lives, and it has certainly damaged livelihoods. Not to mention the impact on the European project itself. Yet, there\u2019s hope.

He didn\u2019t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting Space Force, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn\u2019t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss.\u2019</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/21/the-empire-strikes-back-at-40-star-wars-saga\">The Empire Strikes Back at 40: did the Star Wars saga peak too early?</a></h2> <p>\u2018The original Star Wars followed through on the commercial promise of Jaws, but it was this sequel that set the standard for the decade where the model changed forever. To watch that breathless sequence of events on Hoth now is to see a combination of efficiency and spectacle that blockbusters have been chasing ever since \u2013 rarely with the same success.\u2019</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/21/my-favourite-game-bobby-moore-displays-his-brilliance-against-brazil\">My favourite game: Bobby Moore displays his brilliance against Brazil</a></h2> <p>\u2018Another full viewing makes clear the outstanding performance was Moore\u2019s \u2013 all the more remarkable given, as team-mate Alan Mullery recalled, he \u201clooked like death warmed up and had almost lost a stone\u201d on his arrival in Mexico.\u2019</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/21/fifteen-years-on-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-ewan-mcgregor\">Fifteen years on, how does Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith stand up?</a></h2> <p>\u2018Instead of eliciting horror and awe, the final scene in which we see what remains of Anakin\u2019s ravaged torso encased in the infamous \u201cmini-Darth armour\u201d evokes only scorn. It is impossible to believe that this callow whinger has any relation to the iconic villain of the original trilogy.\u2019</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/21/10-best-chance-encounters-readers-travel-memories-tips\">10 of the best chance encounters: readers\u2019 travel memories</a></h2> <p>\u2018I helped a group through check-in en route to Bologna. On landing, one thanked me and asked my plans. My mum and I had none, aside from ambling around Emilia-Romagna. Massimo Bottura, then proprietor of the world\u2019s top restaurant, proceeded to piece together an itinerary of his favourite spots to eat and drink in the region, calling ahead and making sure we were looked after like locals at each turn.\u2019</p> <h2>6.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/ive-never-seen-doctor-zhivago\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/21/lance-armstrong-documentary-espn-doping-cycling-tour-de-france\">In a new documentary, Lance Armstrong shows plenty of rage but little regret</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018The casual violence, the callous disregard for rules and the feelings of others: Armstrong did not come to any of these late in life, once his course as a professional cyclist was set. He was practically marinating in insensitivity from the womb. Born into a rotten system, Armstrong stayed rotten.\u2019</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/21/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-clothes-keys-to-coaching-team-talks-kick-it-out\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: on clothes, the keys to coaching and Liverpool team talks</a></h2> <p>\u2018With the clock ticking Klopp is asked for two more tips. \u201cIf you are really ambitious you have to understand the game,\u201d he says. \u201cThe interesting fact with football is pretty much everybody thinks he is an expert. It\u2019s a nice game, a simple game. But it\u2019s not easy. That\u2019s why so many people think they understand it but stop so early.\u201d\u2019</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/21/lorena-amazon-documentary-about-the-notorious-bobbitt-case-is-a-1990s-time-capsule\">Lorena: Amazon documentary about the notorious Bobbitt case is a 1990s time capsule</a></h2> <p>\u2018The horrific details of anal rape, beatings and police call-outs, as recounted with sensitivity in this documentary, were sidelined by the media in favour of lurid accounts of John Wayne\u2019s emasculation. Up until this trial, it wasn\u2019t polite to even commit the word \u201cpenis\u201d to print, but early media references to John Wayne\u2019s \u201corgan\u201d were soon replaced by the correct anatomical word \u2013 a moment that was, in itself, a cultural watershed.\u2019</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/21/ive-never-seen-sleepless-in-seattle\">I\u2019ve never seen \u2026 Sleepless in Seattle</a></h2> <p>\u2018How is it so sad, but so happy? It takes the avatar for Hollywood\u2019s hope \u2013 Tom Hanks \u2013 but makes him jaded and completely resigned to a future without love. It takes the sparky Meg Ryan and places her with a fiance who is \u2026 well, fine. Yet, it is the balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism that underpins every word of Ephron\u2019s gorgeous screenplay.\u2019</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/21/mussolinis-war-by-john-gooch-review-fascist-dreams-of-the-1930s-and-40s\">Mussolini\u2019s War by John Gooch review \u2013 fascist dreams of the 1930s and 40s</a></h2> <p>\u2018Over much of Gooch\u2019s long and fascinating book hangs Mussolini\u2019s personality. By turn gungho and monosyllabic, truculent and cheerful, he changed his senior soldiers around, issued orders and then cancelled them, committing Italy to battles she could not win. Gooch is skilful at carrying his narrative forward, through painful campaigns and quixotic tactics, through advances and retreats, victories and losses.\u2019</p> <h2>How we create the antidote</h2> <p>Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

      "bodyText": "1. John Malkovich: \u2018I had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?\u2019 \u2018I first interviewed him 27 years ago when he had just made In the Line of Fire \u2013 a thriller in which he plays an assassin determined to kill the president (and which is one of his classics). He didn\u2019t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting Space Force, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn\u2019t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss.\u2019 2. The Empire Strikes Back at 40: did the Star Wars saga peak too early? \u2018The original Star Wars followed through on the commercial promise of Jaws, but it was this sequel that set the standard for the decade where the model changed forever. To watch that breathless sequence of events on Hoth now is to see a combination of efficiency and spectacle that blockbusters have been chasing ever since \u2013 rarely with the same success.\u2019 3. My favourite game: Bobby Moore displays his brilliance against Brazil \u2018Another full viewing makes clear the outstanding performance was Moore\u2019s \u2013 all the more remarkable given, as team-mate Alan Mullery recalled, he \u201clooked like death warmed up and had almost lost a stone\u201d on his arrival in Mexico.\u2019 4. Fifteen years on, how does Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith stand up? \u2018Instead of eliciting horror and awe, the final scene in which we see what remains of Anakin\u2019s ravaged torso encased in the infamous \u201cmini-Darth armour\u201d evokes only scorn. It is impossible to believe that this callow whinger has any relation to the iconic villain of the original trilogy.\u2019 5. 10 of the best chance encounters: readers\u2019 travel memories \u2018I helped a group through check-in en route to Bologna. On landing, one thanked me and asked my plans. My mum and I had none, aside from ambling around Emilia-Romagna. Massimo Bottura, then proprietor of the world\u2019s top restaurant, proceeded to piece together an itinerary of his favourite spots to eat and drink in the region, calling ahead and making sure we were looked after like locals at each turn.\u2019 6. In a new documentary, Lance Armstrong shows plenty of rage but little regret \u2018The casual violence, the callous disregard for rules and the feelings of others: Armstrong did not come to any of these late in life, once his course as a professional cyclist was set. He was practically marinating in insensitivity from the womb. Born into a rotten system, Armstrong stayed rotten.\u2019 7. J\u00fcrgen Klopp: on clothes, the keys to coaching and Liverpool team talks \u2018With the clock ticking Klopp is asked for two more tips. \u201cIf you are really ambitious you have to understand the game,\u201d he says. \u201cThe interesting fact with football is pretty much everybody thinks he is an expert. It\u2019s a nice game, a simple game. But it\u2019s not easy. That\u2019s why so many people think they understand it but stop so early.\u201d\u2019 8. Lorena: Amazon documentary about the notorious Bobbitt case is a 1990s time capsule \u2018The horrific details of anal rape, beatings and police call-outs, as recounted with sensitivity in this documentary, were sidelined by the media in favour of lurid accounts of John Wayne\u2019s emasculation. Up until this trial, it wasn\u2019t polite to even commit the word \u201cpenis\u201d to print, but early media references to John Wayne\u2019s \u201corgan\u201d were soon replaced by the correct anatomical word \u2013 a moment that was, in itself, a cultural watershed.\u2019 9. I\u2019ve never seen \u2026 Sleepless in Seattle \u2018How is it so sad, but so happy? It takes the avatar for Hollywood\u2019s hope \u2013 Tom Hanks \u2013 but makes him jaded and completely resigned to a future without love. It takes the sparky Meg Ryan and places her with a fiance who is \u2026 well, fine. Yet, it is the balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism that underpins every word of Ephron\u2019s gorgeous screenplay.\u2019 10. Mussolini\u2019s War by John Gooch review \u2013 fascist dreams of the 1930s and 40s \u2018Over much of Gooch\u2019s long and fascinating book hangs Mussolini\u2019s personality. By turn gungho and monosyllabic, truculent and cheerful, he changed his senior soldiers around, issued orders and then cancelled them, committing Italy to battles she could not win. Gooch is skilful at carrying his narrative forward, through painful campaigns and quixotic tactics, through advances and retreats, victories and losses.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them. This list is created by comparing the attention time with the length of each article, to come up with a ranking for the stories people read most deeply.",

We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.</p> <h2>The rules</h2> <p>We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.</p> <p>This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s<strong> </strong>the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.</p> <p>As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section.

While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre\u2019s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>98</strong></h2> <h2>Lieutenant Pigeon \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O465enGz03w\">Mouldy Old Dough</a> (1972)</h2> <p>Recorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>97</strong></h2> <h2>Dave and Ansell Collins \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w94BfHCeTBI\">Double Barrel</a> (1971)</h2> <p>If you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken \u2013 sampled if you like \u2013 from Ramsey Lewis; a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: \u201cI am the magnificent W-O-O-O!\u201d It still sounds fantastic. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>96</strong></h2> <h2>Roy Orbison \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jm3Tq_q4yU\">It\u2019s Over</a> (1964)</h2> <p>The pinnacle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/why-roy-orbison-is-one-of-the-rock-n-roll-greats\">Roy Orbison\u2019s career as rock\u2019s great tragedian</a>: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce22cd59da60a6a920f6a65d2735f67bfdafb0a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce22cd59da60a6a920f6a65d2735f67bfdafb0a2/0_0_2984_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duo Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn of the Buggles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Postmodern gold \u2026 Duo Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn of the Buggles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>95</strong></h2> <h2>The Buggles \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs\">Video Killed the Radio Star</a> (1979)</h2> <p>It won\u2019t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/30/the-buggles-how-we-made-video-killed-the-radio-star\">Trevor Horn and co</a> turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>94</strong></h2> <h2>Dua Lipa \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU\">New Rules</a> (2017)</h2> <p>After a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/03/dua-lipa-you-have-to-be-made-of-steel-to-not-let-words-get-to-you\">a global star</a>. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don\u2019t answer your ex\u2019s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She\u2019s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>93</strong></h2> <h2>Del Shannon \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMufLXrFIg8\">Runaway</a> (1961)</h2> <p>Behind the simple, perky rock\u2019n\u2019roll facade \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate fairground anthem\u201d, as writer Bob Stanley put it \u2013 there\u2019s something disturbing about Del Shannon\u2019s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4d95be22e1f5ffa47f8103e2859a9f9dc974cad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4d95be22e1f5ffa47f8103e2859a9f9dc974cad/0_24_3743_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Sinatra with Lee Hazlewood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nancy Sinatra with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/28/lee-hazlewood-guru-cowboy-psychedelia\">Lee Hazlewood</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GAB Archives/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>92</strong></h2> <h2>Nancy Sinatra \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbyAZQ45uww\">These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019</a> (1966)</h2> <p>Had These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently divorced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>91</strong></h2> <h2>Whigfield \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DNQRtmIMxk\">Saturday Night</a> (1994)</h2> <p>Saturday Night just pipped Gina G\u2019s Ooh Aah \u2026 Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it\u2019s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People\u2019s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It\u2019s got an immediately iconic tag (\u201cdee dee da da da!\u201d), plus it was the victor in one of pop\u2019s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne\u2019s Fog on the Tyne was having.<strong> LS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d2e5186e4bff8801756ff13e74398ac59dcb95a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2e5186e4bff8801756ff13e74398ac59dcb95a/0_29_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber performing in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He\u2019s had his moments, but sometimes he release a triumph \u2026 Justin Bieber performing in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>90</strong></h2> <h2>Justin Bieber \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_0jXPuIr0\">What Do You Mean?</a> (2015)</h2> <p>There will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he\u2019s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/how-dreamy-escapism-tropical-house-took-dance-music-by-storm\">then-popular tropical house sound</a> and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>89</strong></h2> <h2>Sugababes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSAGsiVSoeE\">Freak Like Me</a> (2002)</h2> <p>Producer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes\u2019 debut UK No 1 \u2013 the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army \u2013 but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing \u201cI\u2019m grown now\u201d transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It\u2019s got a classic belting \u201cmay-ee!\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cme\u201d in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn\u2019t have Sound of the Underground \u2013 or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>88</strong></h2> <h2>Craig David \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5lmb5-tnM0\">7 Days</a> (2000)</h2> <p>Like the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f24e1ac2c8e8ec8180b0c8d19360744bdb415e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f24e1ac2c8e8ec8180b0c8d19360744bdb415e/0_228_5444_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adamski, left, with Seal in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adamski, left, with Seal in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Muller/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>87</strong></h2> <h2>Adamski \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtENRzTV__8\">Killer (feat Seal)</a> (1990)</h2> <p>Every part of Adamski\u2019s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><strong>86</strong></h2> <h2>The Tornados \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9B_a0ct-DM\">Telstar</a> (1962)</h2> <p>The product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock28\">producer Joe Meek</a>\u2019s twin obsessions \u2013 space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself \u2013 Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them.

Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: \u201cLike the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking / Don\u2019t like his baggy jeans but I might like what\u2019s underneath them.\u201d The bump of will.i.am\u2019s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c5c2062e3f35538e771385c1e5a5f853a9b8199d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5c2062e3f35538e771385c1e5a5f853a9b8199d/0_116_2768_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gloria Gaynor in the mid-70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Universal touchstone \u2026 Gloria Gaynor in the mid-70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>84</strong></h2> <h2>Gloria Gaynor \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRMvKFJ5fZM\">I Will Survive</a> (1979)</h2> <p>Decades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who\u2019s tried chancing his arm again: \u201cI\u2019m not that chained up little person still in love with you.\u201d <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>83</strong></h2> <h2>Cher \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZXRV4MezEw\">Believe</a> (1998)</h2> <p>I Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher\u2019s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song\u2019s wild success \u2013 11m copies sold worldwide \u2013 is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it\u2019s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09ed661dc263e310a301d769c01a85ee995bb3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ed661dc263e310a301d769c01a85ee995bb3b4/0_151_5347_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart-stopping chart-topper \u2026 Robyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>82</strong></h2> <h2>Robyn \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ojHWQrm4UM\">With Every Heartbeat (feat Kleerup)</a> (2007)</h2> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t look back,\u201d Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush\u2019s DNA outlines the tragedy). \u201cAnd \u2013 it \u2013 hurts \u2013 with \u2013 ev \u2013 er \u2013 y \u2013 heart \u2013 <em>beat</em>,\u201d Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>81</strong></h2> <h2>Elton John \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QSA7pSvh-o\">Are You Ready for Love?</a> (2003)</h2> <p>For someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn\u2019t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It\u2019s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>80</strong></h2> <h2>Dave \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxns_n9q0f4\">Funky Friday (feat Fredo)</a> (2018)</h2> <p>This wasn\u2019t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven\u2019t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap\u2019s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba88ff217f2908d974c9671929260731205ff099\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba88ff217f2908d974c9671929260731205ff099/0_38_2500_1917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orchestral drama \u2026 Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Newspapers /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>79</strong></h2> <h2>Jackie Trent \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLESaA_XrA\">Where Are You Now (My Love)</a> (1965)</h2> <p>The pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/petula-clark-tony-hatch-how-we-made-downtown\">Tony Hatch</a>, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach\u2019s knack for orchestral drama.

Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that \u201cthe revolution\u2019s here\u201d, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it\u2019s really moving. <strong>AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>77</strong></h2> <h2>Enya \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTrk4X9ACtw\">Orinoco Flow</a> (1988)</h2> <p>Perhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly \u2013 but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya\u2019s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><strong>76</strong></h2> <h2>Baby D \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f17b8m5fniU\">Let Me Be Your Fantasy</a> (1994)</h2> <p>The lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy \u2013 \u201cLotions of love flow through your hands / See visions, colours every day\u201d \u2013 and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences.

It was the devil\u2019s music, but Great Balls of Fire still sounds like an act of God. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/18/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-15-jerry-lee-lewis-great-balls-of-fire\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Michael Hann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67ffffa7fa1edcc8e8fd4ea3d4e5b025fa8d6a36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67ffffa7fa1edcc8e8fd4ea3d4e5b025fa8d6a36/0_0_1249_749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Bush.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Individuality \u2026 Kate Bush.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14</strong></h2> <h2>Kate Bush \u2013 Wuthering Heights (1978)</h2> <p>The piano gently heralds the arrival of this haunted tale of lost love and longing, then that tight, high melody reels you in. It loops and lilts, ascending, descending, as Bush\u2019s vocal urges the story on, like Catherine striding across the moors. Wuthering Heights turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her individuality was set in stone from the very beginning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/19/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-14-kate-bush-wuthering-heights\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2><strong>13</strong></h2> <h2>Frankie Goes to Hollywood \u2013 Relax (1984)</h2> <p>With not only its flagrant innuendo, but its wide-open synths, and swooning, psychedelic disco structure, the song was a complete wildcard \u2013 and the band performing it even more so. At a pivotal, deeply conservative time in Britain\u2019s history, their crowning glory was what they brought out of the shadows and thrust into the light. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/20/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-13-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-relax\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Aimee Cliff</strong></p> <h2><strong>12</strong></h2> <h2>Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor \u2013 Nothing Compares 2 U (1990)</h2> <p>By drawing out the emotional weight that eluded its creator, O\u2019Connor fashioned one of the all-time great cover versions. Time has only cemented Nothing Compares 2 U\u2019s place in the pop pantheon \u2013 three decades on, this haunting, heart-wrenching evocation of the grief of lost love remains peerless. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/21/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-12-sinead-oconnor-nothing-compares-2-u\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Rachel Aroesti</strong></p> <h2><strong>11</strong></h2> <h2>The Beach Boys \u2013 Good Vibrations (1966)</h2> <p>Good Vibrations was at once the mumbled inarticulacy and heightened feelings of love, but also the sound of a culture changing \u2013 almost in real time. In this collision of sound and sentiment, Wilson and his bandmates succeeded in capturing the moment when everything we thought we knew about pop songs dissolved. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/22/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-11-the-beach-boys-good-vibrations\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Laura Barton</strong></p> <h2><strong>10</strong></h2> <h2>Marvin Gaye \u2013 Heard It Through the Grapevine (1968)</h2> <p>Here, Gaye would establish himself as the bad boy of Motown, both a figurehead for rising anti-Vietnam sentiment and archetype of the socially conscious songwriter.

We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952. The rules We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics. This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once. As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1. Enjoy! Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor 100 Bill Haley and His Comets \u2013 Rock Around the Clock (1955) You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. AP 99 Lorde \u2013 Royals (2013) By disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre\u2019s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LS 98 Lieutenant Pigeon \u2013 Mouldy Old Dough (1972) Recorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. AP 97 Dave and Ansell Collins \u2013 Double Barrel (1971) If you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken \u2013 sampled if you like \u2013 from Ramsey Lewis; a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: \u201cI am the magnificent W-O-O-O!\u201d It still sounds fantastic. AP 96 Roy Orbison \u2013 It\u2019s Over (1964) The pinnacle of Roy Orbison\u2019s career as rock\u2019s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. AP 95 The Buggles \u2013 Video Killed the Radio Star (1979) It won\u2019t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBT 94 Dua Lipa \u2013 New Rules (2017) After a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don\u2019t answer your ex\u2019s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She\u2019s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBT 93 Del Shannon \u2013 Runaway (1961) Behind the simple, perky rock\u2019n\u2019roll facade \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate fairground anthem\u201d, as writer Bob Stanley put it \u2013 there\u2019s something disturbing about Del Shannon\u2019s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. AP 92 Nancy Sinatra \u2013 These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 (1966) Had These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently divorced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. AP 91 Whigfield \u2013 Saturday Night (1994) Saturday Night just pipped Gina G\u2019s Ooh Aah \u2026 Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it\u2019s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People\u2019s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It\u2019s got an immediately iconic tag (\u201cdee dee da da da!\u201d), plus it was the victor in one of pop\u2019s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne\u2019s Fog on the Tyne was having. LS 90 Justin Bieber \u2013 What Do You Mean? (2015) There will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he\u2019s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBT 89 Sugababes \u2013 Freak Like Me (2002) Producer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes\u2019 debut UK No 1 \u2013 the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army \u2013 but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing \u201cI\u2019m grown now\u201d transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It\u2019s got a classic belting \u201cmay-ee!\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cme\u201d in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn\u2019t have Sound of the Underground \u2013 or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LS 88 Craig David \u2013 7 Days (2000) Like the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBT 87 Adamski \u2013 Killer (feat Seal) (1990) Every part of Adamski\u2019s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBT 86 The Tornados \u2013 Telstar (1962) The product of producer Joe Meek\u2019s twin obsessions \u2013 space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself \u2013 Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It\u2019s like nothing else, before or since. AP 85 Estelle \u2013 American Boy (feat Kanye West) (2008) This will get you thinking, \u201cI miss the old Kanye\u201d \u2013 the rapper\u2019s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet \u201crubbish\u201d is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: \u201cLike the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking / Don\u2019t like his baggy jeans but I might like what\u2019s underneath them.\u201d The bump of will.i.am\u2019s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBT 84 Gloria Gaynor \u2013 I Will Survive (1979) Decades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who\u2019s tried chancing his arm again: \u201cI\u2019m not that chained up little person still in love with you.\u201d AP 83 Cher \u2013 Believe (1998) I Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher\u2019s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song\u2019s wild success \u2013 11m copies sold worldwide \u2013 is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it\u2019s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT 82 Robyn \u2013 With Every Heartbeat (feat Kleerup) (2007) \u201cBut I don\u2019t look back,\u201d Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush\u2019s DNA outlines the tragedy). \u201cAnd \u2013 it \u2013 hurts \u2013 with \u2013 ev \u2013 er \u2013 y \u2013 heart \u2013 beat,\u201d Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LS 81 Elton John \u2013 Are You Ready for Love? (2003) For someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn\u2019t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It\u2019s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LS 80 Dave \u2013 Funky Friday (feat Fredo) (2018) This wasn\u2019t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven\u2019t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap\u2019s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBT 79 Jackie Trent \u2013 Where Are You Now (My Love) (1965) The pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach\u2019s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent \u2013 this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBT 78 Thunderclap Newman \u2013 Something in the Air (1969) It\u2019s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that\u2019s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that \u201cthe revolution\u2019s here\u201d, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it\u2019s really moving. AP 77 Enya \u2013 Orinoco Flow (1988) Perhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly \u2013 but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya\u2019s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LS 76 Baby D \u2013 Let Me Be Your Fantasy (1994) The lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy \u2013 \u201cLotions of love flow through your hands / See visions, colours every day\u201d \u2013 and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBT 75 Procol Harum \u2013 A Whiter Shade of Pale (1967) Channelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies \u2013 \u201cAlthough my eyes were open / They might have just as well\u2019ve been closed\u201d \u2013 and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: \u201cI was feeling kinda seasick / But the crowd called out for more.\u201d A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBT 74 Will Young \u2013 Leave Right Now (2003) You can imagine an older relative calling this \u201ca proper song\u201d \u2013 unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White\u2019s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight\u2019s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBT 73 Chicago \u2013 If You Leave Me Now (1976) The softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn\u2019t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he\u2019s trying not to wake someone up. It\u2019s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. AP 72 Rage Against the Machine \u2013 Killing in the Name (2009) The heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history \u2013 with one of the best riffs, too \u2013 only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its \u201cFuck you, I won\u2019t do what you tell me\u201d climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBT 71 Spice Girls \u2013 Wannabe (1996) Almost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the \u201czig-a-zig-ah\u201d, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard\u2019s \u201ca-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!\u201d almost four decades prior) that it\u2019s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2013 seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes \u2013 and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LS 70 Rui Da Silva \u2013 Touch Me (feat Cassandra) (2001) Dance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra\u2019s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn\u2019t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBT 69 Snap! \u2013 Rhythm Is a Dancer (1992) Dance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy \u2013 Haddaway\u2019s What Is Love and Corona\u2019s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples \u2013 and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday. BBT 68 Dexys Midnight Runners \u2013 Come on Eileen (1982) Pop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they\u2019ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LS 67 Black Box \u2013 Ride on Time (1989) Matching disco diva Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People\u2019s Heather Small \u2013 working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample \u2013 blows the house down, and her \u201clet me tell you, what you do to me\u201d is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBT 66 Eminem \u2013 Stan (feat Dido) (2000) It\u2019s testament to time\u2019s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn\u2019t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It\u2019s the peak of Eminem\u2019s storytelling skill and \u2013 in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan \u2013 profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan\u2019s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it. LS 65 Kraftwerk \u2013 The Model (1982) A depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model\u2019s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn\u2019t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBT 64 Nena \u2013 99 Red Balloons (1984) Too often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go\u2019s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.) LS 63 Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel \u2013 Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) (1975) A fabulously bitchy kiss-off to the three members of Cockney Rebel who left the band after their 1974 album The Psychomodo, the genius of Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) is to couch its screw-you message in the sunniest, most charming, irresistibly hook-laden music imaginable. AP 62 Elvis Presley \u2013 Jailhouse Rock (1958) Jailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. AP 61 Arctic Monkeys \u2013 I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor (2005) Most mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys\u2019 debut single proper is something to look back on with pride \u2013 not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic \u201cvictory\u201d for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner\u2019s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: \u201cJust bangin\u2019 tunes and DJ sets and / Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.\u201d LS 60 Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next (2018) After all that Ariana Grande had been through \u2013 the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement \u2013 she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop\u2019s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande\u2019s freedom. LS 59 The Walker Brothers \u2013 Make It Easy on Yourself (1965) \u201cBreaking up is so very hard to do\u201d \u2013 this Burt Bacharach-penned ballad opens with a wry bit of understatement from Scott Walker, and he deals with things very magnanimously from here on out: a stiff upper lip in song. The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy is arranger Ivor Raymonde just showing off, really. BBT 58 Rihanna \u2013 Umbrella (feat Jay-Z) (2007) Originally written for Britney Spears, although it\u2019s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that\u2019s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop\u2019s great come-ons. It\u2019s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons. LS 57 10cc \u2013 I\u2019m Not in Love (1975) Eric Stewart wrote I\u2019m Not in Love after his wife, Gloria, complained that he didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d often enough \u2013 not out of petulance, but to express his depth of feeling for her beyond the cliche. After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LS 56 Aaliyah \u2013 More Than a Woman (2002) A posthumous chart-topper after her death in a plane crash when she was 22, More Than a Woman is one of the trio of masterpiece singles she made with Timbaland, along with We Need a Resolution and Try Again. Into the producer\u2019s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBT 55 Daft Punk \u2013 Get Lucky (feat Pharrell Williams) (2013) Ah, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy\u2019s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all. Take it off the alcopop-splashed CDJs and back into headphones and you can newly appreciate its mastery, with the liveness of Nile Rodgers\u2019 guitar and Pharrell\u2019s conversational charm. BBT 54 tATu \u2013 All the Things She Said (2003) On one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo\u2019s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager\u2019s head. An industrial cri de c\u0153ur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LS 53 Take That \u2013 Back for Good (1995) The boy band \u2013 well, Gary Barlow \u2013 had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There\u2019s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though \u2013 \u201cWhenever I\u2019m wrong / Just tell me the song and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d \u2013 so you don\u2019t really fancy his chances. BBT 52 Soft Cell \u2013 Tainted Love (1981) You might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell\u2019s version of Gloria Jones\u2019s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There\u2019s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBT 51 S-Express \u2013 Theme from S-Express (1988) To watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass\u2019s earlier acid house hits, S-Express\u2019s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound\u2019s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London\u2019s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage. LS 50 Steve \u201cSilk\u201d Hurley \u2013 Jack Your Body (1987) It\u2019s hard to imagine now how strange and alien Jack Your Body sounded in 1987. Other early house hits had at least come with a song or a hook attached, but this had neither: it may be the most minimal No 1 of all time. It isn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination the best Chicago had to offer in 1987: as a signal of a vast shift in the way pop music sounded, it\u2019s unbeatable. AP 49 Chemical Brothers \u2013 Setting Sun (feat Noel Gallagher) (1996) A half-cover of the Beatles\u2019 Tomorrow Never Knows but with that band\u2019s LSD juiced up with some kind of experimental steroid, Setting Sun still sounds extreme. Lighting up that breakbeat and demonically heaving harmonium riffs are rockets and catherine wheels of wild sound, with Noel Gallagher sounding as if he\u2019s being dragged out of sanity. BBT 48 So Solid Crew \u2013 21 Seconds (2001) A new high-water mark of commercial success for British rap was set by this incandescently brilliant wave of London MCs, each given 21 seconds of time on the mic. The energy stays permanently high, but is filtered through such distinct characters: Harvey\u2019s rave MC, Romeo\u2019s lascivious loverman, Kaish\u2019s jabbing boxer, Face\u2019s bug-eyed vampire and more. BBT 47 Suzi Quatro \u2013 Can the Can (1973) The first attempt to make Suzi Quatro a star, with the light pop of Rolling Stone, fell flat: second time around, with writers/producers Chinn and Chapman in control, everything clicked. From its opening wall of drums to Quatro\u2019s scream of \u201cscratch out her eyes\u201d to its lyrically baffling but indelible chorus, Can the Can is glam-pop perfection. AP 46 Queen \u2013 Bohemian Rhapsody (1975) Everyone with even a glancing interest in pop knows Bohemian Rhapsody, which means its sheer audacity is easy to overlook. It\u2019s a completely inexplicable, extraordinary single, a joke that got out of hand according to producer Roy Thomas Baker, a preposterous exercise in high camp with demented lyrics, that somehow still exerts a huge emotional pull. AP 45 Simon and Garfunkel \u2013 Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970) The charts in 1970 were rich with hymn-like songs solemnly marking the passing of the 60s \u2013 not least the Beatles\u2019 Let It Be \u2013 but Bridge Over Troubled Water was the blockbuster take: five minutes of booming, Phil Spector-inspired white gospel with a choirboy vocal and a simple, universal message beneath the sturm und drang. AP 44 Rick Astley \u2013 Never Gonna Give You Up (1987) More fool the person who thought up Rickrolling, believing chance exposure to Never Gonna Give You Up to be some kind of punishment: the Stock Aitken Waterman tea boy\u2019s star-making moment couldn\u2019t be less cool or more glorious, his good-boy Redcoat brogue the cheese to SAW\u2019s soulful, acid pickle. And, hey, if it was good enough for Larry Levan \u2026 LS 43 Tubeway Army \u2013 Are \u201cFriends\u201d Electric? (1979) The 80s began in British pop when the stately, epic Are \u201cFriends\u201d Electric? arrived on Top of the Pops in June 1979: two synth players, Gary Numan looking puzzled, as if he didn\u2019t understand how a song with no chorus had become a hit. He was six months early, but Numan was always ahead of his time: oft-mocked, his alienated-suburbanite-in-a-world-of-technology schtick now seems remarkably prescient. AP 42 Lady Gaga \u2013 Bad Romance (2009) Gaga\u2019s third UK No 1 outshines earlier hits Just Dance and Poker Face as the apex of her tectonic, Teutonic first-phase battering rams. While it\u2019s heavily indebted to Depeche Mode and Madonna, Gaga\u2019s weapons-grade persona turns a homage into a conquest, tagging everything in her wake with a lusty \u201cGaga, ooh la la.\u201d LS 41 East 17 \u2013 Stay Another Day (1994) One of the greatest Christmas No 1s of all time is a triumph of emotional candour. It resembles a breakup song with its talk of final kisses, but was written by Tony Mortimer after his brother killed himself. The pain of those sudden calls of \u201cstay now\u201d is so acute, voicing the suddenness of loss. BBT 40 The Four Tops \u2013 Reach Out (I\u2019ll Be There) (1966) Soaring above Reach Out\u2019s dramatic arrangement \u2013 which smashed through the boundaries of Motown\u2019s signature style, inspired by the Rolling Stones\u2019 Paint It Black, not that you\u2019d know \u2013 lead vocalist Levi Stubbs sounds as if he\u2019s close to tears, delivering the lyrics as if they\u2019re a matter of life or death. It remains an astonishingly intense way to spend three minutes. AP 39 The Jam \u2013 Going Underground (1980) A song in which disgust at Thatcher\u2019s Britain seems to meld with Paul Weller\u2019s increasing unease over the mod revival he\u2019d single-handedly started, Going Underground was also the perfect demonstration of what its author had learned studying taut, potent mid-60s pop: grab the listener from the start, don\u2019t let your grip slacken or a second go to waste. AP 38 Blondie \u2013 Heart of Glass (1979) There are plenty of arguments for Heart of Glass not really qualifying as the only UK No 1 punk single. While Blondie came from the genre\u2019s first wave in New York, their 1979 hit mainlined European electronic pioneers Kraftwerk and Heart of Glass in its brilliant, cycling riff, while Debbie Harry\u2019s rhapsodic vocals owed more to Donna Summer (whose I Feel Love the group had been covering), with a twist of downtown irony. It pissed off the punk purists back home \u2013 which is, incidentally, pretty much the most punk thing you could do by 1979. LS 37 Slade \u2013 Merry Xmas Everybody (1973) The production on Merry Xmas Everybody is fuzzy as tinsel (the result of recording in an echoey corridor), potent as plum pudding doused in brandy and appropriately poignant, straddling that late-December divide between nostalgia and optimism. Which is what, it\u2019s easy to imagine, gave it the edge over Wizzard\u2019s dementedly cheery I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday, the loser in what\u2019s now considered the original festive chart battle, though it cemented glam as the official sound of Christmas. LS 36 David Bowie \u2013 Let\u2019s Dance (1983) That opening crescendo, giving way to the Nile Rodgers-penned guitar funk riff, is one of the most breathtakingly exciting moments in Bowie\u2019s catalogue, and the croaky croon of \u201cput on your red shoes and dance the blues\u201d a few seconds later is one of the coolest. Let\u2019s Dance remains an irresistible command. BBT 35 The Pretenders \u2013 Brass in Pocket (1980) \u201cWe all just thought she was a groupie,\u201d noted the Damned\u2019s Rat Scabies of Chrissie Hynde when the Pretenders made it big, the kind of dismissive remark you suspect fuelled Brass in Pocket\u2019s surfeit of attitude: \u201cI\u2019m special.\u201d Brilliantly, it sets its narcissistic swagger to music that\u2019s languid and sensual rather than aggressive: perfect pop ensues. AP 34 Rod Stewart \u2013 Da Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? (1978) Bear in mind Rod was asking this question when his hair\u2019s volume had been turned way beyond 11, and when he was giving an audible crotch-thrust at the opening of each chorus line. And yet, even though this song is utterly ridiculous, it is also utterly brilliant \u2013 the way the synth melody steps up before pirouetting down is eternally replayable, and Rod\u2019s charisma is, sorry, a bit sexy. BBT 33 Tom Jones \u2013 It\u2019s Not Unusual (1965) On his breakthrough single, Tom Jones exhibits the kind of determined perkiness that can only accompany truly desperate heartbreak. That double negative gives his confusion away as he tries to come to terms with seeing his girl out with another guy, but it\u2019s no use: \u201cI wanna die.\u201d In a Top 100 full of savagely unhappy yet upbeat songs, this is the most emotionally dissonant of all. BBT 32 Britney Spears \u2013 \u2026 Baby One More Time (1999) \u2026 Baby One More Time wasn\u2019t the first hit from Denniz Pop and Max Martin\u2019s Cheiron Studios \u2013 Backstreet Boys and Robyn predated Britney. But the Louisiana 16-year-old was to Cheiron what Kylie was to Stock Aitken Waterman: the first act with the personality to overwhelm the blueprint (Euro melodies, metal\u2019s impact and club-pop\u2019s sparkle) and make it her own. Rockists accuse Britney Spears of being an empty vessel, but it\u2019s her vocal DNA that shapes every single word of this song into a pop landmark. LS 31 Althea and Donna \u2013 Uptown Top Ranking (1977) \u201cNah pop nah style,\u201d sang Althea and Donna, and they had a point. What\u2019s striking about the greatest reggae No 1 of all is how unvarnished its repurposing of an old Alton Ellis it is, the lack of concession to white ears as Althea and Donna riff on the lyrics of Trinity\u2019s Three Piece Suit with blank-eyed teenage insouciance. AP 30 Madonna \u2013 Vogue (1990) Of Madonna\u2019s 13 No 1s, Vogue is her most poised, agile and sexually intoxicating. It is a portal into a world of glamour \u2013 the litany of classic Hollywood in the middle eight, but also the world of peacocking ballroom culture it was borne from \u2013 where you find Madonna herself presiding over the decadence with her commands and observations. Get up on the dancefloor, indeed. BBT 29 Whitney Houston \u2013 I Wanna Dance With Somebody (1987) A masterpiece of synthetic production: the gorgeously wrong approximations of horns, bass guitar and piano have their own delirious beauty. But, of course, it\u2019s Whitney who seals it. That final chorus line, \u201cwith somebody who loves me\u201d, is so emphatic in knowing she deserves happiness, creating a paradoxically euphoric song about being lonely. BBT 28 The Kinks \u2013 You Really Got Me (1964) The arrival of You Really Got Me amid the still relatively mild No 1s of the time must have been startling \u2013 it even makes the Beatles sound like squares. One of the all time great riffs, made from only two notes, powers the garage-band energy as the group\u2019s lust builds to a ferocious head. BBT 27 George Michael \u2013 Careless Whisper (1984) Just imagine this being the third song you\u2019d ever written as a band, turning a litany of silly teenage crushes into one of the all-time great ballads (and home to the most arresting sax solo since Gerry Rafferty\u2019s Baker Street). It wasn\u2019t Wham!\u2019s third single \u2013 George Michael astutely parcelled it out later, asserting his soulful, songwriterly bona fides after a raft of more cartoonish hits, and paving the way for a different shade of solo career. LS 26 The Rolling Stones \u2013 (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction (1965) Sneering attitude and glowering negativity \u2013 provoked by everything from radio DJs to TV advertising to a lady declining to have sex with Mick Jagger because she\u2019s on her period \u2013 aligned to the most famous guitar riff in history. Satisfaction is pissed off, provocative, dirty, thrilling; everything great about the mid-60s Rolling Stones condensed into 3 minutes and 45 seconds. AP 25 Bee Gees \u2013 Night Fever (1978) Fortysomething years on, the opprobrium occasioned by the late-70s Bee Gees seems utterly baffling: the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack sounds like a masterclass in pop songwriting, as evidenced by Night Fever\u2019s perfect evocation of pre-club anticipation: \u201cOn the waves of the air / There is dancing out there \u2026 We can steal it.\u201d AP 24 Freda Payne \u2013 Band of Gold (1970) Written by Motown brains trust Holland-Dozier-Holland, Band of Gold sees Payne sitting in a lonely bedroom, her wedding night gone disastrously unconsummated after some kind of freak-out by the groom. Although the exact details are tactfully veiled by Payne, it\u2019s an unforgettably specific scenario, its horror hammered into your mind with that unyielding snare rhythm and told via a wondrous vocal line. BBT 23 The KLF \u2013 3am Eternal (1991) Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond had already written a book on how to have a No 1 record, The Manual, after their novelty chart-topper Doctorin\u2019 the Tardis. As the KLF, they brought every one of their tricks to bear on this titanic piece of rave: hip-house rapping, gospel choirs, chants about an ancient race of people and a huge synthetic guitar riff. What on earth was it on about? The mystery was the final key to its success. BBT 22 George McCrae \u2013 Rock Your Baby (1974) Ostensibly the first disco No 1 and the product of songwriters Harry Casey and Richard Finch observing what worked on the dancefloors of Miami\u2019s clubs, in truth, Rock Your Baby carved out a shimmering, supple musical space entirely of its own: organ-led, Hi Records-esque Memphis soul, complete with imploring falsetto vocal, over the hissy ticking of a primitive drum machine. AP 21 T Rex \u2013 Get It On (1971) Any of T Rex\u2019s magisterial run of No 1 singles could be in this list, but Get It On just shades it, by dint of being the most imperious sounding of the lot: the earthy R&amp;B of Chuck Berry recast into a defiantly modern shape, sexually charged in a way no teen pop had previously been. AP 20 Carly Rae Jepsen \u2013 Call Me Maybe (2012) On first listen, the song seemed deceptively featherweight. The strings sound like ringtones; the guitar parts as though they were lifted from a PlayStation 2 game. But even the most synthetic production can\u2019t detract from songwriting this ironclad. It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song; it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater. Read our full review here. Elle Hunt 19 Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) (2019) Old Town Road was unstoppable, with no apparent end to its appeal. Children rioted in their love for it. Its vast stable of remixes made it a genre-splicing Rosetta stone. But as much as the song is an urtext in how to go viral (until the rules change again), Old Town\u2019s Road\u2019s magic lies in its affirming faith that a sunnier future is just around the next bend, designer Stetson optional. Read our full review here. Owen Myers 18 Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads \u2013 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (1979) Dury told chatshow host Michael Parkinson that he wanted his success to dispel society\u2019s discomfort with and patronising attitudes to disability and provide hope to those for whom things hadn\u2019t turned out so well. Today, his best-known tune still sounds fresh and wonderfully off-kilter, a beacon of pop\u2019s ability to embrace oddity and celebrate the other. Read our full review here. Dave Simpson 17 Kylie Minogue \u2013 Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head (2001) This was always a Kylie classic in the making. Blessed with the perfect pop voice, she delivers each line with just enough blank space for the listener\u2019s own interpretations. Is it about a crush? A recent heartbreak? Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those famous \u201cla, la, las\u201d take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted. Read our full review here. Michael Cragg 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Crazy in Love (2003) The announcement of her arrival via those unforgettable blaring horns, sampled from the Chi-Lites\u2019 1970 hit Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So), erred on regal fanfare, inspiring endless struts across makeshift dancefloors-turned-catwalks to this day. Beyonc\u00e9 was auditioning for the part of pop\u2019s new reigning diva, a role she knew she had already secured. Read our full review here. Yomi Adegoke 15 Jerry Lee Lewis \u2013 Great Balls of Fire (1957) Jerry Lee still sounds more lascivious than almost anyone. The sensations simply spill out of him \u2013 not only his voice but also his piano playing, too, his right hand sliding down the keys in exhalations of delight. It was the devil\u2019s music, but Great Balls of Fire still sounds like an act of God. Read our full review here. Michael Hann 14 Kate Bush \u2013 Wuthering Heights (1978) The piano gently heralds the arrival of this haunted tale of lost love and longing, then that tight, high melody reels you in. It loops and lilts, ascending, descending, as Bush\u2019s vocal urges the story on, like Catherine striding across the moors. Wuthering Heights turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her individuality was set in stone from the very beginning. Read our full review here. Rebecca Nicholson 13 Frankie Goes to Hollywood \u2013 Relax (1984) With not only its flagrant innuendo, but its wide-open synths, and swooning, psychedelic disco structure, the song was a complete wildcard \u2013 and the band performing it even more so. At a pivotal, deeply conservative time in Britain\u2019s history, their crowning glory was what they brought out of the shadows and thrust into the light. Read our full review here. Aimee Cliff 12 Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor \u2013 Nothing Compares 2 U (1990) By drawing out the emotional weight that eluded its creator, O\u2019Connor fashioned one of the all-time great cover versions. Time has only cemented Nothing Compares 2 U\u2019s place in the pop pantheon \u2013 three decades on, this haunting, heart-wrenching evocation of the grief of lost love remains peerless. Read our full review here. Rachel Aroesti 11 The Beach Boys \u2013 Good Vibrations (1966) Good Vibrations was at once the mumbled inarticulacy and heightened feelings of love, but also the sound of a culture changing \u2013 almost in real time. In this collision of sound and sentiment, Wilson and his bandmates succeeded in capturing the moment when everything we thought we knew about pop songs dissolved. Read our full review here. Laura Barton 10 Marvin Gaye \u2013 Heard It Through the Grapevine (1968) Here, Gaye would establish himself as the bad boy of Motown, both a figurehead for rising anti-Vietnam sentiment and archetype of the socially conscious songwriter. With I Heard It Through the Grapevine, we find him stepping out into his independence, all potential buoyed on by the force of his first creation. Read our full review here.

The government furlough scheme: key facts The UK government announced the employee scheme in March and has recently extended it until the end of October. 7.5 million workers and 1m businesses have been protected by the scheme across the UK. Already the UK government has received claims for more than \u00a310bn. Workers across the UK now have the peace of mind that they can receive 80% of wages \u2013 up to \u00a32,500 \u2013 until the end of October. This is part of the multi-billion pound package of support and loans that the UK government is making available to workers and businesses all across the UK.

      "body": "<p>Springtime is generally boom time for the hospitality industry. The four-day weekend of Easter, plus Mother\u2019s Day and two bank holidays in May, see many people celebrating with meals out. But this year in March, just as restaurants and bars began to get really busy, Covid-19 took hold.</p> <p>\u201cWe were on the crest of a wave,\u201d says Paul Elgee, director of Myra\u2019s Kaiseki, a restaurant in Dorchester. \u201cWe were fully booked, and with stock in ready for a big weekend, then we were told we needed to shut. The closure of the restaurant couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\u201d</p> <p>As the pandemic swept through China, then Europe, at the start of 2020, there was confusion in the UK about the virus and the impact it would have. On 16 March, the prime minister simply advised the country to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other social venues\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until a week later that lockdown was put into place, meaning venues such as Myra\u2019s Kaiseki were forced to bring down the shutters.</p> <p>This small, fine-dining Japanese restaurant is part of an industry that before the outbreak of Covid-19 was valued at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/restaurants-stare-into-social-distancing-abyss\">\u00a372bn</a> in the UK. Though the closures were unavoidable, the process of doing so had the potential to devastate the trade\u2019s workforce.</p> <p>\u201cWe opened the family-run restaurant in 2016 and we\u2019ve built it up from nothing,\u201d says Elgee, who employs four people alongside his wife Myra, the chef. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with closure, it\u2019s like a dark cloud. But it was very important to us to retain our staff. It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust and rely on \u2013 you can\u2019t replace people who have contributed a lot to the business. They aren\u2019t just another number to us, they are like family. They have to be looked after.\u201d</p> <p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, subsequently announced a range of measures for UK businesses and workers to protect them during the economic emergency. The Small Business Grant Fund (SBGF) provides small businesses with grants of up to \u00a310,000, while the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) enables employees to be put on furlough while allowing employers to apply for a government grant that covers 80% of their usual wage, capped at \u00a32,500 a month.</p> <p>Elgee\u2019s first port of call was the team running Dorchester Business Improvement District, who, along with his accountants, suggested he apply for an SBGF through Dorset county council. The restaurant was awarded the full \u00a310,000 within a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c50c7066e10408c37cf9579fe51427a090cc335f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c50c7066e10408c37cf9579fe51427a090cc335f/0_0_640_428/500.jpg\" alt=\"Paul and Myra Elgee. \u2018It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust\u2019, says Paul\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul and Myra Elgee. \u2018It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust\u2019, says Paul</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe grant gave us enough space to breathe so we could search for that silver lining and figure out what we could do in the circumstances. It also helped to tie things up with our suppliers and our staff, so we could close up in good order,\u201d he says.</p> <p>They were then able to furlough two of their staff through the CJRS. Of utmost importance to Elgee was being able to support his staff. \u201cThey will be secure and ready to come back when we can reopen,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel isolated with the problem, which was really important,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe were kept very well informed.\u201d</p> <p>But business owners \u2013 and the people who work in these bars, cafes and restaurants \u2013 are aware that there\u2019s no quick fix for the effects of the pandemic on their trade, and that things are still precarious.</p> <p>The job retention scheme has now been extended until the end of October, which has come as a relief to Elgee. \u201cAs far as the restaurant industry is concerned, we can\u2019t expect to recover immediately in July. It will take us a while to pick up again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Elgee says he\u2019s fortunate to have the support of his landlord, who has agreed to suspend the business\u2019s rental obligations while the restaurant is shut. There\u2019s now pressure for this to become a nationwide standard so as to save even more jobs and livelihoods. A campaign for a <a href=\"https://www.hospitalityunion.co.uk/nationaltimeout\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Time Out</a> is asking that hospitality business rents to be paused until January 2021, when rental payments would begin again as normal.</p> <p>In the meantime, Elgee, like many other restaurant owners, is working out how Myra\u2019s Kaiseki can function in this new era of social distancing. \u201cWe sat quietly for a month and thought about it, looking at how we could adapt and create new revenue streams.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/22/i-call-furloughed-staff-once-a-week-how-one-company-is-coping-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">'I call furloughed staff once a week': how one company is coping during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The restaurant has just started offering takeaways and a home delivery service, it\u2019s doing a weekly grocery run for its older isolating customers, and is delivering free meals once a week to NHS staff at Dorset county hospital.

      "bodyText": "Springtime is generally boom time for the hospitality industry. The four-day weekend of Easter, plus Mother\u2019s Day and two bank holidays in May, see many people celebrating with meals out. But this year in March, just as restaurants and bars began to get really busy, Covid-19 took hold. \u201cWe were on the crest of a wave,\u201d says Paul Elgee, director of Myra\u2019s Kaiseki, a restaurant in Dorchester. \u201cWe were fully booked, and with stock in ready for a big weekend, then we were told we needed to shut. The closure of the restaurant couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\u201d As the pandemic swept through China, then Europe, at the start of 2020, there was confusion in the UK about the virus and the impact it would have. On 16 March, the prime minister simply advised the country to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other social venues\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until a week later that lockdown was put into place, meaning venues such as Myra\u2019s Kaiseki were forced to bring down the shutters. This small, fine-dining Japanese restaurant is part of an industry that before the outbreak of Covid-19 was valued at \u00a372bn in the UK. Though the closures were unavoidable, the process of doing so had the potential to devastate the trade\u2019s workforce. \u201cWe opened the family-run restaurant in 2016 and we\u2019ve built it up from nothing,\u201d says Elgee, who employs four people alongside his wife Myra, the chef. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with closure, it\u2019s like a dark cloud. But it was very important to us to retain our staff. It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust and rely on \u2013 you can\u2019t replace people who have contributed a lot to the business. They aren\u2019t just another number to us, they are like family. They have to be looked after.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, subsequently announced a range of measures for UK businesses and workers to protect them during the economic emergency. The Small Business Grant Fund (SBGF) provides small businesses with grants of up to \u00a310,000, while the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) enables employees to be put on furlough while allowing employers to apply for a government grant that covers 80% of their usual wage, capped at \u00a32,500 a month. Elgee\u2019s first port of call was the team running Dorchester Business Improvement District, who, along with his accountants, suggested he apply for an SBGF through Dorset county council. The restaurant was awarded the full \u00a310,000 within a week. \u201cThe grant gave us enough space to breathe so we could search for that silver lining and figure out what we could do in the circumstances. It also helped to tie things up with our suppliers and our staff, so we could close up in good order,\u201d he says. They were then able to furlough two of their staff through the CJRS. Of utmost importance to Elgee was being able to support his staff. \u201cThey will be secure and ready to come back when we can reopen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel isolated with the problem, which was really important,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe were kept very well informed.\u201d But business owners \u2013 and the people who work in these bars, cafes and restaurants \u2013 are aware that there\u2019s no quick fix for the effects of the pandemic on their trade, and that things are still precarious. The job retention scheme has now been extended until the end of October, which has come as a relief to Elgee. \u201cAs far as the restaurant industry is concerned, we can\u2019t expect to recover immediately in July. It will take us a while to pick up again,\u201d he says. Elgee says he\u2019s fortunate to have the support of his landlord, who has agreed to suspend the business\u2019s rental obligations while the restaurant is shut. There\u2019s now pressure for this to become a nationwide standard so as to save even more jobs and livelihoods. A campaign for a National Time Out is asking that hospitality business rents to be paused until January 2021, when rental payments would begin again as normal. In the meantime, Elgee, like many other restaurant owners, is working out how Myra\u2019s Kaiseki can function in this new era of social distancing. \u201cWe sat quietly for a month and thought about it, looking at how we could adapt and create new revenue streams.\u201d The restaurant has just started offering takeaways and a home delivery service, it\u2019s doing a weekly grocery run for its older isolating customers, and is delivering free meals once a week to NHS staff at Dorset county hospital. Elgee and his wife are working towards, potentially, a July reopening, albeit only operating at 40% capacity, and are now looking into serving Japanese street food from their outdoor terrace. Elgee recognises the dilemmas and logistical issues facing the business: \u201cWe will have to discuss how we reopen with a limited number of seats, the economics are going to be difficult.\u201d There\u2019s no quick fix for the restaurant industry, and it faces many challenges in the post-Covid world. But, with the right support, it is hoped that restaurants at the heart of their communities will survive. And Elgee remains optimistic about the prospect: \u201cWe were very much encouraged that this is something that is going to recover and we won\u2019t be left out in the cold.\u201d Use the business support finder here to check whether your business is eligible for financial support. The government furlough scheme: key facts The UK government announced the employee scheme in March and has recently extended it until the end of October. 7.5 million workers and 1m businesses have been protected by the scheme across the UK. Already the UK government has received claims for more than \u00a310bn. Workers across the UK now have the peace of mind that they can receive 80% of wages \u2013 up to \u00a32,500 \u2013 until the end of October. This is part of the multi-billion pound package of support and loans that the UK government is making available to workers and businesses all across the UK.

We\u2019ve all got a common enemy in this virus; everybody has to do their individual and collective bit to overcome it.\u201d The government furlough scheme: key facts The UK government has extended the furlough scheme from the end of June until the end of October. 7.5 million workers and 1m businesses have been protected. Since the scheme was announced on 20 March, the UK government has received claims for more than \u00a310bn. The UK government has also provided the Welsh government with \u00a3730m to help fund business support grants and \u00a3635m for business rates relief.

      "bodyText": "Pictures of Donald Trump wearing a face mask while on a visit in Michigan have emerged. In a video published by Sky News, the US president can be seen wearing a navy blue mask. The images emerged after a state attorney general called Trump a \u201cpetulant child\u201d because he allegedly refused to wear the covering during a tour of a plant belonging to the Ford car company. Surrounded by Ford executives who were wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on earlier in the visit. \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d he said. Trump toured a plant belonging to Ford in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment to use in the coronavirus crisis. When asked whether Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, the Ford executive chairman, Bill Ford, said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to him.\u201d The company had indicated prior to the visit that the president should wear a mask at the factory. The Michigan state attorney general, Dana Nessel, had written to the White House saying it was the law in Michigan that everyone should wear a mask in such a setting \u2013 an indoor venue with many people in attendance. \u201cThe president is like a petulant child who refuses to follow the rules. This is not a joke,\u201d she told CNN, adding that Trump\u2019s behaviour was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d and that thousands of people in Michigan had died from coronavirus. The US death toll on Thursday surpassed 94,000 and there are more than 1.5m confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country. Trump said he had tested negative for Covid-19 on Thursday morning, but within the last week two senior White House aides have tested positive, and the president has been taking the drug hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic. This is despite it being not proven for treating the coronavirus, and stern warnings from federal regulators and the World Health Organization that it should not be taken for coronavirus outside clinical trials.",

      "body": "<p>If Wotsits still exist 30 years from now, I may eat one and be transported back to 2020. The moment that faux cheese umami hits my tongue, and I can feel my pupils dilate on reaching the gastronomic Shangri-La referred to by <a href=\"https://junkee.com/guy-fieri-meme-to-hero-charity-coronavirus/253484\">Guy Fieri as \u201cflavour town\u201d</a>, I\u2019ll fall down a rabbit hole of Zoom quizzes, hand sanitiser and unintelligible government briefings.</p> <p>It was never my plan to make Wotsits my own version of Proust\u2019s madeleine. If I had any real choice over which food would send me hurtling down a winding path of involuntary memory, it would probably be something fancy and literary, like fresh New England clams, or the first bite of a ripe Comice pear. But Wotsits it is. And probably spaghetti hoops, Dairylea triangles, and Penguin bars, too. Because global crises, it transpires, put me into a culinary regression, the likes of which I\u2019ve never known.</p> <p>Lockdown social media \u2013 as we all well know \u2013 is where you go to either check up on who\u2019s winning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/04/museum-covid-19-v-and-a-pandemic-coronavirus-objects\">war on Covid-19</a>, or to gaze upon people\u2019s perfect, freshly baked sourdough loaves. Or homemade dumplings. Or, generally, photogenic meals containing at least four types of vegetable. Which is all very inspiring and motivational (if not overwhelming) for someone like me, who is always looking to improve and diversify her cooking skills. Especially when I\u2019m increasingly opting for meals such as tinned spaghetti on toast. Because real comfort foods are the ones you remember.</p> <p>Tinned spaghetti on toast is something my grandma (who was a great cook, before old age and dementia) used to make me for lunch, when I\u2019d go and stay with her as a kid.

The moment that faux cheese umami hits my tongue, and I can feel my pupils dilate on reaching the gastronomic Shangri-La referred to by Guy Fieri as \u201cflavour town\u201d, I\u2019ll fall down a rabbit hole of Zoom quizzes, hand sanitiser and unintelligible government briefings. It was never my plan to make Wotsits my own version of Proust\u2019s madeleine. If I had any real choice over which food would send me hurtling down a winding path of involuntary memory, it would probably be something fancy and literary, like fresh New England clams, or the first bite of a ripe Comice pear. But Wotsits it is. And probably spaghetti hoops, Dairylea triangles, and Penguin bars, too. Because global crises, it transpires, put me into a culinary regression, the likes of which I\u2019ve never known. Lockdown social media \u2013 as we all well know \u2013 is where you go to either check up on who\u2019s winning the war on Covid-19, or to gaze upon people\u2019s perfect, freshly baked sourdough loaves. Or homemade dumplings. Or, generally, photogenic meals containing at least four types of vegetable. Which is all very inspiring and motivational (if not overwhelming) for someone like me, who is always looking to improve and diversify her cooking skills. Especially when I\u2019m increasingly opting for meals such as tinned spaghetti on toast. Because real comfort foods are the ones you remember. Tinned spaghetti on toast is something my grandma (who was a great cook, before old age and dementia) used to make me for lunch, when I\u2019d go and stay with her as a kid. And it\u2019s a carb-on-carb delight I can\u2019t remember tasting since my 90s childhood. Triple carb, actually, if you count all the sugar in the tomato sauce.

The notion of such a surcharge reeked of meanness of spirit, the demand that it increase from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624 stank. The hypocrisy was particularly pungent: even Scrooge didn\u2019t clap on the doorstep for those from whom he was squeezing every penny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Public patience for a government that is incompetent will not last long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clearly in-house genius Dominic Cummings is losing his touch if he didn\u2019t see that one coming. Of course, the surcharge policy would have to be ditched. No government could be on the wrong side of health and care workers during a pandemic that has the nation clinging to doctors and nurses as its only protection. That would be true of a government that was handling things well. But it is triply true of a government handling things badly.</p> <p>No need to dwell on the excess deaths number, which suggests Britain will soon have lost as many people to coronavirus as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/almost-55000-excess-uk-deaths-during-covid-19-outbreak-says-ons\">lost civilians</a> in the second world war. Contemplate instead the current situation, in which the government has already eased the lockdown in England and plans to ease it more on 1 June, even though it has not yet built a robust system that can find, test, trace and isolate new cases.</p> <p>Maybe it will all come good on the night. Perhaps at 11.55pm on 31 May, a breathless Matt Hancock will rush towards the Downing Street microphone to announce, still panting, that the contact-tracing app is online and the last contact-tracer is in place. But for now this looks like a government that has seen a cart and a horse and put them in the wrong order. Surely, the first move was to build the system that would keep the lid on any future outbreak and only then \u2013 once the app was tested and working, once the tracers were not merely recruited but fully trained, once the local health organisations best placed to run testing were involved \u2013 start lifting the restrictions that have kept the virus under relative control.</p> <p>Instead, the government is now hastily <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-easing-the-uk-out-of-lockdown-is-a-confidence-game-and-the-pm-is-losing-11991899\">changing its story</a>, explaining that an app previously touted as essential is now merely \u201cthe cherry on the cake\u201d, so there\u2019s no need for us to worry if it\u2019s not ready yet. The focus now, they tell us, is on those human contact tracers. Except they\u2019re not fully up to speed either. No wonder the NHS Confederation <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52748564\">is warning</a> of \u201ca second surge\u201d if the lockdown is eased any further.</p> <p>Cart-before-horse has become the repeating pattern. Johnson dumped the simple \u201cstay home\u201d advice for the opaque \u201cstay alert\u201d \u2013 prompting the number of Britons who regard the government\u2019s messaging as clear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/1263477716675973120?s=20\">to drop</a> from 90% to 56% \u2013 on 10 May while the daily death rate was still grievously high. He said people should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their workplaces, before those places had been retooled for physical distancing. The inevitable result was to nudge people back on to trains and buses \u2013 regardless of his suggestion that they should avoid public transport \u2013 before he\u2019d ensured a sufficient, accessible supply of the face masks that the best advice suggests are necessary for such travel. He\u2019s doing it again now on schools, announcing a return date of 1 June <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/05/reopening-schools-question-logistics-not-risks-teachers\">before</a> the extra teachers and classrooms are in place that would allow socially distanced teaching to be viable.</p> <p>Logic would dictate that you prepare first and, once that\u2019s done, you loosen the restrictions. Johnson\u2019s preferred method is to signal a relaxation, then scramble to put in place the mechanisms that might make that relaxation possible.</p> <p>The consequences of this \u201cact now, prepare later\u201d approach have been lethal. Witness the decision to release infected patients from hospital and back into care homes unequipped to receive them. Reporting by the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1263219921124720640?s=20\">shows</a> that the more expensive homes had the staff, and the space, to keep the virus at bay and keep their residents alive; the cheaper ones worked staff round the clock with no PPE, and the disease duly ran riot. Incredibly, those well-resourced homes kept their residents alive in part by defying government instructions, imposing an early lockdown when the official advice was to keep the doors open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/nhs-workers-bereavement-scheme-unfairness\">We forced the government to do right by NHS workers. Let\u2019s keep pressure on | Hassan Akkad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Add that to the long list of flawed decisions \u2013 the 11-day delay to lockdown, the football matches and concerts that were not stopped, the airports that remained (and still remain) open to unhindered arrivals from all over the world, the abandonment of contact tracing in mid-March \u2013 and it\u2019s no surprise that the British Medical Journal (BMJ) <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">declared</a> this week that \u201cthe UK\u2019s response so far has neither been well prepared nor remotely adequate\u201d. Some of that, the BMJ argues, goes back to decisions taken over several years, such as austerity and the \u201cdecimation\u201d of the country\u2019s local and regional public health capacity. That may predate Johnson\u2019s premiership, but it does not predate this government, which has been in power for a full 10 years. This is on them.</p> <p>So far the public has been patient. It has granted its leaders the benefit of the doubt, allowing that this is a global crisis not of their making. Crucially, it has wanted to believe that the government means well, even if it is stumbling. That\u2019s certainly been the perception of Johnson himself, who came so close to death at the hands of the virus. The surcharge row was a perilous moment because it shook that understanding, casting the government as lacking basic compassion.</p> <p>More such moments are coming. Why is it right that foreign-born porters, cleaners and care workers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1263501628692406272?s=20\">are excluded</a> from the automatic visa extension that has rightly been granted to doctors and nurses? Why is an army veteran who served this country, who worked and paid taxes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/british-army-veterans-children-call-on-government-to-waive-27000-nhs-bill\">landed</a> with a \u00a327,000 bill for treatment that would be free to everyone else? How could Johnson praise two migrant nurses for saving his life and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikegalsworthy/status/1263101739223232512?s=20\">say</a>, \u201cOn the other hand \u2026\u201d as he attempted to defend charging them to use the NHS they work for?</p> <p>He would be wise to learn the lesson of the reversal that was forced on him by an adroit Labour leader this week. Public patience for a government that is incompetent will not last long. But there will be no tolerance at all for a government that is both useless and cruel.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Clearly in-house genius Dominic Cummings is losing his touch if he didn\u2019t see that one coming. Of course, the surcharge policy would have to be ditched. No government could be on the wrong side of health and care workers during a pandemic that has the nation clinging to doctors and nurses as its only protection. That would be true of a government that was handling things well. But it is triply true of a government handling things badly. No need to dwell on the excess deaths number, which suggests Britain will soon have lost as many people to coronavirus as it lost civilians in the second world war. Contemplate instead the current situation, in which the government has already eased the lockdown in England and plans to ease it more on 1 June, even though it has not yet built a robust system that can find, test, trace and isolate new cases. Maybe it will all come good on the night. Perhaps at 11.55pm on 31 May, a breathless Matt Hancock will rush towards the Downing Street microphone to announce, still panting, that the contact-tracing app is online and the last contact-tracer is in place. But for now this looks like a government that has seen a cart and a horse and put them in the wrong order. Surely, the first move was to build the system that would keep the lid on any future outbreak and only then \u2013 once the app was tested and working, once the tracers were not merely recruited but fully trained, once the local health organisations best placed to run testing were involved \u2013 start lifting the restrictions that have kept the virus under relative control. Instead, the government is now hastily changing its story, explaining that an app previously touted as essential is now merely \u201cthe cherry on the cake\u201d, so there\u2019s no need for us to worry if it\u2019s not ready yet. The focus now, they tell us, is on those human contact tracers. Except they\u2019re not fully up to speed either. No wonder the NHS Confederation is warning of \u201ca second surge\u201d if the lockdown is eased any further. Cart-before-horse has become the repeating pattern. Johnson dumped the simple \u201cstay home\u201d advice for the opaque \u201cstay alert\u201d \u2013 prompting the number of Britons who regard the government\u2019s messaging as clear to drop from 90% to 56% \u2013 on 10 May while the daily death rate was still grievously high. He said people should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their workplaces, before those places had been retooled for physical distancing. The inevitable result was to nudge people back on to trains and buses \u2013 regardless of his suggestion that they should avoid public transport \u2013 before he\u2019d ensured a sufficient, accessible supply of the face masks that the best advice suggests are necessary for such travel. He\u2019s doing it again now on schools, announcing a return date of 1 June before the extra teachers and classrooms are in place that would allow socially distanced teaching to be viable. Logic would dictate that you prepare first and, once that\u2019s done, you loosen the restrictions. Johnson\u2019s preferred method is to signal a relaxation, then scramble to put in place the mechanisms that might make that relaxation possible. The consequences of this \u201cact now, prepare later\u201d approach have been lethal. Witness the decision to release infected patients from hospital and back into care homes unequipped to receive them. Reporting by the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall shows that the more expensive homes had the staff, and the space, to keep the virus at bay and keep their residents alive; the cheaper ones worked staff round the clock with no PPE, and the disease duly ran riot. Incredibly, those well-resourced homes kept their residents alive in part by defying government instructions, imposing an early lockdown when the official advice was to keep the doors open. Add that to the long list of flawed decisions \u2013 the 11-day delay to lockdown, the football matches and concerts that were not stopped, the airports that remained (and still remain) open to unhindered arrivals from all over the world, the abandonment of contact tracing in mid-March \u2013 and it\u2019s no surprise that the British Medical Journal (BMJ) declared this week that \u201cthe UK\u2019s response so far has neither been well prepared nor remotely adequate\u201d. Some of that, the BMJ argues, goes back to decisions taken over several years, such as austerity and the \u201cdecimation\u201d of the country\u2019s local and regional public health capacity. That may predate Johnson\u2019s premiership, but it does not predate this government, which has been in power for a full 10 years. This is on them. So far the public has been patient. It has granted its leaders the benefit of the doubt, allowing that this is a global crisis not of their making. Crucially, it has wanted to believe that the government means well, even if it is stumbling. That\u2019s certainly been the perception of Johnson himself, who came so close to death at the hands of the virus. The surcharge row was a perilous moment because it shook that understanding, casting the government as lacking basic compassion. More such moments are coming. Why is it right that foreign-born porters, cleaners and care workers are excluded from the automatic visa extension that has rightly been granted to doctors and nurses? Why is an army veteran who served this country, who worked and paid taxes, landed with a \u00a327,000 bill for treatment that would be free to everyone else? How could Johnson praise two migrant nurses for saving his life and then say, \u201cOn the other hand \u2026\u201d as he attempted to defend charging them to use the NHS they work for? He would be wise to learn the lesson of the reversal that was forced on him by an adroit Labour leader this week. Public patience for a government that is incompetent will not last long. But there will be no tolerance at all for a government that is both useless and cruel. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

UK operators have been closed since the end of March and will not be allowed to open to diners until at least 4 July, when the third step in the government\u2019s lockdown easing plan is due to take place, if progress in tackling the virus allows. Even then, businesses are expected to have to operate with strict physical-distancing rules, which are likely to dramatically affect profits. Carluccio\u2019s was founded by the late chef Antonio Carluccio in 1999 and was owned by Landmark Group, a Dubai-based retail and hospitality conglomerate.

We\u2019ll try and do more next week \u2026</p> <p>Dom Frey pays tribute to Anthony Partington, a witty English teacher, now head of Stamford Welland academy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inspirational, humorous, talented, witty and a brilliant teacher. As a disengaged student he captured my imagination with his passion for American lit texts and Shakespeare. He really brought them to life for me and completely challenged my (very limited at the time) world view that men could be sensitive, popular and educated at the same time. Sadly, I didn\u2019t grow up in the most diverse environment at the time! He was a breath of fresh air, never afraid to give an opinion or to challenge my personal mediocrity. He inspired me to go to university and be successful and engaging like him when all I wanted to do was coast through life as a 16 year old. <br> I\u2019m an English teacher now and I\u2019d like to think I rock a little bit of the party boy attitude and pedagogical style with my students as often as I can. I even find myself saying: \u201cwill ya bloody shoot oop!\u201d From time to time in his Wigan accent.   Thank you, Anthony. Legend!</p> </blockquote> <p>Laura Parker relives the heady days of Leeds in the 1980s:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Learning Spanish at Roundhay high with Mrs Dronfield changed my life. I went on to do Latin American Studies at university where I learnt Portuguese, spent a year in Brazil and was bitten by the travel bug. In the intervening three decades, I\u2019ve had the good fortune to live and work in many places \u2013 including for over 10 years in Bulgaria. There I met my Italian husband with whom I\u2019m now locked down in northern Italy.</p> <p>I can still muddle through a conversation in Spanish \u2013 which this weekend I will with my Spanish brother-in-law \u2013 and think of Mrs Dronfield every time I do. Thanks to her rigour, learning Italian was less painful than it might have been.</p> <p>I would just like her to know that in the hills of Piedmont here\u2019s an English woman speaking Italian and thinking of her brilliant Spanish teacher.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alison Leonard recalls a moral conundrum:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Olga Wilkinson inspired me. There were times when she discarded the syllabus entirely and challenged us directly with moral problems from history. For instance, when I declared myself a pacifist, she asked me whether, if I found myself standing next to Adolf Hitler and happened to have a gun on me, I would kill him and thus save millions of lives. (I was flummoxed, but went on to study philosophy at university.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Gillian Fitzgerald fondly remembers an early champion of equality in Liverpool:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We made xylophones in Mr Bleasdale\u2019s class. It was the age of sewing for girls, woodwork for boys, but not with Mr Bleasdale. I sawed, sanded and varnished pieces of wood, ready for Mr Bleasdale to tune each one. He drilled holes in each end, ready for twine to be threaded through. At last, our xylophones were ready. I\u2019ll never forget the thrill of playing a musical instrument I had made.</p> </blockquote> <p>Luke Bosman remembers language classes with Mike Clark:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was a shy lad who would naturally have preferred to sit unnoticed, to put my efforts into bookwork and to quietly succeed. Yet somehow he took this boy with a speech impediment (one of the reasons why I hated to speak) and helped me to grow in confidence, such that by the time I had finished my A-levels, for which he had also been one of my Russian teachers, I could speak confidently.</p> <p>When I qualified as a teacher, I had an interview at a school where, unbeknown to me, he was the head of department. One of the interview questions was, \u201cWhat motivated you to become a teacher?\u201d I was obliged to answer that my inspiration was sitting to the headteacher\u2019s left. I didn\u2019t get the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jerry Goddard goes back 50 years to a history class in Bedfordshire in the 1960s:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Patrick \u2018Harry\u2019 Eavis treated every pupil as if you were three-five years older than you were. Talk about high expectations. \u2018So retell the Martin Luther / Diet of Worms impasse with the pope. But why not turn your A4 page sideways and do it in an eight caption comic book style?\u2019 It made you pr\u00e9cis in a really creative way. I can remember him playing the violin and joining us sixth formers in carol singing, raising money for Oxfam. He was a liberal socialist and believed in community. <br> Did it do mean me any good? Well I\u2019m 67 and now retired after a lifelong career in education including teaching, training, writing, advising, directing and now a member of the board of a local university. What success I\u2019ve had in my career was because of trying to emulate his style.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Where was the Upside?</h2> <p>In the race for vaccines: eight volunteers produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/astrazeneca-could-supply-potential-coronavirus-vaccine-from-september\">Covid-19 antibodies</a> in a US vaccine trial, the first human trial results.

Homo sapiens got where they did by being cooperative and collaborative, and we\u2019ve seen that on a daily basis: the seed sharers, mask weavers, happy clappers, valiant volunteers, community choirs and online orchestras. Long story short, community is back. And in two weeks\u2019 time, we are going to explore this more deeply in a livestreamed event to which you are cordially invited. Book early to avoid disappointment \u2013 and in this new era of community spirit, get one for your neighbour too. You can also help us out in advance by telling us about your community hero, someone who has been good to have around in a crisis. In return, I hereby summarise the best of all the optimism on the Guardian site this week: How Covid-19 could transform one of the dirtiest industries \u2013 aviation. Three-minute read. (Part of a new mini-series.) The end of plastic? Plant-based bottles that degrade in a year. Two-minute read. How to hire a goat for your Zoom conference call: 90 seconds of silliness. The four-day week \u2013 a solution for New Zealand? One-minute read. London\u2019s post-lockdown pedestrian push. Two-minute read. The Parisians rescuing \u2026 office plants? One-minute to leaf through. Back to school? What Denmark can teach others. Two-minute lesson. A big change for organ donation. Two-minute read. Sudoku becomes a spectator sport. Quick read or long watch. Taiwan: 24 million people, 440 cases, and only seven deaths. How? Two-minute read. The Chinese man abducted as a toddler, reunited with his parents 32 years later. One-minute read, 45-second video. Lucky numbers One in six Londoners may have already had coronavirus. That\u2019s more than a million people who now hopefully benefit from some kind of immunity. About 6,000 have died in hospitals, many more in the community. But that\u2019s still a mortality rate of well under 1%. Meanwhile, there have been sharp falls in carbon emissions through the pandemic \u2013 double-digit declines in many places. What we liked We loved this NPR piece, which suggests that we could all learn a few things from Senegal\u2019s admirable approach to Covid 19. Good things come to those who wait for marshmallows. Sound advice from Arthur Brooks in the Atlantic. Also interesting to read this piece about advertising and good news. Perhaps we need a sponsor for the Upside weekly newsletter \u2026 What we heard We had hundreds of responses to our teacher herogram callout, and I\u2019m really sorry that we can\u2019t feature them all. We\u2019ll try and do more next week \u2026 Dom Frey pays tribute to Anthony Partington, a witty English teacher, now head of Stamford Welland academy: Inspirational, humorous, talented, witty and a brilliant teacher. As a disengaged student he captured my imagination with his passion for American lit texts and Shakespeare. He really brought them to life for me and completely challenged my (very limited at the time) world view that men could be sensitive, popular and educated at the same time. Sadly, I didn\u2019t grow up in the most diverse environment at the time! He was a breath of fresh air, never afraid to give an opinion or to challenge my personal mediocrity. He inspired me to go to university and be successful and engaging like him when all I wanted to do was coast through life as a 16 year old. I\u2019m an English teacher now and I\u2019d like to think I rock a little bit of the party boy attitude and pedagogical style with my students as often as I can. I even find myself saying: \u201cwill ya bloody shoot oop!\u201d From time to time in his Wigan accent. Thank you, Anthony. Legend! Laura Parker relives the heady days of Leeds in the 1980s: Learning Spanish at Roundhay high with Mrs Dronfield changed my life. I went on to do Latin American Studies at university where I learnt Portuguese, spent a year in Brazil and was bitten by the travel bug. In the intervening three decades, I\u2019ve had the good fortune to live and work in many places \u2013 including for over 10 years in Bulgaria. There I met my Italian husband with whom I\u2019m now locked down in northern Italy. I can still muddle through a conversation in Spanish \u2013 which this weekend I will with my Spanish brother-in-law \u2013 and think of Mrs Dronfield every time I do. Thanks to her rigour, learning Italian was less painful than it might have been. I would just like her to know that in the hills of Piedmont here\u2019s an English woman speaking Italian and thinking of her brilliant Spanish teacher. Alison Leonard recalls a moral conundrum: Olga Wilkinson inspired me. There were times when she discarded the syllabus entirely and challenged us directly with moral problems from history. For instance, when I declared myself a pacifist, she asked me whether, if I found myself standing next to Adolf Hitler and happened to have a gun on me, I would kill him and thus save millions of lives. (I was flummoxed, but went on to study philosophy at university.) Gillian Fitzgerald fondly remembers an early champion of equality in Liverpool: We made xylophones in Mr Bleasdale\u2019s class. It was the age of sewing for girls, woodwork for boys, but not with Mr Bleasdale. I sawed, sanded and varnished pieces of wood, ready for Mr Bleasdale to tune each one. He drilled holes in each end, ready for twine to be threaded through. At last, our xylophones were ready. I\u2019ll never forget the thrill of playing a musical instrument I had made. Luke Bosman remembers language classes with Mike Clark: I was a shy lad who would naturally have preferred to sit unnoticed, to put my efforts into bookwork and to quietly succeed. Yet somehow he took this boy with a speech impediment (one of the reasons why I hated to speak) and helped me to grow in confidence, such that by the time I had finished my A-levels, for which he had also been one of my Russian teachers, I could speak confidently. When I qualified as a teacher, I had an interview at a school where, unbeknown to me, he was the head of department. One of the interview questions was, \u201cWhat motivated you to become a teacher?\u201d I was obliged to answer that my inspiration was sitting to the headteacher\u2019s left. I didn\u2019t get the job. Jerry Goddard goes back 50 years to a history class in Bedfordshire in the 1960s: Patrick \u2018Harry\u2019 Eavis treated every pupil as if you were three-five years older than you were. Talk about high expectations. \u2018So retell the Martin Luther / Diet of Worms impasse with the pope. But why not turn your A4 page sideways and do it in an eight caption comic book style?\u2019 It made you pr\u00e9cis in a really creative way. I can remember him playing the violin and joining us sixth formers in carol singing, raising money for Oxfam. He was a liberal socialist and believed in community. Did it do mean me any good? Well I\u2019m 67 and now retired after a lifelong career in education including teaching, training, writing, advising, directing and now a member of the board of a local university. What success I\u2019ve had in my career was because of trying to emulate his style. Where was the Upside? In the race for vaccines: eight volunteers produced Covid-19 antibodies in a US vaccine trial, the first human trial results. And there was more positive vaccine news besides. Also plenty of potential in our young sportswriter of the year competition. Get your kids writing! Oh, and happy birthday, Pac-Man! Thanks for reading. Nominate the people who could be Covid-19 heroes, just for one day. Enjoy the weekend, but not too much.",

\n <h2 class=\"block-title\">A short summary of how the jobkeeper numbers changed</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a short summary of how the jobkeeper muck up happened:</p> \n  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, announces jobkeeper on 30 March:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cToday, I announce that we are committing $130bn over the next six months to support the jobs and livelihoods of what we anticipate are being almost <strong>six million</strong> Australians, who will need that lifeline in the months ahead.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Around 900,000 employers and sole traders express interest, and then enrolments commence in mid-April.</p> \n  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, reports on 24 April that around 400,000 employers, covering 2.5 million employees have enrolled.</p> \n  <p>In his address to parliament on 12 May, Frydenberg says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cThere are now more than 835,000 businesses employing more than 5.5 million workers who are formally enrolled in the program.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then on 14 May, the treasurer announces the number of people on jobkeeper \u201cnow exceeds six million\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, after collecting the tax file numbers and other information on eligible employees, the ATO begins paying out jobkeeper earlier this

That 1.3 million figure brings the unemployment rate to just under 10%.</p> \n  <p>It is suddenly looking like that unofficial unemployment rate just got a lot more official.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:13:31.722Z\">at 6.13am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75c7f8f0864e579f15967\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:01:03.525Z\">6.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is a pretty fair take:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lucethoughts/status/1263693519245291522\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Journalists stoked to learn they are no longer the worst at maths.</p>\u2014 Lucy Carter (@lucethoughts) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucethoughts/status/1263693519245291522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:11:41.142Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75c328f0864e579f15965\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:59:52.197Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As has <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>:<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/1263695310955544577\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow.<br><br>Suddenly $60b in already-budgeted funds available.<br><br>Let\u2019s:<br>- extend JobKeeper to all who need it, inc all casuals<br>- keep new JobSeeker rate <br>- have Jobs &amp; Income Guarantee for young people<br>- fund nation-building planet-saving projects to recover.<br><br>How would you spend $60b? <a href=\"https://t.co/McxLg7ou9V\">https://t.co/McxLg7ou9V</a></p>\u2014 Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/1263695310955544577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75c0c8f08a1782fa7f676\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:59:12.792Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>has already responded:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Another day, another shambles from a treasurer who just can\u2019t stop seriously stuffing up this key program. </p> \n   <p>This just shows you can\u2019t trust a hopeless government with a good idea like wage subsidies for workers. </p> \n   <p>After all the lectures about fiscal responsibility, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have had to admit to getting their numbers wrong by $60bn.</p> \n   <p>For weeks they\u2019ve been telling casuals and others that the program was full when in reality they were 3 million workers short. </p> \n   <p>If they can\u2019t get this basic maths right how can we expect them to get the recovery right?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:11:12.483Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75bcb8f08a1782fa7f675\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:58:19.513Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>has announced another doorstop on the back of the jobkeeper reporting screw-up news.</p> \n  <p>He\u2019ll be up at 3.45pm.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:10:32.095Z\">at 6.10am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75a448f0864e579f15962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:52:05.867Z\">5.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Not only is that $60bn now free, Australia\u2019s short- to medium-term economic outlooks, from the RBA to the government itself, have been based on $130bn being spent.

Instead of reporting how many employees were eligible, businesses reported how much they expected to receive for their employees.</p> \n  <p>In that way, one became 1,500.</p> \n  <p>We are not joking. Here is the official release.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Joint media release with the Australian Taxation Office</strong></p> \n  <p>Late yesterday, the ATO and Treasury advised the Government of a reporting error in estimates of the number of employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>The enrolment forms completed by 910,055 businesses who have self\u2011assessed as eligible under the scheme had indicated that this program would cover around 6.5 million eligible employees. <br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The ATO\u2019s review of these forms has found that around 1,000 of those businesses appear to have made significant errors when reporting the estimate of eligible employees on their enrolment form. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>The most common error was that instead of reporting the number of employees they expected to be eligible, they reported the amount of assistance they expected to receive. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>For example, over 500 businesses with \u20181\u2019 eligible employee reported a figure of \u20181,500\u2019 (which is the amount of JobKeeper payment they would expect to receive for each fortnight for that employee).</strong></p> \n  <p>This reporting error has come to light as the ATO and Treasury have been analysing the amounts being paid out under the scheme, reconciling these with the estimates provided by enrolled businesses of the likely number of eligible employees. It was not picked up by the ATO earlier as their primary focus in the first fortnight of JobKeeper payments was on ensuring that JobKeeper payments were paid promptly to those eligible for them, and not paid to those who were ineligible. These initial estimates from businesses of employees covered are not linked to payments, and so were not as carefully analysed.</p> \n  <p>Importantly this reporting error has no consequences for JobKeeper payments that have already been made to eligible businesses, as payments under the scheme depend on the subsequent declaration that an eligible business makes in relation to each and every eligible employee. This declaration does not involve estimates and requires an employer to provide the tax file number for each eligible employee. By contrast, the only use of the information collected in respect of the reporting error was to provide an early estimate of the number of expected employees likely to access the JobKeeper program.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:46:18.116Z\">at 5.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec756488f08a1782fa7f661\"

from stable to negative, but maintains its AAA rating from the Fitch ratings agency.</p> \n  <p>Ratings like this dictate how easy it for countries to borrow money, as well as the interest rates on those borrowings.</p> \n  <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> \n  <p>Fitch said it expects Australia\u2019s economic growth will fall sharply in 2020 and government spending in response to the health and economic crisis will cause large fiscal deficits and a sharp increase in government debt.</p> \n  <p>It forecast the $2tn economy to contract 5% this year driven by a plunge in economic activity during the second quarter due to virus containment measures.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile these measures have effectively curbed the spread of the virus, they also constrained household consumption and reduced business sentiment and investment,\u201d Fitch said. </p> \n  <p>It expects a gradual economic recovery to begin in the second half of 2020 affirmed Australia\u2019s rating but said a downgrade is possible in the absence of a fiscal consolidation strategy or if there is economic or financial sector distress.</p> \n  <p>Fitch said fiscal deficits are set to swell at both the federal and state levels as a result of the discretionary fiscal measures such as the jobkeeper wage subsidy program and economic contraction. </p> \n  <p>It forecast the government deficit to rise to 6.9% of GDP in 2019-20 and 9.0% in 2020-21, from 1.2% in 2018-19.</p> \n  <p>Fitch\u2019s move follows a similar action by S&amp;P Global Ratings in April, when it downgraded the outlook on Australia from stable to negative as a result of the government\u2019s stimulus measures. <br></p> \n  <p>The federal treasurer,<strong> Josh Frydenberg</strong>, said Fitch\u2019s action is a reminder of the importance of maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur measures are temporary, targeted and proportionate to the challenge we face and will ensure Australia bounces back stronger on the other side, without undermining the structural integrity of the budget which Australians have worked so hard to restore,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n </div> \n <p

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we will leave the live blog for Friday night. In case you missed it, these were the biggest news events of the day: After a reporting error, the government revised down the number of jobkeeper recipients from 6.5 million to 3.5 million, cutting the cost of the $130bn program by $60bn. Clive Palmer said he plans to take Western Australia to the high court over being refused entry to the state. Restrictions were eased in South Australia, allowing people to return to pubs. NSW announced plans to allow up to 50 people in pubs, clubs and restaurants from 1 June. Australia\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 101. Wesfarmers announced up to 75 Target stores will close. If you want to keep track of the latest coronavirus news globally, please check out our other live blog. Until tomorrow, stay safe. What a difference a day makes. Here\u2019s a short summary of how the jobkeeper muck up happened: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announces jobkeeper on 30 March: \u201cToday, I announce that we are committing $130bn over the next six months to support the jobs and livelihoods of what we anticipate are being almost six million Australians, who will need that lifeline in the months ahead.\u201d Around 900,000 employers and sole traders express interest, and then enrolments commence in mid-April. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, reports on 24 April that around 400,000 employers, covering 2.5 million employees have enrolled. In his address to parliament on 12 May, Frydenberg says: \u201cThere are now more than 835,000 businesses employing more than 5.5 million workers who are formally enrolled in the program.\u201d Then on 14 May, the treasurer announces the number of people on jobkeeper \u201cnow exceeds six million\u201d. Meanwhile, after collecting the tax file numbers and other information on eligible employees, the ATO begins paying out jobkeeper earlier this month. Three fortnights of payments have been made so far, and the next is set to be paid by Sunday. It is then that the ATO realises it is paying out much less than expected, and goes back to check the numbers. The total number of employers is right, but the employees is way down. The ATO determines it was an incorrect response on the enrolment form that led to massively inflated employee numbers. So it\u2019s not clear how the original number was determined, but I am sure there will be questions on it soon. The mining magnate and former senator Clive Palmer says he is planning to take Western Australia to the high court over the state\u2019s hard border closure, after being refused entry. Australian stock market closes for the week, via AAP: The ASX has finished the week on a sour note, dropping 53.4 points with every sector except tech stocks closing lower. The Australian share market has closed lower, rejecting a move above 5,600 as traders turned cautious amid fresh US-China tensions. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Friday down 53.4 points, or 0.96%, at 5,497 points, while the broader All Ordinaries closed down 52.2 points, or 0.92%, to 5,608.7. The Australian dollar was buying 65.36 US cents, down from 65.71 US cents at the close of trade on Thursday. The Australian Services Union is calling on the jobkeeper payment to be expanded now there\u2019s a lot less money being spent than forecast. The assistant national secretary of the union, Linda White, said the payment should be extended to employees who were excluded because of the ownership structure of their employer, such as dnata and Air Niugini. \u201cThey should have access to the same financial support as other Australians,\u201d White said. \u201cDnata employees have been stood down without pay since March and are struggling to put food on the table for their families. It doesn\u2019t need to be this way. \u201cClearly there are now unspent resources that the government can use to make sure every Australian, regardless of the ownership structure of their employer, is supported through unprecedented economic turmoil.\u201d The government is still being cagey on whether jobkeeper should be expanded, but said this last week: A lot of questions as to how the government estimated, on 30 March and before employers filled out forms, the scheme would cost $130bn and cover around 6 million employees. I do not know, but I will try to find out. Good evening, everyone. This is the question on jobkeeper forms that caught up around 1,000 employers. In some cases, employers put down they had 1,500 employees when they had just one. With that press conference over, I\u2019ll leave you with my colleague Josh Taylor. Thanks for reading. On the form, Hirschhorn says: \u201cWith hindsight, perhaps the form could have been more straightforward. \u201cHowever, I do note that only 1,000 of the 900,000 employers misinterpreted that question.\u201d Hirschhorn says this is how the tax office figured out the mistake: \u201cAt the start of this week, identifying that there was a discrepancy between the two numbers, the 6.5 million estimate and the 3 million or so applications we had already finalised and had been paying out, we decided to investigate and we identified the difference between the two was due, almost entirely, to misunderstanding of the question of the number of employees and people filling in, for example, 1,500 instead of 1.\u201d Hirschhorn says about 1,000 businesses misunderstood a question where the ATO asked how many workers the business expected would receive the jobkeeper subsidy. He says that the questions was only for analysis purposes, and had no bearing on how much money was paid to businesses. He says \u201cthe largest mistake\u201d was \u201cabout 550 employers, instead of putting down one employee, put down 1,500 employees being the amount that they were entitled to in the first fortnight\u201d. The original forecast predicted 6.5 million people on the program. Noting the lower number who are receiving the subsidy, Hirschhorn says \u201cwhat this shows is that the economy has been more resilient than anticipated in the original estimates, which is good news\u201d. He says: \u201cSo the difference is a large difference \u2013 the difference between 6.5 million and 3.5 million.\u201d Jeremy Hirschhorn, second commissioner at the Australian Taxation Office, is addressing the media about the jobkeeper package. He says 900,000 businesses have enrolled and 750,000 businesses have finalised their applications, which means the program is supporting 3 million people through the program. \u201cThere are another 150,000 employers who have not yet finalised their applications, and we are expecting that there will be another 500-600,000 employees supported under the jobkeeper program,\u201d he says. Pubs had previously been excluded from rules that allowed restaurants to reopen. But the rules caused confusion, prompting the premier Steven Marshall to announce a u-turn on that decision this afternoon. Labor frontbenchers Jim Chalmers, Tony Burke and Brendan O\u2019Connor have issued a statement on the jobkeeper blunder. Today the Morrison government has been forced to admit it has again seriously stuffed-up the roll out of the jobkeeper program. This is a humiliating confession that the PM and treasurer were wrong by 3 million workers and $60bn dollars. This just shows that you can\u2019t trust a hopeless government with a good idea like wage subsidies for workers. For weeks the Morrison government has been telling casuals and other excluded workers that the jobkeeper program was full when in reality it was 3 million workers short. After all the lectures about fiscal responsibility, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have admitted to getting their numbers wrong by $60bn. If they can\u2019t get this basic maths right how can we expect them to get the recovery right? Millions of Australians are being deliberately left out and left behind by this Morrison government. This kind of serious economic incompetence is a threat to jobs, the economy and the recovery. Jobkeeper applications only opened on 20 April. The Greens education spokeswoman, Mehreen Faruqi, says: The higher education sector is shedding jobs and crying out for support. It\u2019s time to scrap the unfair rules excluding university staff from jobkeeper. Desperate international students, who have been going hungry and falling into destitution, should urgently be given access to jobkeeper and provided with income support. As some commentators have noted, the government said the package would cost $130bn in March when it was announced. \u201cAt a cost of $130bn over the next six months, we are providing support to the Australian worker like never before,\u201d Josh Frydenberg said at the time. \u201cExtraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.\u201d Here is our story from 30 March. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert says: The revised jobkeeper figures released today mean that the government has no excuse to return the jobseeker payment to $40 a day at the end of September. Further, the government can top up the DSP and carer payments so that disabled people and carers can meet the additional costs they are facing because of the pandemic. No one in a country as wealthy as Australia should be living in poverty and cutting income support payments to those who need it most is a choice, not an inevitability. Today marks the first day since the widespread shutdown of sport that community football clubs in NSW will be able to participate in training, potentially paving the way for a weekend of play, albeit heavily restricted, in parks across the state this weekend. Competition matches remain off limits for the time being, including friendly matches as part of training, and all sessions will have to adhere to the guidelines set out by the NSW public health order. That means a limit of 10 participants in a session, including coaches, and no spectators \u2013 parents cannot hang about to watch. Change rooms will remain closed and contact is still forbidden under the guidelines, so tackling is also off limits. But at least training drills can be run, and fitness and skill levels worked on. A return to full match play has yet to be announced in NSW, but Victoria has already pencilled in 28 June, and Queensland 12 June. Football NSW said it was committed to ensuring competitive play can resume \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \u201cWe are engaging with the NSW government as to when we may be able return to competitive play and management is currently developing a set of return-to-play guidelines which we will shortly forward to the appropriate authorities,\u201d a statement read. It\u2019s a similar situation for Australian rules football in NSW, with a return to club-sanctioned small group training at community level in the state endorsed as of yesterday. Rugby league training is still some way off with the NSWRL having indicated a return from 1 July, with a view to competition resuming from 18 July. Stay tuned. Albanese says the government should have had \u201cin place basic mechanisms to check on the forms that were coming in\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the extent of this miscalculation, the fact that many businesses who should have put down one instead put down 1,500.\u201d Albanese contrasts the error to \u201cthe government\u2019s actions when it comes to robodebt, whereby people who made an error on a document got letters, got chased up,\u201d in some cases for money which they did not even owe. Albanese says it is \u201cjust absurd for the government to say that it is not responsible\u201d. \u201cThe idea that we will ever again listen to Josh Frydenberg and think that he has any credibility at all is gone,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bloke in the government who produced mugs saying the budget was already back in black when that simply was not true \u2013 that mistake, and error of judgment, has been blown out of the water by this. \u201cThey said they couldn\u2019t expand the program because they\u2019d drawn a line in the sand. What we know now is that that sand was, indeed, quicksand.\u201d He adds: \u201cCan you imagine what the Coalition would be saying if this were a Labor government? Can you imagine what some of the media outlet headlines would be tomorrow if this was a Labor government?\u201d Albanese notes those who have missed out on the jobkeeper wage subsidy. \u201cWhere there are 1 million casual workers who have not received support,\u201d he says. \u201cLocal government workers who have not received support. \u201cEntire sectors such as the arts and entertainment sector who have not received support. \u201cAt the same time, this smug government has, time after time, repeated figures that are wrong to the tune of $60bn, and wrong to the tune of 3 million workers.\u201d Meanwhile, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has addressed the media in Sydney. Albanese says the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has lost all credibility. \u201cThe government\u2019s extraordinary revelations \u2013 that it isn\u2019t 6.5 million people who are on jobkeeper, but 3.5 million. it\u2019s not a $130bn cost, but $70bn \u2013 blows any previous mistake when it comes to economic figures in Australian history right out of the water,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a mistake you could have seen from space, and this is a government that couldn\u2019t run a bath, let alone be good economic managers.\u201d Will the reporting error impact the accuracy of the unemployment rate? The treasurer says: As you know, in the statement put out by Treasury and the tax office, they\u2019ve made it very clear that the forecast remains for unemployment to peak at around 10% in this June quarter, but for the jobkeeper payment you are talking about the unemployment rate being another 10 percentage points higher, so it is having a very significant and positive effect. Karvelas puts Frydenberg\u2019s \u201cdraw the line somewhere\u201d quote to him. The line is a lot different now, she says. Shouldn\u2019t the government reconsider who receives jobkeeper? In short, no, Frydenberg says. \u201cAgain, we\u2019ve been entirely consistent \u2013 the jobkeeper program and the jobseeker programs are to work in complement to each other,\u201d he says. Karvelas changes tack slightly. Does Frydenberg think the government can go back to the old jobseeker payment rate. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve always been consistent that the programs that we\u2019re implementing \u2013 namely the jobseeker coronavirus supplement that you are referring to, the extra $550 \u2013 that\u2019s temporary,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was for the six-month period to reflect the problems ...\u201d Frydenberg is asked if he takes responsibility for the revised cost. He dodges the question. \u201cThe ATO and the Treasury have made it clear what has occurred here,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was an unintentional reporting error by about 1,000 businesses and I\u2019m sure those businesses ...\u201d Frydenberg continues: No doubt the Labor party will say, \u2018Go and spend it more here or there.\u2019 The Labor party have never seen a spending proposal they haven\u2019t supported, and a tax that they haven\u2019t increased. \u201cWe are a lot more principled and a lot more disciplined in relation to spending. Frydenberg has been stressing that this is not an \u201cinvitation to spend more money\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not making wholesale changes to the jobkeeper program,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a review, as we\u2019ve always stated, midway through the program, and we\u2019ll wait for the results of that review.\u201d Karvelas says that the discrepancy was not just a reporting error, but also a forecasting error. Frydenberg says officials \u201calso expected the economy to deteriorate further than it has\u201d. \u201cSo that\u2019s why this is good news for the taxpayer, because the jobkeeper program \u2013 indeed, our coronavirus economic initiatives all involve borrowed money and therefore this is not an invitation to spend more money, but rather to ensure that the program gets to those people who need it most.\u201d The treasurer is asked why the mistake wasn\u2019t picked up. Frydenberg says the tax office and the Treasury have put out an \u201cextensive statement tonight to explain what actually occurred, and it seems that some 1,000 businesses have made an unintentional reporting error in their enrolments for the jobkeeper program\u201d. \u201cImportantly, there was no money that was sent out that shouldn\u2019t have been sent out. There was no underpayments, there was no overpayments. \u201cBut in Treasury\u2019s, and the tax office\u2019s, initial estimation as to how many people were covered by the jobkeeper program, they\u2019ve had to revise that downwards in light of discovering this reporting error.\u201d The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is on the ABC with Patricia Karvelas. He is trying to spin the revelation as good news. \u201cWe are very pleased that the jobkeeper is supporting some 3 million employees according to the tax office. What has occurred is good news. \u201cWe are using billions of dollars, yes, because the economy has not deteriorated by as much as Treasury forecast. This is all borrowed money.\u201d Universities Australia is also out of the blocks with a statement. Its chief executive, Catriona Jackson, says: \u201cAs we have said in recent weeks, without greater support universities face the loss of 21,000 jobs in the next six months and a significant reduction in the essential research undertaken on our campuses. \u201cWe were disappointed that government has changed the regulations on a number of occasions to effectively exclude universities. \u201cWe call on them to reconsider. \u201cAustralia will need even more new ideas, new skills and new jobs to power economic and community recovery. Universities are the engine rooms of that renewal.\u201d Me too. The Greens arts spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, says: The massive revision on jobkeeper numbers today leaves the government with no excuse not to extend the program to casuals, migrant workers and workers in the arts and entertainment industry who have been excluded from the program.\u201d There is now $60bn already budgeted for jobkeeper that can go to saving more jobs. The arts and entertainment industry has been one of the hardest hit by coronavirus restrictions and will be one of the last to recover, yet the government has left many artists and creatives without support due to the nature of the work. The arts and entertainment industry needs a tailored package to save it and the government clearly has the financial capacity to do it. Josh Frydenberg is coming up on the ABC shortly. No doubt he will be asked about his comments from last month. Frydenberg said shorter-term Australian casual workers would be eligible for the $1,100 fortnightly jobseeker payment instead, while temporary visa-holders could access their superannuation, continue to work or return home. \u201cAt $130bn \u2026 we had to draw the line somewhere. This is a massive call on the public purse and it is a debt that the country will pay for years to come and at six million people on the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s nearly half the Australian workforce.\u201d Alison McMillan says what is \u201creally important for us now is not to drop the ball\u201d. \u201cWe have seen evidence and pictures in the news and on the television of those who have clearly, quite quickly, moved back to the old ways of doing things and we must all follow the important physical distancing rules.\u201d Alison McMillan says there are 39 people who are still in hospital and seven of those are in intensive care. Alison McMillan, the Australian government\u2019s chief nursing and midwifery officer, is providing the daily Covid-19 update. She says there have been 6,479 people who have recovered from Covid-19 in Australia, which she describes as a \u201creally, really encouraging number\u201d. There are currently 506 active cases. In the past 24 hours, there have been 15 new cases and one additional death reported across the country. The statement from the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, begins with a one-word sentence. \u201cWow.\u201d \u201cNow Scott Morrison has no excuse not to extend jobkeeper to all who need it, retain the new jobseeker rate, give a jobs and income guarantee to young people and invest in nation-building planet-saving projects to help the recovery.\u201d Before the \u201creporting error\u201d, the Greens wanted the government to extend jobkeeper to all who need it, including all casuals, keep the boosted rate of jobseeker, and fund a jobs and income guarantee for young people. GetUp\u2019s national director, Paul Oosting, says in a statement: Instead of cutting jobkeeper, why not expand it to all the casuals and people on temporary visas who need it? The funds are literally all there. Jobkeeper was proof that the money for social spending was always there, there\u2019s no justification to cut these vital funds that are keeping food on the table for families across the country. We\u2019ve heard devastating stories of people turning to the generosity of local restaurants providing free food to eat, families who have called Australia home for years now facing homelessness, and workers who\u2019ve lost their jobs, with no way to return home. This has been one of the government\u2019s biggest policy failures in this pandemic, now they have the opportunity to step up and do the right thing. If Scott Morrison doesn\u2019t use this opportunity to extend jobkeeper to casual workers and people on temporary visas then he cannot say it\u2019s because of the cost. Clive Palmer has been denied entry to Western Australia as the state government remains adamant interstate borders will remain closed for months, AAP reports. Palmer wanted to visit WA for meetings with businesspeople, senator Mathias Cormann and potential 2021 state election candidates for his United Australia party but was knocked back. A spokesman told AAP he had commenced a high court challenge to the border closure and would cite a section of the constitution that stipulates trade between states must be free. Palmer accused the premier, Mark McGowan, of \u201cdenying Western Australians jobs and prosperity\u201d by refusing to open interstate borders. \u201cHe risks economic shutdown with his gestapo tactics,\u201d the Queensland-based billionaire said in a statement. McGowan batted away \u201cbullying\u201d from the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, over interstate borders earlier this week, saying he wouldn\u2019t take advice from the state at the centre of the Ruby Princess debacle. WA\u2019s chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, says it will take at least one month to confirm community spread had been eliminated in affected jurisdictions and until then opening interstate borders was not recommended. Meanwhile, McGowan remains under pressure to fully reopen intrastate travel after WA\u2019s 13 regions were slashed to four vast areas on Monday. The state Liberal leader, Liza Harvey, labelled his stance on intrastate borders \u201cnonsensical\u201d, given Perth residents could cram on to public transport but not visit northern regions or the Goldfields. \u201cEvery day the premier dithers, another West Australian small business closes its doors,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cOur tourism industry is on its knees.\u201d The health minister, Roger Cook, said on Thursday federal biosecurity zones had complicated reopening regional borders, but the police commissioner was working with the state solicitor\u2019s office on dismantling them. Only three active cases of coronavirus remained in WA as of Thursday. We touched on this issue earlier this month. Here is what Paul Karp reported on 4 May: On Friday Scott Morrison gave an update of the number of employers enrolled in the jobkeeper program, but didn\u2019t know how many employees are receiving the payment. A spokesman for the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Guardian Australia that as of midday Friday the figure was \u201c740,871 employers covering more than 4.4m employees\u201d. The $130bn wage subsidy program can cover up to 6m employees, but Morrison gave some pretty big hints if it falls short of that the program won\u2019t be expanded. He said: And at this point it is too early to make estimates about what the final reconciliation would be against the budgeted amount. And there are many calls, there are many calls on the budget in relation to Covid-19 and we do see some movement between jobseeker and jobkeeper. Remember the jobseeker payments, that costing related to the additional payment and there is also the uplift in costs for the commonwealth in relation to many other welfare payments that are happening at the moment as well, what\u2019s called the automatic stabilisers. So I can assure you the commonwealth will be footing \u2013 that is, the commonwealth taxpayer \u2013 will be footing a very big bill and they understand that. And that\u2019s why every single element of that we are considering very carefully and we\u2019ve set the parameters for jobkeeper and for jobseeker and we have no plans to change that, apart from the administrative changes like the ones the treasurer announced last week. An observation from the former Labor government adviser Sean Kelly. And this is an interesting point from the Grattan Institute\u2019s Danielle Wood. Seems quite straightforward, no? Hi everyone, this is Luke Henriques-Gomes taking over from Amy Remeikis. Thanks to Amy for her work. I\u2019ll take you through the afternoon. As Amy said, there is a national health update on the way. And I\u2019m sure there will be some more reaction to news that a reporting error means the cost of the jobkeeper package was overstated by $60bn. Yes, I\u2019m still digesting this, too. And on that note, I\u2019ll hand the blog over to Luke Henriques-Gomes for the next part of the day. There is a national health update coming in the next 20 minutes or so and, of course, the continued fallout from Treasury and the ATO\u2019s \u2018reporting error\u2019 bombshell. I\u2019ll be back on Monday. Have a wonderful weekend, and take care of you. Suddenly, the official unemployment figures look real hazy too. They were based on 6 million Australians being on jobkeeper. It turns out that there are only 3.5 million on jobkeeper. We have heard a lot in recent days, including from the Treasury secretary, the government and business groups, just how much worse the unemployment figure would have been if jobkeeper wasn\u2019t helping keep 6 million Australians in contact with their employers. But suddenly that number is 3.5 million. Which means the 500,000 or so Australians who just dropped out of the labour force market \u2013 meaning they stopped looking for work and are not counted as either employed or unemployed \u2013 really matter. Counting them would bring the number of unemployed people in Australia to about 1.3 million. Officially, it is hovering around 800,000. That 1.3 million figure brings the unemployment rate to just under 10%. It is suddenly looking like that unofficial unemployment rate just got a lot more official. This is a pretty fair take: As has Adam Bandt: Jim Chalmers has already responded: Another day, another shambles from a treasurer who just can\u2019t stop seriously stuffing up this key program. This just shows you can\u2019t trust a hopeless government with a good idea like wage subsidies for workers. After all the lectures about fiscal responsibility, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have had to admit to getting their numbers wrong by $60bn. For weeks they\u2019ve been telling casuals and others that the program was full when in reality they were 3 million workers short. If they can\u2019t get this basic maths right how can we expect them to get the recovery right? Anthony Albanese has announced another doorstop on the back of the jobkeeper reporting screw-up news. He\u2019ll be up at 3.45pm. Not only is that $60bn now free, Australia\u2019s short- to medium-term economic outlooks, from the RBA to the government itself, have been based on $130bn being spent. Now, that has been revised down to $70bn. This has massive implications. Massive. What does it mean on a wider scale? There is $60bn the government had planned to spend, which is suddenly freed up. Expect the calls to expand the jobkeeper payment to other groups, including universities and foreign-owned entities to grow louder. You can read the whole release here. So what happened? Instead of reporting how many employees were eligible, businesses reported how much they expected to receive for their employees. In that way, one became 1,500. We are not joking. Here is the official release. Joint media release with the Australian Taxation Office Late yesterday, the ATO and Treasury advised the Government of a reporting error in estimates of the number of employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. The enrolment forms completed by 910,055 businesses who have self\u2011assessed as eligible under the scheme had indicated that this program would cover around 6.5 million eligible employees. The ATO\u2019s review of these forms has found that around 1,000 of those businesses appear to have made significant errors when reporting the estimate of eligible employees on their enrolment form. The most common error was that instead of reporting the number of employees they expected to be eligible, they reported the amount of assistance they expected to receive. For example, over 500 businesses with \u20181\u2019 eligible employee reported a figure of \u20181,500\u2019 (which is the amount of JobKeeper payment they would expect to receive for each fortnight for that employee). This reporting error has come to light as the ATO and Treasury have been analysing the amounts being paid out under the scheme, reconciling these with the estimates provided by enrolled businesses of the likely number of eligible employees. It was not picked up by the ATO earlier as their primary focus in the first fortnight of JobKeeper payments was on ensuring that JobKeeper payments were paid promptly to those eligible for them, and not paid to those who were ineligible. These initial estimates from businesses of employees covered are not linked to payments, and so were not as carefully analysed. Importantly this reporting error has no consequences for JobKeeper payments that have already been made to eligible businesses, as payments under the scheme depend on the subsequent declaration that an eligible business makes in relation to each and every eligible employee. This declaration does not involve estimates and requires an employer to provide the tax file number for each eligible employee. By contrast, the only use of the information collected in respect of the reporting error was to provide an early estimate of the number of expected employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. This is pretty incredible: Australia\u2019s credit outlook has moved from stable to negative, but maintains its AAA rating from the Fitch ratings agency. Ratings like this dictate how easy it for countries to borrow money, as well as the interest rates on those borrowings. As AAP reports: Fitch said it expects Australia\u2019s economic growth will fall sharply in 2020 and government spending in response to the health and economic crisis will cause large fiscal deficits and a sharp increase in government debt. It forecast the $2tn economy to contract 5% this year driven by a plunge in economic activity during the second quarter due to virus containment measures. \u201cWhile these measures have effectively curbed the spread of the virus, they also constrained household consumption and reduced business sentiment and investment,\u201d Fitch said. It expects a gradual economic recovery to begin in the second half of 2020 affirmed Australia\u2019s rating but said a downgrade is possible in the absence of a fiscal consolidation strategy or if there is economic or financial sector distress. Fitch said fiscal deficits are set to swell at both the federal and state levels as a result of the discretionary fiscal measures such as the jobkeeper wage subsidy program and economic contraction. It forecast the government deficit to rise to 6.9% of GDP in 2019-20 and 9.0% in 2020-21, from 1.2% in 2018-19. Fitch\u2019s move follows a similar action by S&amp;P Global Ratings in April, when it downgraded the outlook on Australia from stable to negative as a result of the government\u2019s stimulus measures. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said Fitch\u2019s action is a reminder of the importance of maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. \u201cOur measures are temporary, targeted and proportionate to the challenge we face and will ensure Australia bounces back stronger on the other side, without undermining the structural integrity of the budget which Australians have worked so hard to restore,\u201d he said in a statement. AAP has this report: Labor powerbroker Joel Fitzgibbon has been accused of \u201cweaponising foreign policy\u201d in explosive comments criticising the government\u2019s handling of China relations. Fitzgibbon has accused the Coalition of demonising China and its communist system, raising concerns about consequences for agricultural trade. He also criticised the Turnbull government for targeting China through tighter investment thresholds and the foreign influence register. The Nationals deputy leader, David Littleproud, believes that\u2019s a sackable offence. \u201cThis a member of Anthony Albanese\u2019s frontbench that is openly undermining his leadership by weaponising foreign policy, our sovereignty and our security,\u201d he told reporters in Toowoomba. \u201cAnthony Albanese, who once before brought in Joel Fitzgibbon and gave him a rap over the knuckles, either gets rid of him or shows he doesn\u2019t have the ticker to lead a competent government.\u201d We revealed this morning that the government\u2019s federal integrity commission plans were further delayed due to the Covid-19 crisis. The attorney general, Christian Porter, said draft legislation for its Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC) \u2013 now more than two years in the making \u2013 was ready for release before the pandemic hit. It has not materialised. Porter said the government had been forced to redirect its focus to the crisis, but remained committed to releasing the draft. He has not nominated a new timeline for doing so. The Transparency International Australia chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, has just issued a statement accusing the government of using the crisis to \u201csidestep accountability, control, oversight, and scrutiny\u201d. \u201cLike many governments around the world, the Australian government appears to be using the double health and economic emergency of the Covid-19 pandemic to sidestep accountability, control, oversight and scrutiny of political decisions, economic bailouts and the use of executive and discretionary powers,\u201d Lillywhite said. \u201cTimes of emergencies \u2013 including Covid-19 \u2013 create corruption risks. The need for transparency, accountability and political integrity has never been more important. \u201cIn times of emergency, corruption and violations of our standards of political integrity can undermine our democratic processes because the usual safeguards and oversight mechanisms are not in force.\u201d The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, says his health advice is not to reopen the borders to the southern states: We are in the safest place in Australia \u2013 because of that I know that there are calls for us to relax our hard borders. Being at zero cases is just more proof that the problem is not [the same for us as it is for] the rest of Australia. That is why we need to keep our border secure for now. The danger of coronavirus is still out there and we need to keep it out there. Cases are dropping down south and that is great news. They are getting better every day but still not good enough. This week alone a school has been shut down in Sydney after a positive case that nobody can explain. In Victoria, they have new cases at a health service and a construction site. I am not taking a shot at those states or their leaders. Dan and Gladys are doing the best they can in really tough times. I know they are both working extremely hard. We all have different views on what to do next. What they do is up to them, what we do is up to us. Our chief health officer\u2019s advice remains the same. The threat is still real and we need to stay vigilant and our hard borders should stay in place for now. It is not for ever, it is for now. In better retail news, Myer has announced plans to reopen all its stores (bar one which is undergoing renovations) by next Wednesday. In a statement to the ASX the retailer said a trial reopening of 24 stores had gone well. The Company is pleased to announce that it will reopen all of its remaining stores from next Wednesday, 27 May 2020, excluding Karrinyup (WA), which is expected to reopen on Saturday, 30 May 2020, when refurbishment works are completed. Click and Collect services will also be available at all stores nationally. All stores will operate in a manner that protects the health and wellbeing of customers and team members, with enhanced safety and cleaning measures. These enhanced measures include increased frequency of cleaning, protective items such as hand sanitiser stations, social distancing and contactless payments. That was quick David Littleproud also called for a boycott of Wesfarmers stores, which include Target and Kmart, after the announcement it would be closing and repurposing scores of Target stores across the country. It is doing that because Target stores were in economic trouble even before the Covid pandemic shut down the economy. Littleproud says the company should be taught a lesson, by people not shopping there \u2013 even though logically, that would suggest more stores end up closing. It just goes to show they don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s about us. Australians should vote with their wallets and not go near them. ... I\u2019ll be saying to everyone don\u2019t shop at these stores,\u201d he said. Go and shop at those outlets that are prepared to support not just metropolitan Australians but regional Australians. Littleproud then appeared shocked that a big business would seek to exploit a capitalist society: They make a lot of money. They make billions out of Australians. If they want to turn their back on the most vulnerable, it just goes to show that corporate Australia has lost its way morally. Anthony Albanese was asked about the boycott call from Littleproud: Look, Australians will make their own decisions, but I\u2019ve got to say, I\u2019m not sure what a boycott for Wesfarmers means except people not going into stores and further job losses. I am not sure what Mr Littleproud\u2019s comments would result in, and how that would be constructive. It must be under 25C in Queensland \u2013 David Littleproud is wearing a jumper. In talking about the federal government\u2019s trespassing laws, he says he understands people want to be vegetarians and \u201ceveryone has to be angry about something these days\u201d, but the farm trespass is too far. Cruise liners may have started taking bookings again, but the ban on cruise ships docking in Australia has been extended to September. Asked how NSW will police the changes, the customer service minister, Victor Dominello, says: We\u2019re going to continue to work with industries. We\u2019ve had a number of meetings with them already. That will continue, to finetune the implementation of this. But it is absolutely critical, as the health minister has said, that we find out, get the details about the patronage. Because we need to know \u2013 we need to be better than a CovidSafe app. If there is an outbreak, we need to know, and we need to contact those people in the event that there is. But the point is we\u2019ve got to use this period in June to ramp up in a safe way. In many ways, build the hygiene muscle so that, as we do open up, it\u2019s a much safer environment. NSW might be leading the way in terms of the bigger states opening up its hospitality industry again in bigger groups, but it also leads the way in active Covid cases. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, says NSW has been doing \u201cvery well\u201d and has the contact tracing ability in place. He says all diners will have to register their details: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And, in fact, I know, just going to my local cafe, there\u2019s a piece of paper there and they ask you to write your name and phone number. That\u2019s the sort of thing that we\u2019ll be doing. Each one of us are effectively soldiers in a war against this virus. And each one of us has to be prepared to live our lives in a little bit different way as we get our old lives back. And certainly, in the same way when you ring up a restaurant, you\u2019d normally give your name and phone number anyway to make the booking. In this case, it would more likely be, though \u2013 and we\u2019re working through this with industry \u2013 that each person who goes in would also give their name and phone number. That would certainly help keep all of us safe. (We are about one press conference away from a \u2018we\u2019ll fight Covid in the pubs\u2019 line.) Brad Hazzard, the NSW health minister, then steps up the analogies, by comparing the virus to a track and field athlete: NSW has always led the way, and again NSW is leading the way. We will not let this virus beat NSW. But as we do open up, and as we do make sure that our economy will lead again this nation, I also want to make sure that all of us understand that this virus is still out there, it\u2019s still lurking, and we still have to be careful. The way that we\u2019re moving forward is in a cautious and sensible way. It has the maximum of 50 people in a cafe or restaurant, but a lesser number if the cafe or restaurant, defined by the four-square-metre rule, requires a lesser number. So, for example, if you had 80 square metres, you would have 20 people. That\u2019s the basic lesson. Just do the basic maths. And, of course, my advice to all of us is, as I\u2019ve said many times, as we open up our economy, we don\u2019t need to open ourselves up to the virus. By just being cautious, we won\u2019t. It is not a high jumper, it is not a long jumper. Just maintain the social distance of 1.5 metres, and also hygiene \u2013 washing your hands like you\u2019ve never done before. If you arrive at the restaurant, the first thing you should do is use hand hygienic cleaner, or go and wash your hands. Then sit down, enjoy your dinner, do what NSW residents have always done, have a great night out with your friends, but be cautious, be careful, and this will work to the advantage of the entire community, but also keep you safe. From this comment, it seems the NSW minister for customer service, Victor Dominello, doesn\u2019t get out that much. He compares the virus to both a dance and whack-a-mole. Pick an analogy, dude. Well, today\u2019s announcement is about ramping up so that, hopefully, we can then open up all in a safe environment. We are working with industry to make sure that we have a Covid-safe environment, whether it\u2019s cafes, restaurants, pubs and clubs. We know that we\u2019re in the hammer-and-dance phase of this pandemic. That means we have to dance with the virus. But if it pops its head up, we have to hit it, and hit it hard, fast and local. And we will put regulations in place so that, if there is an outbreak, we go hard, fast and local. Because we have to make sure that we protect the health of the people, and also the health of the economy. Gladys Berejiklian says NSW\u2019s happy hour is going to look very, very different: We already know that, for many of these businesses, they won\u2019t be coming back at all. But for those who are viable, for those who have managed to hang on, we\u2019re ensuring that we can work together to provide that safe environment. Things will be very different. Imagine even something as simple as having joint cutlery on a table won\u2019t be able to exist any more. A simple buffet won\u2019t exist any more. There will be strict guidelines to ensure this happens safely. Because the last thing we want to do is have to shut businesses down because they haven\u2019t complied. And the last thing we want to do is go backwards. Now, we know this is a big step. But the regulations and rules we\u2019ll be putting in place will be very strict to make sure safety is paramount. But it is a significant time in the history of our state. And we have a no-regrets policy, firstly in keeping the community safe, making sure everything we do is to protect lives and save lives. But also in relation to making sure people aren\u2019t long-term unemployed, and that we can bounce back from the devastating economic shock. Gladys Berejiklian: However, this will be with very strict guidelines in place. It has to be in adherence to the four-square-metre rule. So some venues are small in space, they will only be able to have as many customers as is allowed in that space according to the four-square-metre rule. Nobody will be able to take bookings of more than 10 people. A maximum booking of 10 people. And also nobody will be able to be standing up in these venues. You have to be seated at a table, even if it\u2019s a pub. You have to be seated at the table, you have to be served at the table. There is no mingling, no standing around. There are strict guidelines in place, which will ensure that we can do this safely. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, along with her deputy premier, John Barilaro, treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, health minister, Brad Hazzard, and customer service minister, Victor Dominello, has announced New South Wales residents can expect stage 2 restrictions from 1 June. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and the like can have up to 50 patrons. Gladys Berejiklian has called another press conference for 12.30. Could there be a further loosening of restrictions coming? (Probably, yes.) The UK is finally looking at forced quarantine for travellers. As AAP reports, Australia is hoping for an exemption, although Australians returning would need to spend 14 days in forced quarantine: Australians flying into the United Kingdom could be excused from spending 14 days in quarantine. Trade minister Simon Birmingham discussed the exemption with his British counterpart this week. Australia argues its success in bringing the disease under control at home makes it a low-risk country abroad. Several UK cabinet ministers support the idea but others do not want to complicate the system. The belated UK coronavirus quarantine regime is expected to start next month. \u201cWe welcome any recognition that Australia has led the world in the successful containment of Covid-19, which clearly means that travellers coming from Australia would pose a low risk to the rest of the world,\u201d Birmingham told AAP on Friday. \u201cHowever, transmission from overseas continues to present a risk to Australia\u2019s ongoing suppression of Covid-19 and restrictions on travel in and out of Australia will remain for the foreseeable future.\u201d Australia has since March effectively banned international travel and forced all incoming passengers to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. The Chinese state council premier, Li Keqiang, is addressing the nation as part of the annual congress, and has broken with tradition by not giving a GDP prediction. Obviously there is always some raised eyebrows over whether or not the named figure is correct, but it is useful for international observers because it gives some idea of where the CCP thinks the economy is headed. Not naming a figure this year, in the wake of the pandemic, is very telling. And for those who need a bit of a laugh It was on, in New Zealand Pushed on Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s comments, after turning the first question into a \u2018well-this-is-what-the-government-haven\u2019t-been-doing\u2019 answer, Anthony Albanese says: I speak on behalf of the Labor Party and when it comes to the government and people in the media parroting the government lines, that\u2019s up to them. This is a government that doesn\u2019t have a plan on so many areas, doesn\u2019t have an economic plan. I expected last Tuesday Josh Frydenberg to make some comments about what would happen in the recovery to boost employment. What are they doing about the fact that today Target has announced 14,000 job losses? That\u2019s what Australians are really concerned about - job losses - and they\u2019re concerned about economic security. What we have as government ministers, often let off scot free... You have Peter Dutton, whose become the Queensland state Coalition spokesperson out there doing press conferences about Annastacia Palaszczuk at the same time, when he was the minister in charge of Australia\u2019s borders, but allowed in the Ruby Princess. I would say the government should worry about doing its job and having a plan for the country. Anthony Albanese says he has not spoken to Joel Fitzgibbon over his \u2018demonising China\u2019 comments. He says this is Labor\u2019s view: Labor was at one with the government in saying there should be an inquiry, that\u2019s just commonsense. When you have 300,000 lives lost, I saw that as completely unremarkable that you would have an inquiry, and that\u2019s good that that\u2019s going ahead. We need to make sure that the Australian government and ministers should be in contact with their counterparts in China, like they should be in regular contact with their counterparts in other nations. We simply can\u2019t afford the job losses that would result from the sort of incidents that seeing with barley, but if it spreads to other industries as well, that clearly is not in Australia\u2019s interests, so the government needs to always stand up for our own national interests. We need always to diversify as much as possible, that\u2019s just commonsense that that should occur in terms of risk management, but we also need to ensure that we continue to have a good economic relationship with China. In the past, the government has trumpeted the China free trade agreement and economic partnership. It\u2019s up to the government to explain further why it is that they\u2019re not getting that contact with their Chinese counterparts. The Labor leader also says the government\u2019s local government project funding announcement is welcome, but that communities which were impacted by the summer bushfires need more. Very clearly they have been forgotten. There is no additional support for local government in those communities with to day\u2019s announcement, and there is a great deal of concern that when the cameras left, so did some of the support. I\u2019ve been traveling in affected communities this week, and they do feel that there is a lack of support there. ...They\u2019ve had a shutdown not for a period of weeks but for the entire year of 2020, and for some of them, going back even further. So there is a need to continue to support those communities, and it shouldn\u2019t have taken a by-election to get an announcement such as we had a week ago for increased aerial firefighting to increase the capacity - something that was recommended and had a business case now two years ago. Anthony Albanese says the deputy prime minister needs to apologise for the \u2018people set their hair on fire over climate change\u2019 comment. Michael McCormack\u2019s comment that ... and to quote him accurately, \u201cA lot of people, I know, set their hair on fire about climate change,\u201d is entirely inappropriate. The fact is the government has conceded that climate change was one of the factors in the devastating bushfires that saw a loss of life, that saw thousands of homes lost, that saw millions of hectares burnt, and that had a devastating impact on the communities of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and I\u2019d say to Michael McCormack that he should reflect on those comments and retract them, and we need to be very careful about the language that we use. When it comes to climate change, it is real, we do need action. It\u2019s good yesterday there was some positive elements of the document put out by the government, including an acknowledgement that renewables were critical for dealing with the challenge of climate change, and that is a positive thing indeed. We will have more to say about that in coming days. Labor leader Anthony Albanese brought this up earlier this week. The Queensland transport minister, Mark Bailey, says given the continued cases in Victoria and NSW, it is appropriate for Queensland to review its border closures each month, and keep them closed for the time being. What we need to see is NSW be in the same sort of ballpark as Queensland in terms of health outcomes.\u201d We were so busy seeing if we could get a loaf of white bread to talk, we never stopped to check if we should. Michael McCormack gets a question on climate policy and gives a very Michael McCormack answer. It is so Michael McCormack that even he seems to have a moment of self awareness, and he calls an end to the press conference at the end of his answer: Q: Do you support net zero emissions by 2050, which is a target a lot of other countries have adopted an Australia is yet to make a decision about. Would you see Australia seeking to achieve that target and should Australia seek to achieve that target? McCormack: It is 2020, we\u2019re talking about 30 years in advance and a lot of people, I know, set their hair on fire about climate change and all the rest of it, yes, it\u2019s important, for the farmers, it\u2019s important, for their factories, it\u2019s important. What\u2019s important also is the jobs for here and now and what\u2019s important is we continue on a path to lower emissions, and we\u2019re doing that while at the same time not taxing farmers out of business and making sure as best we can we can have a manufacturing industry, we can have people working in factories and industry and we\u2019re not sending everything offshore to countries where they couldn\u2019t care less about making sure they lower emissions. We\u2019re doing it in a right and responsible way while at the same time protecting the interests that protect Australia. This is, of course, another Team Australia moment and of course we want the best outcome, the best environment for those future generations that will follow us. That\u2019s our legacy. We will make sure we do it in a right and responsible way, and we are meeting all of our international agreements, like we said we would, and we\u2019re doing it without taxing the hell out of farmers and businesses and families, who have the right to be able to turn on the switch and to get reliable, affordable electricity and power, and that\u2019s why coal is so important and why a range of technologies is so important. That\u2019s what ministers Pitt and Taylor are working towards, the prime minister is working towards, that is each and every one of our goal. Asked about India looking (at this very initial stage) open to expanding its trade with Australia, particularly when it comes to barley (and putting to the side some of the very different trade policy settings should that go ahead) Michael McCormack says he is still hopeful that China will reverse its tariff decision: There is an old saying of a slow boat to China, but indeed, it is important that barley reaches the destination. It is important it reaches the port, and it doesn\u2019t matter what the speed of the boat might be, we want to see it offloaded. Australian barley is the best barley in the world and I know particularly for our West Australian and South Australian growers, yes, we grow a lot of barley on the east Coast as well, my late father, Lance, used to do that himself. But particularly for Western Australia and South Australia, those growers have produced a lot of the barley which is indeed used by China. We want to make sure that that reaches its destination. Asked about Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s comments, that the Coalition government has been \u201cdemonising\u201d China, Michael McCormack says: Well, this is a team Australia moment and Joel Fitzgibbon has once again failed the test. On China, the deputy prime minister has been very well prepped on what he is authorised to say: We will work through that in a measured, considered way as we always do, as people would expect the government to do. I know that Keith Pitt, Simon Birmingham, working with our Chinese diplomats, working through Dfat, working for the proper processes. China knows that we produce the best resources in the world, and we will keep on doing that. They will continue to need the product that we export, they will need them into the future. Yes, we will have a few hiccups along the way. That is the case matter no matter whether it is Asia or where the case may be. We will work through those in a considered way. Q: Barley, beef, iron ore and today coal, how concerned are you about this decision in China to steer away from using Australian imports and to use domestic coal supplies instead? MM: Coal is our third biggest export commodity to China. It is, and as I said, we will work through this and are carefully considered way. We understand that China is a big customer of ours. $147 billion of exports and we want to make sure that not only do we retain as many of those exports but indeed we increase them as time goes on. And I have got every confidence that senator Birmingham as the trade minister, Keith Pitt is a resources minister, will be able to do just that. Q: It is a bit difficult, isn\u2019t it, to work through in any considered way when China won\u2019t even pick up the phone or take a phone call from a minister. How do you then contact the Chinese authorities and talk to them, if they are not going to pick up the phone? MM: I say again, I know I have got every confidence that senator Birmingham will be able to work this out in a rational, clear and proper way, working through our Dfat officials, working with China. China needs Australia just as much as Australia needs China, and it is a two way relationship. It has been happening for many, many years, and I am sure it will be happening for many more years to come. Michael McCormack also wants you to know that the National party, which looks after the nation\u2019s food bowls, and represents electorates which are already facing the impacts of climate change, is all in when it comes to coal: Well, when you say large parts of the National party, I think you mean all parts of the National party. We are all pro-coal. But we are pro-coal, we are pro all technologies. We believe in technology rather than taxation. If you ask Anthony Albanese, he will say one thing in bigger and one thing elsewhere. If you ask our party, we will say exactly the same thing when we come to Canberra. We will say exactly the same thing wherever we are in Australia. Because that is what the National party, who understand that there are many, many jobs in coal, many, many jobs in resources, many, many jobs in renewables, as well, and I know Mark Coulton\u2019s electorate has a lot of renewable energy happening with solar farms and the like. Gas, of course, is important as well. I have spoken to minister Angus Taylor on many occasions on the need for technology rather than taxation. That is the National party way, that is the government\u2019s way. And indeed, this technology roadmap is a draft, it is in its draft form. So there will be opportunities for input into that progress comic process. Michael McCormack gets to stand in front of a very big Australian government backdrop to announce the local government funding, so you know that his year has just been made. He says there is no need to worry about how these grants will be spent, following sports rorts: No colour coding. What they will be as councils will, for those councils who have already brought forward their projects and talked about their community priorities, that is going to be important, that we will take and assess those. The infrastructure department will be doing that. I will of course have a look at those as well but each and every one of the 537 councils across Australia will benefit from this. It will be based on what their roads to recovery funding is, and so it is based on their road network and the length of the road network, as well as, of course, the number of people department, very accountable, very transparent. Each and every one of the local government areas right across the nation will benefit from this. Regional, metropolitan, remote, the whole lot. IbisWorld has looked at the Wesfarmers announcement it is closing and repurposing scores of Target stores around the nation and concluded it\u2019s quite bad news for the department industry in general. As the lockdowns ease, analysts expect the Australian retail market to look very different. Declining discretionary incomes and fluctuating consumer sentiment have encouraged shoppers to favour discount stores over the past five years. Revenue for the department stores industry is expected to decline at an annualised 2.0% over the five years through 2019-20 to $18bn. This trend includes an expected fall of 4.8% in the current year due to weak shopping activity resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Wesfarmers has slowly rationalised Target\u2019s store network over the past five years to focus on Kmart. \u2018Consumer demand is becoming increasingly polarised, with shoppers seeking either ultra-low-cost or high-quality, ethically made goods. Target\u2019s mid-market position has failed to appeal to either of these types of shoppers,\u2019 IbisWorld senior industry analyst Daisy Feller said. Steven Marshall is speaking again about the easing of the restrictions in South Australia, which has been a little confusing, because of just how many different licences venues there have: We are allowing those businesses that have been trading with 10 outdoors now to have 10 indoors also with alcohol. So a small step. Our major step, of course, is occurring on 5 June when we will be allowing indoor dining with alcohol right across the state. Now there is some confusion and I would like to apologise for the confusion, which has occurred in South Australia with regards to the easing of these restrictions. As I\u2019ve said from day one, it is a lot easier to put these restrictions in place than it is to ease these restrictions. As it turns out, we have varied licences in South Australia and some patrons who have quite rightly asked the question is this a restaurant, I don\u2019t know their licensing arrangement. So it is confusing and we acknowledge that. We apologise for that confusion. What we are trying to do is lift the restrictions in an orderly way, which is going to allow us to keep the coronavirus at bay. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly in my press conferences there are more cities and countries around the world with who have eased restrictions who have had to put them back in place. We are absolutely determined that doesn\u2019t happen here in South Australia. Then again, with discourse like this, why do you even need facts? Karl Stefanovic: Peter, to you first of all, how dare that nasty dictator Annastacia Palaszczuk not listen to you. Peter Dutton: Well, Karl, when she starts listening to me, we\u2019ll know she is talking a bit of common sense, I\u2019d say. Richard Marles: We\u2019re all in trouble. Dutton: Look, I just don\u2019t understand where she\u2019s coming from. There was a document produced, and Steven Wardill actually has a good article in the Courier Mail this morning, a document that said 10 July was the opening date. So tourism operators in Cairns, for example, planning to open from 10 July. And then out of nowhere comes this September date and I think it caught the chief medical officer in Queensland by surprise as well. And, I just think she has painted herself into a corner and with no logic to the position. Stefanovic: OK. Dutton: Just come out and explain where the September date comes from and we can, you know, have a reasonable discussion. It might be worth noting, again, that the Queensland LNP is not overly vocal on the border issue (as yet), probably, (and this isn\u2019t based on anything other than chatter from Queensland), because Queenslanders are still OK with the border lockdowns. It is a similar story in WA. Michael McCormack has been allowed out to talk about the commonwealth\u2019s $1.8bn local government funding package. Here is what he said to the ABC this morning: If councils come to us and say \u2018we want to build street lighting, bus stops, want to put in refurbished Town Hall\u2019, which are so much the fabric of regional centres, we will look at that. We want to have local jobs, importantly local procurement, which will be one of the criteria of the $500m stimulus. I had 400 councils write back to me when I wrote to them \u2013 I wrote to all councils. Each and every one of those 537 councils will benefit. They will put in their applications for what particular stimulus projects they want to do. Noting that any road projects \u2013 they need to be new road projects, they need to be things that they weren\u2019t working on pre-Covid. They need to be new projects that they warrant to spend their money on, that they want to invest in, to help local jobs, because if there is one way \u2013 one day \u2013 of getting local jobs on the ground through this pandemic, it\u2019s going to be through local councils. That\u2019s why we wanted to put in this injection of money and that\u2019s why this cash will certainly help small, medium enterprises around the country. Because if there\u2019s one thing that local councils know how to do \u2013 spend money locally. Year 12 students in Victoria will receive their ATARs by the end of the year. Victorian education minister James Merlino has announced that Victorian students will be able to complete their VCE and VCAL and receive their results by the end of the year. The positive outcomes [from community testing blitzes] meant that we could bring students back to face-to-face teaching earlier than anticipated, and students start from Tuesday next week. It also means that we can bring our exams forward our year 12 exams. VCE exams will run between 9 November and 2 December this year. It means they can celebrate finalising the big 12 before the end of the year, enjoy the summer break and then plan for their futures. It will mean no disadvantage for Victorian students in terms of university and other pathways. So the pathway for students will be exactly the same as for students right around the country. It\u2019s time for another review announcement! This time, the national water initiative. In the last week, the government has been stepping up its quiet announcements \u2013 no biosecurity levy being one of them. This review is due by early next year. The National Water Initiative (NWI) is a shared commitment by governments to increase the efficiency of Australia\u2019s water use, provide investment confidence, supply security for rural and urban communities, and provide greater certainty for the environment. The commission will assess whether the water reforms agreed in the National Water Initiative, along with any other subsequent reforms adopted by COAG, are achieving their intended outcomes. The inquiry will examine whether governments have been successful in achieving the objectives, outcomes and timelines of reform ideas proposed under the NWI. Reform of the water sector has been ongoing over several decades, with the last productivity review into the NWI completed in April 2019. The inquiry will also fulfil the statutory requirement for the second of the productivity commission\u2019s triennial assessments of progress towards achieving the objectives and outcomes of the NWI required by the Water Act 2007. The commission has been asked to provide further practical advice on ways in which the NWI could be improved, including specific advice to assist governments to progress their commitments to renew the NWI. Mr Drew Collins has been appointed as an associate commissioner to assist with this inquiry. Peter Dutton was on the Nine Network this morning, where he again attacked the Queensland Labor government for keeping the borders closed. The man, who leads a department which appeals court decisions on refugee cases time and time again, believes the Queensland border closure should be tested: People are right to test that if they think it\u2019s not. Because it is impacting on people\u2019s lives. Just excuse me while I choke on this irony. Victoria\u2019s Cedar Meat outbreak continues to grow with five new cases overnight. Victorian education minister James Merlino has confirmed 12 new cases in the state. Four came from those in hotel quarantine, two from community screenings and one is still under investigation. This is significantly more than New South Wales, with only three new cases overnight. The Cedar Meats outbreak has continued to grow over the past few days with small numbers of cases each day. Lately, the majority have been from household contacts of workers rather than staff members themselves. The Victorian government has not yet confirmed the connection between these five new cases and the meat processing plant. Wesfarmers, which owns Target and Kmart has just made a pretty significant announcement to the Australian stock market \u2013 it will be closing up to 75 Target stores across the country. Following the completion of the first phase of the Target review, Kmart Group has identified a number of actions to accelerate the growth of Kmart and address the unsustainable financial performance of Target. These actions include the conversion of suitable Target and Target Country stores to Kmart stores, the closure of between 10 to 25 large format Target stores, the closure of the remaining 50 small format Target Country stores, and a significant restructuring of the Target store support office. Wesfarmers is continuing its assessment of strategic options for a commercially viable Target and its remaining store network. [continued from previous post] Senator Birmingham is being ignored by his Chinese counterpart. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton said the stonewalling was part of China\u2019s tactics. \u201cWe don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got a legal basis for imposing these tariffs and we want them to change their position,\u201d he told the Nine Network. He said Australia would stand firm in its values after a push for global coronavirus inquiry stung China. Thermal coal, which is used to generate power, is Australia\u2019s second largest export to China after iron ore. China has also announced new supervising rules for iron ore, with opinion divided on its impact for Australian exporters. Senator Birmingham is hopeful the changes could speed up the entry of iron ore into China through fewer batches being checked. \u201cEarly indications of talking to the industry are indeed that this would provide an opportunity for benefits both to China and to Australia,\u201d he said. But the Global Times \u2013 considered a media voice of the Chinese government \u2013 has warned Australian iron ore imports could be hurt by political tensions between the two countries. \u201cThis is another implicit warning to Australia,\u201d Yu Lei, a chief research fellow at Liaocheng University, told the newspaper. \u201cIt is associated with how Australia has acted, and a general decline in demand for steel on the global level.\u201d The good reporters at AAP listened to Michael McCormack, which has saved me from having to do it, and for that I thank them. Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack is concerned coal exporters could face a tougher time selling the commodity into China. The Chinese government is reportedly warning state-owned power plants not to buy new shipments of Australian thermal coal and instead favour domestic products. Mr McCormack said trade minister Simon Birmingham and diplomats were attempting to fix the issue. \u201cOf course we\u2019re very concerned by it,\u201d he told the ABC on Friday. \u201cBut we have a two-way relationship with China. China needs Australia as much as Australia needs China and we want to make sure that whatever we do is in a careful and considered way.\u201d China cooling on Australian coal could signal the latest escalation in trade tensions between the two nations. Coal exports faced delays at Chinese ports last year. Beijing has slapped a prohibitive 80% tariff on Australian barley, while four major abattoirs have been banned from sending red meat to China. Mr McCormack said Chinese steel mills and power plants would need high-quality Australian coal to operate. \u201cWe want to make sure that our coal exports have a destination. China has long been a customer of ours. They know the quality of our coal, they know the quality of our iron ore and other resources.\u201d But it is these comments from Joel Fitzgibbon, about this time yesterday, which have really caught the government\u2019s ire (comments, which had to be walked back by colleagues such as Richard Marles later in the day) While on Sky News yesterday, Fitzgibbon accused the Coalition of \u201cdemonising\u201d the Chinese. Certainly we have to be robust in defence of our national interest. But let\u2019s just recap what\u2019s been happening here for the last few years, starting under Malcolm Turnbull. We\u2019ve been demonising the Chinese and their system of governance. Malcolm Turnbull, for example, changed Foreign Investment Review Board thresholds, so that there were special discriminatory rules for the Chinese. They deliberately constructed foreign interest registers with a clear intention of targeting China, for domestic political gain. And of course, now we\u2019ve had our most recent and current prime minister, basically saying things like we should send weapons-style supervisors into China, against their will. I have no idea how he thought he was going to achieve that. So, there have been some problems here in our relationship with China for some time. It\u2019s our largest trading partner and we need to normalise this relationship again. We can see already through barley and the red meat sector some of the consequences when that relationship is not a healthy one. David Littleproud has just announced a press conference \u2018re Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s China comments\u2019 for 9.30am. Joel Fitzgibbon, as Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, has come out hard in the last 24 hours over the trade barney with China \u2013 much harder than a lot of his colleagues. He was on Afternoon Briefing with Patricia Karvelas yesterday, where he was asked about the coal situation: PK: A state-backed Chinese coal group has called for a reduction in the use of Australian coal because local producers can\u2019t compete. Two power stations will suspend imports from I think it\u2019s July the 1st. Does that worry you? JF: Well, I should say, PK, that there have been a number of events with our coal exports over the course of the last few years. This is not the first time there\u2019s been some threat to our coal exports into China. But can I also say like \u2013 unlike many of our other commodities, China is not a key export market. It\u2019s an important export market for our coal but of course our big export market for coal is to countries like Japan and South Korea. Queensland and South Australia are holding firm on the border closures. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young reiterated to ABC radio this morning that she could not imagine the Queensland borders opening in the next month, at least. We have to do the checks as we go along the way. The very earliest I can see it happening is July. As to when it does happen \u2013 I really and truly don\u2019t know.\u201d Meanwhile, the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall said much the same thing when speaking to ABC Breakfast, about his state: We have been trying to sort of balance this issue. While we keep the strong borders in place, it does allow us to go a bit further and a bit faster than other states. If we lift the borders straight away, then we can probably only go as fast as the slowest jurisdiction. My priority at the moment is getting people back to work in South Australia. But the other states are doing really well. They are increasing testing, getting numbers down. I don\u2019t think it will be that far down the track. At the moment we will be keeping our borders closed in South Australia. ...Well, look, I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. We need to wait and see what happens in those other states, where they arrive at. We won\u2019t do anything that is going to let us having a second wave in South Australia. When we look around the world, and we see cities and countries who have been in the same position in South Australia with low or no cases, more often, as they have lifted restrictions, they have had to put them back in place. We are determined to get this right. We are taking those things into account before we make a decision on state borders. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, reports an 80-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, died overnight in Concord Hospital. It being Gladys o\u2019clock, the NSW premier is giving the daily state update. Gladys Berejiklian says there have been three new positive results from 8,600 tests. Berejiklian is also another round of infrastructure projects: We want to save jobs. We cannot afford to continue to have the job losses that we\u2019ve encountered in April. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased to have with me today the minister for planning, who had announced the first tranche of projects that were going through a speedier approval process. Now there\u2019s a second tranche that he\u2019s announcing today, which has the potential to put in an extra $5bn into our economy and create jobs. That is something all of us should feel positive about, because anything we can do as a government to keep jobs, to save jobs, and to create new jobs, we know will help communities get through the next few months and beyond. The government is cracking down on class actions, targeting those who fund them. The Morrison government is ensuring that litigation funders are subject to greater regulatory oversight by requiring them to hold an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) and comply with the managed investment scheme regime. Litigation funders are currently exempt from holding an AFSL and being categorised as a managed investment scheme. As a result, litigation funders do not face the same regulatory scrutiny and accountability as other financial services and products under the Corporations Act. The removal of these exemptions will require litigation funders to obtain an AFSL from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. AFSL holders are obligated to: \u2022 Act honestly, efficiently and fairly. \u2022 Maintain an appropriate level of competence to provide financial services. \u2022 Have adequate organisational resources to provide the financial services covered by the licence. Removal of these exemptions will also require greater transparency around the operations of litigation funders in Australia. That is due to come in, in three months time. The Sydney Morning Herald has this story, detailing the latest escalation in trade tensions between Australian and China: Australian coal exporters are facing the risk of tougher restrictions selling into China as government authorities in Beijing direct state-owned power plants to purchase domestic product instead. The move threatens to add to escalating tensions between Australia and its largest trading partner and follows new customs reforms that analysts fear could lead China to delay cargoes of Australia\u2019s most lucrative export, iron ore. Canberra Airport managing director Stephen Byron is speaking to the ABC. He says the nation\u2019s capital airport has gone from about 120 flights a week to two or three. He has written to the Queensland and South Australian governments about setting up bubble to bubble travel, because the ACT is (known) Covid case free. So far, there has been no firm answer. We\u2019ve only had feedback at this stage. But I think you have to allow time for the premiers to consider these things. They have obviously taken a very firm and clear line. The thing with aviation is a date needs to be set for two weeks\u2019 time or so that people can make bookings on flights and the airlines can schedule flights. It\u2019s not like just ramping up a cafe and turning up and changing from takeaway to dine-in again within 24 hours. The aviation industry needs a very clear timetable with firm dates. We need to know that we can restart these flights in a matter of weeks. Ideally by 8 June. And certainly be well and truly up and running for the school holidays on 1 July. And welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. We\u2019ll bring you all the latest, including the escalating war of words over state border closures. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has said it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep borders across Australia closed, given the number of new coronavirus infections has stabilised, and is opening her own state for regional tourism on 1 June. But other premiers disagree. \u201cWe are not going to be lectured to by a state that has the highest amount of cases in Australia,\u201d Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said. Mark McGowan lobbed a Ruby Princess comment towards NSW the day before. The national health advice is there is no reason not to reopen. The states say their health advice is to keep the borders closed. The active (known) Covid-free states are working on whether or not they can create their own travel bubbles, which would exclude NSW and Victoria, something NSW really does not want. It is opening up its state to travel, with even the ski resorts open for business. As it was always going to, the moment politics was thrown back into the mix, any sense of national unity between the leaders is very quickly dissipating. Still, national cabinet will be held next Friday and it\u2019s possible they can come to some sort of agreement, or at least a cease-fire, then. It comes as South Australia eases some rules today: from Friday, cafes and restaurants can seat 10 customers indoors for meals along with 10 outdoors. The change has come earlier than expected and SA will also look to move to stage two ahead of schedule. Meanwhile, the commonwealth has announced it will be spending $1.8bn on local government projects, as it looks to kick start the economy with infrastructure investment. The economic recovery is the number one priority now, and you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about it on Tuesday, when the prime minister gives his national press club address. We\u2019ll cover all the day\u2019s events as they unfold. You have Amy Remeikis with you this morning and the entire Guardian brains trust. Ready?",

The communities account for 537 of the state\u2019s 80,400 confirmed coronavirus cases and 28 of the 3,300 deaths attributed to the virus. The impact of Covid-19 among Pacific Islanders is exacerbated by the high prevalence of a range of pre-existing health conditions in the community, including diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. Roughly one in five Pacific Islanders have been diagnosed with heart disease and they are 46% more likely than the general population to be diagnosed with cancer \u2013 a rate higher than any other racial group, according to an April report from the Pacific Islander Center of Primary Care Excellence. High poverty rates, lack of access to healthcare, and higher than average rates of \u201cessential workers\u201d can compound risk and accelerate the spread of the virus among Pacific Islander communities, said the organization. Life in multigenerational households, common among communities of Pacific Islanders, complicates the challenge to maintain distance \u2013 especially if a member of the household works in the community and returns home to elders. \u2018Alisi Tulua, who is Tongan and a member of the national Pacific Islander Covid-19 Response Team, believes coronavirus is also spreading in the community because \u201cnobody is talking about it\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of stigma around disease in our community. Tongans are faithful people, and there\u2019s been negativity attached to the narrative around coronavirus \u2013 a sense that, if you have it, God must be punishing you for something,\u201d she said.

The night before the funeral for her 15-year-old nephew, Ah Soon couldn\u2019t sleep. Funerals are sacred events, their importance deeply ingrained in Samoan culture.

But the fuss has died down, replaced by the background noise over global warming \u2013 or, lately, shock over the coronavirus. \u201cI was disappointed, yes,\u201d says Hakonarson. \u201cBut I never expected the film to make any change in Skagafj\u00f6rdur. It would have been too much to ask that it start a revolution.\u201d \u2022 The County is available on Curzon Home Cinema.",

      "body": "<p>It would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 it\u2019s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life. That\u2019s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was \u201cthrowing everything at it\u201d.</p> <p>But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed \u2013 Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research \u2013 ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.</p> <p>This is why.</p> <h2><strong>Why might a vaccine fail?</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this week, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure we will get a vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>But he was right to be circumspect.</p> <p>Vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.</p> <p>More than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/first-fda-approved-vaccine-prevention-dengue-disease-endemic-regions\">approved only last year</a>, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.</p> <p>Scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both.

And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. \u201cWe should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we\u2019re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that\u2019s going to take as long as we think, then let\u2019s fucking start planning it now.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How will we live with the virus?</strong></h2> <p>People will have to adapt \u2013 and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.</p> <p>Yuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed \u2013 but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.</p> <p>At restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. \u201cIn our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the \u201cnew normal\u201d and that without more interventions \u2013 such as fines for not wearing face masks \u2013 \u201cwe could see people drifting back to old behaviours\u201d.</p> <p>We might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/has-the-coronavirus-pandemic-made-us-all-nicer-community\">Has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One last possibility could save a lot of trouble.

      "bodyText": "It would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 it\u2019s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life. That\u2019s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was \u201cthrowing everything at it\u201d. But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed \u2013 Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research \u2013 ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days. This is why. Why might a vaccine fail? Earlier this week, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure we will get a vaccine.\u201d But he was right to be circumspect. Vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show. More than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was approved only last year, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years. Scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus. A chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year. Researchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies \u2013 those responsible for longer-lasting immunity \u2013 rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again. Last week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus. \u201cThat\u2019s what is particularly challenging,\u201d says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. \u201cIf the natural infection doesn\u2019t give you that much immunity except when it\u2019s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don\u2019t know.\u201d If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time. The genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.

If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus\u2019s mutations, called them \u201can early warning\u201d. Another challenge: making any vaccine safe In the rush to develop a vaccine \u2013 there are now more than 100 in development \u2013 safety must remain a priority.

In all likelihood, a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100% effective. Those in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient\u2019s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against. Ideally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also \u201cT\u201d cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,\u201d says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic. Early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use. The US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine. Another vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients. If humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it. How well a vaccine works determines how it is used.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

      "bodyText": "A group of senior scientists has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely in England and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The Independent Sage committee, which is separate from the government\u2019s official advisers and is chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says new modelling of coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September would further reduce the risk. The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so new cases are found and isolated fast. \u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Prof King said. In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a vital part of the decision-making process. The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children, with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes. King said the decision of when to reopen schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their local area.\u201d The Independent Sage committee will host an online discussion at midday on Friday for teachers, parents, children and union representatives in association with the British Medical Journal and Mumsnet.

Before the pandemic struck, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/09/democrats-and-republicans-role-scientists-policy-debates/\">recent polling</a> showed that just 43% of Republicans think that scientists should play an active role in policy debates, compared with 73% of Democrats.</p> <p>Even fewer Republicans \u2013 34% \u2013 think scientists are any better at making decisions about science policy than you or me.</p> <p>These opinions did not crawl out of the primordial soup on their own. They have evolved over time in a warm bath of fringe conspiracy groups that have spent decades fighting against the teaching of evolution, among other social evils. One of those groups was Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum, which <a href=\"https://ncse.ngo/phyllis-schlafly-dies\">worked</a> to push evolution out of the classroom, almost as doggedly as <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/series/mrs-america-96f330fe-878d-412e-949f-fd8b69b3adf2?\">Mrs America</a> fought against women\u2019s rights and the Equal Rights Amendment.</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise to find her son Andrew <a href=\"https://aapsonline.org/about-aaps/board-of-directors/\">named</a> as general counsel to the AAPS. Among other projects, Andrew Schlafly founded a conservative alternative to Wikipedia, to correct its \u201cliberal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/jul/01/conservapediahasalittlehan\">bias</a>\u201d on things like evolution.</p> <p>Schlafly\u2019s group was not alone; its brother-in-arms was the anti-commie, anti-civil rights John Birch Society, which Phyllis somehow believed was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/phyllis-schlafly-obituary-eagle-forum-era-214559\">not sufficiently</a> concerned about the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Today the Birchers believe that among the many globalist plots against America \u2013 led by the UN of course \u2013 is a vast scientific conspiracy. The biggest one, naturally, is the supposed science about the climate crisis. But if you\u2019re at all confused, the Birchers\u2019 website cites \u201cconspiracy\u201d as the first thing that bothers them about science.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition, a conspiracy is when two or more people work in secret for evil purposes. The John Birch Society believes this definition fits a number of groups working against the independence of the United States,\u201d its <a href=\"https://www.jbs.org/jbs-other-issues/\">website</a> declares about science. \u201cExtensive study has shown us that history is rarely accidental.\u201d</p> <p>Extensive studies are everywhere if you know where to look. It was no accident of history that Barack Obama recently tried to hypnotize young Americans by warning that the fools who ignored the pandemic were also ignoring the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1245007713387544576?s=20\">tweeted</a>. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more consequences of climate denial.\u201d</p> <p>His successor is immune to this kind of mind control known as logic, especially when it comes to testing for Covid-19. For Trump, the number of tests is both a remarkable triumph \u2013 the biggest in the world \u2013 and also a remarkable admission of failure. You see, if you test more, you find more sickness. It\u2019s like a scientific plot conspiring against him, much like the negative hydroxy study that he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/19/trump-describes-medical-researchers-trump-enemies-because-he-doesnt-like-their-results/\">called</a> \u201ca Trump-enemy statement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBy doing testing, you\u2019re finding people,\u201d he explained to a couple of governors and reporters on Wednesday, before bragging again that the US was testing more people than Germany and South Korea. \u201cSo we\u2019re way ahead of everybody. But when you do that, you have more cases. So a lot of times, the fake news media will say, \u2018You know, there are a lot of cases in the United States.\u2019 Well, if we didn\u2019t do testing at a level that nobody has ever dreamt possible, you wouldn\u2019t have very many cases.\u201d</p> <p>This was a genius strategy, first perfected by a teenager hiding under his bed covers to avoid homework.

      "bodyText": "What kind of buffoon brags about taking a drug that could kill him? Among the many ailments Donald Trump has inflicted on his own country \u2013 not to mention the rest of the world \u2013 there may be something even worse than hydroxycholoroquine. Yes, it\u2019s bad that he claims to be taking an anti-malarial that his own Food and Drug Administration says is unsafe and ineffective to treat Covid-19. Yes, it\u2019s astonishing that Trump\u2019s tools forced out of office an actual vaccine expert because he dared to question the president\u2019s love of an unproven drug. But it\u2019s even worse that he is a one-man delivery vehicle for a dunce cult that denies science. We\u2019re not just talking about the presidential brainwaves that bounced around the world, hitting bodies with very powerful light or bleaching patients \u201cby injection inside or almost a cleaning\u201d. Trump\u2019s anti-science cult does not begin with quack remedies for a pandemic, and it does not even begin with him. He represents the nadir of a long tradition of conspiracy-loving wingnuts who used to populate the fringes of the American conservative movement. Over the last half-century they have moved steadily into the mainstream of the Republican party, where their fact-free fairytales about the evil establishment have found a natural home in the cranium of the 45th president. In this age of hyper-connected ignorance, there are no independent experts and there are no true facts. Your scientific theories are equal to my Twitter theories, just as your FBI investigation into Russia is equal to Rudy\u2019s supposed investigation into Ukraine. All opinions are equal, but some are more equal than others. How can you deny this democracy of dunces when there are supposedly experts on both sides? Brad Parscale, the Ferrari-driving Trump campaign manager, slapped down the science of Covid-19 cures by citing the work of a respectable-sounding group of doctors. \u201cThe press is going nuts over @realDonaldTrump taking hydroxychloroquine (prescribed by doctor). Of course, if he\u2019s doing it, they must oppose it,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cBut the Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons says otherwise.\u201d Parscale linked to a story on the AAPS website about the group\u2019s letter to the Arizona governor citing its own \u201cfrequently updated table of studies\u201d of the drug, claiming it has \u201cabout [a] 90% chance of helping Covid-19 patients\u201d. What kind of crazy medical cabal is keeping such a powerful drug from dying patients? The AAPS has a long record of exposing the obvious malevolence of mainstream medicine as part of its mission to keep government out of healthcare. It took a bold stand against the science that HIV causes Aids, citing \u201cofficial reports and the peer-reviewed literature\u201d. It also blew open the science of how Barack Obama was using mass hypnosis to bamboozle voters with his fancy speeches. Apparently the O of his campaign logo resembled a crystal ball, which explains why so many Jews supported Obama. If you think that\u2019s crazy, you should take a look at \u201ca 66-page extensively footnoted but unsigned article\u201d that inspired the AAPS article. The AAPS counts fewer than 5,000 members, compared with more than 220,000 members of its arch-enemy, the American Medical Association. But it\u2019s quality, not quantity that counts. Among its past members, the AAPS counts Rand Paul, the ophthalmologist who now serves as one of the few doctors in the US Senate. His kooky libertarian father Ron, a former OB-GYN, was also a member. This is a shame because there are only 17 doctors among the 535 members of Congress, and 14 of them are Republicans at a time when the nation and the world would appreciate some informed medical opinions in the middle of a once-in-a-generation pandemic. Instead, there\u2019s ample evidence that most Republicans think scientists should butt out of public policy. Before the pandemic struck, recent polling showed that just 43% of Republicans think that scientists should play an active role in policy debates, compared with 73% of Democrats. Even fewer Republicans \u2013 34% \u2013 think scientists are any better at making decisions about science policy than you or me. These opinions did not crawl out of the primordial soup on their own. They have evolved over time in a warm bath of fringe conspiracy groups that have spent decades fighting against the teaching of evolution, among other social evils. One of those groups was Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum, which worked to push evolution out of the classroom, almost as doggedly as Mrs America fought against women\u2019s rights and the Equal Rights Amendment. So it\u2019s no surprise to find her son Andrew named as general counsel to the AAPS. Among other projects, Andrew Schlafly founded a conservative alternative to Wikipedia, to correct its \u201cliberal bias\u201d on things like evolution. Schlafly\u2019s group was not alone; its brother-in-arms was the anti-commie, anti-civil rights John Birch Society, which Phyllis somehow believed was not sufficiently concerned about the Soviet Union. Today the Birchers believe that among the many globalist plots against America \u2013 led by the UN of course \u2013 is a vast scientific conspiracy. The biggest one, naturally, is the supposed science about the climate crisis. But if you\u2019re at all confused, the Birchers\u2019 website cites \u201cconspiracy\u201d as the first thing that bothers them about science. \u201cBy definition, a conspiracy is when two or more people work in secret for evil purposes.

The US president had previously been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of the Ford plant. India suffers largest one-day rise India has reported 6,000 new cases in its biggest one-day rise since the outbreak started. The country has also reported over 118,000 confirmed cases \u2013 around a 5% increase from yesterday. Yemen\u2019s health service \u2018collapses\u2019 Coronavirus cases in war-torn Yemen are believed to be \u201cwidespread\u201d, while its health system has \u201cin effect collapsed\u201d. A UN spokesman said on Friday that the reported total of 184 cases in the country is also \u201calmost certainly much higher\u201d. Hong Kong poised for protests Hong Kong activists have called for citizens to rise up against Bejing\u2019s plans to impose national security legislation in the financial hub. Many believe the plans have reignited the anti-government movement that had lost its focus and dwindled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Indonesia sees rise in cases Indonesia has reported 973 new infections \u2013 its highest number of daily coronavirus cases \u2013 bringing the country\u2019s total cases to 20,162.

Ardern boosted by handling of crisis The leader of New Zealand\u2019s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed Jacinda Ardern\u2019s soaring popularity. Around 84% of New Zealanders approve of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has helped to boost her ratings ahead of a general election in September.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In areas where seating is dense, protective screens will be erected to create a barrier between tables; there will also be screens at the till.</p> \n<p>Staff will be given gloves, masks and goggles, although they will not be required to wear them.

      "bodyText": "The pubs of the near future could have protective screens between tables, bar staff wearing goggles and dedicated workers to enforce physical distancing, according to a vision set out by the pub chain JD Wetherspoon. The company, whose outspoken chairman, Tim Martin, has previously faced criticism for playing down the risk of Covid-19, said it was spending \u00a311m on measures to ensure its 874 UK pubs can reopen this summer. It outlined a series of precautionary measures including: Gloves, masks and goggles for staff. Protective screens at the till and between tables. Ten hand sanitiser bottles per pub. Staff told to hold glasses at the base. Daily health checks on employees. Condiments will come in disposable sachets rather than reusable containers. The government has said some pubs could start reopening from 4 July, as part of the third phase of lockdown restrictions being eased. Guidance issued by the trade body UK Hospitality has previously suggested an end to bar service, while the British Beer and Pubs Association said this week the 27,000 UK pubs with beer gardens should be among the first to open. However, Wetherspoon\u2019s list of measures is the most detailed blueprint yet for how a visit to the pub could look in a post-lockdown world. The \u00a311m plan will include two staff members per pub, or more in bigger venues, specifically tasked with disinfecting surfaces such as door handles, handrails and card payment machines. Dedicated staff will also monitor the pub to ensure physical distancing is being maintained, while customers will be encouraged to use one of 10 hand sanitiser points in each pub. In areas where seating is dense, protective screens will be erected to create a barrier between tables; there will also be screens at the till. Staff will be given gloves, masks and goggles, although they will not be required to wear them. They will also be subject to daily health questionnaires and a health check using a digital thermometer. Workers will hold glasses at the base when they deliver drinks to tables. Where possible, each pub will have separate entrance and exit doors, with markings on the floor to guide any customers who become confused.

The BBPA said larger pubs were likely to have an advantage in being able to show that physical distancing can be maintained. Wetherspoon\u2019s pointed to the average 4,000 sq ft floor space of its venues and said almost 700 of its 867 UK pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio.",

As a freelance theatre-maker, Varjack will no longer be launching two new shows this summer at the Edinburgh fringe \u2013 the fruit of years of careful strategy \u2013 while all her other engagements are indefinitely on ice. But after the denial, anger, bargaining etc, Varjack thought she might at least end up at some sort of acceptance; maybe she could even come to see the closure of theatres as an opportunity to reimagine the art form wholesale. There\u2019s been some of this, says Varjack, but she\u2019s also realised that grieving for your livelihood \u2013 for your whole vanishing industry \u2013 isn\u2019t simply a process. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I\u2019m struggling to get past the shock stage myself, and I\u2019m not (or at least, no longer) a freelance artist \u2013 although as artistic director of <a href=\"https://www.cptheatre.co.uk/\">Camden People\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.cptheatre.co.uk/\">theatre</a>, I work closely with many of them. The point of CPT is to support emerging theatre-makers, particularly those making innovative or socially engaged work, so that they can get a foothold in the industry. We\u2019re only as good as the artists we work with \u2013 and those artists are, in the era of Covid-19, in serious trouble. Those we\u2019re closest to \u2013 artists from marginalised backgrounds, and at the fragile start of their careers \u2013 are more vulnerable than most as their work dries up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d01e78454ccde187f79d883c324c864c19d62a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d01e78454ccde187f79d883c324c864c19d62a7/0_0_2316_3088/750.jpg\" alt=\"Bryony Kimmings\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creative energy ... superstar live artist Bryony Kimmings has raised \u00a340,000 through her #GigAid support scheme</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that support hasn\u2019t been made available.

But the Arts Council can\u2019t cater for everyone: <a href=\"https://www.rashdash.co.uk/just-some-thinking\">some terrific artists have been refused funding</a>. And many more aren\u2019t eligible for the government\u2019s offer. Those whose income derives jointly from PAYE and freelance work can find themselves excluded. So too artists whose income is too small, those who\u2019ve freelanced for less than a year and foreign nationals whose visa status disqualifies them.

      "bodyText": "\u2018It\u2019s like the seven stages of grief,\u201d says Paula Varjack, of the way Covid-19 has affected the world of theatre. As a freelance theatre-maker, Varjack will no longer be launching two new shows this summer at the Edinburgh fringe \u2013 the fruit of years of careful strategy \u2013 while all her other engagements are indefinitely on ice. But after the denial, anger, bargaining etc, Varjack thought she might at least end up at some sort of acceptance; maybe she could even come to see the closure of theatres as an opportunity to reimagine the art form wholesale. There\u2019s been some of this, says Varjack, but she\u2019s also realised that grieving for your livelihood \u2013 for your whole vanishing industry \u2013 isn\u2019t simply a process. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle,\u201d she says. I\u2019m struggling to get past the shock stage myself, and I\u2019m not (or at least, no longer) a freelance artist \u2013 although as artistic director of Camden People\u2019s theatre, I work closely with many of them. The point of CPT is to support emerging theatre-makers, particularly those making innovative or socially engaged work, so that they can get a foothold in the industry. We\u2019re only as good as the artists we work with \u2013 and those artists are, in the era of Covid-19, in serious trouble. Those we\u2019re closest to \u2013 artists from marginalised backgrounds, and at the fragile start of their careers \u2013 are more vulnerable than most as their work dries up. Not that support hasn\u2019t been made available. There\u2019s the government\u2019s Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), and the Arts Council\u2019s emergency fund for creative practitioners. But the Arts Council can\u2019t cater for everyone: some terrific artists have been refused funding. And many more aren\u2019t eligible for the government\u2019s offer. Those whose income derives jointly from PAYE and freelance work can find themselves excluded. So too artists whose income is too small, those who\u2019ve freelanced for less than a year and foreign nationals whose visa status disqualifies them. Together, those categories cover a lot of theatre-makers; 70% of the industry\u2019s workforce is self-employed. Many are now left with no earning power and no institutional support. In its place, there is at least solidarity. I\u2019ve been speaking to freelancers about their plight, and everyone comments on the spirit of mutuality that\u2019s come to the fore. At CPT, we financially compensated all the artists whose shows were cancelled when we shut down \u2013 possible mainly because audience members donated the cost of their tickets, and several fellow artists \u201cpaid forward\u201d their cancellation fees. Elsewhere, superstar live artist Bryony Kimmings initiated her #GigAid support scheme, raising \u00a340,000 for artists who\u2019d lost work due to Covid-19, while theatre-maker Scottee offered paid mentoring sessions for producers and artists, and micro-commissions to create digital work for home viewing.

In 550 cases the employers put down they had 1,500 employees (the dollar value of the fortnightly payment) rather than just one employee. As a result, the 900,000 employers are estimated to only need to pay about 3.5 million workers, not 6.5 million as had been originally forecast, meaning the jobkeeper program will cost $70bn, not $130bn. The government is so far resisting calls from Labor to extend the payment to casuals and sectors of the workforce that were not eligible for the payment.

Clive Palmer plans high court challenge over being refused entry to WA Mining magnate Clive Palmer wanted to visit WA for meetings with businesspeople, senator Mathias Cormann and potential 2021 state election candidates for his United Australia party but was knocked back. He has told the ABC he plans to take the case to the high court and challenge the state\u2019s hard border closure. National death toll rises to 101 The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, reported an 80-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, died overnight in Concord Hospital. 75 Target stores to close Target owner Wesfarmers announced that as many as 75 of its stores across the country will close, placing more than 1,000 workers at risk of losing their jobs.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them.

The study, which will feed into the debate on when to open schools, found that children and young adults under the age of 20 appear 56% less likely to contract the virus than the over-20s, a finding that supports the idea that children are unlikely to play a major role in spreading the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s preliminary evidence, but the weight of evidence is clear that children appear to be less susceptible to Sars-Cov-2,\u201d said Russell Viner, a professor of adolescent health at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and a senior author on the review. \u201cThe balance of evidence is clearly that children are the safest group to be out in the community. They have the lowest prevalence of infections and the risk of death or severe infection from Covid-19 is exceptionally low in children,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for children themselves, the balance of risk is strongly in favour of a return to school given the very clear evidence of harm due to lockdown.\u201d Researchers assessed more than 6,000 recent papers on the pandemic, most of which \u2013 like the review itself - have not yet been peer reviewed or formally published in journals, and whittled them down to 18 that contained useful data on children\u2019s susceptibility to the virus. Nine of the papers examined in further detail were contact tracing studies that followed infections from person to person.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, reckons the deficit could max out close to \u00a3300bn this year, five times the sum borrowed a year ago, and almost twice as much as after the banking crash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0c8f345-2a12-402d-8615-b4517d7b7d18\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The deficit is the shortfall between government income and spending as measured each month by the Office for National Statistics. Tax receipts make up the vast majority of income, while spending on welfare, schools, healthcare and pensions make up most of its outgoings.</p>\n    <p>Successive governments have racked up deficits since 2000-2001, the last time Britain recorded a budget surplus. The deficit ballooned after the financial crisis as the economy went into recession.</p>\n    <p>When the government spends more than it receives, this adds to the overall level of the national debt \u2013 or the cumulative annual deficits ran over the past several decades. The national debt stood at \u00a31.8tn at the end of October.<br></p>\n    <p>The deficit matters because it signals the strength of the government\u2019s control over the public finances, which is important for convincing investors that Britain can pay back the money it borrows. More importantly, the government must pay interest on its debts to the investors it borrows money from such as pension funds, City banks and asset managers. The higher the debt, the more interest the government must pay, potentially cutting funds available for public spending.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A decade ago, Britain would have been described as living beyond its means. This time around, warnings about maxed-out credit cards will only come from yesterday\u2019s men who favoured austerity. It appears there is now broader acceptance of an argument defeated by the Conservatives a decade ago \u2013 that the budget deficit is more complex than a family\u2019s bank balance.</p> \n<p>The household metaphor holding sway today is about public borrowing and central heating: it\u2019s supposed to come on when the weather is cold. And right now, despite the late spring sunshine, the economic outlook for Britain is wintery bleak.</p> \n<p>But well above and beyond the tools a family could call upon to handle a blowout credit card bill, Britain has the advantage of the Bank of England sinking interest rates to the lowest level in its 325-year history, alongside its \u00a3645bn quantitative easing programme \u2013 sucking up government debt to keep borrowing costs low.</p> \n<p>Although the national debt \u2013 the sum total of all annual deficits \u2013 surged by 17.4 percentage points to 97.7% of GDP in April \u2013 about \u00a31.9tn \u2013 interest payments on government bonds fell by \u00a31.2bn comparedwith a year ago.</p> \n<p>There are hopes that Britain can escape 2020 without a major structural deficit \u2013 persistently higher levels of annual borrowing. Ministers are banking on growth bouncing back as lockdown measures are lifted, and that the nation\u2019s productive capacity is kept intact thanks to their emergency support schemes. Under such a scenario, the deficit could shrink rapidly.</p> \n<p>But there are signs the crisis could go on for longer than first anticipated. As acknowledged by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/chancellor-plays-down-hopes-of-quick-economic-recovery\">the jury is out on how big the long-term damage will be.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Once the immediate health emergency passes, focus will however turn to tackling the deficit. Especially if the extreme levels of borrowing in April continue.</p> \n<p>Leaked Treasury documents have though suggested austerity could be on the menu again to tackle soaring borrowing levels. But unlike previous occupants of his office, the chancellor has so far expressed a preference for growing the economy to cut the deficit.</p> \n<p>The lessons from a decade ago suggest a fresh round of cuts would choke off any recovery, making matters worse for the public purse down the line.

      "bodyText": "It was inevitable that borrowing would hit a peacetime record this year. In April alone, the government borrowed more in a single month than was expected for the whole year before the coronavirus pandemic struck. According to the first official Covid-19 cost estimates, the government borrowed \u00a362bn in April, more than at any time since comparable records began in 1993. Not even the depths of the 2008 financial crisis come close. Tax income in April was obliterated with the economy at a standstill, while spending soared as the government sought to cushion the blow. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, reckons the deficit could max out close to \u00a3300bn this year, five times the sum borrowed a year ago, and almost twice as much as after the banking crash. A decade ago, Britain would have been described as living beyond its means. This time around, warnings about maxed-out credit cards will only come from yesterday\u2019s men who favoured austerity. It appears there is now broader acceptance of an argument defeated by the Conservatives a decade ago \u2013 that the budget deficit is more complex than a family\u2019s bank balance. The household metaphor holding sway today is about public borrowing and central heating: it\u2019s supposed to come on when the weather is cold. And right now, despite the late spring sunshine, the economic outlook for Britain is wintery bleak. But well above and beyond the tools a family could call upon to handle a blowout credit card bill, Britain has the advantage of the Bank of England sinking interest rates to the lowest level in its 325-year history, alongside its \u00a3645bn quantitative easing programme \u2013 sucking up government debt to keep borrowing costs low. Although the national debt \u2013 the sum total of all annual deficits \u2013 surged by 17.4 percentage points to 97.7% of GDP in April \u2013 about \u00a31.9tn \u2013 interest payments on government bonds fell by \u00a31.2bn comparedwith a year ago. There are hopes that Britain can escape 2020 without a major structural deficit \u2013 persistently higher levels of annual borrowing. Ministers are banking on growth bouncing back as lockdown measures are lifted, and that the nation\u2019s productive capacity is kept intact thanks to their emergency support schemes. Under such a scenario, the deficit could shrink rapidly. But there are signs the crisis could go on for longer than first anticipated. As acknowledged by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the jury is out on how big the long-term damage will be. Once the immediate health emergency passes, focus will however turn to tackling the deficit. Especially if the extreme levels of borrowing in April continue. Leaked Treasury documents have though suggested austerity could be on the menu again to tackle soaring borrowing levels. But unlike previous occupants of his office, the chancellor has so far expressed a preference for growing the economy to cut the deficit. The lessons from a decade ago suggest a fresh round of cuts would choke off any recovery, making matters worse for the public purse down the line. Britain could prove to be intensely relaxed about higher levels of borrowing for some time to come.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Just when you think things can\u2019t get much more surreal, we hear that Donald Trump has been dosing himself up with the anti-malarial drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">hydroxychloroquine</a> in efforts to ward off the coronavirus that he doesn\u2019t yet have. \u201cI\u2019m taking it for about a week and a half now and I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he told reporters during a White House briefing. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine, is completely unproven as a treatment for Covid-19 and can have dangerous side-effects, you can only wonder about the president\u2019s state of mind. And that of his medical team who are happily prescribing him a drug that is far more likely to do him harm than good. Next he\u2019ll be hooking himself up on a ventilator at night. I thought my hypochondria was bad \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times over the past 10 weeks when I\u2019ve woken up with a slight headache or the merest hint of a sore throat and imagined I had the virus \u2013 but it\u2019s never occurred to me to start dosing myself up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">remdesivir</a>. It would be like me marching into the doctor\u2019s and demanding to be put on a course of chemotherapy on the off chance that I had cancer. Or having elective surgery to remove my appendix to ensure that I don\u2019t get peritonitis.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Two weeks back my daughter was tidying her garden in Minneapolis when she came across a small burrow of tiny, furless animals, with their eyes shut, that were clearly no more than a day or so old. She sent me a picture and we wondered if they might be moles, before someone pointed out they were above ground, had large ears and were obviously rabbits. Anna even got round to setting up a webcam so she could check up on them at all times, and we got used to watching the mother returning from time to time to feed them and scrape her fur to keep them warm. At a time when so much else in the world seemed so bleak, they came to represent something new and hopeful. A week or so ago, we got the call that we had been dreading. The webcam had picked up a neighbour\u2019s cat entering the burrow. When Anna went out to check up on them, there was no sign of the bunnies. Then today, Anna was looking out of her kitchen window and spotted a small rabbit at the bottom of her garden. It was almost certainly from a different burrow, but I would like to believe it was one that had escaped the carnage and come back to let us know that just occasionally the natural world can provide a happy ending.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson sold himself to many voters at the last election as the great communicator: the leader who could unite a divided country and get Brexit done. So it\u2019s been a surprise to find just how invisible he\u2019s been since recovering from the coronavirus. He\u2019s given one confusing TV statement \u2013 with no questions allowed \u2013 and sent out junior cabinet ministers in his place at the Downing Street press conference. One explanation for his absenteeism over the last week has been that he was so wounded by his mauling from Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions that he had spent the last seven days preparing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/this-time-boris-is-better-prepared-but-the-qc-still-gets-under-his-skin-pmqs-john-crace\">this week\u2019s encounter</a>. If so, it only partially paid off: Boris was much more of his usual aggressive, unpleasant self, but the Labour leader still came out comfortably ahead on points. Not least because Boris insisted that all those overseas nationals who were working on low salaries in the NHS would have to pay a visa surcharge of \u00a3624 to access health services if they got ill while doing their jobs of trying to keep the rest of us alive. It was so obviously unjust and immoral that Boris was shamed into doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">massive U-turn</a> the following day. There was no screeching reversal, however, on him forcing through a vote preventing MPs from accessing Commons proceedings remotely at a time when the official government policy is still for people to work from home if they possibly can. When recess ends in 10 days\u2019 time, the only MPs able to join in the debate will be the 50 or so allowed in under the physical distancing guidelines. So MPs from constituencies remote from London will be in effect disenfranchised. Some would call it a scandal. Boris calls it taking back control.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>We need to talk about Kevin. Again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/zoom-dog-groom-how-stay-alert-covid-19-boris-johnson\">Last week</a> I wrote about my friend Kevin\u2019s experience of coronavirus testing as performance art. What neither of us had realised was that he was only in the first act of the play. Two weeks to the day after his initial test, for which he was never able to get the results, he was offered a second test. On Monday this week he went off to have that second test. The following day a result of \u201cunclear\u201d arrived back, so a further test was required. However, what was also unclear was whether the result was from the first or second test. Kevin rang the ironically named helpdesk which, as ever, had no information and put him on hold for several minutes. After a discussion with all of his colleagues, the adviser reported back that they had unanimously concluded that the result couldn\u2019t have come from the second test as they had never known of an instance when the system had been that efficient.

      "bodyText": "Monday Just when you think things can\u2019t get much more surreal, we hear that Donald Trump has been dosing himself up with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in efforts to ward off the coronavirus that he doesn\u2019t yet have. \u201cI\u2019m taking it for about a week and a half now and I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he told reporters during a White House briefing. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine, is completely unproven as a treatment for Covid-19 and can have dangerous side-effects, you can only wonder about the president\u2019s state of mind. And that of his medical team who are happily prescribing him a drug that is far more likely to do him harm than good. Next he\u2019ll be hooking himself up on a ventilator at night. I thought my hypochondria was bad \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times over the past 10 weeks when I\u2019ve woken up with a slight headache or the merest hint of a sore throat and imagined I had the virus \u2013 but it\u2019s never occurred to me to start dosing myself up with remdesivir. It would be like me marching into the doctor\u2019s and demanding to be put on a course of chemotherapy on the off chance that I had cancer. Or having elective surgery to remove my appendix to ensure that I don\u2019t get peritonitis. Tuesday Two weeks back my daughter was tidying her garden in Minneapolis when she came across a small burrow of tiny, furless animals, with their eyes shut, that were clearly no more than a day or so old. She sent me a picture and we wondered if they might be moles, before someone pointed out they were above ground, had large ears and were obviously rabbits. Anna even got round to setting up a webcam so she could check up on them at all times, and we got used to watching the mother returning from time to time to feed them and scrape her fur to keep them warm. At a time when so much else in the world seemed so bleak, they came to represent something new and hopeful. A week or so ago, we got the call that we had been dreading. The webcam had picked up a neighbour\u2019s cat entering the burrow. When Anna went out to check up on them, there was no sign of the bunnies. Then today, Anna was looking out of her kitchen window and spotted a small rabbit at the bottom of her garden. It was almost certainly from a different burrow, but I would like to believe it was one that had escaped the carnage and come back to let us know that just occasionally the natural world can provide a happy ending. Wednesday Boris Johnson sold himself to many voters at the last election as the great communicator: the leader who could unite a divided country and get Brexit done. So it\u2019s been a surprise to find just how invisible he\u2019s been since recovering from the coronavirus. He\u2019s given one confusing TV statement \u2013 with no questions allowed \u2013 and sent out junior cabinet ministers in his place at the Downing Street press conference. One explanation for his absenteeism over the last week has been that he was so wounded by his mauling from Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions that he had spent the last seven days preparing for this week\u2019s encounter. If so, it only partially paid off: Boris was much more of his usual aggressive, unpleasant self, but the Labour leader still came out comfortably ahead on points. Not least because Boris insisted that all those overseas nationals who were working on low salaries in the NHS would have to pay a visa surcharge of \u00a3624 to access health services if they got ill while doing their jobs of trying to keep the rest of us alive. It was so obviously unjust and immoral that Boris was shamed into doing a massive U-turn the following day. There was no screeching reversal, however, on him forcing through a vote preventing MPs from accessing Commons proceedings remotely at a time when the official government policy is still for people to work from home if they possibly can. When recess ends in 10 days\u2019 time, the only MPs able to join in the debate will be the 50 or so allowed in under the physical distancing guidelines. So MPs from constituencies remote from London will be in effect disenfranchised. Some would call it a scandal. Boris calls it taking back control. Thursday We need to talk about Kevin. Again. Last week I wrote about my friend Kevin\u2019s experience of coronavirus testing as performance art. What neither of us had realised was that he was only in the first act of the play. Two weeks to the day after his initial test, for which he was never able to get the results, he was offered a second test. On Monday this week he went off to have that second test. The following day a result of \u201cunclear\u201d arrived back, so a further test was required. However, what was also unclear was whether the result was from the first or second test. Kevin rang the ironically named helpdesk which, as ever, had no information and put him on hold for several minutes. After a discussion with all of his colleagues, the adviser reported back that they had unanimously concluded that the result couldn\u2019t have come from the second test as they had never known of an instance when the system had been that efficient. So on the basis of their absolute certainty of the incompetence of the system, they say he should ring back next Monday to find out if the series is to be extended to a third test. And the government wonders why the whole country doesn\u2019t share its excitement when it announces a new testing programme. Friday I\u2019ve watched more of the Downing Street press briefings than I care to remember and will have to endure many more before the pandemic is over. Though sadly I will miss Priti Patel\u2019s outing this evening as the home secretary is such a liability she is only allowed out in public when no sketch writers are writing for the following day. Already though, there are signs that the government is regretting its decision to give the country daily updates, not least because more often than not the minister taking the press conference \u2013 Boris has long since decided these are too much like hard work and can\u2019t be bothered to turn up \u2013 has nothing new to announce.

Despite the widespread negative publicity around a number of recent high-profile regeneration schemes that have become synonymous with social cleansing \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">Heygate Estate</a> in Southwark to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/18/-sp-truth-about-gentrification-how-woodberry-down-became-woodberry-park\">Woodberry Down</a> in Hackney \u2013 the threat of demolition and displacement remains very much alive across the capital and beyond.</p> <p>\u201cThere is now more awareness of the importance of involving the community in decisions about the future of estates,\u201d says Sendra, \u201cbut demolition is still taken as the starting point. The <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/improving-quality/estate-regeneration\">mayor\u2019s guidance</a> is directed at achieving the councils and developers\u2019 goals, rather than the interests of the existing communities.\u201d<br><br>In 2018, following the backlash against a number of regeneration schemes, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, introduced a new requirement for every estate regeneration project involving demolition of social homes: there would have to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/sadiq-khan-to-cut-cash-for-housing-schemes-opposed-by-residents\">ballot of residents</a> before receiving City Hall funding. But, as many have pointed out, the ballots are open to manipulation and can be easily framed to achieve the desired outcome. Sendra is currently working with a community in Brent where, he says, the council is only presenting the residents with one option. \u201cSo far, most ballots follow the template, \u2018Do you agree with regeneration?

The case studies range from the lengthy battle to realise the groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.wech.co.uk/\">Walterton and Elgin Community Homes</a> project in Westminster, to the fiery direct action of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/05/focus-e15-mums-fight-for-right-to-home\">Focus E15 campaign</a> in Newham, to the collaborative strategies of the <a href=\"http://www.peach-e16.org.uk/\">People\u2019s Empowerment Alliance for Custom House</a>. In each case, the key obstacles, tools and lessons are drawn out, painting a picture of how communities can triumph against the odds when they pull together.</p> <p>\u201cThe strategies are all focused on challenging the linearity of the council-led regeneration processes,\u201d says Fitzpatrick, \u201cand putting spanners in the cogs of their logic to slow it down. These tools can also help to organise the community towards a common goal.\u201d</p> <p>Linda Sanders, of the <a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/\">West Ken and Gibbs Green estates campaign</a> in Hammersmith and Fulham, says she and her neighbours have spent the last decade fighting attempts to bulldoze their homes, which were in the firing line of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jun/25/earls-court-how-to-do-regeneration-wrong\">Capco\u2019s gargantuan Earl\u2019s Court redevelopment</a>.<br><br>\u201cWe know that sticking together has been imperative,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned to share ideas from other campaigns and just get stuck in.\u201d She says their tactics have ranged from holding a Victorian dressing-up day and parading outside the local pub when it was threatened with closure, to \u201cvisiting the developer\u2019s own backyard\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5765aef4d476930d09004c575409383526445a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5765aef4d476930d09004c575409383526445a/0_145_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tenants and supporters marched from Cressingham Gardens to Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton in 2017 to demand a ballot on the planned redevelopment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tenants and supporters marched from Cressingham Gardens to Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton in 2017 to demand a ballot on the planned redevelopment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rowe/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their carnivalesque direct actions have been combined with the formal tools of setting up a <a href=\"http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/\">Community Land Trust</a> and preparing their own <a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/the-peoples-plan/\">People\u2019s Plan</a> for up to 300 new homes, without demolishing any of the existing housing, as well as launching a judicial review and applying for the right to transfer. All of which helped to grind the developer\u2019s momentum to a halt and encourage the newly Labour-led council to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/08/residents-of-london-peoples-estates-hail-council-move-against-developer\">demand the estate be handed back to the local authority</a>. As Sanders puts it: \u201cAfter all these delays, selling luxury flats became harder to do.\u201d</p> <p>What comes across in all of the stories is the sheer amount of effort and willpower required to keep these campaigns going for so many years, as well as the uphill struggle to find the required expertise to challenge the developmental juggernauts. \u201cYou\u2019re hit with this tsunami of disciplines that you\u2019ve got to get your head around very quickly,\u201d says Keene. \u201cI considered myself reasonably politically active, but I didn\u2019t understand how a local authority worked, or housing management, or the law, or the planning process.\u201d</p> <p>He has since drawn up a <a href=\"http://www.db-estate.co.uk/08.RegenCheatSheet/00.CheatSheet.html\">\u201cRegen cheat sheet\u201d</a>, as a quick guide to help others in his position get their heads around the fiendish complexities of estate regeneration.<br><br>The book adds to this kind of work, bringing activists together to share their experiences and build a collective body of knowledge that will be so important for future campaigns. Its release is timely: the coronavirus pandemic has shown just how powerful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">community self-organising, mutual aid and the solidarity of local support networks can be</a>. By compiling such a broad (if London-centric) range of case studies, Sendra and Fitzpatrick have performed a vital public service, helping to ensure that any communities facing top-down regeneration in future know that they are not alone \u2013 and that it is eminently possible to hold off the bulldozers.

The case studies range from the lengthy battle to realise the groundbreaking Walterton and Elgin Community Homes project in Westminster, to the fiery direct action of the Focus E15 campaign in Newham, to the collaborative strategies of the People\u2019s Empowerment Alliance for Custom House. In each case, the key obstacles, tools and lessons are drawn out, painting a picture of how communities can triumph against the odds when they pull together. \u201cThe strategies are all focused on challenging the linearity of the council-led regeneration processes,\u201d says Fitzpatrick, \u201cand putting spanners in the cogs of their logic to slow it down. These tools can also help to organise the community towards a common goal.\u201d Linda Sanders, of the West Ken and Gibbs Green estates campaign in Hammersmith and Fulham, says she and her neighbours have spent the last decade fighting attempts to bulldoze their homes, which were in the firing line of Capco\u2019s gargantuan Earl\u2019s Court redevelopment. \u201cWe know that sticking together has been imperative,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned to share ideas from other campaigns and just get stuck in.\u201d She says their tactics have ranged from holding a Victorian dressing-up day and parading outside the local pub when it was threatened with closure, to \u201cvisiting the developer\u2019s own backyard\u201d. Their carnivalesque direct actions have been combined with the formal tools of setting up a Community Land Trust and preparing their own People\u2019s Plan for up to 300 new homes, without demolishing any of the existing housing, as well as launching a judicial review and applying for the right to transfer. All of which helped to grind the developer\u2019s momentum to a halt and encourage the newly Labour-led council to demand the estate be handed back to the local authority. As Sanders puts it: \u201cAfter all these delays, selling luxury flats became harder to do.\u201d What comes across in all of the stories is the sheer amount of effort and willpower required to keep these campaigns going for so many years, as well as the uphill struggle to find the required expertise to challenge the developmental juggernauts. \u201cYou\u2019re hit with this tsunami of disciplines that you\u2019ve got to get your head around very quickly,\u201d says Keene. \u201cI considered myself reasonably politically active, but I didn\u2019t understand how a local authority worked, or housing management, or the law, or the planning process.\u201d He has since drawn up a \u201cRegen cheat sheet\u201d, as a quick guide to help others in his position get their heads around the fiendish complexities of estate regeneration. The book adds to this kind of work, bringing activists together to share their experiences and build a collective body of knowledge that will be so important for future campaigns. Its release is timely: the coronavirus pandemic has shown just how powerful community self-organising, mutual aid and the solidarity of local support networks can be. By compiling such a broad (if London-centric) range of case studies, Sendra and Fitzpatrick have performed a vital public service, helping to ensure that any communities facing top-down regeneration in future know that they are not alone \u2013 and that it is eminently possible to hold off the bulldozers. For now, at least. \u2022 Community-Led Regeneration: A Toolkit for Residents and Planners by Pablo Sendra and Daniel Fitzpatrick can be downloaded for free here.",

But a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/government-rows-back-on-1-june-english-primary-schools-reopening-plan\">growing number of councils have said they will not comply</a>, and Welsh and Scottish schools will not reopen until later.</p> <p>In accounts submitted by hundreds of teachers to the Guardian community team, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/plans-to-reopen-schools-on-1-june-in-jeopardy-as-education-unions-tell-staff-not-to-engage-with-prepartions-1\">there remains widespread concern about the feasibility of physical distancing in schools and the health risks that poses to pupils and staff, </a>as well as how best to balance children\u2019s educational needs with their welfare and wellbeing.</p> <p>Some teachers say they are reassured by the preparations made by their schools but complained that ministers have failed to provide detailed guidance. They want to review the evidence published on Friday by the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which warned that June 1 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/22/scientists-warn-1-june-too-early-schools-reopen-england-coronavirus-track-trace\">too early to reopen safely</a>.</p> <p>Sandra, 50, a supply teacher in Doncaster, says she welcomed her primary school\u2019s plans to initially only allow one year back in early June, with others not returning unless it is deemed safe.</p> <p>She is concerned that headteachers have been left to devise their own plans without much input from government. \u201cSome people are really anti teachers because of this and think the NHS has gone back and faced this and teachers don\u2019t want to,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t get taken into consideration is things like children can\u2019t share equipment, crayons, can\u2019t access books.

      "bodyText": "Teachers have warned that the UK government\u2019s push to reopen primary schools in England on 1 June will be a logistical nightmare. Under the plans, schools have been told to prepare to resume reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as any early years education they provide. But a growing number of councils have said they will not comply, and Welsh and Scottish schools will not reopen until later. In accounts submitted by hundreds of teachers to the Guardian community team, there remains widespread concern about the feasibility of physical distancing in schools and the health risks that poses to pupils and staff, as well as how best to balance children\u2019s educational needs with their welfare and wellbeing. Some teachers say they are reassured by the preparations made by their schools but complained that ministers have failed to provide detailed guidance. They want to review the evidence published on Friday by the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which warned that June 1 was too early to reopen safely. Sandra, 50, a supply teacher in Doncaster, says she welcomed her primary school\u2019s plans to initially only allow one year back in early June, with others not returning unless it is deemed safe. She is concerned that headteachers have been left to devise their own plans without much input from government. \u201cSome people are really anti teachers because of this and think the NHS has gone back and faced this and teachers don\u2019t want to,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t get taken into consideration is things like children can\u2019t share equipment, crayons, can\u2019t access books. It is a mammoth organisational task. If we were in normal class sizes that\u2019d be horrifying.\u201d Carole Powell, a teacher and manager at the Stoke Poges School in Buckinghamshire, says reception, year 1 and year 6 will each be split into six groups of 10 pupils who will have staggered starting, lunch and break times, come in at different entrances and wash their hands in the toilets before entering their classroom.

      "body": "<p>Few residents of the world\u2019s great metropolises would have thought much about plagues before this year. Outside China and east Asia \u2013 made vigilant by swine flu and Sars \u2013 the trauma of pandemics such as Spanish flu or typhoid has largely faded from popular memory. But our cities remember.</p> <p>An outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-pandemics-have-changed-american-cities-often-for-the-better-137945\">prompted administrators</a> to take over the task of cleaning streets, clearing gutters and collecting rubbish. It worked, and governments across the US adopted the responsibility over the next decades. A misconception that the odour emanating from wastewater was responsible for diseases such as cholera prompted one of <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/cholera-pandemic-new-york-city-london-paris-green-space\">the world\u2019s first modern underground sewer systems</a> in London, and the development of wider, straighter and paved roads - which helped prevent water from stagnating.</p> <p>Cities have evolved over the centuries according to theories of how to fight disease, turning features such as public parks and sewers into \u201ca mundane part of city thinking\u201d, says Michele Acuto, a professor of global urban politics at the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>The legacy Covid-19 might leave on the world\u2019s great cities is being hotly debated, although most specialists admit it is too early to know for sure. \u201cIt will depend in the end on how we analyse this virus: how is it spreading? How is it making people sick?\u201d says Roger Keil, a professor of environmental studies at Toronto\u2019s York University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full answers, but once they become clearer, urban planners and other professionals will start to think as their predecessors did 100 years ago, as they laid sewer pipes and cleaned out parts of the city that were considered insalubrious.\u201d</p> <p>The sanitary infrastructure that trails in the wake of Covid-19 may be digital, Acuto says, in the form of the surveillance technology used by cities such as Singapore and Seoul to retrace the steps of infected people and warn others who have crossed their path. Life in the megacities of the future will be less private than ever.</p> <p>Some of the changes already taking shape may make cities more pleasurable: mayors from Bogot\u00e1 to Budapest are taking the opportunity to lay down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars\">vast networks of bike lanes</a>. Athens is widening its pavements, enlarging public squares and banning traffic from areas beneath the Acropolis. The pandemic has strengthened the case for making neighbourhoods self-sufficient, in the vein of Melbourne\u2019s plan to put shopping, leisure and work <a href=\"https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/policy-and-strategy/planning-for-melbourne/plan-melbourne/20-minute-neighbourhoods\">within 20 minutes of its residents\u2019 homes</a>, or the promise by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/paris-mayor-unveils-15-minute-city-plan-in-re-election-campaign\">transform it </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/paris-mayor-unveils-15-minute-city-plan-in-re-election-campaign\"> into a 15-minute city</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"405d9f60c4111318072bc3a02bdd68ea8da42cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/405d9f60c4111318072bc3a02bdd68ea8da42cf1/0_406_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk on a closed street as part of New York City\u2019s Open Streets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk on a closed street as part of New York City\u2019s Open Streets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the good news. The bad is that the pandemic is a catastrophe for many of the things that make cities worth living in. Busy streets, squares and nightclubs will be zones for transmission for as long as the virus lasts. And once it does abate, many of the comedy clubs, bars, galleries and theatres that have shuttered their doors may never reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s crippling to the life and energy of New York,\u201d says Roddy Bottum, a member of the band Faith No More and a fixture of the city\u2019s music scene.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many venues in the city that are small, and have to keep up their month-to-month payments. How are those places going to survive? How will opera take place, or Broadway shows? Social distancing in the audience and masks on stage? It\u2019s horrifying to think about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible for a while,\u201d says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of geography and urban studies at Temple University. \u201cPeople have to get used to the idea of sitting closely again. Then they have to have enough job security and money to blow 100 quid on an evening of interpretative dance.\u201d</p> <p>But he is among those who are bullish on the prospects of a resurgence of city life. \u201cThe modern city is indestructible,\u201d he says. \u201cFires, earthquakes, bombings, the blitz of London or the siege of Stalingrad: these cities lost population, but then they came back.\u201d</p> <p>People return for fundamental reasons, he says. They need work, and cities create lots of it. \u201cCities are engines of economic growth,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want work, you eventually have to come to the cities, because the density makes work more efficient. They are the most innovative and creative places in the world; where the creative types, the artists, the scientists, compete and collaborate. If there is going to be a rebound, it\u2019s not going to be in the rural areas. It\u2019s going to be in the cities.\u201d</p> <p>But the rebound might not be strongest in the cities that currently have superstar status. People were already leaving the cores of metropolises such as New York and Paris before Covid struck, says Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University in California. London\u2019s population was being sustained <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c88b4c54-b925-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203\">only by international arrivals</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe outmigration was being accelerated by several factors,\u201d Kotkin says. \u201cMillennials are getting into their 30s and are thinking of buying a house, getting married, having kids, and of course the pandemic is going to make space more attractive.

      "bodyText": "Few residents of the world\u2019s great metropolises would have thought much about plagues before this year. Outside China and east Asia \u2013 made vigilant by swine flu and Sars \u2013 the trauma of pandemics such as Spanish flu or typhoid has largely faded from popular memory. But our cities remember. An outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793 prompted administrators to take over the task of cleaning streets, clearing gutters and collecting rubbish. It worked, and governments across the US adopted the responsibility over the next decades. A misconception that the odour emanating from wastewater was responsible for diseases such as cholera prompted one of the world\u2019s first modern underground sewer systems in London, and the development of wider, straighter and paved roads - which helped prevent water from stagnating. Cities have evolved over the centuries according to theories of how to fight disease, turning features such as public parks and sewers into \u201ca mundane part of city thinking\u201d, says Michele Acuto, a professor of global urban politics at the University of Melbourne. The legacy Covid-19 might leave on the world\u2019s great cities is being hotly debated, although most specialists admit it is too early to know for sure. \u201cIt will depend in the end on how we analyse this virus: how is it spreading? How is it making people sick?\u201d says Roger Keil, a professor of environmental studies at Toronto\u2019s York University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full answers, but once they become clearer, urban planners and other professionals will start to think as their predecessors did 100 years ago, as they laid sewer pipes and cleaned out parts of the city that were considered insalubrious.\u201d The sanitary infrastructure that trails in the wake of Covid-19 may be digital, Acuto says, in the form of the surveillance technology used by cities such as Singapore and Seoul to retrace the steps of infected people and warn others who have crossed their path. Life in the megacities of the future will be less private than ever. Some of the changes already taking shape may make cities more pleasurable: mayors from Bogot\u00e1 to Budapest are taking the opportunity to lay down vast networks of bike lanes. Athens is widening its pavements, enlarging public squares and banning traffic from areas beneath the Acropolis. The pandemic has strengthened the case for making neighbourhoods self-sufficient, in the vein of Melbourne\u2019s plan to put shopping, leisure and work within 20 minutes of its residents\u2019 homes, or the promise by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to transform it into a 15-minute city. That\u2019s the good news. The bad is that the pandemic is a catastrophe for many of the things that make cities worth living in. Busy streets, squares and nightclubs will be zones for transmission for as long as the virus lasts. And once it does abate, many of the comedy clubs, bars, galleries and theatres that have shuttered their doors may never reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s crippling to the life and energy of New York,\u201d says Roddy Bottum, a member of the band Faith No More and a fixture of the city\u2019s music scene. \u201cThere are so many venues in the city that are small, and have to keep up their month-to-month payments. How are those places going to survive? How will opera take place, or Broadway shows? Social distancing in the audience and masks on stage? It\u2019s horrifying to think about.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible for a while,\u201d says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of geography and urban studies at Temple University. \u201cPeople have to get used to the idea of sitting closely again. Then they have to have enough job security and money to blow 100 quid on an evening of interpretative dance.\u201d But he is among those who are bullish on the prospects of a resurgence of city life. \u201cThe modern city is indestructible,\u201d he says. \u201cFires, earthquakes, bombings, the blitz of London or the siege of Stalingrad: these cities lost population, but then they came back.\u201d People return for fundamental reasons, he says. They need work, and cities create lots of it. \u201cCities are engines of economic growth,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want work, you eventually have to come to the cities, because the density makes work more efficient. They are the most innovative and creative places in the world; where the creative types, the artists, the scientists, compete and collaborate. If there is going to be a rebound, it\u2019s not going to be in the rural areas. It\u2019s going to be in the cities.\u201d But the rebound might not be strongest in the cities that currently have superstar status. People were already leaving the cores of metropolises such as New York and Paris before Covid struck, says Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University in California. London\u2019s population was being sustained only by international arrivals. \u201cThe outmigration was being accelerated by several factors,\u201d Kotkin says. \u201cMillennials are getting into their 30s and are thinking of buying a house, getting married, having kids, and of course the pandemic is going to make space more attractive. And the kind of urban development we\u2019ve had has produced enormous inequality, much worse in the big cities, and that was chasing people out.\u201d The enforced experiment in working by Zoom over recent months might convince some they can survive outside big cities. Downtown offices were falling out of favour for years even before Covid sent tens of millions of employees home \u2013 companies such as Twitter and Salesforce have already said they will allow workers to stay there. The need to physically distance their employees may require companies to rent even more expensive office space, adding to the allure of alternative arrangements. It is true that cities have historically bounced back from pandemics, Kotkin adds, \u201cbut some went through hundreds of years of decline. They pay a price. They won\u2019t disappear, but we\u2019ll have a much more dispersed world.\u201d If the fate of the metropolis is to be decided anywhere, it will be Asia, where the largest migratory waves in history have been into cities such as the Indian capital, Delhi, for the past three decades. Millions of those migrants left for their home villages in the days after India announced it was going into lockdown. Many of those who didn\u2019t now find themselves trapped in cities, such as Mumbai or Bangalore, and running out of cash.

      "body": "<p><strong>A few years ago, I sought help for my </strong><strong>obsessive</strong><strong>-compulsive </strong><strong>disorder, which I could trace back to when I was</strong><strong> about</strong><strong> 14. I did CBT, which I found positive and helpful.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have a son who is now two years old, and </strong><strong>worry he has started to display OCD tendencies, and that I am passing it on. Though I am far better than I was, I struggle with managing some behaviours, including handwashing. </strong><strong>With the threat of Covid-19, this has ramped up,</strong><strong> and I have been </strong><strong>fastidious about the whole household washing hands. I try to do it in a \u201cnormal\u201d way, but sometimes feel I need to wash my hands more often. I wonder if my son picks up on the fact that I am more stressed when we wash his hands. He recently said: \u201cI need wash my hands again \u2013 I dirty\u201d and got upset when I tried to dry his hands with a towel, wanting a different one; just being touched by the towel I had offered provoked him to wash his hands again.</strong></p> <p><strong>We have just started toilet training, which has opened up a </strong><strong>new world of opportunities for my son to touch the toilet/potty, and I don\u2019t know how to be reasonable about what contact necessitates hand</strong><strong>washing. How can I keep my OCD under wraps and act as normally as possible around my son, to avoid him developing similar issues?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s great you are so thoughtful about your behaviour and how it may affect your son. I consulted psychotherapist Graham Music (<a href=\"http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>) and the first thing we both wanted to know was: what happened to you aged 14? This felt like an important piece of information. My own OCD behaviours stemmed from my mother going to hospital when I was nine; they can still rear their heads <strong>\u2013</strong> but in a diluted form <strong>\u2013</strong> when I\u2019m anxious and am seeking to control my immediate environment because my usual coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. This is probably what\u2019s happening to you. In your treatment, I\u2019m sure you learned that OCD is a particular set of behaviours around intrusive thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Music said, \u201clet\u2019s think about your boy. There\u2019s something that happens around that age anyway; two-year-olds can be quite obsessional; that\u2019s normal. He\u2019s very likely imitating you, rather than starting to display true OCD behaviour which, generally speaking, manifests later.\u201d</p> <p>Your son may be picking up on your anxiety for everyone to keep their hands clean and wanting to do the right thing <strong>\u2013</strong> and nothing more.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, I sought help for my obsessive-compulsive disorder, which I could trace back to when I was about 14. I did CBT, which I found positive and helpful. I have a son who is now two years old, and worry he has started to display OCD tendencies, and that I am passing it on. Though I am far better than I was, I struggle with managing some behaviours, including handwashing. With the threat of Covid-19, this has ramped up, and I have been fastidious about the whole household washing hands. I try to do it in a \u201cnormal\u201d way, but sometimes feel I need to wash my hands more often. I wonder if my son picks up on the fact that I am more stressed when we wash his hands. He recently said: \u201cI need wash my hands again \u2013 I dirty\u201d and got upset when I tried to dry his hands with a towel, wanting a different one; just being touched by the towel I had offered provoked him to wash his hands again. We have just started toilet training, which has opened up a new world of opportunities for my son to touch the toilet/potty, and I don\u2019t know how to be reasonable about what contact necessitates handwashing. How can I keep my OCD under wraps and act as normally as possible around my son, to avoid him developing similar issues? It\u2019s great you are so thoughtful about your behaviour and how it may affect your son. I consulted psychotherapist Graham Music (childpsychotherapy.org.uk) and the first thing we both wanted to know was: what happened to you aged 14? This felt like an important piece of information. My own OCD behaviours stemmed from my mother going to hospital when I was nine; they can still rear their heads \u2013 but in a diluted form \u2013 when I\u2019m anxious and am seeking to control my immediate environment because my usual coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. This is probably what\u2019s happening to you. In your treatment, I\u2019m sure you learned that OCD is a particular set of behaviours around intrusive thoughts. \u201cFirst,\u201d Music said, \u201clet\u2019s think about your boy. There\u2019s something that happens around that age anyway; two-year-olds can be quite obsessional; that\u2019s normal. He\u2019s very likely imitating you, rather than starting to display true OCD behaviour which, generally speaking, manifests later.\u201d Your son may be picking up on your anxiety for everyone to keep their hands clean and wanting to do the right thing \u2013 and nothing more. Of course you don\u2019t want it to turn into something else, but in these heightened times, and with your history, you may be picking up on something you recognise, and giving it more meaning than it deserves. One thing that may help, Music advised, is \u201cif you could find ways of relaxing a little, looking after your anxious self\u201d. What might those be at the moment? Maybe talking about it to your husband, who you say in your original letter is very supportive; or checking in with a trusted friend? If you can find ways to dissipate your angst, that will go some way to helping you to deal with your son in a more relaxed way; it will also help you eventually see your son\u2019s behaviour as the separate entity it is.

      "body": "<p>As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all UK fertility clinics were required to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/thousands-lose-last-hope-of-having-a-baby-as-lockdown-closes-ivf-clinics\">close their doors</a> in early April. Fertility specialists had to inform their patients, some of whom had been on waiting lists for up to a year and others who were midway through drug cycles, that their treatments were going to be delayed or paused for an indefinite period of time. Shirin Khanjani, a consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at University College Hospital, who underwent retraining to be redeployed to the NHS Covid-19 frontline, says these were extremely difficult conversations, and that the news was distressing for many of her patients. She explains: \u201cThey have waited for months, if not years, to have their treatment and this break in proceedings may have had a damaging impact on their emotional and physical wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Although the clinic closures were an understandable part of coronavirus restrictions, and a necessary measure to protect NHS capacity, they left many patients <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/time-precious-ivf-women-fear-lost-chance-to-have-children\">facing uncertain futures</a>. How long would men and women have to wait until they could have a chance to attempt conception? What would be the fate of those patients who found themselves \u201cageing out\u201d and missing their opportunity for much-needed NHS funding for their treatments? And how about those who were told their fertility was already on a steep decline, who now feared their odds of a successful outcome might irrevocably diminish as lockdown progressed into months?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fertility patients will require additional medical, emotional, and psychological care as part of their treatment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A stressful and rollercoaster experience at the best of times, the pandemic has exacerbated fertility patients\u2019 emotional turmoil, by amplifying the already overwhelming feelings of uncertainty, lack of control and isolation that are often associated with infertility and IVF treatment. As Philomena da Silva, a psychologist working in a fertility clinic told me; \u201cThe journey towards parenthood as a fertility patient can be a long, emotionally heightened and precarious experience in itself, and these feelings seemed to increase during the isolation period.\u201d Da Silva has continued to speak to patients over the telephone since lockdown began, and some fertility counsellors have been running online counselling and daily support sessions through Zoom or Facebook. But despite these offerings, for many men and women the unforeseen disruption to their fertility plans has been heartbreaking.</p> <p>As such, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\u2019s (HFEA) recent announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/ivf-clinics-set-to-reopen-across-uk\">clinics could apply to reopen</a> as of 11 May was generally welcomed by both professionals and patients across the fertility industry. In order to reopen for treatment, clinics will be required to meet the <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-professionals/\">revised </a><a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-professionals/\">general </a><a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-professionals/\">direction</a> and to reconfigure their services to ensure the safety of staff and patients, including compliance with government guidance on social distancing. However, the HFEA does not require clinics to reopen, and it is likely that some will take much longer than others to do so. As with much of the guidance around the transition out of lockdown, here too a great deal of confusion reigns and questions remain unanswered.</p> <p>What will the new requirements mean for the numbers of patients who can be treated at any one time, and how might this impact waiting lists? Will all clinics reopen in a matter of weeks or will some choose to take much longer, depending on local conditions and staff shortages? Can patients who were receiving treatments in clinics that remain closed transfer to alternative clinics? As yet, we simply don\u2019t know. Plus, part of the new requirements will be for patients to actively consent to having treatment while there is a risk that they could contract Covid-19 either during the treatment or if successful, during pregnancy, adding yet another layer of potential anxiety.</p> <p>Some patients are, of course, optimistic and eager to resume their treatment plans as soon as possible. Others are feeling worried or cautious, concerned about a huge range of issues, from how to safely negotiate travel to their soon-to-be-open clinic, to balancing newly emerging care responsibilities or remote working arrangements with the taxing demands of a treatment cycle. And then there are those who are facing additional financial burdens, having lost significant income or even their jobs during this pandemic, and who find themselves having to recalculate the considerable expense of fertility treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/coronavirus-mental-health-trauma\">Coronavirus affects mental health too \u2013 here's what we know | Anthony David</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sally (not her real name), who was about to start her third cycle of IVF with her husband just before the clinics closed, says the lockdown has been an \u201cincubator of frustrations\u201d for her. She describes her experience of \u201cstill\u201d being childless at 37 after six years of marriage as a source of loneliness and perceived exclusion. Over the past two months in particular, she says, it has created \u201ca growing chasm\u201d between her and the friends who\u2019ve variously complained about the impossibilities of home schooling young children and relished the creative activities they finally had time to enjoy as a family. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite painful to see all that on social media actually,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone is doing mum challenges and posting photos of their children, and it kind of rubs it in your face.\u201d</p> <p>For Sally, the reopening of clinics is good news; it gives her an opportunity to try to join the parenthood club she so much wants to become a part of. But it won\u2019t be treatment as usual, and she is yet to find out what new measures her clinic has put in place, or whether she might have to wait longer if they can only treat a smaller number of patients each month. There is, of course, also the question of what might happen to newly reopened clinics if there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">second peak</a> or an increase in the R number. One thing seems fairly clear: fertility patients will require additional medical, emotional and psychological care as part of their treatment during this pandemic, and clinics must build robust support systems as part of their reopening strategies.</p> <p>\u2022 Zeynep Gurtin is the lead researcher on a new research project organised by the Institute for Women\u2019s Health at UCL exploring the impact of clinic closures and the coronavirus pandemic on fertility patients\u2019 lives, relationships and feelings. <a href=\"https://ifwh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_036pawRXJspDsMZ\">Click here</a> to learn more about this project or to take part in the anonymous online questionnaire</p> <p><br></p>",

Fertility specialists had to inform their patients, some of whom had been on waiting lists for up to a year and others who were midway through drug cycles, that their treatments were going to be delayed or paused for an indefinite period of time. Shirin Khanjani, a consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at University College Hospital, who underwent retraining to be redeployed to the NHS Covid-19 frontline, says these were extremely difficult conversations, and that the news was distressing for many of her patients. She explains: \u201cThey have waited for months, if not years, to have their treatment and this break in proceedings may have had a damaging impact on their emotional and physical wellbeing.\u201d Although the clinic closures were an understandable part of coronavirus restrictions, and a necessary measure to protect NHS capacity, they left many patients facing uncertain futures. How long would men and women have to wait until they could have a chance to attempt conception? What would be the fate of those patients who found themselves \u201cageing out\u201d and missing their opportunity for much-needed NHS funding for their treatments? And how about those who were told their fertility was already on a steep decline, who now feared their odds of a successful outcome might irrevocably diminish as lockdown progressed into months? A stressful and rollercoaster experience at the best of times, the pandemic has exacerbated fertility patients\u2019 emotional turmoil, by amplifying the already overwhelming feelings of uncertainty, lack of control and isolation that are often associated with infertility and IVF treatment. As Philomena da Silva, a psychologist working in a fertility clinic told me; \u201cThe journey towards parenthood as a fertility patient can be a long, emotionally heightened and precarious experience in itself, and these feelings seemed to increase during the isolation period.\u201d Da Silva has continued to speak to patients over the telephone since lockdown began, and some fertility counsellors have been running online counselling and daily support sessions through Zoom or Facebook. But despite these offerings, for many men and women the unforeseen disruption to their fertility plans has been heartbreaking. As such, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\u2019s (HFEA) recent announcement that clinics could apply to reopen as of 11 May was generally welcomed by both professionals and patients across the fertility industry. In order to reopen for treatment, clinics will be required to meet the revised general direction and to reconfigure their services to ensure the safety of staff and patients, including compliance with government guidance on social distancing. However, the HFEA does not require clinics to reopen, and it is likely that some will take much longer than others to do so. As with much of the guidance around the transition out of lockdown, here too a great deal of confusion reigns and questions remain unanswered. What will the new requirements mean for the numbers of patients who can be treated at any one time, and how might this impact waiting lists? Will all clinics reopen in a matter of weeks or will some choose to take much longer, depending on local conditions and staff shortages? Can patients who were receiving treatments in clinics that remain closed transfer to alternative clinics? As yet, we simply don\u2019t know. Plus, part of the new requirements will be for patients to actively consent to having treatment while there is a risk that they could contract Covid-19 either during the treatment or if successful, during pregnancy, adding yet another layer of potential anxiety. Some patients are, of course, optimistic and eager to resume their treatment plans as soon as possible. Others are feeling worried or cautious, concerned about a huge range of issues, from how to safely negotiate travel to their soon-to-be-open clinic, to balancing newly emerging care responsibilities or remote working arrangements with the taxing demands of a treatment cycle. And then there are those who are facing additional financial burdens, having lost significant income or even their jobs during this pandemic, and who find themselves having to recalculate the considerable expense of fertility treatment. Sally (not her real name), who was about to start her third cycle of IVF with her husband just before the clinics closed, says the lockdown has been an \u201cincubator of frustrations\u201d for her. She describes her experience of \u201cstill\u201d being childless at 37 after six years of marriage as a source of loneliness and perceived exclusion. Over the past two months in particular, she says, it has created \u201ca growing chasm\u201d between her and the friends who\u2019ve variously complained about the impossibilities of home schooling young children and relished the creative activities they finally had time to enjoy as a family. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite painful to see all that on social media actually,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone is doing mum challenges and posting photos of their children, and it kind of rubs it in your face.\u201d For Sally, the reopening of clinics is good news; it gives her an opportunity to try to join the parenthood club she so much wants to become a part of. But it won\u2019t be treatment as usual, and she is yet to find out what new measures her clinic has put in place, or whether she might have to wait longer if they can only treat a smaller number of patients each month. There is, of course, also the question of what might happen to newly reopened clinics if there is a second peak or an increase in the R number. One thing seems fairly clear: fertility patients will require additional medical, emotional and psychological care as part of their treatment during this pandemic, and clinics must build robust support systems as part of their reopening strategies. \u2022 Zeynep Gurtin is the lead researcher on a new research project organised by the Institute for Women\u2019s Health at UCL exploring the impact of clinic closures and the coronavirus pandemic on fertility patients\u2019 lives, relationships and feelings.

      "bodyText": "School leaders said the government\u2019s publication of scientific advice failed to make a convincing case for the early reopening of schools in England, as the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser said an effective testing and tracking system was necessary for more pupils to return to the classroom. After pressure from teaching unions, the government published 12 documents presented to its Sage committee of scientific advisers looking at the effect of coronavirus on children and how schools could safely reopen to more pupils. But union leaders said they found little in the documents to reassure staff or parents that reopening primary schools in England by Boris Johnson\u2019s stated target of 1 June was a safe decision. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union said the evidence was \u201cinconclusive\u201d, while Geoff Barton, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the government \u201cmust be able to show very clearly that its five tests have been met before it gives the green light to any wider opening from 1 June\u201d. Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said on Friday that Sage had been very clear that an effective \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d mechanism was necessary in the event of schools reopening, and the sooner in place the better in order to make changes to England\u2019s lockdown. Roach said it remained his union\u2019s view that no schools should reopen more widely until it was safe to do so, and that the publication of the Sage documents would only add to the uncertainty. \u201c[Sage] states that large-scale community testing is needed to better understand and monitor the prevalence of and susceptibility to Covid-19 in children, yet the government\u2019s plans for the reopening of schools from 1 June are premature whilst a widespread community testing system will not be in place,\u201d Roach said. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said the Sage papers showed that \u201cthe phased, cautious return of a limited number of pupils to classrooms has been a carefully considered decision based on the best scientific and medical advice\u201d. \u201cMy department continues to engage with the school, college and nursery sectors and I am enormously grateful for all the planning and preparation they are doing, alongside local authorities and academy trusts,\u201d Williamson said. A number of local authorities have said their maintained primary schools will not be ready to reopen, while others \u2013 including Staffordshire county council, which covers Williamson\u2019s own constituency \u2013 have left the decision up to individual schools. The papers revealed that a low-risk scenario where pupils in England would attend school on alternating weeks was presented to the government as the most likely way to gain popular support, before ministers instead settled on their plan for a widespread reopening on 1 June. The government\u2019s plan for reopening schools to entire classes of reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 1 June was not among the nine scenarios modelled for Sage by the Department for Education.

      "bodyText": "A number of NHS and private healthcare staff, from heart surgeons to nurses, porters and volunteers, have lost their lives to the coronavirus in the UK. The government says there have been 49 verified deaths of NHS staff from Covid-19 during the pandemic, but it is clear that many others have died. The Guardian has recorded 198 deaths that have been reported in the news, but the true figure is likely to be higher because not all deaths will be in the public domain. Many family members of those who have died have complained that health professionals are not being given adequate protective equipment as they deal with coronavirus cases. If you would like to share any further names and stories with us, or feel there are people we have missed out, then please email sarah.marsh@theguardian.com. We hope to document and pay tribute to those who have died working on the frontline of the pandemic. We will be adding the cases to a database and hope to examine these deaths in more detail at a later date.

That is also just like her: fancying the rules of nature, or the odds, somehow didn\u2019t apply to her. But they did. It seems somehow unsurprising, then, that she died as she lived: sacrificing herself for others. \u201cThere are some people out there still urging that the virus is not that threatening, or that the government has overreacted, or that it doesn\u2019t matter if a few oldies die,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are mistaken. My mother was 63: too young to die but old enough to die from this; a statistic to others, but the very heart of our family. \u201cWe might have had another 20 years with her; instead, we had to say goodbye via an iPad, unable to hold her hand. Her grandson is not yet three. About 25,000 other families will know what I mean when I say that I hope to God such people never have personal cause to amend their opinions.\u201d Before working in care homes, his mother was a nurse for decades, caring for the sick and vulnerable, including the liver failure intensive treatment unit at King\u2019s College hospital.

Dr Khan has left behind his wife and three children. His son, Mahad Ali Khan, said: \u201cMy dad was a loving, caring and much-loved father, husband, son, brother and friend.

His parents were El Hadj Djeli Fod\u00e9 Kant\u00e9 and singer Fatouma Kamissoko, from one of Guinea\u2019s best-known families of musicians. Age seven, he was sent from Guinea to Bamako, Mali, to learn to play the kora, the instrument that would later make him famous. He also played balafon. In 1971, age 21, he joined the Rail Band, and later replaced Salif Ke\u00efta as the singer. Of his time in the band, he said: \u201cWe were young and careless about not thinking about money. Only perfection, perseverance and success counted.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, Kant\u00e9 moved to Paris. His popularity in France saw him nicknamed \u201cthe electronic griot\u201d. He cycled through different musical styles over the subsequent decades. In the 2000s, he embraced more acoustic music, often in an orchestral setting. For his 2012 album La Guin\u00e9enne, he embraced the golden age of west African music: lyrics in the Guinean Mandinka language accompanied by zouk, funk and reggae.</p> <p>Later in his career, Kant\u00e9 expressed his pride that he was able to construct an entertainment complex in the village of Nongo, near Conakry, featuring a 1,500-seat auditorium, two sophisticated recording studios and leisure facilities. He also gave guest lectures at universities around the world, expanding on his interest in the industrialisation of culture.</p> <p>As a solo artist, he released 13 studio albums. The last, N\u2019Diarabi, was released in 2017. In 2014, he recorded Africa Stop Ebola alongside artists including Amadou &amp; Mariam, Salif Ke\u00efta and Oumou Sangar\u00e9. It sold 250,000 copies, raising money for M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/nov/13/weekend7.weekend1\">Speaking to the Guardian in 2004</a>, he said he would like to be remembered \u201cas a man of culture, as a citizen of the world who delivers his messages in music, and as a tireless traveller looking to meet and know the people of this world\u201d.</p>",

His parents were El Hadj Djeli Fod\u00e9 Kant\u00e9 and singer Fatouma Kamissoko, from one of Guinea\u2019s best-known families of musicians. Age seven, he was sent from Guinea to Bamako, Mali, to learn to play the kora, the instrument that would later make him famous. He also played balafon. In 1971, age 21, he joined the Rail Band, and later replaced Salif Ke\u00efta as the singer. Of his time in the band, he said: \u201cWe were young and careless about not thinking about money. Only perfection, perseverance and success counted.\u201d In the 1980s, Kant\u00e9 moved to Paris. His popularity in France saw him nicknamed \u201cthe electronic griot\u201d. He cycled through different musical styles over the subsequent decades. In the 2000s, he embraced more acoustic music, often in an orchestral setting. For his 2012 album La Guin\u00e9enne, he embraced the golden age of west African music: lyrics in the Guinean Mandinka language accompanied by zouk, funk and reggae. Later in his career, Kant\u00e9 expressed his pride that he was able to construct an entertainment complex in the village of Nongo, near Conakry, featuring a 1,500-seat auditorium, two sophisticated recording studios and leisure facilities. He also gave guest lectures at universities around the world, expanding on his interest in the industrialisation of culture. As a solo artist, he released 13 studio albums. The last, N\u2019Diarabi, was released in 2017. In 2014, he recorded Africa Stop Ebola alongside artists including Amadou &amp; Mariam, Salif Ke\u00efta and Oumou Sangar\u00e9. It sold 250,000 copies, raising money for M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Speaking to the Guardian in 2004, he said he would like to be remembered \u201cas a man of culture, as a citizen of the world who delivers his messages in music, and as a tireless traveller looking to meet and know the people of this world\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, after an edgy day\u2019s trading, Europe\u2019s markets have closed pretty much where they started. Anxiety over US-China tensions weighed on stocks, and kept the oil price down. But some investors are also clinging to hopes that lockdown measures will continue to be eased without a dangerous spike in Covid-19 infections. The City took the record surge in UK borrowing, and the slump in retail sales, largely in its stride. Over the week, the Stoxx 600 index gained 3.7%, which Reuters says is the best performance since 6th-10th April. The FTSE 100 gained 3.3%. Here\u2019s today\u2019s closing prices: Stoxx 600: up 0.02 points or 0.01% at 340.28 UK FTSE 100: down 22 points or 0.37% at 5993 German DAX: up 9.9 points or 0.09% at 11,075 French CAC: up 5.6 points or 0.1% at 4,451 David Madden of CMC Markets says the Footsie underperformed due to geopolitical tensions: The FTSE 100 is underperforming against its Continental counterparts as US-China tensions rise. Beijing are keen to tighten their grip on Hong Kong which is why the Chinese government are set to impose a national security law on the district. Last year there was protests and civil unrest in the territory as the Beijing administration were trying to put Hong Kong further under its influence. The latest development is likely to trigger protests. President Trump effectively sided with Hong Kong last year so he is likely to do the same if the situation escalates, and that might renew US-China trade tensions, which is why equity traders are a little nervous. On the FTSE 100, HSBC and Prudential are the biggest fallers in terms of index points as the companies have large exposure to the Far East. The weakness in the oil market is weighing on BP as well as Royal Dutch Shell. But the standout performer was Marston\u2019s - jumping by over 102% to 66p after securing that brewing tie-up with Carlsberg. On that note, goodnight, and have a lovely Bank Holiday weekend (while staying safe). GW With Britain\u2019s borrowing hitting record levels, the government can at least rely on the Bank of England to mop up hundreds of billions of pounds of bonds. That moves, though the Bank\u2019s QE scheme, is helping to keep borrowing costs at record lows - and limit the need for fresh austerity. My colleague Richard Partington explains: A decade ago, Britain would have been described as living beyond its means. This time around, warnings about maxed-out credit cards will only come from yesterday\u2019s men who favoured austerity. It appears there is now broader acceptance of an argument defeated by the Conservatives a decade ago \u2013 that the budget deficit is more complex than a family\u2019s bank balance. The household metaphor holding sway today is about public borrowing and central heating: it\u2019s supposed to come on when the weather is cold. And right now, despite the late spring sunshine, the economic outlook for Britain is wintery bleak. But well above and beyond the tools a family could call upon to handle a blowout credit card bill, Britain has the advantage of the Bank of England sinking interest rates to the lowest level in its 325-year history, alongside its \u00a3645bn quantitative easing programme \u2013 sucking up government debt to keep borrowing costs low. Small brewers are worried they might lose out once Marston\u2019s teams up with Carlsberg to form a new brewing and distribution operation. Although Marston\u2019s will keep running its pubs independently, could there be pressure to take more beer from the CMBC joint venture, and less from independent beer-makers? James Calder, chief executive of SIBA, which represents small independent brewers in the UK, says: \u201cThis merger is the latest in a series of consolidating measures within the UK beer market. It has the potential to take the Marston\u2019s brand global and brings Carlsberg back into the distribution and porterage business only after a few short years of leaving it. This merger yet again has the potential to impact negatively on small independent brewers by further reducing the access to market they receive.\u201d The City is cheering Marston\u2019s tie-up with Carlsberg. Shares in the UK pub and brewer jumped as much as 87% today to 60p, for the first time since Friday 13th March (at the height of the pandemic sell-off). Over in New York, stocks have dipped at the start of trading as investors worry about rising China tensions, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic. The Dow has dropped by 120 points, or 0.5%. to 24,353. This follows the earlier losses in Europe, after Beijing dropped its growth target and announced a new clampdown on dissent in Hong Kong. Oil markets retreated from 10 week highs by tumbling 5% on Friday morning as renewed trade tensions between the US and China fanned fears for the global economy. The price of Brent crude fell from over $36 a barrel on Thursday to lows of $33.70 late Friday morning, before paring its losses to $35.40 a barrel by early afternoon. Oil prices have climbed since \u2018Black April\u2019 when the glut of oil in the global market left by the impact of the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm the world\u2019s available storage. But fears over a looming global recession were reignited on Friday after the US warned China against imposing new security laws on Hong Kong and said it could have an impact on the favorable US treatment of the territory. Oil analysts at Rystad Energy added that fundamentals of the oil market remain weak, and the threat of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is still weighing on the minds of oil traders. \u201cOil production is still above demand levels and there is a lot of uncertainty about the future of how the Covid-19 pandemic will evolve,\u201d said Paola Rodriguez Masiu of Rystad, adding: \u201cA second wave is not such a remote possibility and a new round of lockdowns could send prices back to much lower levels very quickly, and the market knows it.\u201d More reaction to the Marston\u2019s-Carlsberg brewing merger, from beer blogger Steve Williams: Here\u2019s Ben Lockwood of craft brewer BrewDog: More from John Porter: Newsflash: UK pub chain Marston\u2019s is merging its brewing operations with Carlsberg\u2019s UK arm in a deal worth around \u00a3780m. The two companies have just announced they will form a new \u201cjoint venture\u201d called Carlsberg Marston\u2019s Brewing Company (\u2018CMBC\u2019), combining their brewing and distribution operations. The deal values the Marston\u2019s Brewing Business at up to \u00a3580m and the Carlsberg UK Brewing Business at \u00a3200m. But Marston\u2019s, which has been forced to shut its pubs under the lockdown, is only receiving 40% of CMBC + plus cash of up to \u00a3273m. That will let Marston\u2019s focus on its pub and accommodation business. Shares in Marston\u2019s have surged by almost 30%, up to 42p - on track for their highest close since mid-April (although they started the year at 128p). Here\u2019s some snap reaction from beer writer John Porter: And Dan Coatsworth of Shares Magazine. Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, says it will take many months before we know the full cost of the pandemic. But, today\u2019s public finances give an \u201cinitial taste\u201d of the fiscal hit - with borrowing jumping at a record amount last month, at \u00a362bn. The OBR also points out that April\u2019s deficit is more than the UK intended to borrow in the whole financial year. The watchdog says: Today\u2019s data highlight the fiscal impact of the coronavirus crisis, but will be prone to material future revisions. The headline accrued data rely heavily on forecasts (including our reference scenario assumptions in places). And while cash measures reflect actual payments to and from government, any underlying pattern is clouded by timing effects and non-payment of taxes. It will take many months before the true scale of even the initial shock becomes clear. Public sector net borrowing (PSNB) totalled \u00a362.1 billion in April, \u00a319.6 billion higher than market expectations. This takes the headline deficit to a record monthly level. The sharp rise on last year reflects both much higher spending and a significant deterioration in tax receipts. HMRC cash receipts fell by 42 per cent on a year earlier. VAT accounted for the bulk of the deterioration as the Government\u2019s VAT deferral scheme left VAT receipts negative in April. Income tax, corporation tax and fuel duties also saw sharp falls on a year earlier. Central government spending was up 52 per cent in April, reflecting the assumed impact of the coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS), higher grants to local authorities and higher public services spending, much of which was coronavirus related (including NHS spending). Net debt rose by 17.4 per cent of GDP on a year earlier to 97.7 per cent in April \u2013 a sharper rise than at any point during the financial crisis. This reflects higher borrowing and the impact of Bank of England schemes on cash debt, but also the falls in nominal GDP over the coming months assumed in our reference scenario, which the ONS has used pending outturn data. The good news for the UK is that it won\u2019t struggle to finance its huge deficit. The financial markets haven\u2019t reacted badly to April\u2019s record surge in borrowing, or the possibility that Britain needs to borrow, say, \u00a3300bn this year. UK gilts (government bonds) are trading at record highs. Both two-year and five-year bonds are swapping hands at a yield (or interest rate) of below zero, showing that Britain could effectively borrow for free (as happened this week). Wetherspoons has unveiled its plan to reopen its pubs while keeping customers and staff safe from Covid-19. It include protective screens between tables, and bar staff wearing goggles, in an attempt to comply with physical distancing rules and limit the risk of infection. My colleague Rob Davies explains: The \u00a311m plan will include two staff members per pub, or more in bigger venues, specifically tasked with disinfecting surfaces such as door handles, handrails and card payment machines. Dedicated staff will also monitor the pub to ensure physical distancing is being maintained, while customers will be encouraged to use one of 10 hand sanitiser points in each pub. Astonishingly, the UK government actually paid out more in VAT repayments than it took in through VAT receipts last month. VAT, charged at up to 20% on a range of goods and services, is usually a reliable source of revenue. In April 2019 it brought in \u00a313bn. But last month, VAT cash receipts were minus \u00a30.9 billion. That\u2019s partly due to the shutdown, and partly due to the government\u2019s deferral scheme for Value Added Tax payments, letting firms delay VAT due between 20 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. The ONS estimates that most, but not all, of this deferred VAT will eventually be paid (but it all depends how many firms don\u2019t survive the crisis, and how much damage is done to consumer spending). Carl Emmerson and Isabel Stockton of the Institute of Fiscal Studies have a good explanation: This sharp decline in revenue reflects both the economic slowdown and the VAT deferral scheme. Therefore \u2013 at least in large part \u2013 this represents a policy success: large parts of the economy have, as was intended, shut down to stop the spread of COVID-19, reducing VAT owed. In addition, firms have been able to defer payment on their VAT liabilities until the end of the financial year. To the extent that businesses had short-term liquidity problems, this measure will help support them through the crisis and revenue will come in later in the year. However, some fraction of businesses is likely to face not just a liquidity but a solvency issue and not survive, meaning that some VAT revenues will never be paid. The OBR assumes that 5% of the VAT that is deferred will never be repaid and, on this basis, forecast that the deferral cost will mean that ultimately revenues are depressed by \u00a31.9 billion as a result. European stock markets are still in the red, amid concerns that China is tightening its control of Hong Kong. Here\u2019s the latest: Around 800 jobs have been saved through a rescue deal for the Carluccio\u2019s restaurant chain. But sadly, 1,000 jobs are still being lost. My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: The billionaire Ranjit Singh Boparan has bought the Carluccio\u2019s brand and 31 restaurants in a deal that rescues more than 800 jobs. About 40 further outlets of the ailing chain, which called in administrators in March, will be permanently shut, with the loss of 1,000 jobs. All the Carluccio\u2019s outlets are currently closed and its staff are on furlough. Boparan, 53, has made his fortune in the food business and owns the Giraffe and Ed\u2019s Easy Diner chains as well as Fox\u2019s Biscuits and a vast supermarket chicken empire. Phil Reynolds, a joint administrator of Carluccio\u2019s and a partner at the corporate restructuring firm FRP, said: \u201cThe Covid-19 lockdown has put incredible pressure on businesses across the leisure sector, so it has been important to work as quickly and as decisively as possible in an extremely challenging business environment to secure a sale, which ensures the future of the Carluccio\u2019s brand in the UK casual dining scene.\u201d Billionaire investor-turned-philanthropist George Soros has warned that Covid-19 threatens the survival of the EU. In a new Q&amp;A session sent to reporters today, Soros warns that the economic damage of the pandemic will last longer than people think. His solution -- \u2018perpetual bonds\u2019 to boost the EU budget and and fund relief efforts in hard-hit member states such as Italy and Spain. These perpetual bonds would never mature, but would simply pay a coupon to whoever held them. Soros reckons the EU would only need to offer a 0.5% annual interest payment. That\u2019s the equivalent of raising a whopping \u20ac1trn and only repay \u20ac5bn per year. Forever. Soros says: Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures. Perpetual bonds or consols are such a measure. They should not even be considered in normal times. But if the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts. This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality. The coronavirus and climate change are threatening not only people\u2019s lives but the survival of our civilization. The European Union is particularly vulnerable because it is based on the rule of law and the wheels of justice turn proverbially slowly. By contrast the coronavirus moves very fast and in unpredictable ways. In order to borrow so cheaply, the EU would need to maintain a AAA credit rating. That would mean agreeing taxes to cover the cost of servicing the bonds. A long process, that would be opposed by those who won\u2019t accept collective borrowing. But Soros has a solution: The taxes only have to be authorized; they don\u2019t need to be implemented. Authorization should take a few weeks, not a few years. Once they are authorized the EU could go ahead and issue perpetual bonds or consols. Consols, incidentally, are an old financial instrument -- used by government such as Britain to finance spending. For example, debt issued to fund the First World War. Luxury fashion chain Burberry has also highlighted the slump in retail, reporting that sales fell by over a quarter as the Covid-19 pandemic began. Like-for-like sales slumped by 27% in January-March, Burberry reports, due to around 60% of its retail outlets being closed by the end of March. This compares to +4% for the first 9 months of the year, the chain says. Earnings also took a significant hit, with operating profits dropping to just \u00a3189m, from \u00a3437m. Burberry explains: Reported operating profit declined 57%, predominantly due to the impact of adjusting items relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has also forced Burberry to cancel its final dividend. It is still selling online, but demand for expensive clothes, handbags and accessories will obviously be lower than normal until the pandemic eases. The company has also been doing its bit to help, saying it has: Retooled our factory in Yorkshire to make gowns and sourced surgical masks through our global supply chain. To date donated &gt;150,000 pieces of PPE to NHS and care charities, funded research into a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and donated to charities tackling food poverty in the UK. British households probably won\u2019t return to their old spending patterns until the middle of this decade, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. CEBR economist Sam Miley has warned that the damage caused by the pandemic will linger on, long after lockdown measures have eased. He writes: Any potential lifting of restrictions going into June is likely to facilitate a slight return to retail activity, though the impact of lockdown throughout April and May means the picture for Q2 as a whole is entirely negative. Our forecasts estimate household consumption to fall by 19.5% over the course of the current quarter, before picking up from Q3 onwards. Consumer activity is expected to remain suppressed for much longer than this, however, with lingering fears over the virus, the continued need for social distancing, and wider economic uncertainty all serving to restrict spending. In a stark illustration of the economic impacts of coronavirus, we do not expect household consumption to reach pre-crisis levels until the mid-2020s. With restrictive measures as we currently know them highly unlikely to remain in place for this sort of timescale, this forecast highlights the longer-term effects of the current crisis on consumer spending, showing that the economic consequences will not solely be confined to the lockdown period. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the jump in UK borrowing: The government was forced to borrow a record \u00a362bn to balance its books in April as the public finances felt the strain from a shutdown of the economy that saw high street spending plummet by an unprecedented 18%. Figures from the office for national statistics highlighted the dramatic impact of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced in late March on activity \u2013 with public borrowing up by more than \u00a350bn on the same month a year earlier and spending in clothes stores down by 50%. The ONS said there had been a sharp drop in all the state\u2019s main sources of revenue \u2013 income tax, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax coupled with a marked increase in spending. With the economy at a virtual standstill, the government borrowed as much last month as in the whole of the previous financial year. Britain\u2019s retailers are suffering from one of the most \u201cprofound shifts\u201d in consumer behaviour in a century, says Lynda Petherick, managing director at Accenture. April was always going to be the month when the full force of government lockdown measures would hit retailers. Clothing has continued to suffer, and though there are still some bright spots in grocery, \u201cpanic-buying\u201d and online household goods orders subsided slightly as consumers continued to restrict their shopping trips. Yes \u2013 these are hard times for the sector, however there are lessons to be learned if retailers are to come out the other side of the pandemic ready to respond. Online sales continue to reach new heights, suggesting that consumers have been quick to shift their buying habits \u2013 a trend which is only likely to continue. Retailers will need to act quickly and deliberately to improve their capabilities if they are to drive growth and profitability in an increasingly digital future.\u201d Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, hopes that the worst may be over though, after the 18% slump in April: However bad April\u2019s figures are, we believe that retail has reached a turning point in the Covid-19 crisis. In the short term, May has already seen a loosening of lockdown restrictions across all the home nations. Indeed, enterprising operators have begun to reopen cautiously, from garden centres to some furniture stores coming back for the bank holiday weekend. Economist Rupert Seggins has shown the unprecedented scale of the drop in April: As rumoured, the UK government has extended its mortgage payment holiday scheme by three months. It\u2019s also extended the ban on home repossessions until the end of October, in an attempt to prevent the pandemic leading to rising homelessness. My colleague Mark Sweney explains: More than 1.8 million homeowners have taken a three-month mortgage holiday since the scheme was announced in March to help borrowers in financial difficulty because of the coronavirus crisis, according to Treasury figures. It was due to expire at the end of June. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to help people with their finances at this difficult time and that includes making sure people get the support they need with their mortgages,\u201d said John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working with the banks and lenders to extend payment holidays if people need them.\u201d Over in the City, shares are dropping as investors worry about the economic impact of Covid-19. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK-listed shares dropped by 110 points, or 1.8%, in early trading to 5903. That wipes out most of this week\u2019s gains. Nearly every share is down, led by financial services firms like Prudential (-9%), HSBC (-5.8%) and Standard Chartered (-4%). The slump in retail sales, and the spike in borrowing, are a reminder of the economic cost of the pandemic. Recent hints from the Bank of England that it could impose negative interest rates in the UK are weighing on bank stocks too. Shares are also down in Germany and France. Traders are worried that China has dropped its annual GDP target today - clearly growth this year is simply too bad [Beijing has an remarkable track record of achieving these targets...] But there\u2019s another reason for the sell-off: China\u2019s ruling Communist Party has proposed a controversial national security law for Hong Kong to ban \u201ctreason, secession, sedition and subversion\u201d. The proposal, which could bypass Hong Kong\u2019s lawmakers, would also allow the central government to set up \u201csecurity organs\u201d in the territory. It\u2019s likely to inflame tensions with pro-democracy supporters in the city state, and with the White House too, as Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients: This will likely draw a large amount of opposition given the pro-democracy protests in the country over the past year. This could be another wedge between China and the US, given how many US politicians on both sides of the aisle supported HK\u2019s efforts last year. You can read today\u2019s data yourself, here: Public sector finances, UK: April 2020 Retail sales, Great Britain: April 2020 Online spending surged last month, as the lockdown encouraged more Britons to order groceries, wine, household goods and other items online. The ONS reports that 30.7% of retail spending took place online in April, up from 19.1% a year earlier. Simon French of Panmure Gordon has tweeted more details: Over 14% of UK shops reported no turnover at all in April, due to the Covid-19 shutdown. That includes 27% of clothing and footwear outlets (where takings halved last month!), and almost 40% of department stores. This morning\u2019s retail sales report also shows that sales at supermarkets dropped slightly compared with March. But alcohol and tobacco outlets posted rising sales, defying the 18% plunge across the industry. Here\u2019s the full details: Paul Dales of Capital Economics predicts Britain\u2019s deficit could hit 17% of GDP this year. That\u2019s an immense figure -- exceeding the last financial crisis, when the deficit hit 10% of annual output. Dales explains: With little prospect of a swift return this year towards pre-crisis levels of economic activity, we expect borrowing to total \u00a3340bn (17.5% of GDP) over 2020/21, which would be over \u00a340bn more than the OBR\u2019s forecast. Overall, the small easing of the lockdown on 13th May probably means that retail sales started to edge higher in May and that the government might not have had to borrow quite as much as in April. But it\u2019s very clear that the retail activity will remain worrying weak for some time yet and that the government will have to borrow a few hundred billion pounds this year. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at financial services group Equals, says we should welcome the jump in borrowing - the alternative is worse. The UK\u2019s budget deficit is at the highest level since records began in 1993. This is a good thing; if your house is on fire, you don\u2019t ask the Fire Brigade to only use a certain amount of water. The water will need to keep flowing and the deficit will continue to grow because the alternative \u2013 a deeply scarred economy - is far worse.\u201d Howard Archer of EY Item Club points out that falling tax receipts also hit the public finances: Central government receipts fell 26.5% year-on-year in April, as they were impacted by a combination of sharply contracting economic activity, markedly rising unemployment and weaker earnings, and companies being allowed to delay tax payments. \u201cIncome and capital gains tax receipts were down 36.0% year-on-year in April, as jobs were lost and pay hit. There was also a fall of 14.1% in corporation tax receipts while VAT receipts were down 43.6% year-on-year. Here\u2019s some snap reaction to the surge in UK government borrowing to \u00a362bn last month. The BBC\u2019s Dharshini David points out that Britain just borrowed more in April than it had expected to borrow in the whole financial year, before the pandemic struck: Her colleague Kamal Ahmed has some historical context, for those who can\u2019t remember 1993 (my main memory is of a young Shane Warne....) Torsten Bell of Resolution Foundation says government borrowing is going to rocket this year, to protect us from even more economic harm: John Hawksworth of PwC predicts the UK could borrow as much as \u00a3300bn in the current financial year -- six times as much as previously planned. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We start with some breaking news -- UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993. Indeed, it\u2019s almost as much as the UK borrowed in the whole of the last financial year: This is an early sign of the massive cost of the government\u2019s attempts to limit the damage of the Covid-19 crisis, including its jobs guarantee scheme. It\u2019s also due to a sharp drop in tax takings. But the ONS also cautions that \u201cthe effects of COVID-19 are not fully captured in this release\u201d. The ONS has also reported that retail sales across the UK slumped at an unprecedented rate in April. Sales fell by over 18% compared with March, due to the widespread shutdown of non-essential shop, taking turnover down to its lowest level since 2005. The ONS explains: The volume of retail sales in April 2020 fell by a record 18.1%, following the strong monthly fall of 5.2% in March 2020. All sectors saw a monthly decline in volume sales except for a record increase in sales for non-store retailing at 18.0% and a continued increase in sales for alcohol stores at 2.3%. The volume of clothing sales in April 2020 plummeted by 50.2% when compared with March 2020, which had already fallen by 34.9% on the previous month. This comes as fears over the UK hospitality industry grow, with many pubs, bars and restaurants warning they will close some outlets permanently. Stock markets are also under pressure, after China abandoned its long-held practice of setting a GDP target - presumably because growth has been so badly hit by the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "The government has unveiled a major shift in border policy to be introduced next month in a bid to prevent a second wave of Covid-19 in the UK. What has been announced? All arrivals into the UK, apart from a short list of exemptions, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days from 8 June. How will it work? All arriving passengers will be required to fill in a contact locator form with contact and travel information so they can be reached if they, or someone they may have been in contact with, develops the disease. Is it being enforced? Yes. Anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action. A breach of self-isolation would be punishable with a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution and unlimited fine. The level of fine could increase if the risk of infection from abroad increases. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will set out their own enforcement approaches. Border Force will undertake checks at the border and may refuse entry to any non-British citizen who refuses to comply with the regulations and is not resident in the UK. Failure to complete the contact locator form will be punishable by a \u00a3100 fixed penalty notice. Public health authorities will conduct random checks in England to ensure compliance with self-isolation requirements. Removal from the country would be considered as a last resort for foreign nationals who refuse to comply. Why is this happening now? The Home Office says that as the transmission rate in the UK falls and the number of travellers arriving increases, imported cases may pose a larger threat as they could become a higher proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK and increase the spread of the disease. Air passenger arrivals into the UK have plunged 99% during the lockdown period, although at least 95,000 people arrived in April alone. Why didn\u2019t it happen before? The Home Office chief scientific adviser, Prof John Aston, says that while there has been significant community transmission of the virus within the UK, the impact of putting in place additional border restrictions would have been negligible to the spread of the virus. However, the government has faced criticism for not enforcing stricter measures in the first three months of the year when the pandemic began. In late February and early March the policy was to advise all arrivals from a shortlist of global regions, including Wuhan in China, to self-isolate, but this was withdrawn on 13 March.

There will be limited exemptions and a full list will be published on Gov.uk. The Home Office has already confirmed the following will be exempt: Road haulage and freight workers, to ensure the supply of goods is not impacted. Medical professionals who are travelling to help with the fight against coronavirus. Anyone moving from within the common travel area, covering Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Seasonal agricultural workers who will self-isolate on the property where they are working. How long will it last? The government is going to review the measures every three weeks. Looking further ahead, it has said it will look at more options including air bridges \u2013 agreements between countries who both have low transmission rates to recognise their respective screening measures for departing passengers and removing the need for quarantine measures for incoming passengers.",

Cancer Research UK estimates the impact of coronavirus to be a 20-25% drop in its fundraising income \u2013 a shortfall of \u00a3120m. It is planning a phased reopening of its shops in England from 29 June \u2013 subject to government guidance. Jo Mewett, head of retail for Cancer Research UK said: \u201cWe\u2019re planning significant safety measures and putting new processes in place for receiving and handling donations. These include installing hand sanitiser stations, cough guards, contactless payment and face coverings for staff, as well as floor markings inside our larger superstores. Donated items will have a quarantine period before they are sorted to be sold in stores.\u201d The plan is similar at the British Heart Foundation, which has 750 UK stores as well as an online operation, and has lost around \u00a310m a month as a result of the lockdown. Oxfam \u2013 which is particularly under pressure \u2013 is also urging members of the public to hold on to items and donate them when its 650 shops and donation banks are open again. Last year its shops raised \u00a31.4m a month and the organisation has reopened its online secondhand shop this week. The blueprint from the CRA for its 400 members \u2013 which run an estimated 9,000 shops \u2013 aims to help them adhere to the physical distancing measures required by the government. Like most retail outlets, hand sanitiser, perspex screens in front of tills, limits on the number of shoppers, and contactless payment are likely to become standard measures. Robin Osterley, chief executive of the CRA, said: \u201cOur members are being, rightly, cautious, but they are an amazingly creative bunch and there has been a lot of very impressive forward planning.\u201d A national campaign being launched by the CRA and its members on social media from 8 June will encourage consumers to \u201cbe mindful\u201d about what they donate, and urge them to contact a store to check it is open before dropping off donations.",

With the Met Office forecasting that temperatures in some parts of Britain could rise to more than 26C on Monday, the AA suggested the government should have considered not easing the lockdown until afterwards. Councils and some of those involved in tourism also called on the public to avoid swamping coastal resorts this Monday while the pandemic continues. Edmund King, the AA\u2019s president, said: \u201cWhilst understanding the frustrations of the police and locals, it is obviously difficult for individuals to know how busy an area would be until they get there. In order to take pressure off picturesque coastal and rural areas it would be helpful to clarify the rules rather than condemn the drivers. \u201cPerhaps the government should have delayed easing leisure trips until after the bank holiday to avoid this situation, but drivers should also think about how far they need to travel to enjoy the great outdoors safely. Many facilities, such as shops and public toilets, will not be open at traditional holiday hotspots.\u201d King said drivers should plan their journeys in advance this weekend and \u201cif it is busy, hotspots should be avoided\u201d. One hotspot is expected to be Brighton, where the city council advised would-be visitors from outside the area not to travel there this weekend. Stewards were deployed on Friday to restrict access to Brighton beach from East Street to West Street. The council said the stewards would be in place from noon to 9pm up to and including bank holiday Monday \u201cto encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if the area becomes too busy\u201d. The council added: \u201cWe are used to catering for up to 11 million visitors each year and are renowned for the warm welcome we usually give to all our valued visitors. \u201cWe are so proud of the city we share but to promote Brighton and Hove as a place to visit at this time would be utterly irresponsible and an insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers who have protected the whole county throughout this devastating crisis.\u201d Not everyone on Brighton beach agrees with the continued lockdown of most businesses. Luke Johnson, the chairman of the Brighton Pier Group PLC, said 900 of its staff were desperate to return to their jobs. \u201cWe would love to reopen this weekend but we can\u2019t, we are trapped. But in the longer term, with millions of Brits unable or unwilling to travel abroad this summer staycation could be the salvation of this city. Brighton will have to get to a situation where we are encouraging instead of dissuading people to come to visit us,\u201d Johnson said. Blackpool has already experienced an increase in visitors to attractions such as Stanley Park, the resort\u2019s 26-acre green space. Elaine Smith, the chairman of Friends of Stanley Park, said it was too early for the Lancashire resort to absorb a mass influx of tourists. \u201cWe should pray for rain not just to keep the numbers down but also because we\u2019ve just spent \u00a34,000 on our rose garden and at this stage we really would need some rain for them too,\u201d she said.",

Epidemic is now flat or declining, says top UK adviser The UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, says the country\u2019s R number, which measures the number of people to whom each infected person passes the virus, is between 0.7 and 1 and that the epidemic is \u201ceither flat or declining in the UK and in most areas it is declining\u201d. African Union counts 100,000 cases According to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control, the 54 countries in Africa have collectively identified more than 100,000 cases of infection. According to the interactive dashboard hosted on the African Union health agency\u2019s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent. Unlike other regions, particularly Europe, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa. After the first confirmed case was reported in mid-February in Egypt, many countries responded with strict lockdowns. Germany\u2019s tax revenues fall by a quarter in April German tax revenues for April fall by a quarter compared to the same month last year. According to the finance ministry\u2019s monthly report, the central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about \u20ac39bn (\u00a334.87bn). The revenue decline is most severe for income, corporate and air traffic taxes, the report shows. Madrid and Barcelona to ease lockdowns The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area will be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday, the Spanish government says. The two regions have been the areas hardest hit by Covid-19, which has killed at least 27,940 people in the country, while at least 233,037 have become infected. Exit festival given new date in August One of Europe\u2019s biggest music events, Exit festival in Serbia, is rescheduled for August. Originally meant to take place in mid-July in the northern city of Novi Sad, the fate of the festival was uncertain. But, as Serbia emerges from its lockdown without a major outbreak, its prime minister, Ana Brnabi\u0107, recommends the event can take place after all.",

The French interior ministry expressed its \u201cregret\u201d that it would not be exempt from the quarantine plan, after assurances this month that the country would be.</p> \n<p>Anyone failing to comply could face a fine of \u00a31,000. Patel said: \u201cI fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures. But we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others.\u201d</p> \n<p>Patel defended the stringent new measures at the Downing Street press conference on Friday. \u201cWe are not closing our borders, and I think people should recognise that,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>But business groups have reacted furiously, saying ministers should instead have taken a more targeted approach \u2013 and sought international agreements that could have allowed some restrictions to be waived.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/uk-quarantine-plan-what-will-it-mean-for-travellers\">UK quarantine plan: what will it mean for travellers?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A spokesperson for Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, said: \u201cProtecting public health is a priority and it\u2019s vital to base decisions about travel on the best health and scientific advice. No one should be in any doubt, however, that a 14-day quarantine period for all travellers returning to the UK will unavoidably put many people off travelling abroad or visiting the UK, and will therefore have a hugely damaging impact on the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries \u2013 which support hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country and have already been severely affected by the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical that the government regularly reviews this policy \u2013 including assessing its effectiveness and how it works with other control measures. We\u2019d also continue to urge the government to keep any measures proportionate, targeted and limited only to what is necessary and to seek a coordinated approach with destinations in the EU and beyond.\u201d</p> \n<p>The stringent new quarantine system will be reviewed every three weeks. The government confirmed there will be exemptions for freight drivers; doctors and scientists working on the pandemic; and fruit pickers, who will be expected to confine themselves to the farms where they work. Visitors from Ireland will also be exempt.</p> \n<p>Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: \u201cIndustry will be disappointed with this measure which is isolationist and will prevent many essential daily cross-border journeys to provide service and maintenance. Additionally air freight on passenger aircraft provides a significant proportion of UK export and supply chain capacity, all of which is vital to operations as companies begin to get up and running.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adam Tyndall, programme director of the business lobbying group London First, said: \u201cDeciding to quarantine all passengers arriving into the UK is an indiscriminate response to an increasingly nuanced situation. Two weeks in isolation will put off most travellers, all of whom would have contributed to the UK\u2019s economic recovery.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe UK is a world leader in aviation and should be forging international agreements between low-risk countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: \u201cThe imposition of a quarantine period will inevitably damage international visitor travel, and the longer it is in place, the more damage it will wreak.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has not ruled out negotiating \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 an idea championed by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. The UK would seek to strike bilateral agreements with countries with low incidence of Covid-19 under which quarantine restrictions could be waived. \u201cFrance is ready to put in place a reciprocal scheme once the system comes into force on the British side,\u201d the French interior ministry said in a statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3961eae2b9e1f8d4723cc4d051ec7f2e73fe72f8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3961eae2b9e1f8d4723cc4d051ec7f2e73fe72f8/368_85_1028_617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priti Patel announced details of the new quarantine measures on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priti Patel announced details of the new quarantine measures on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Patel made clear such plans were not imminent. \u201cI think we should be absolutely open to all ideas.

      "bodyText": "Business groups have accused the government of pursuing an \u201cisolationist\u201d policy after the home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed that arrivals in the UK will have to quarantine themselves for a fortnight or face a \u00a31,000 fine. From 8 June, almost everyone arriving at ports and airports, including UK citizens, will be required to travel directly to an address they provide to the authorities, where they must then self-isolate for a fortnight. The French interior ministry expressed its \u201cregret\u201d that it would not be exempt from the quarantine plan, after assurances this month that the country would be. Anyone failing to comply could face a fine of \u00a31,000. Patel said: \u201cI fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures. But we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others.\u201d Patel defended the stringent new measures at the Downing Street press conference on Friday. \u201cWe are not closing our borders, and I think people should recognise that,\u201d she said. But business groups have reacted furiously, saying ministers should instead have taken a more targeted approach \u2013 and sought international agreements that could have allowed some restrictions to be waived. A spokesperson for Abta, which represents travel agents and tour operators, said: \u201cProtecting public health is a priority and it\u2019s vital to base decisions about travel on the best health and scientific advice. No one should be in any doubt, however, that a 14-day quarantine period for all travellers returning to the UK will unavoidably put many people off travelling abroad or visiting the UK, and will therefore have a hugely damaging impact on the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries \u2013 which support hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country and have already been severely affected by the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical that the government regularly reviews this policy \u2013 including assessing its effectiveness and how it works with other control measures. We\u2019d also continue to urge the government to keep any measures proportionate, targeted and limited only to what is necessary and to seek a coordinated approach with destinations in the EU and beyond.\u201d The stringent new quarantine system will be reviewed every three weeks. The government confirmed there will be exemptions for freight drivers; doctors and scientists working on the pandemic; and fruit pickers, who will be expected to confine themselves to the farms where they work. Visitors from Ireland will also be exempt. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: \u201cIndustry will be disappointed with this measure which is isolationist and will prevent many essential daily cross-border journeys to provide service and maintenance. Additionally air freight on passenger aircraft provides a significant proportion of UK export and supply chain capacity, all of which is vital to operations as companies begin to get up and running.\u201d Adam Tyndall, programme director of the business lobbying group London First, said: \u201cDeciding to quarantine all passengers arriving into the UK is an indiscriminate response to an increasingly nuanced situation. Two weeks in isolation will put off most travellers, all of whom would have contributed to the UK\u2019s economic recovery. \u201cThe UK is a world leader in aviation and should be forging international agreements between low-risk countries.\u201d Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: \u201cThe imposition of a quarantine period will inevitably damage international visitor travel, and the longer it is in place, the more damage it will wreak.\u201d The government has not ruled out negotiating \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 an idea championed by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. The UK would seek to strike bilateral agreements with countries with low incidence of Covid-19 under which quarantine restrictions could be waived. \u201cFrance is ready to put in place a reciprocal scheme once the system comes into force on the British side,\u201d the French interior ministry said in a statement. But Patel made clear such plans were not imminent. \u201cI think we should be absolutely open to all ideas. This is not for today, but this doesn\u2019t mean we should rule this out in the future. We will look at all options,\u201d she said. Authorities will carry out spot checks to ensure the new rules are being complied with \u2013 using details supplied by travellers on a dedicated form. Failure to provide one will result in a \u00a3100 fine. New arrivals will also be encouraged to download the contact tracing app, once it is available. The regime will be in place across the UK, though the devolved administrations are expected to publish details of how they will implement it. The move rekindled the debate about why ministers did not restrict travel from areas affected by coronavirus much earlier in the outbreak. Papers published by the Sage group of scientific experts on Friday showed that its modelling group SPI-M-O suggested on 3 February that restricting travel from badly hit areas, including China, could delay the onset of the disease in the UK by up to a fortnight. \u201cBased on current information on doubling times from China, the average delay expected to result from a 90% reduction of travel from China may be up to two weeks,\u201d the experts said at the time. They cautioned that preventing direct arrivals from China alone would have had a smaller impact, because of the risk of infected people coming via third countries. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the measures were \u201clong overdue\u201d. But she said they were not a long-term solution. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking people voluntarily to self-isolate for two weeks when they don\u2019t have any symptoms and there\u2019s pressure to go to work or they lose their jobs \u2013 it\u2019s hard for people to know what to do.\u201d She suggested that once the government\u2019s track and trace system is in place, the restrictions could potentially be loosened \u201cIf they have got a world-beating test, track and trace system up and running they can test people when they get off and then at that stage you could see a scenario at which point quarantine measures become redundant,\u201d she said. Government messaging over the quarantine had been frustrating, Nandy said, with seven occasions in which announcements relating to the policy had been made by a minister or briefed to newspapers and then dropped or rowed back from within the last month. She said the fact that the government had applied quarantine measures to only a handful of flights earlier in the crisis was \u201ccompletely incoherent and inconsistent\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The owner of coach holiday operator Shearings has collapsed into administration, with 2,460 immediate job losses and thousands of holiday cancellations. Specialist Leisure Group (SLG), which also owns brands including UKBreakaways.com, Wallace Arnold Travel, and hotel chains Bay Hotels, Coast &amp; Country and Country Living, said all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks in the UK and abroad have been cancelled and would not be rescheduled. The company stopped taking bookings on Thursday. Insolvency specialists from accountancy firm EY have been appointed as administrator to SLG after efforts to find a buyer for the company\u2019s 44 hotels and travel brands failed. EY said that \u201cthe vast majority of customers\u201d were expected to have financial protection through insurance schemes such as Atol or the Bonded Coach Holidays Scheme, or through their credit or debit card issuers. The administrators said they will try to contact any customers with cancelled bookings, with refund claims able to be submitted for another six months. The Wigan-based company focused on tours, events and river cruises for the over 50s. More than 2,200 SLG staff had been furloughed as the company tried to cope with all of its bookings being cancelled during the coronavirus lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak this month extended the furlough scheme, under which the government pays 80% of workers\u2019 wages, until October, but travel companies have moved to make redundancies, given the likelihood of a slow recovery for tourism as travel restrictions drag on. Lost revenue is unlikely to be recouped by customers taking extra holidays at a later date. Other travel companies have already drafted plans for thousands of redundancies, including a succession of airlines such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Ryanair. Tour operator Tui cut 8,000 jobs, citing \u201cunquestionably the greatest crisis the industry and Tui has ever faced\u201d. Hays Travel, which rescued 555 Thomas Cook shops from administration last year, has put essential staff on half pay while others had their hours cut, including 880 who went on to zero-hours contracts. PwC had been working with SLG and shareholder Lone Star, a private equity investor, to find a buyer. Sam Woodward, one of the administrators from EY, said: \u201cThe group has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic as all tours, trips and events have been cancelled and the hotels closed to the public, leading to a significant cash shortfall. \u201cThe directors of the group have been in discussions with a number of parties, seeking a going concern buyer for the business.

But, he said: \u201cFundamentally mutations, especially here, are nothing to worry about ... it is just some kind of minor typo [in the genome] that are either neutral or actually often not favourable to the virus.\u201d<br><br><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v1\">The study</a>, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by a team of researchers in the UK and France, who scrutinised more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes collected from patients around the world since the outbreak began. <br><br>Across all the genomes they uncovered 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, but none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Further analysis revealed 273 of the mutations cropped up repeatedly \u2013 with the team focusing on the 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cThere is no such thing as a European strain, an American strain, an Icelandic strain- there has been a lot of mixing from the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d said Balloux. <br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a mutation that happened once over the pandemic, then that is most unlikely to be something beneficial [to the virus].\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">They then looked at whether these mutations made the virus more transmissible. \u201cWe just work out whether the ones that carry a mutation, whether they have more descendants, whether they are actually spreading faster [than closely related genomes without the mutation] \u2013 and the answer is no,\u201d said Balloux, adding the mutations could be introduced by enzymes involved in the body\u2019s immune system. In fact, the team says, some of the mutations studied seem to be actually harmful to the virus.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Balloux added that while there is not enough data as yet to explore whether mutations may make the virus more deadly or cause more severe symptoms, he said it is unlikely.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cViruses don\u2019t benefit from killing their hosts.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil the plans at the daily Downing Street briefing later. The measures, which will be introduced next month, will be reviewed every three weeks, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said. Tony Smith, a former head of Border Force, said he was surprised quarantine measures had not been brought in sooner.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Paul Nurse: \u2018We are desperate for clear leadership\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot, increasingly playing catchup\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care home boss calls for repeat testing</strong></p> \n  <p>Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. There was a real reluctance to test staff. They were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Government borrowing hits record \u00a362bn in April</strong></p> \n  <p>UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993.</p> \n  <p><strong>Independent Sage warns against school reopening plan</strong></p> \n  <p>The Independent Sage committee has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The group, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June.</p> \n  <p><strong>New spitting incident at a London station</strong></p> \n  <p>Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. He became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police were called and spit samples were taken from the female customer\u2019s face and arm. The incident follows the death of ticket office worker Belly Mujinga from coronavirus following an incident at London Victoria station.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T11:23:42.775Z\">at 12.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec7a7548f0864e579f15b59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T10:20:41.744Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello everyone.

Delaying until September reduced the risk still further.</p> \n  <p>The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so that new cases are found and isolated fast. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Professor King said. </p> \n  <p>In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a \u201cvital\u201d part of the decision-making process.</p> \n  <p>The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes.</p> \n  <p>King said the decision of when to re-open schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Professor King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. </p> \n  <p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly.

You can follow the Guardian\u2019s global coverage here I will be closing today\u2019s blog shortly, so below is a summary of today\u2019s main updates: \u2022 Sir Patrick Vallance said that the R number was between 0.7 and 1. He said that the epidemic was \u201ceither flat or declining in the UK and in most areas it is declining\u201d. \u2022 Two-week quarantines will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June, with fines for anyone who breaches the measure to prevent new waves of coronavirus from overseas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announced that mandatory self-isolation would not apply to people coming from Ireland, medics tackling Covid-19 and seasonal agricultural workers. \u2022 Wales has recorded 138 new cases and seven new deaths. The total number of cases in Wales is 72,984 and the total number of deaths 1,254. \u2022 The UK death toll rises by 351 to 36,393. Figures from the DHSC show there were 140,497 tests on 21 May. As of 5pm on 21 May, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,393 have died. \u2022 Downing Street did not rule out London emerging from the lockdown sooner than other parts of the country. \u2022 A total of 2,245 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 24 from 2,221 on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon said. \u2022 Acting earlier to tackle the coronavirus pandemic would have \u201cmade quite a big difference\u201d to the death rate, according to one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers. Sir Ian Boyd, a member of the Sage scientific advisory group, told the BBC that the number 1 issue was whether ministers could have acted earlier. Airline employees who have lost their jobs could become nurses and other healthcare professionals, a leading NHS expert has said. The chief executive of NHS England and NHS Improvement, Sir Simon Stevens, said he could foresee employees from struggling industries such as aviation training to become much-needed frontline healthcare workers. There are about 40,000 vacancies for NHS nurses, according to the latest report available. Speaking to a virtual Public Accounts Committee, Stevens and NHS England\u2019s medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said volunteers, medical students and about 18,900 retired professionals had plugged the nursing deficit amid increased demand recently, but this was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. Police had not been keen to be involved in the quarantine plans. The government confirmed it would have a limited role and would not be carrying out spot checks. While public health authorities will conduct random checks in England to verify self-isolation, police will only be involved if it is suspected a recent traveller is not complying and may face potential enforcement action. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said public officials would carry out checks on 20% of recent arrivals who are not exempted. He said: \u201cIt will not be the role of police to conduct spot checks on those who should be isolating. Only if public health authorities suspect someone is not following the restrictions will police become involved.\u201d Scientists are becoming \u201cmuch more positive\u201d that those who have had coronavirus develop antibodies afterwards, Sir Patrick Vallance said, although how effective they are remains unknown. \u201cWe are much more positive that people who get infections do mount an antibody response \u2013 I think that\u2019s really quite clear now,\u201d said the chief scientific adviser. \u201cThe vast majority of people do get an antibody response and we know that some of those antibody responses at least \u2013 and maybe all of them but we don\u2019t know that for sure, but certainly some of them \u2013 are so-called neutralising antibodies \u2013 in other words, you would expect that to have an effect in terms of viral infection and transmission. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is how long that lasts for and we don\u2019t know how effective that is, in terms of either preventing transmission or preventing infection. \u201cSo there is still work to be done \u2013 and that isn\u2019t just in the UK, this is globally \u2013 to understand the significance of a positive antibody test. \u201cIt is likely that it confers some degree of protection but we just don\u2019t know, and we don\u2019t know whether it confers your, if you like, your immunity against being able to harbour the virus and transmit it.\u201d A big UK trade organisation says quarantining travellers will hold back the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of ADS \u2013 which represents the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, with more than 1,100 member businesses \u2013 said: Quarantining travellers will hold back the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Key workers across our sectors must be provided with a route to secure exemptions and allow travel essential to our economic recovery. The 14-day quarantine should be a time-limited measure that can be removed as soon as the evidence supports doing so, and an international approach should be taken to resuming flights as quickly as possible. While the quarantine is operating, air bridges that allow controlled removal of the measure on selected routes have the potential to limit unnecessary disruption and I urge the government to implement the process as quickly as possible. I am now moving into my last hour on the blog. I hope everyone found the briefing clear, if you have any questions please do feel free to get in touch. We, as ever, also welcome any news tips from our readers. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The press briefing has now ended, here is a summary of the main points: Two-week quarantines will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June, with fines for anyone who breaches the measure to prevent new waves of coronavirus from overseas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announces that mandatory self-isolation will not apply to people coming from Ireland, medics tackling Covid-19 and seasonal agricultural workers. Breaches would be punishable with a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England, or prosecution with an unlimited fine, while devolved nations can set out their own enforcement approaches. Border Force will be able to refuse entry to foreign citizens who are not UK residents during border checks, while removal from the country could be used as a last resort. The chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said reopening schools was likely to push the R rate up. He said: \u201cThe broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you introduce any contact, you put pressure on the R and you put pressure on numbers, and that\u2019s true of anything we are going to do in terms of changes to contact.\u201d Patel said ministers would work to \u201cfind new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way\u201d. She told the daily Downing Street press conference: \u201cWe also recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel sector, and leisure sectors, who are already struggling through these unprecedented times.\u201d Asked if it was inevitable that people would travel to beauty spots across the UK following an easing of measures, Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow the advice. She said: \u201cIt is inevitable that obviously the public will be out and about a lot more, but of course our message is clear to the public - yes, enjoy being outdoors, we have encouraged people to go out, but we have put a very clear caveat around that.\u201d Priti Patel said the move to start quarantining visitors from next month did not equate to Britain shutting its borders. She said: These measures will be kept under review and I really do want to emphasise that. We are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders. People need to recognise that. What we are seeking to do is control the spread of the virus because we do not want a second wave of this virus. The chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said reopening schools was likely to push the R rate up. He said: \u201cThe risk for children [from coronavirus] is much lower \u2013 we know that. \u201cThey are at low risk but not zero risk and there have been some serious cases of children, of course, but very few compared to adults and older age groups. \u201cThe broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you introduce any contact, you put pressure on the R and you put pressure on numbers, and that\u2019s true of anything we are going to do in terms of changes to contact.\u201d As there have been automatic visa extensions for NHS and frontline health workers during coronavirus, will the same happen for care workers? Patel said: \u201cThe work we are seeing across the NHS is incredible. I have made the point as well that this is difficult in terms of the complexities around immigration. Across the system we are supporting frontline health and social care workers, and finding ways to support other care workers as well across the NHS. The immigration system is complex and we are looking at schemes, we keep everything under review.\u201d Asked about the prospect of introducing a so-called \u201cair bridges\u201d scheme, Ms Patel said she would \u201clook at all options\u201d. She said: \u201cWhen it comes to air bridges, I think we should be absolutely open to all ideas. This is not for today but this doesn\u2019t mean we should rule this out in the future. \u201cThe fact of the matter is I spoke in my statement, in my remarks earlier about the travel industry, the leisure sector, aviation, we\u2019re at the forefront of a really dynamic aviation sector in our country. \u201cAviation is, in fact, the lifeblood when you think about it, keeping people moving but keeping goods moving as well. We will look at all options.\u201d Where do you go if you cannot quarantine for two weeks? Patel said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to reflect and recognise that the number travelling to the UK is at an all-time low \u2013 it\u2019s 99% down compared to this time last year. The measures will come in 8 June and we are working to communicate around the world and through channels what processes are and what people need to do to get ready. If they want to come to the UK they have to have that accommodation.\u201d If measures are in place to save lives, why are they starting in June and not immediately? Patel said: \u201cAs outlined in my statement, quite clearly, as the number of infections drop we have to manage the risk of external transmission. More people are now travelling and bringing in their own measures. This is about managing the risk of transmission being introduced elsewhere and that is vital so it\u2019s why we are bringing in these measures now. We want to reduce the risk of imported cases to the UK.\u201d Vallance said that this is not a three-month epidemic and it is something long term to deal with, requiring some form of social distancing over a longer period until there is treatment or a vaccine. He said: \u201cI am not going to speculate on when decisions will be made by government on schools. That is a decision for government. But I will say a few words on considerations and the lower we get the numbers of new infections each week the more things we can do.\u201d He added: \u201cThe more we can modify environments to be useful to keep appropriate social distancing the better things are. There are a number of ways, and decisions must be based on good scientific principles.\u201d Vallance continued: \u201cObviously it is important schools must get back for education at some point... We must make that decision at the right time in an era where social distancing will be in place for some time.\u201d Direct questions from the media. Now with this quarantine measure coming in - shall we assume most summer holidays abroad won\u2019t happen this year? Patel said: \u201cThe advice is that it is not about booking holidays right now, these measures have been brought in for the clear reasons outlined... The other point to note \u2013 the advice from government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is not to travel and please follow the advice on their website, that there should be nothing but essential travel. This is not about booking holidays, we want to avoid a second wave.\u201d While the risks are low to children, if schools reopen \u2013 what will be the risk to families and the wider community? Patel: \u201cMany schools are already open and doing fantastic work providing schooling for kids of key workers and vulnerable children. There are hundreds of thousands of vulnerable children who are safer in schools. On the question of infection control and families, that needs to be looked at ... and we are following advice from government and scientistic advice and that is crucial.\u201d Patel was asked about what guidance there is for those who have booked weddings. She said: \u201cAt the same time, now we know everything we do in terms of working to control the virus, taking individual responsibility is crucial.\u201d Vallance said \u2013 on the point of gatherings: \u201cWe have been trying to break transmission between households ... as any decisions are made about relaxing those sort of guidelines ... The science can provide guidance but cannot choose the number, that has to be a policy decision.\u201d The home secretary, Priti Patel, said ministers will work to \u201cfind new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way\u201d. She told the daily Downing Street press conference: \u201cWe also recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel sector, and leisure sectors, who are already struggling through these unprecedented times. \u201cSo, across government, we will continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way.\u201d Patel also confirmed the plan will be reviewed every three weeks. Sir Patrick Vallance said that the R number is between 0.7 and 1. He said that the epidemic is \u201ceither flat or declining in the UK and in most areas it is declining.\u201d He said as the R rate gets lower, the number of new infections will also be important to monitor. He added that at the moment there were about 61,000 new infections a week, which equates to one in 1,000 people every week getting an infection. \u201cThe epidemic is shrinking and the numbers will come down but we need to keep an eye on them as the lower we can get these numbers the more likely we can release measures.\u201d Border Force will be able to refuse entry to foreign citizens who are not UK residents during border checks while removal from the country could be used as a last resort, the Home Office said. Anyone arriving by air, sea or rail will be advised to use personal transport to head to their accommodation and once there not leave for 14 days. They will not be allowed to accept visitors, unless they are providing essential support, and should not go out to buy food or other essentials \u201cwhere they can rely on others\u201d, the department said. The Home Office said if accommodation does not meet necessary requirements - with hotels, or with friends and family listed as options - they will have to self-isolate in hotel accommodation arranged by the government. Officials said that those the new entrant is staying with would not need to quarantine, but they should avoid contact with each other where possible. Paul Lincoln, director general of the Border Force, said they are ramping up communications to make people aware of the self-isolation rules when arriving. People will need to provide travel plans and details about where they are self-isolating. Certain groups will be exempt and a full list of those in this category will be published on the government\u2019s website. It includes road haulage and freight workers, and medical professionals travelling to help fight Covid-19. Paul Lincoln, director general of the Border Force, said last month 700kg of cocaine and heroin was seized, some concealed in shipments of face masks. They intercepted thousands of counterfeit Covid-19 tests. Between 21 March and 15 May officers referred 84 consignments of face masks to trading standards as being counterfeit or below standard. Patel said she recognised how hard changes would be for travel and the leisure sector. \u201cWe will support [the sector] to find new ways to open international travel and tourism,\u201d she said. She added that the new measures will be reviewed and arrivals will be required to provide contact and address details to help them be traced should they need to be. Priti Patel, speaking at the daily briefing, said: As the world begins to emerge from what we hope is the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, we must look to the future and protect the British public by reducing the risk of cases crossing our border. We are introducing these new measures now to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave. I fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures. But we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others. Two-week quarantines will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June, with fines for anyone who breaches the measure to prevent new waves of coronavirus from overseas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announces that mandatory self-isolation would not apply to people coming from Ireland, medics tackling Covid-19 and seasonal agricultural workers. Passengers will have to fill in a form providing their contact and travel information so they can be traced if infections arise, and they could be contacted regularly during the 14 days and face random checks from public health authorities to ensure their compliance. Breaches would be punishable with a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England, or prosecution with an unlimited fine, while devolved nations can set out their own enforcement approaches. Border Force will be able to refuse entry to foreign citizens who are not UK residents during border checks while removal from the country could be used as a last resort, the Home Office said. Anyone arriving by air, sea or rail will be advised to use personal transport to head to their accommodation and once there not leave for 14 days. They will not be allowed to accept visitors, unless they are providing essential support, and should not go out to buy food or other essentials \u201cwhere they can rely on others\u201d, the department said. The Home Office said if accommodation does not meet necessary requirements - with hotels, or with friends and family listed as options - they will have to self-isolate in hotel accommodation arranged by the government. Officials said that those the new entrant is staying with would not need to quarantine, but they should avoid contact with each other where possible. Firefighters are to train care home staff on measures aimed at stemming the spread of coronavirus. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said that following a request from health officials in England, its members will deliver infection prevention and control training in care homes. Training will include hygiene measures, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and carrying out Covid-19 tests. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: \u201cThe crisis in care homes is a national scandal but our members will do what they can to help. \u201cFirefighters, highly trained in the safe use of PPE and infection prevention and control, can provide vital support at this difficult time.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re coming into wildfire season and can expect an incredibly busy few months for firefighters but crews have taken on extraordinary new areas of work to support their communities through this pandemic.\u201d As temperatures rise over the bank holiday weekend, councils with responsibility for beauty spots are warning people to stay away. Following the easing of some lockdown measures last week, there are no restrictions on how far people can go to get to the countryside, national parks and beaches in England. But the National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend, as part of the collective effort to make easing of the lockdown work. With the Met Office forecasting that temperatures could reach highs of 26C on Monday, many people may be planning trips to the beach. Visitors to Brighton in East Sussex will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton &amp; Hove city council, said on Friday: We are so proud of the city we share but to promote Brighton &amp; Hove as a place to visit at this time would be utterly irresponsible and an insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers who have protected the whole county throughout this devastating crisis. We urge anyone thinking of travelling to the city at this time to consider very carefully how their journey will impact on others and what sort of experience they will have when they arrive, without access to the usual high standards of hospitality. Hastings borough council meanwhile has said the area is \u201cclosed to visitors from outside the town\u201d. After seeing the number of people who headed to its coastline this week, Sefton council in Merseyside has adopted a new campaign before the bank holiday weekend. \u201cWish you weren\u2019t here!\u201d is the council\u2019s take on the picture postcard message it is sending to people thinking of travelling to its beaches from across the north-west of England. An art group is attacking the British government\u2019s record on Covid-19 deaths, bringing the message direct to Westminster. They have placed their poster \u201cWorst in Europe\u201d opposite the British parliament in a bus stop advertising space. The poster was in place for the Thursday 21 May NHS clapping. Ben from Protest Stencil said: \u201cThe media and opposition politicians have failed to hold this government to account for its appalling record. In the war metaphors that the government seems so fond of, this has been a massacre, and the blood is on their hands.\u201d Students could sit A-level exams in October and GCSEs in November if they are unhappy with their summer results, under proposals published by the government. Exact dates have not been released because of the continued uncertainty around the full reopening of schools and colleges, exams regulator Ofqual said. Following the closure of schools in March, the Department for Education said pupils in England would be awarded calculated grades based on teacher assessment. Ofqual has now confirmed that grades will be standardised taking account of the expected national outcomes for this year\u2019s students, prior attainment of student cohorts and previous results of the school or college. The autumn exams would be for students who want to try and improve the grade they receive this summer, and for those who are unable to receive a calculated grade. Hi everyone. I am going to be running the Guardian\u2019s live feed, bringing you all the latest on the coronavirus news from the UK until 7pm. Please do share with me any thoughts and comments you have or tips for areas we should be investigating. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The National Education Union suggested Boris Johnson was taking a \u201ccavalier attitude\u201d towards children in response to the publication of the Sage documents. Joint general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: We are surprised that the wider opening of schools proposed by Boris Johnson has not been modelled by Sage. This points to a cavalier attitude towards the nation\u2019s children. The fact of the matter is that Sage has only weak evidence as to what extent children can transmit the virus to others. The Office for National Statistics has recently indicated that age does not affect the likelihood of being infected. And last week, the Government\u2019s scientific panel told us that there are cases where children do act as the index case. If we cannot be certain about the transmission of the virus - and it appears Sage cannot, either - then it is only right to exercise caution. Boris Johnson may meet Donald Trump at the G7 summit in the US next month as the US president considers holding a \u201ccomeback\u201d meeting of global leaders at Camp David. Ikea is set to reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland, making it the latest big-name chain to announce plans to welcome back customers. The stores are set to start reopening from June 1 and social distancing wardens will patrol stores to help shoppers and ensure they keep their distance. But families will be banned, with Ikea saying it will allow one adult and one child per household inside the store at any one point. The 19 stores reopening are Croydon, Greenwich, Lakeside, Wembley, Tottenham, Norwich collection point, Birmingham, Nottingham, Belfast, Manchester, Warrington, Gateshead, Leeds, Sheffield, Milton Keynes, Reading, Southampton, Bristol and Exeter. Annemarie Plas, architect of the \u201cclap for carers\u201d gesture, has said next Thursday\u2019s event, the 10th, should be the last. The 36-year-old, from south London, told the PA Media news agency: \u201cI think it\u2019s good to have the last of the series next Thursday, because to have the most impact I think it is good to stop it at its peak. \u201cWithout getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised. \u201cI think the narrative is starting to change and I don\u2019t want the clap to be negative. \u201cA clap is something normal people can do, showing our appreciation. But the power is not with us. We can give them respect but we are not signing the cheque \u2013 that falls on another desk.\u201d Plas suggested resurrecting the clap in 2021 to mark a year since the coronavirus outbreak. Tributes have been made to a \u201cfiercely proud\u201d nurse who died after contracting coronavirus and had been working to keep his colleagues safe. The Press Association reports: Joselito Habab, known as Jo, died at Whiston hospital on Wednesday with his wife, Michelle, an A&amp;E nurse, by his side, a spokesman for Warrington and Halton teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust said. The father of one, originally from Manila in the Philippines, joined the trust almost 18 years ago. He worked as a staff nurse in trauma and orthopaedics until 2011 when he became a clinical nurse educator and was awarded employee of the month, the hospital spokesman said. A statement on the hospital\u2019s website said: Jo was recently promoted to orthopaedic trauma nurse co-ordinator but before becoming ill, Jo was back in a key clinical education and training role keeping others safe by doing PPE training and fit testing for face masks. He was an exemplary nurse and role model and fiercely proud of being both a nurse and a member of the WHH family. He will be very sadly missed by all who knew and worked with him. A GoFundMe page set up in his memory described Habab as a \u201ctrue NHS hero\u201d. It said: Joe was a fantastic colleague, always ready to help with a smile on his face. He worked hard and never left a task unfinished. Ikea will reopen 19 sites from June 1, according to the company. The sites set to reopen will be: Croydon, Greenwich, Lakeside, Wembley, Tottenham, Norwich collection point, Birmingham, Nottingham, Belfast, Manchester, Warrington, Gateshead, Leeds, Sheffield, Milton Keynes, Reading, Southampton, Bristol and Exeter. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home, said the retailer. New polling from Ipsos MORI shows that Boris Johnson\u2019s favourability ratings have slipped \u2013 but are still positive on balance, and higher than his scores before his illness The online survey, carried out between 15-18 May, found that Johnson\u2019s ratings are still higher than they were before the lockdown started. Leader favourability ratings Boris Johnson\u2019s ratings have fallen this month, but are still positive on balance, and higher than his scores before his illness. Forty-five percent feel favourable towards him (down 6 points since April), and 38% unfavourable (up 7). Keir Starmer\u2019s ratings also continue to be more positive than negative. 34% are favourable towards him (up 8 points this month) and 26% unfavourable (also up by 5). Those with a neutral or no opinion about him have fallen from 53% to 40%. People also continue to believe that Starmer is more likely to change the Labour party for the better (46%, up 3) than for the worse (9%, also up 3). Three in ten (29%) think he will make no difference. Among Conservative voters in the 2019 General Election, Boris Johnson\u2019s favourability ratings have fallen from a very high 91% last month to 79% this month, in line with his average earlier in the year. However, this is still higher than the equivalent score for Keir Starmer among 2019 Labour voters, which stands at 58% (three in ten are still neutral or don\u2019t know). Public perceptions of the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are positive, with 47% favourable and just 18% unfavourable (35% are neutral or don\u2019t know). The public are split about Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. A third (33%) are favourable, and another 33% are unfavourable (34% neutral or don\u2019t know). Country direction The proportion of Britons saying Britain is moving in the right direction has fallen seven points to 33%, and is once again outnumbered by those who think the country is on the wrong track (also up seven to 42%) - a similar picture to March, according to the pollsters. Those who voted Conservative in the 2019 General Election are most positive, with 53% agreeing the country is heading the in the right direction (against just 18% of Labour voters), although this has fallen from 71% last month. This chart shows that by far the most popular politician in Britain right now is ....Chancellor Rishi Sunak Wales has recorded 138 new cases and seven new deaths. The total number of cases in Wales is 72,984 and the total number of deaths 1,254. And here are the hospital death figures from the NHS in England. 121 people who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,387. According to NHS England the patients were aged between 41 and 98 and three had no known underlying health condition. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region: East of England 25 London 16 Midlands 27 North East &amp; Yorkshire 12 North West 23 South East 15 South West 3 TOTAL 121 Figures from the DHSC show there were 140,497 tests on 21 May. As of 5pm on 21 May, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,393 have died. That is 3,287 new cases (up from 250,908 yesterday) and 351 new deaths (36,393, compared to 36,042 yesterday). The Sage group of scientific advisers modelled a range of scenarios for school reopenings, including low-risk options for pupils attending on alternate weeks, before the government settled on a June 1 reopening plan, according to papers published on Friday. The papers of scientific advice prepared for Sage and its subcommittees also reveal high levels of uncertainty around different scenarios for school reopenings and over the likelihood of transmission of Covid-19 virus by children of different ages. One of the most recent papers, discussing the effects of increasing school attendance on transmission, concludes: \u201cThere is substantial uncertainty, with the relative contribution of school openings being driven also by the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children of different ages compared to adults, as well as the extent to which social distancing is or is not sustained in the wider population.\u201d Collectively, the scientific advice does little to assuage fears among parents and teachers over the potential risks to reopening schools to reception, year 1 and year 6 groups as soon as 1 June, as pledged by Boris Johnson earlier this month. Yesterday the governments of both Scotland and Northern Ireland announced that schools in those countries would not return until after the summer holidays. You can read the full Sage advice for reopening schools here Lockdown changes being eased in London ahead of other parts of the country was hinted at by Downing Street today. Focus on the capital comes as Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced that he and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will co-chair a London Transition Board on how the city might ease its way out of the lockdown process. The capital reported no new Covid-19 cases in a 24 hours period this week. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said that the government had already been clear that some parts of the country could see measures lifted ahead of others. He said: \u201cWhat is clear in the plans is that as we are able to gather more data and have better surveillance of the rate of infection in different parts of the country, then we will be able to potentially lift measures quicker in some parts of the country than in others. And equally we will be able to put the breaks on while not having to do so in other parts.\u201d London is the first region in the country to have an official recovery board however No 10 said they are in regular contact with regional mayors on how they will respond to the easing of lockdown.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Boris Johnson could go to see Donald Trump for the G7 summit, which will take place at the White House next month. At a briefing at Downing Street, reporters were told: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has urged Johnson to give Trump \u201ca bit of encouragement\u201d to think about the importance of following scientific advice on the coronavirus pandemic if he does visit. Asked by the Guardian about reports from Friday\u2019s Downing Street media briefing that the prime minister could visit Trump, Sturgeon said it was not her role to tell Johnson what he should ask the president, but said Trump\u2019s leadership on the pandemic had been worrying. \u201cI think all of us, and I say this not just as a leader of a government, I say this as a citizen, would like to see the president of the United States, in his demeanour and public utterances around the dealing with this virus, be just a little bit more responsible in the messages he is giving. \u201cWe laugh sometimes about previous comments about disinfectant and some of the comments he has made recently about testing but it is so important that leaders \u2013 we all make mistakes, we all get things wrong, all of us \u2013 that we give clear advice and messages to people and we try to base that on the best knowledge, science and information we\u2019ve got. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a responsibility for leaders at the best of times but it\u2019s such an important responsibility at times like this, so perhaps a bit of encouragement to think about the importance of that would not go amiss.\u201d Downing Street did not rule out London emerging from the lockdown sooner than other parts of the country. Asked whether the capital could see measures eased quicker, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cAs we are able to gather more data and have better surveillance of a rate of infection in different parts of the country then we will be able to lift measures quicker in some parts of the country than in others. \u201cAnd equally we will be able to put the brakes on in some parts of the country while not having to do so in other parts.\u201d Plans to manage London\u2019s recovery from the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic have been unveiled. A strategy has been set out by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary. It includes the establishment of a London Transition Board, co-chaired by Khan and Jenrick, which will coordinate the capital\u2019s response to issues and risks arising from lockdown being lifted. The board will comprise of senior leaders from across the city who will help to provide strategic direction for the next phase of response and restart, remaining in place until the end of 2020. Key issues for the group will include controlling the infection, phasing in and out the various levels of lockdown, and assessing the impact on public services, including transport. Khan pledged that \u201cnobody is left behind\u201d in the city\u2019s recovery from the pandemic. The number of people travelling by tube in London has increased by around a quarter in the last week. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told reporters tube travel is up 20-26% compared with last week, however the overall figure is still 91-93% down on the same period last year. Network Rail said there has been slight increases in footfall at London stations they manage, but overall it remains \u201cfairly low\u201d. Bus journeys outside of London are 80-86% lower than you would expect for the time of year. Rail passenger journeys are down 95% this week compared with the same time last year. Nicola Sturgeon has said people will be able to travel longer distances to see their parents or children as long as they do not go indoors, as she clarified the new Scottish lockdown rules coming into force later next week. The first minister told Friday\u2019s daily coronavirus media briefing the updated guidelines, which come into force on 28 May in Scotland, did not mean family members were barred from travelling more than five miles from home to meet close family. Even that five miles limit was \u201ca guide\u201d she said. Many commentators and social media users were surprised and irritated on Thursday the new rules appeared to rule out any visits to see elderly parents, even while it allowed people to play golf or host barbeques from next week. Sturgeon urged Scots to \u201cexercise good judgement\u201d about where they travelled and who they met, but insisted that meeting people - including parents - outwith their immediate household could only happen outdoors. She said people should avoid popping into their parents\u2019 home to use the toilet after a long drive. \u201cYou risk leaving the virus on surfaces inside the house, and that\u2019s a risk we don\u2019t want you to take,\u201d she said. Sturgeon cautioned that the looser lockdown rules would not be in force this bank holiday weekend, and urged people not to flood to beaches, parks and beauty spots. \u201cYou have all been magnificent so far but please stick with it for the next few days, so we can begin the journey back to normality,\u201d she said. The government\u2019s testing coordinator has urged the public to wait for an approved home antibody testing kit rather than buying one off the internet. Prof John Newton told the Commons science and technology committee the public should wait for an approved home test which is currently being evaluated. The government announced on Thursday that more than 10m antibody kits were being bought and would be rolled out first in hospitals and care homes. High street chains, including Superdrug, had already begun to offer a home antibody test kit for \u00a369. When asked about the home tests, Newton said better tests would be available to the public soon. A total of 2,245 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 24 from 2,221 on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon said. The first minister said 14,969 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 113 from 14,856 the day before. There are 1,257 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 61. Of these, 50 were in intensive care, a fall of one. Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, told the Commons home affairs committee, she was keen to see more information on the \u201cusefulness\u201d of certain people being exempt from quarantine. She said: Of course an airline is not going to fly a flight if there are only one or two people who are exempted who will be coming in. That\u2019s why we are concerned about the way that this will operate, in that it may simply lead to a prolonged shutdown of all aviation. The coronavirus crisis has led to Royal Mail missing its annual regulatory target for delivering first class post. The company announced that it delivered 92.6% of mail on the next working day in the year to March, against a target of 93%. The performance was \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d by the crisis, which led to high levels of coronavirus-related absences in recent weeks, it said in a statement. Up until mid-March, Royal Mail was meeting its first class target with a performance of 93%. Royal Mail is asking the regulator Ofcom to take these issues into consideration. The figures showed that 98.7% of second class mail was delivered within three working days, against a target of 98.5%. The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Freedland writes today on the NHS surcharge debacle, saying during a pandemic the public expects compassion and effectiveness. They seem to be in recklessly short supply. Acting earlier to tackle the coronavirus pandemic would have \u201cmade quite a big difference\u201d to the death rate, according to one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers. Sir Ian Boyd, a member of the Sage scientific advisory group, told the BBC that the number one issue was whether ministers could have acted earlier. He also said he believed that some politicians \u201cwould have loved\u201d to have reacted earlier, but that they thought it would not be feasible. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Coronavirus Newscast, Boyd said: \u201cActing very early was really important and I would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s really the number one issue: could we have acted earlier? \u201cWere the signs there earlier on?\u201d He continued: \u201cOne could point the finger at ministers and politicians for not being willing to listen to scientific advice. \u201cYou could point the finger at scientists for not actually being explicit enough. \u201cBut at the end of the day all these interact with public opinion as well. \u201cAnd I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasn\u2019t feasible because people wouldn\u2019t have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did.\u201d Children and young people could be half as likely to catch coronavirus than adults, a scientific review of studies from around the world has suggested. Researchers found those aged under 20 had 56% lower odds of catching SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the coronavirus which causes the disease Covid-19, from an infected person. But the review of global test and tracing and population screening studies, led by University College London (UCL), said evidence \u201cremains weak\u201d on how likely children are to transmit the virus to others. Researchers also concluded they did not have sufficient data to examine whether children under the age of 12 differed to teenagers in terms of susceptibility to the virus. Lead author of the research, Prof Russell Viner of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said it was the \u201cfirst comprehensive study\u201d to review what is and is not known about \u201csusceptibility and transmission\u201d among children. There is no evidence that mutations in the coronavirus are making it easier for the virus to spread, researchers have said. Prof Francois Balloux, a co-author of the research at University College London, said the results are a surprise, but a rare piece of good news. \u201cI have to admit I expected the virus would evolve towards even higher transmission,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt is really good news that is not happening and it is unlikely to happen in the near future.\u201d Balloux said he understood why there are concerns about mutations. But, he said: \u201cFundamentally mutations, especially here, are nothing to worry about ... it is just some kind of minor typo [in the genome] that are either neutral or actually often not favourable to the virus.\u201d The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by a team of researchers in the UK and France, who scrutinised more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes collected from patients around the world since the outbreak began. Across all the genomes they uncovered 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, but none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes. Further analysis revealed 273 of the mutations cropped up repeatedly \u2013 with the team focusing on the 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times. \u201cThere is no such thing as a European strain, an American strain, an Icelandic strain- there has been a lot of mixing from the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d said Balloux. \u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a mutation that happened once over the pandemic, then that is most unlikely to be something beneficial [to the virus].\u201d They then looked at whether these mutations made the virus more transmissible. \u201cWe just work out whether the ones that carry a mutation, whether they have more descendants, whether they are actually spreading faster [than closely related genomes without the mutation] \u2013 and the answer is no,\u201d said Balloux, adding the mutations could be introduced by enzymes involved in the body\u2019s immune system. In fact, the team says, some of the mutations studied seem to be actually harmful to the virus. Balloux added that while there is not enough data as yet to explore whether mutations may make the virus more deadly or cause more severe symptoms, he said it is unlikely. \u201cViruses don\u2019t benefit from killing their hosts. There is no evolutionary advantage to them hurting their hosts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t expect the virus to become more virulent.\u201d Martin Hibberd, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved in the study, welcomed the findings. But, he added, the relatively small sample size and the fact samples tend to be collected from more severe cases of Covid-19 means more research is needed to explore how genetic variations may affect transmission, or how virulent the virus is. Among other considerations Hibberd said: \u201cFurther surveillance is also needed as circumstances change \u2013 such as lockdown conditions changing \u2013 which might alter the transmission environment.\u201d Schools in Northern Ireland will not begin to reopen to full year groups of pupils until late August at the earliest, Peter Weir, the education minister, has announced. The decision means Northern Ireland joins Scotland in ruling out a return to the classroom for most pupils before the end of the summer break, which in Northern Ireland was scheduled to end on 1 September, leaving England alone in attempting to reopen schools from 1 June. Weir told the assembly\u2019s Covid-19 response committee: Subject to medical guidance and safety it would be my aim to see a phased reopening of schools, beginning with a limited provision for key cohort years in late August, followed by phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. This will not be a return to school as it was prior to Covid, but rather a new normal reflective of social distancing and a medically safe regime. For all pupils it will involve a schedule with a mixture of school attendance and remote learning at home. Finally, in line with the executive strategy, contingent upon medical guidance and scientific evidence around susceptibility and transmission, consideration may be given to a full return for cohorts of younger pupils. As in the UK\u2019s other nations, schools in Northern Ireland have remained open for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers, and Weir said he wanted to encourage more children from those groups to attend and to continue provision over the summer. The assembly\u2019s direct payments to parents in lieu of free school meals will continue until 30 June, Weir said. Wales has also said it will continue providing free school meals over the half-term holiday next week, while the Department for Education in England has declined. Weir also said that his department would establish a \u201crestart programme\u201d with schools and other stakeholders to \u201cput in place the detailed arrangements which will enable a safe, phased reopening of schools\u201d. Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian\u2019s live feed, updating you on all the latest coronavirus developments. Please do drop me a note while I work if you have any useful news tips or insight. It\u2019s always really great to hear from readers. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Volunteers are being recruited for the next two phases of clinical trials to help develop a coronavirus vaccine this year. Work began in January on the vaccine, which uses a virus taken from chimpanzees and has been developed by the University of Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. If it proves successful in human trials, up to 30 million doses for the UK could be available by September, the government has said. How will it work? Researchers want to recruit up to 10,260 people across the country for phases two and three of the study to see if there is a variation in how the immune systems respond to the vaccine in older people and children. The volunteers will be randomly allocated to receive either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or a licensed meningitis vaccine that will be used as a control for comparison. The first phase of the trials involved 160 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 55. Who can participate? Researchers are seeking volunteers aged 56 and over, as well as children aged five to 12 for phase two, and people aged 18 and over for phase three. They cannot have tested positive for Covid-19, must be in good health, not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and must not have previously taken part in a trial with an adenoviral vaccine or received any other coronavirus vaccines. Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director and director of health protection for Public Health England, said the UK had taken a \u201cprecautionary\u201d approach to introducing a 2 metre social distancing rule when other countries were using small distances. She told the Commons science and technology committee: We are still obviously learning about this virus and how it transmits itself so on a precautionary basis 2 metres appears to be correct. I know other countries use slightly less than that but until we know more, particularly about where the virus might transmit environmentally, 2 metres is important. She said that the 2 metre rule will be the \u201csubject of continued investigation\u201d on whether it can be reduced. She added: \u201cWe are aware of the international differences and I am sure this will be the subject of continued investigation as to whether 2 metres is actually necessary or whether that can be reduced further.\u201d A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said that with mandatory 14-day self-isolation in place there simply won\u2019t be sufficient demand to resume passenger services before August at the earliest. The safety and security of our people and our customers is always our top priority and public health must come first. However, by introducing a mandatory 14-day self isolation for every single traveller entering the UK, the government\u2019s approach will prevent flights from resuming. We are continually reviewing our flying programme and with these restrictions, there simply won\u2019t be sufficient demand to resume passenger services before August at the earliest. We know that as the Covid-19 crisis subsides, air travel will be a vital enabler of the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Therefore, we are calling for a multi-layered approach of carefully targeted public health and screening measures, which will allow for a successful and safe restart of international air travel for passengers and businesses. Four in 10 adults felt unsafe when going outside after the government\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d guidance was relaxed, official figures suggest. Forty-one per cent felt unsafe or very unsafe due to coronavirus, rising to more than half (54%) of those with an underlying health condition, according to the latest polling by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Despite the fears, around one in four adults said they had visited a park or green space over the past seven days, a sixth of whom did so to meet friends or family outside their immediate household. The Opinions and Lifestyle survey on the social impacts of Covid-19 was conducted on 995 adults in Great Britain between 14 and 17 May. This week\u2019s results are the first since the announcement of changes to the \u201cstay at home\u201d guidance on 10 May. There may be twice as many new coronavirus cases in the north of England as in the south, according to figures recorded by an app. The Covid Symptom Study app, developed by health technology company ZOE, has calculated there are currently 9,900 daily new cases of Covid-19 across England, not including in care homes. A spokesman for the firm said the results, based on a group of 980,000 people, showed levels in the north were around twice those in the south. However, the app\u2019s makers said the regional variation should be treated with caution as the number of actual cases was relatively small. The figures do not include people who are asymptomatic or those in care homes. Users of the app recorded their health online and were invited to be swab tested for the virus by the Department of Health and Social Care if they reported becoming unwell. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments so far today: Quarantine plan for travellers to the UK International travellers, including returning UK citizens, could face spot checks and \u00a31,000 fines if they fail to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving in the country, under measures to guard against a second wave of coronavirus. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil the plans at the daily Downing Street briefing later. The measures, which will be introduced next month, will be reviewed every three weeks, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said. Tony Smith, a former head of Border Force, said he was surprised quarantine measures had not been brought in sooner. Sir Paul Nurse: \u2018We are desperate for clear leadership\u2019 Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot, increasingly playing catchup\u201d. Care home boss calls for repeat testing Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. There was a real reluctance to test staff. They were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home.\u201d Government borrowing hits record \u00a362bn in April UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993. Independent Sage warns against school reopening plan The Independent Sage committee has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The group, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June. New spitting incident at a London station Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. He became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police were called and spit samples were taken from the female customer\u2019s face and arm. The incident follows the death of ticket office worker Belly Mujinga from coronavirus following an incident at London Victoria station. Hello everyone. I am taking over the Guardian\u2019s live feed, updating you on all the latest coronavirus developments. Please do drop me a note while I work if you have any useful news tips or insight. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Prof Newton confirmed that officials from Matt Hancock\u2019s health department had advised Public Health England to count postal tests from when they were sent out not when they were returned. He told the science committee: The way tests were counted was discussed with officials in the Department of Health and we were advised by the officials in the Department of Health of an appropriate method of counting the tests and that\u2019s what we did. They advised us, absolutely yes. The important thing is they are only counted once. The key thing is a very large number of tests are now being conducted. Croydon police have reported another spitting incident which will fuel fears that such behaviour is being \u201cweaponised\u201d against front line workers. Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at the Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. Staff asked him to step back so they could safely social distance, but he became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police (BTP) were called and spit samples were taken from female customer\u2019s face and arms, and it is not clear whether the assailant had coronavirus, said the TSSA. The incident follows the death of ticket office worker Belly Mujinga from coronavirus following an incident at London Victoria station. Lorraine Ward, TSSA official for London Underground, said: We strongly condemn this disgusting and frightening incident. Spitting has always been considered an assault, but following the tragic story of Belly Mujinga and heightened fears over the highly contagious coronavirus, more must be done to prevent such horrendous acts of violence against transport workers and passengers. Our union is pleased the BTP were on the scene straight away at Mile End and we hope that a prosecution can be secured. We\u2019re redoubling our call for protective visors to be made available to all frontline transport workers across the rail, Tube and bus networks as they provide a greater degree of protection from such acts. Prof Doyle and Prof Newton also tried to explain the reasons why testing capacity was initially so limited. Prof Yvonne Doyle told the committee that one reason many laboratories could not be involved was because the virus was regarded as a \u201cdangerous pathogen, and it was therefore categorised as category level three\u201d. She added: \u201cThat meant that very few laboratories initially could do that. We spotted this, and we made it an application to the Committee for Dangerous Pathogens to actually reduce the levels so that more laboratories could come on stream because we actually knew there was going to be a capacity problem. And on March 1, the Health and Safety Executive granted them permission, and then that allowed many more laboratories to engage in this.\u201d Prof Doyle said she is sure there are \u201cmany, many things\u201d we will learn to do differently following the coronavirus outbreak. But she insisted that in terms of laboratory capacity, there was not \u201cmuch more\u201d PHE could have done at the time. She added: We actually don\u2019t have a role in assuring laboratories or the quality assurance of laboratories.I know this may sound frustrating. Maybe in retrospect we need to look at the configuration of laboratory capacity nationally. Prof John Newton told the committee that requests from laboratories to help with testing were passed to the Department of Health and Social Care , which set a series of three tests they had to pass before they could take part. He said: All requests for laboratories were passed to the Department of Health. At the time they set three tests for any laboratory that wanted to take part and on the basis of that some of the laboratories were invited to contribute but others were not. But he said he could not comment on individual requests not receiving responses because they were passed to the department. Prof Newton said many laboratories fell down on the DHSC\u2019s third test that they must be able to provide an end-to-end clinical service associated with the NHS. He added: \u201cMost laboratories were not in a position to do that.\u201d Professor Yvonne Doyle told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that mass contact tracing was stopped in March \u201cbecause of the sheer scale of cases in the UK.\u201d She said there had been \u201cmultiple introductions, particularly after half-term (in February) and from European countries we now know had large amounts of prevalence themselves\u201d. She added: So we have multiple introductions, with many hundreds of thousands of people by March who had now been exposed to this virus in this country. Contact tracing could not possibly have had the capacity to address that. And with the capacity of lab testing and our contact tracers, we felt the most important thing to do was to focus on where there was national concern, which was the capacity of the NHS, to accrue that testing. We did commit from January onwards in a testing response to government to provide up to 25,000 tests per day. This was unprecedented and the fastest amount in increase in testing in recent history, and that we did in Public Health England with partnership with the NHS and with Roche. A former head of Border Force has said he was \u201csurprised\u201d quarantine measures had not been brought in at UK borders sooner. Tony Smith, now chairman of the International Border Management and Technologies Association, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee: Yes I was surprised that we hadn\u2019t seen earlier measures introduced at the UK border. I did live through a number of pandemics in my time in government, including Sars and bird flu, swine flu. The normal response is that there would be a significant introduction of public health into the ports and borders. That is what we would normally expect. I think there was some of that in some of the ports where hotspots were identified. The airports do have the capability working with the Border Force and with the airlines to isolate flights, to segment passengers into more remote areas of the airport and to conduct testing if such a thing is medically proven as being worthwhile. A scientist leading the development of a coronavirus vaccine said it is \u201cnot possible to predict\u201d when it will be ready for the wider population. The government said that if the Covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University proved successful in human trials, then up to 30 million doses could be available for the UK by September. But Professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has now said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know when scientists will have proof that it is effective. Work began in January on the vaccine, which uses a virus taken from chimpanzees and has been developed by the University of Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. The first phase of trialling involved 160 healthy volunteers between 18 and 55. Now scientists want to recruit up to 10,260 people across the country for phases II and III, which involve vastly increasing the number of volunteers and expanding the age range to include older adults and children. Appearing on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday, Prof Pollard was asked what the chances were of having a proven vaccine within a few months. He said: It is a very difficult question to know exactly when we will have proof that the vaccine works because we need, within our population of 10,000 people, to have enough of those who have been exposed to the virus over that time, who are hopefully in the controlled group, who are getting the control vaccine, and to see whether the coronavirus vaccine protects them. Now, there is uncertainty about how many cases there will be over the next three months. If there are cases then it is certainly possible by the autumn to have a result, and that is what we are hoping for, but it is not possible to predict. Public Health England\u2019s medical director Professor Yvonne Doyle has told MPs that the agency did not reject the South Korean model of mass coronavirus testing. She told the Science and Technology select committee on Friday that PHE was \u201cvery interested\u201d in what was being done internationally. Prof Doyle added: We did not reject the South Korean model, in fact we were very interested in what was happening internationally from the get-go. The testing capacity and testing profile of PHE\u2019s approach in the contain phase - which is between January and March - was very close to the one of South Korea for quite a long time, into early March. Chairman Greg Clark asked PHE\u2019s director of health improvement Professor John Newton why the committee was yet to see evidence about the South Korean testing model it had been promised weeks ago. He said: \u201cA commitment was given to provide that assessment, that contemporary assessment, many weeks have gone by, it hasn\u2019t been provided.\u201d But Prof Newton, who is also co-ordinator of the national testing effort, said that the evidence used to make the decision was epidemiology, which had already been published.He added: Just to reassure the committee very extensive continuous process is made of comparing epidemiology and practice and policy in different countries. The evidence that was used to make that decision was the epidemiology, which is published every week and we can certainly share that with you. Labour has demanded an investigation into how the outsourcing firm Serco revealed the details of 300 contract tracers. Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: It has never been clear what expertise or specialist knowledge Serco can bring to contact tracing. It now appears that they are struggling to implement even basic aspects of data privacy. We need some clarity from the government about why and how Serco came to be awarded this contract; and we need reassurances that the contract tracing programme is in safe hands. The Scottish government will not publish an advance timetable of set dates for when other parts of the lockdown will be eased, John Swinney, Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister, has said. Swinney told BBC Good Morning Scotland the easing process would follow the current three-weekly pattern governed by the lockdown regulations, but it would not copy the schedule being used by the UK government in England. Ministers in London have already said certain businesses can restart on 4 July. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, announced the first easing of Scotland\u2019s lockdown rules on Thursday. From 28 May, picnics and sunbathing will be allowed, as will social contact with friends and family outdoors, and garden centres and some non-contact sports will be allowed to restart. There has been a backlash, however, over her decision not to allow families to see relatives at home or to visit family outdoors if they live more than five miles away, while authorising people to play golf and have socially-distanced barbecues. Non-essential shops and businesses are still not allowed to reopen. Swinney said the Scottish government would study the infection, deaths and hospitalisation figures, all of which are falling, before confirming the dates of other relaxations: We have a plan here. If we see a reduction in the effect of Covid in our community, we will be able to make progress on a block of three -week intervals when we look to review each of the individual phases. That is us being straight with the public, recognising we will relax the measure if the public sticks with the rules and guidance and work with us as a community to tackle this very serious threat that we face. Here are the latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom. Transport for London (TfL) has announced it will begin reintroducing the requirement for passengers to pay for bus travel on Saturday. Customers on 85 routes served by more than 1,200 buses will initially need to touch in with their contactless, Oyster or concessionary card when they board. Middle-door boarding, and the suspension of the need to touch in, had been temporarily suspended to protect bus drivers. Thirty-three London bus workers have died after contracting Covid-19, including 29 drivers. TfL has commissioned an independent review into deaths among bus workers. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: TfL is seeking independent advice from UCL Institute of Health Equity to make sure we better understand the impact of coronavirus on our bus workers and to ensure we are taking every possible measure to protect our heroic staff. As the son of a bus driver, this is deeply personal to me. I urge all Londoners to do their bit to keep our transport workers safe by only using public transport if you have no other alternative. It is crucial that the demand on services is as low as possible to enable social distancing for the safety of both staff and passengers. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June. Unison said its members had been \u201cshut out\u201d of the debate over reopening, and that the government has not modelled the impact on support staff such as teaching assistants who tend to be older, and are more likely to come from black and minority ethnic communities or disadvantaged backgrounds. More than 90% said the government has failed to put safety first when planning to reopen schools to nursery, reception, year one and year six pupils in nine days\u2019 time, while 77% said their school would not have the resources to cope. More than 45,000 Unison members responded to the union\u2019s questions, including key staff such as childcare workers and cleaners. The majority said they had been working in schools throughout the lockdown, as many remained open to support vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. Jon Richards, Unison\u2019s head of education, said: There\u2019s little confidence in ministers\u2019 plans, that\u2019s clear to see. Staff, parents and schools aren\u2019t ready to go back without reassurances that safety is the number one priority. Unions want to work with ministers to make schools as safe as possible, so that parents, their children and staff will want to return. But the rush to get some schools open to meet an arbitrary date isn\u2019t at all helpful. Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot increasingly playing catchup.\u201d Nurse said there was confusion about the government\u2019s strategy and who was in charge. Do we have a proper governance system here that can combine scientific knowledge with political action? The question I\u2019m constantly asking myself is, who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy? Is it ministers? Is it Public Health England, the NHS, the Office of Life Sciences, Sage? I don\u2019t know. But more importantly, do they know? We have lions on the front line of clinical care. We need lions also in the leadership so that we can actually really drive this forward. Nurse added: Everybody involved not just the politicians, the scientists, and the doctors. We\u2019re all making mistakes. And we have to try and learn from what mistakes have been made up until now. To get a better, more sensible way forward we we have to tackle two main issues. One is to get a much clearer, publicly presented strategy as to what we\u2019re actually trying to do and the evidence upon which it is based. We\u2019re not getting that in communications. Maybe there\u2019s strategy there, I don\u2019t see it. And we need to know what the scientific evidence led to that. Nurse was particularly scathing about the lack of early testing. He said: We\u2019ve been allowing care workers to be in the wards who are potentially infected, infecting patients, infecting themselves, and as a consequence, making hospitals potentially unsafe places to be. We have to see a changed strategy there that is reliant upon the real evidence He claimed the government failed to use labs across the country to increase testing. He said: \u201cIt was a little like a pass the parcel the responsibilities were diffuse, no clear lines of responsibility. We are desperate for clear leadership at all levels.\u201d St Paul\u2019s Cathedral has launched an online book of remembrance for all UK residents who have died from coronavirus. People of all faiths or none are invited to contribute to Remember Me. It has been backed by Prince Charles. He said: \u201cThis virtual book of remembrance is here to help us remember; not just to recall our loss and sorrow, but also to be thankful for everything good that those we have loved brought into our lives, and all that they have given to others.\u201d A group of senior scientists has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The independent Sage committee, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, say that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so that new cases are found and isolated fast. \u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Professor King said. In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a \u201cvital\u201d part of the decision-making process. The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes. King said the decision of when to re-open schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d Professor King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their local area.\u201d The Independent Sage committee will host an online discussion at midday on Friday for teachers, parents, children and union representatives in association with the British Medical Journal and Mumsnet. It will broadcast on the Independent Sage YouTube channel, the committee\u2019s Facebook page, on Twitter via @independentSAGE and @Sir_David_King and BMJ\u2019s home page. UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, has defended the timing of the new quarantine measures and revealed they will be reviewed every three weeks. Asked by Sky News why the government hadn\u2019t implemented the idea sooner, he said: As the virus spread is falling here in the UK as our R number is falling, obviously, that marginal impact of people coming in has a real effect in a way that it just didn\u2019t a few weeks ago. And some weeks ago, we were still returning many many Britons back to the United Kingdom. People who come over to the United Kingdom will have to do quarantine and a few countries around the world are looking at this or have already introduced this. There\u2019ll be more details later on today \u2013 the Home Secretary will be doing the press conference at 5pm. day. As our R number is down we want to ensure that we don\u2019t get that second spike that could be one of the most damaging things for our economy in the long run. Lewis revealed that the measures would be reviewed every three weeks. He added: We\u2019re a country a that welcomes people from all over the world. But it is appropriate that we say \u2018if you\u2019re coming to the United Kingdom, we need to protect your own health and the health of the people of the United Kingdom\u2019. And the best way is to make sure that people go through that quarantine period to ensure they have no symptoms and are not able to add to the spread of the virus. For UK citizens coming back, they will be able to go home and quarantine at home but for visitors they will need to make arrangements for where they can do that quarantine for 14 days. He also downplayed an idea touted by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, for an \u201cair bridge\u201d to allow British holiday makers to avoid quarantine. Lewis said: \u201cThere\u2019s no plans for that at the moment.\u201d Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: What we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. Just two weeks ago we had a home where there had been no infections throughout the whole of the pandemic. We had a case develop in one of our residents, they started to show symptoms, they were tested and found to be positive. None of the residents had been in or out of hospital, there was no other way that it could have come in and yet none of the staff were presenting any symptoms and at that point it was before the whole home-testing procedure was in. There was a real reluctance to test staff, they were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home. Welcome to our UK coronavirus live blog. The Home Secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil a quarantine plan for new arrivals to the UK, at today\u2019s Downing Street briefing. Under the plans, international travellers could face spot checks and \u00a31,000 fines if they fail to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. Exemptions for road hauliers and medical officials will apply, while the common travel area with Ireland will be unaffected. Arrivals from France are not expected to exempt despite earlier suggestions that they would be. Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has already described the plans as \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cunimplementable,\u201d and Airlines UK said they \u201cwould effectively kill\u201d international travel to and from Britain.",

      "bodyText": "In the last few weeks a spate of American stores have made headlines after putting up signs telling customers who wear masks they will be denied entry. On Thursday, Vice reported on a Kentucky convenience store that put up a sign reading: \u201cNO Face Masks allowed in store. Lower your mask or go somewhere else. Stop listening to [Kentucky governor Andy] Beshear, he\u2019s a dumbass.\u201d Another sign was posted by a Californian construction store earlier this month encouraging hugs but not masks. In Illinois, a gas station employee who put up a similar sign has since defended herself, arguing that mask-wearing made it hard to differentiate between adults and children when selling booze and cigarettes. Meanwhile, Donald Trump finally caved and wore a face mask yesterday \u2013 something he didn\u2019t want to \u201cgive the press the pleasure of seeing\u201d. But while it is gratifying to see the emperor finally forced to wear clothes, you\u2019ve got to wonder to what extent the virus will spread thanks to the actions of citizens insisting on protecting their \u201cfreedom\u201d over the right of others not to get sick.

      "bodyText": "Police spoke to Dominic Cummings about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus, the Guardian can reveal. Officers approached Boris Johnson\u2019s key adviser days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror has found. There are now calls for his resignation. At the time, the government had instructed people not to travel and to stay at their family homes. Cummings, however, was seen in Durham. A member of the public is understood to have seen him and made a complaint to the police. When asked if Cummings had been warned about breaching the lockdown, a spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: \u201cOn Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an individual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. \u201cOfficers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house. \u201cIn line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.\u201d Downing Street has previously refused to disclose where Cummings was staying during the lockdown. The Guardian has also been told Cummings was spotted near the gate of his parents\u2019 home with a young child, believed to be his son, at around 5.45pm on Sunday 5 April, five days after the complaint was made to the police.

Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for flouting physical distancing rules when he was visited by his girlfriend.

But there's a flipside | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>These past few months were a moment when the Australian states and territories \u2013 under-scrutinised and undervalued compared with the federal sphere \u2013 have asserted their importance to the federation. State governments of both major parties have performed slightly differently, but exceptionally well by any international comparison. We have had 101 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/may/20/coronavirus-active-cases-australia-data-update-how-many-new-numbers-today-map-stats-statistics-hotspots-postcode-covid-19-deaths-death-toll\">Covid-19 deaths to date</a>. Four people have died per 1 million people in Australia, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">compared with</a> 597 in Spain, 537 in the UK, and 285 in the US. It\u2019s a stunning achievement.</p> \n<p>Andrews is the most experienced of the premiers and has grown in his 10 years as Labor leader, six as premier. He and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian lead the biggest and most powerful states, which between them have had the largest numbers of coronavirus cases, with 48 deaths in NSW and 18 in Victoria to date.</p> \n<p>The times, as Monash University\u2019s associate professor Paul Strangio points out, play to Andrews\u2019 strengths and style, with the crushing victory in the 2018 state election empowering him further. \u201cHe\u2019s always been prepared to take leadership risks on the calculation that the public prefers decisiveness and assertiveness, rather than vacillation,\u201d Strangio says.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Not a popularity contest\u2019</h2> \n<p>Victoria was the most firm among the states in insisting on early shutdowns in March and has been most cautious in reopening its society and economy. It is Victoria, too, that has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/victorian-treasurer-s-china-comments-spark-outrage-among-federal-colleagues-20200519-p54uix.html\">asserted its independence</a> over its economic relationship with China.</p> \n<p>After Scott Morrison detailed the national cabinet\u2019s three-stage roadmap for lifting coronavirus restrictions on 8 May \u2013 emphasising that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/the-three-step-plan-to-relax-restrictions-and-reopen-australia-after-coronavirus-crisis\">timing would be at the states\u2019 discretion</a> \u2013 it was Andrews who held firm that no Victorian could visit their mother on Mother\u2019s Day. The state\u2019s announcement on loosening restrictions would not happen until the following week, after a testing blitz could be analysed.</p> \n<p>Andrews did begin lifting restrictions, but they remain the tightest in the country. For now, Victorians cannot stay overnight at the home of family or friends \u2013 in every other state, this is allowed. Unlike other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are<strong> </strong>still unable to seat diners, but from next month, they can host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors and, all going well, that will increase as weeks go by. Victoria has been more cautious about students attending school \u2013 some years return on Monday, with all students back by 9 June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/20/social-distancing-rules-australia-when-will-end-guidelines-coronavirus-laws-physical-covid-19-restrictions-signs-posters-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-nt-tasmania\">Social distancing rules explained: Australia's current state by state coronavirus guidelines</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But these are differences of timing, not substance, and Andrews has explained them this way. He has listened to the advice of the state\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, and this has been slightly different to national advice. There\u2019s no perfect answer to how to handle this virus, no one set of modelling that sets a roadmap. \u201cThis is not a popularity contest; it\u2019s a pandemic and we\u2019ve got to make good logical decisions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d he told ABC radio this week. He\u2019s exercised sound judgment \u201cin a Victorian way \u2013 slow steady cautious\u201d. Opening up needs to be done \u201cproperly and once\u201d.</p> \n<p>The quibbling so far is having no impact on Andrews\u2019 popularity, which will inevitably come under greater pressure as the full economic impact becomes clear. People often rally around a leader at a time of crisis, and all state leaders, as well as Morrison, have seen their support soar.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport\">Essential poll</a> last week showed 71% of Victorians rated their government\u2019s performance as good or very good.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Sticking to his guns\u2019</h2> \n<p>Kosmos Samaras served as Victorian Labor\u2019s deputy campaign director for 14 years until 2019, and now heads RedBridge, a political consultancy. Since March, the company has conducted detailed focus groups around the Covid-19 response, predominantly in Victoria (Samaras says the company has no political or corporate clients for this work).</p> \n<p>The pressure from some commentators to reopen quickly is not supported by the majority of voters, especially those in outer suburbs and regional areas. Samaras says that those now on jobkeeper or jobseeker are also cautious.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey understand that if the lockdown is lifted too early or too quickly, we could endure another lockdown and they can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morrison\u2019s performance is highly praised, but Andrews stands out. \u201cParticipants from across the political spectrum are praising his actions,\u201d the March report found. \u201cHe is consistently described as \u2018transparent\u2019, \u2018forthright\u2019, \u2018proactive\u201d, \u2018compassionate\u2019 and \u2018assertive\u2019 on behalf of Victorians.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5c4880e73f2ee32483e01246897c825f27b8ab\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5c4880e73f2ee32483e01246897c825f27b8ab/0_0_3088_4632/667.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Andrews watches Brett Sutton\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Andrews has been consistent in following the advice of his chief health officer, Brett Sutton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Pockett/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The report of 6 May found Victorians were \u201cstill firmly in favour of a \u2018very careful\u2019, \u2018slow and safe\u2019 ending to the lockdown\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose arguing against it are largely seen as pushing personal agendas (selfishness) or being motivated by the wrong things (money). This represents a serious values disconnect with voters.</p> \n<p>\u201cAndrews\u2019 positive image is only reinforced when others put pressure on him to end the lockdown \u2013 he\u2019s doing the right thing and sticking to his guns with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>On China, voters are not interested in the \u201cblame game\u201d but they are worried about Australia\u2019s \u201cover-dependence\u201d on other countries. They want a more self-sufficient Australia, one that \u201cgoes back to building and making things here\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Political supremacy</h2> \n<p>All of which makes the job of an opposition leader tough. Michael O\u2019Brien, a former treasurer, is considered a measured moderate, and became leader of the Liberal party after the devastating election loss of 2018. The party did not expect to win that election, but the 6% swing against them \u2013 especially the desertion of small-l liberal voters in its Melbourne heartland \u2013 highlighted an identity crisis that still persists. The level of personal animosity within the party administration, says one senior Liberal, means \u201cthe Victorian division is regarded as the most dysfunctional\u201d in the country.</p> \n<p>The party\u2019s state conference has been postponed due to the pandemic, and with it, as former ABC presenter Jon Faine <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victorian-libs-tearing-themselves-apart-as-andrews-soars-20200515-p54tby.html\">wrote recently</a>, \u201cthe deferral of a reckoning\u201d with moderates keen to reduce the influence of rightwing religious activists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e05e9b7ecbdcdda823a4587d0d32c2735e9d8d6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05e9b7ecbdcdda823a4587d0d32c2735e9d8d6d/2760_675_1713_2142/800.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith has frustrated colleagues with his relentless attacks on Andrews.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Murray/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Federally, the looming vacancy created by Senate president Scott Ryan\u2019s retirement is a test of that, as is a bitter battle over the seat of Menzies, where rightwing veteran Kevin Andrews is resisting pressure to retire.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien is doing what he can, putting forward policy proposals to help Victoria\u2019s recovery, including exempting small and medium businesses from payroll tax. The government deserves to be scrutinised on many fronts, including the lack of independent oversight over billions in spending, and the $24.5bn in new borrowing the government is proposing, which will more than triple state debt.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we just see budget black holes being filled and paying recurrent expenses like public service wages out of borrowed money, that is the road to economic ruin,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien told the Age recently.</p> \n<p>Victoria\u2019s engagement with China over its Belt and Road initiative \u2013 against national policy \u2013 and the suggestion of state treasurer Tim Pallas that Canberra had vilified China by pursuing an independent coronavirus inquiry, has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/victorian-treasurer-s-china-comments-spark-outrage-among-federal-colleagues-20200519-p54uix.html\">raised eyebrows</a> even among senior Labor figures.</p> \n<p>Yet O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts have been undermined from within. Shadow planning minister Tim Smith, a master of self-promotion, has been tweeting away for months, first demanding the resignation of a senior health official for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/victoria-defends-deputy-chief-medical-officer-after-she-compared-james-cook-to-covid-19\">tweet comparing the coronavirus with Captain Cook\u2019s arrival</a>, and then indulging in almost daily sprays against Andrews. O\u2019Brien had had enough when Smith called the premier \u201cloony\u201d.</p> \n<p>Smith is close to the most senior Victorian federal Liberal, treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and no doubt has leadership ambitions, premature for now. He is loud and aggressive but not one-dimensional; he <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-23/tim-smith-calls-for-bettina-arndt-to-be-stripped-of-am/11992082\">called </a><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-23/tim-smith-calls-for-bettina-arndt-to-be-stripped-of-am/11992082\"> for social commentator Bettina Arndt to have her Australia Day award cancelled</a> following her comments after the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet many Liberals are frustrated with Smith\u2019s antics, designed for maximum media coverage.</p> \n<p>Strangio has some sympathy with the opposition\u2019s dilemma.

Stay quiet and you\u2019ll allow Andrews to continue his dominance. \u201cAndrews has now reached a point of such supremacy in the political landscape, they can\u2019t just keep on keeping the gloves off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrews doesn\u2019t have to do much to swat away the Liberals for now. Smith posted a silly Twitter poll a few days ago, asking whether Andrews should be called \u201cChairman\u201d or \u201cDictator\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked about it, Andrews said: \u201cI don\u2019t comment on people who are fundamentally irrelevant to the work that I do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Easy.</p>",

The times, as Monash University\u2019s associate professor Paul Strangio points out, play to Andrews\u2019 strengths and style, with the crushing victory in the 2018 state election empowering him further. \u201cHe\u2019s always been prepared to take leadership risks on the calculation that the public prefers decisiveness and assertiveness, rather than vacillation,\u201d Strangio says. \u2018Not a popularity contest\u2019 Victoria was the most firm among the states in insisting on early shutdowns in March and has been most cautious in reopening its society and economy. It is Victoria, too, that has asserted its independence over its economic relationship with China. After Scott Morrison detailed the national cabinet\u2019s three-stage roadmap for lifting coronavirus restrictions on 8 May \u2013 emphasising that the timing would be at the states\u2019 discretion \u2013 it was Andrews who held firm that no Victorian could visit their mother on Mother\u2019s Day. The state\u2019s announcement on loosening restrictions would not happen until the following week, after a testing blitz could be analysed. Andrews did begin lifting restrictions, but they remain the tightest in the country. For now, Victorians cannot stay overnight at the home of family or friends \u2013 in every other state, this is allowed. Unlike other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are still unable to seat diners, but from next month, they can host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors and, all going well, that will increase as weeks go by. Victoria has been more cautious about students attending school \u2013 some years return on Monday, with all students back by 9 June. But these are differences of timing, not substance, and Andrews has explained them this way. He has listened to the advice of the state\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, and this has been slightly different to national advice. There\u2019s no perfect answer to how to handle this virus, no one set of modelling that sets a roadmap. \u201cThis is not a popularity contest; it\u2019s a pandemic and we\u2019ve got to make good logical decisions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d he told ABC radio this week. He\u2019s exercised sound judgment \u201cin a Victorian way \u2013 slow steady cautious\u201d. Opening up needs to be done \u201cproperly and once\u201d. The quibbling so far is having no impact on Andrews\u2019 popularity, which will inevitably come under greater pressure as the full economic impact becomes clear. People often rally around a leader at a time of crisis, and all state leaders, as well as Morrison, have seen their support soar. An Essential poll last week showed 71% of Victorians rated their government\u2019s performance as good or very good. \u2018Sticking to his guns\u2019 Kosmos Samaras served as Victorian Labor\u2019s deputy campaign director for 14 years until 2019, and now heads RedBridge, a political consultancy. Since March, the company has conducted detailed focus groups around the Covid-19 response, predominantly in Victoria (Samaras says the company has no political or corporate clients for this work). The pressure from some commentators to reopen quickly is not supported by the majority of voters, especially those in outer suburbs and regional areas. Samaras says that those now on jobkeeper or jobseeker are also cautious. \u201cThey understand that if the lockdown is lifted too early or too quickly, we could endure another lockdown and they can\u2019t afford that.\u201d Morrison\u2019s performance is highly praised, but Andrews stands out. \u201cParticipants from across the political spectrum are praising his actions,\u201d the March report found. \u201cHe is consistently described as \u2018transparent\u2019, \u2018forthright\u2019, \u2018proactive\u201d, \u2018compassionate\u2019 and \u2018assertive\u2019 on behalf of Victorians.\u201d The report of 6 May found Victorians were \u201cstill firmly in favour of a \u2018very careful\u2019, \u2018slow and safe\u2019 ending to the lockdown\u201d. \u201cThose arguing against it are largely seen as pushing personal agendas (selfishness) or being motivated by the wrong things (money). This represents a serious values disconnect with voters. \u201cAndrews\u2019 positive image is only reinforced when others put pressure on him to end the lockdown \u2013 he\u2019s doing the right thing and sticking to his guns with it.\u201d On China, voters are not interested in the \u201cblame game\u201d but they are worried about Australia\u2019s \u201cover-dependence\u201d on other countries. They want a more self-sufficient Australia, one that \u201cgoes back to building and making things here\u201d. Political supremacy All of which makes the job of an opposition leader tough. Michael O\u2019Brien, a former treasurer, is considered a measured moderate, and became leader of the Liberal party after the devastating election loss of 2018. The party did not expect to win that election, but the 6% swing against them \u2013 especially the desertion of small-l liberal voters in its Melbourne heartland \u2013 highlighted an identity crisis that still persists. The level of personal animosity within the party administration, says one senior Liberal, means \u201cthe Victorian division is regarded as the most dysfunctional\u201d in the country. The party\u2019s state conference has been postponed due to the pandemic, and with it, as former ABC presenter Jon Faine wrote recently, \u201cthe deferral of a reckoning\u201d with moderates keen to reduce the influence of rightwing religious activists. Federally, the looming vacancy created by Senate president Scott Ryan\u2019s retirement is a test of that, as is a bitter battle over the seat of Menzies, where rightwing veteran Kevin Andrews is resisting pressure to retire. O\u2019Brien is doing what he can, putting forward policy proposals to help Victoria\u2019s recovery, including exempting small and medium businesses from payroll tax. The government deserves to be scrutinised on many fronts, including the lack of independent oversight over billions in spending, and the $24.5bn in new borrowing the government is proposing, which will more than triple state debt. \u201cIf we just see budget black holes being filled and paying recurrent expenses like public service wages out of borrowed money, that is the road to economic ruin,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien told the Age recently. Victoria\u2019s engagement with China over its Belt and Road initiative \u2013 against national policy \u2013 and the suggestion of state treasurer Tim Pallas that Canberra had vilified China by pursuing an independent coronavirus inquiry, has raised eyebrows even among senior Labor figures. Yet O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts have been undermined from within. Shadow planning minister Tim Smith, a master of self-promotion, has been tweeting away for months, first demanding the resignation of a senior health official for her tweet comparing the coronavirus with Captain Cook\u2019s arrival, and then indulging in almost daily sprays against Andrews. O\u2019Brien had had enough when Smith called the premier \u201cloony\u201d. Smith is close to the most senior Victorian federal Liberal, treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and no doubt has leadership ambitions, premature for now. He is loud and aggressive but not one-dimensional; he called for social commentator Bettina Arndt to have her Australia Day award cancelled following her comments after the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children. Yet many Liberals are frustrated with Smith\u2019s antics, designed for maximum media coverage. Strangio has some sympathy with the opposition\u2019s dilemma. Score points and you\u2019ll turn voters off. Stay quiet and you\u2019ll allow Andrews to continue his dominance. \u201cAndrews has now reached a point of such supremacy in the political landscape, they can\u2019t just keep on keeping the gloves off.\u201d Andrews doesn\u2019t have to do much to swat away the Liberals for now. Smith posted a silly Twitter poll a few days ago, asking whether Andrews should be called \u201cChairman\u201d or \u201cDictator\u201d. Asked about it, Andrews said: \u201cI don\u2019t comment on people who are fundamentally irrelevant to the work that I do.\u201d Easy.",

This might seem an arcane diversion, but it\u2019s important. It marks the point in time when China hawks on the Coalition backbench started to front-run the government\u2019s China policy.</p> <h2>The official line on Beijing became tougher in increments</h2> <p>Let\u2019s remind ourselves quickly about what happened. In March 2017, Malcolm Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/28/china-extradition-treaty-government-isolated-abbott-joins-critics\">had to yank a proposed extradition treaty</a> with China because of an internal boilover. Labor, the Greens and the former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/20/cory-bernardi-stalls-china-australia-extradition-treaty-for-six-months\">lined up in support of a disallowance motion</a> to scuttle the proposed treaty with China, and a handful of Liberal senators telegraphed they would back the disallowance.</p> <p>Perhaps some of the opponents were intent on creating opportunistic havoc for Turnbull and then foreign minister Julie Bishop, but in the main, the internal resistance to the treaty was entirely principled.</p> <p>The argument from Liberals who dissented from government policy was Australia should not be party to an extradition treaty with an authoritarian regime where the rule of law does not prevail \u2013 an impeccable principle for anyone who cares about human rights and basic principles of liberty. The mystery was not the pushback, but why Australia had contemplated such an agreement in the first place. It seemed symptomatic of a loss of moral clarity in the relationship; that the dollars had clouded the sense.</p> <p>Prevailing in that internal battle taught the China hawks there was merit in pushing the envelope, and it is fair to say after that incident, the government\u2019s official line on Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/09/china-says-turnbulls-remarks-have-poisoned-the-atmosphere-of-relations\">became tougher in increments</a>.</p> <p>Obviously the shift that played out during 2017 is significantly more complex and multifaceted than a backbench tail wagging a frontbench dog. There is a good book to be written documenting how and why Australia\u2019s tone about China became more muscular, and how that pivot was then <a href=\"https://insidestory.org.au/journalists-on-the-ramparts/\">filtered and amplified through the media</a> \u2013 resulting in a complex bilateral relationship being presented routinely in cartoonish and sometimes hysterical terms. The era of the \u201cpanda hugger\u201d was unleashed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/australia-australia-pm-scott-morrison-disappointed-if-china-coronavirus-invesigation-tariff-plan-linked-covid-19-inquiry\">Scott Morrison 'disappointed' if China tariff plan is linked to coronavirus investigation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s a great story, but the simple point to establish right now is a front-running, or pace-setting, dynamic was created within the government after the 2017 treaty boilover. That dynamic has persisted, and if anything accelerated, to the point where the Coalition\u2019s China hawks have factions.</p> <h2>Let a hundred flowers bloom</h2> <p>George, not known for playing well with others, is a solo act. The New South Wales conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/scott-morrisons-push-for-who-reforms-a-herding-cats-exercise-liberal-senator-says\">Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is another soloist</a>. Then there\u2019s the group that have dubbed themselves \u201cThe Wolverines\u201d (which believe it or not is a reference to a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087985/\">Patrick Swayze movie, Red Dawn</a>) \u2013 people like Andrew Hastie, the head of parliament\u2019s intelligence committee, James Paterson and Tim Wilson. This latter group runs as a pack, coordinating messaging.</p> <p>This front-running is largely unrestrained by Scott Morrison or senior ministers \u2013 at least not in public \u2013 which is a dynamic worth investigating. Given the issue in question is the China relationship \u2013 a matter of great import given the combustibility of the geopolitics, and the importance of the trading relationship to Australia\u2019s economic prosperity \u2013 Morrison could muzzle. He could insist that he and the foreign minister articulate Australia\u2019s foreign policy, and yet he mostly gives the hawks their head, provided the language doesn\u2019t get too florid.</p> <p>We are witnessing a contemporary Maoism. <em><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-silence-that-preceded-chinas-great-leap-into-famine-51898077/\">Let a hundred flowers bloom</a>, and a hundred schools of thought contend.</em> The obvious question to ask is why? There are a few potential answers. Morrison evidently calculates the risk of muzzling up-and-coming MPs who believe they must speak outweighs the benefits of dialling down the diplomatic noise.</p> <p>Presumably the prime minister intuits a crackdown on the free range China seminar within his own ranks would lead to a lethal breakout at some point or other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9829be965a283d80615b6990ab5fd264684419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9829be965a283d80615b6990ab5fd264684419/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Payne and Morrison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other benefit for Morrison of the free range seminar is it allows his government, domestically, to project many positions on China. It allows the government to speak to people in the community who fear the hegemonic ambitions of the authoritarian regime in Beijing. The hawks represent those view points, while the grown-ups in the ministry maintain a more measured diplomatic tone, trying to keep trade on the rails.</p> <p>Now why would Morrison feel the need to be all things to all people? A cynic might observe this is situation normal for this prime minister, but the worst thing about cynicism is it saps curiosity. We need to be curious about why things happen, and there are significant issues to tease out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/chinas-coercive-behaviour-a-wake-up-call-australias-former-top-public-servant-says\">China's coercive behaviour a 'wake-up call', Australia's former top public servant says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment. Australians can see the great powers are in flux. China is rising, and America is withdrawing from global leadership. The geopolitical gear shift isn\u2019t elegant, it\u2019s chaotic and unsettling, and we are wedged between our most important security partner, America, and our economic interests in the region.</p> <p>Then of course, Covid-19 hit, bringing with it an overlay of domestic economic insecurity. Anyone in politics right now knows unease is building in the Australian community. You can feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/essential-poll-one-in-10-australians-who-have-lost-jobs-fear-they-wont-work-again\">a ripple of anxiety in our Guardian Essential poll</a> as people begin to fret about their labour market prospects, with unemployment still to peak at 10%. A strong majority in that survey suspects China isn\u2019t being transparent in its reporting about the scope of the pandemic. A significant chunk of the sample, over a third, thinks the Covid-19 virus was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\">engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan</a>.</p> <p>We know that economic downturns light a match under nativist sentiment. We saw it during the global financial crisis, which triggered Brexit, and created the wave that carried Donald Trump to the presidency. We largely avoided a witches brew here because we were shielded from the worst of the fallout by China\u2019s demand for our commodities and by an economic stimulus program rolled out by the then Labor government.</p> <p>But the negative economic effects of Covid are harder to insulate ourselves from, despite the Coalition\u2019s stimulus now dwarfing Labor\u2019s in 2009. There has always been a current of community opposition to foreign investment, to foreign workers, to threats beyond our borders. That\u2019s in Australia\u2019s collective DNA. But this undercurrent of nativism will be turbocharged by the economic shock associated with the coronavirus.</p> <p>Over the coming months, the government is going to be dealing with rising protectionist sentiment, both domestically and internationally \u2013 and here\u2019s a prediction. While the Wolverines faction have been out promulgating the perils of proximity to the Chinese Communist party, those same MPs will also be on the frontline of resisting a return to protectionism.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a journey, this column, so let\u2019s bring our story together: Morrison giving the China hawks their way \u2013 while pursuing a more restrained diplomatic line at senior levels \u2013 presumably works in his head as an automatic stabiliser in febrile political times.</p> <p>Bubbling grievances and anxieties are validated by one arm of the government, while the grown-ups work to keep the China relationship more or less on the rails, and duck to avoid being co-opted by the lunatic in the Oval Office, who would burn the world to the ground to survive his date with the ballot box in November.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite the game of chicken, this. Maybe it works, and Australia manages to weather the geopolitical storm. Or maybe things go to shit in a really big way, because China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australia-china-ties-at-risk-of-slipping-into-permanent-hostility-former-senior-diplomat-warns\">declines to be played off the break by Australia</a> for domestic purposes, and the lunatic burns us all.</p>",

The other benefit for Morrison of the free range seminar is it allows his government, domestically, to project many positions on China. It allows the government to speak to people in the community who fear the hegemonic ambitions of the authoritarian regime in Beijing. The hawks represent those view points, while the grown-ups in the ministry maintain a more measured diplomatic tone, trying to keep trade on the rails. Now why would Morrison feel the need to be all things to all people? A cynic might observe this is situation normal for this prime minister, but the worst thing about cynicism is it saps curiosity. We need to be curious about why things happen, and there are significant issues to tease out. The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment. Australians can see the great powers are in flux. China is rising, and America is withdrawing from global leadership. The geopolitical gear shift isn\u2019t elegant, it\u2019s chaotic and unsettling, and we are wedged between our most important security partner, America, and our economic interests in the region. Then of course, Covid-19 hit, bringing with it an overlay of domestic economic insecurity. Anyone in politics right now knows unease is building in the Australian community. You can feel a ripple of anxiety in our Guardian Essential poll as people begin to fret about their labour market prospects, with unemployment still to peak at 10%. A strong majority in that survey suspects China isn\u2019t being transparent in its reporting about the scope of the pandemic. A significant chunk of the sample, over a third, thinks the Covid-19 virus was engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. We know that economic downturns light a match under nativist sentiment. We saw it during the global financial crisis, which triggered Brexit, and created the wave that carried Donald Trump to the presidency. We largely avoided a witches brew here because we were shielded from the worst of the fallout by China\u2019s demand for our commodities and by an economic stimulus program rolled out by the then Labor government. But the negative economic effects of Covid are harder to insulate ourselves from, despite the Coalition\u2019s stimulus now dwarfing Labor\u2019s in 2009. There has always been a current of community opposition to foreign investment, to foreign workers, to threats beyond our borders. That\u2019s in Australia\u2019s collective DNA. But this undercurrent of nativism will be turbocharged by the economic shock associated with the coronavirus. Over the coming months, the government is going to be dealing with rising protectionist sentiment, both domestically and internationally \u2013 and here\u2019s a prediction. While the Wolverines faction have been out promulgating the perils of proximity to the Chinese Communist party, those same MPs will also be on the frontline of resisting a return to protectionism. It\u2019s been a journey, this column, so let\u2019s bring our story together: Morrison giving the China hawks their way \u2013 while pursuing a more restrained diplomatic line at senior levels \u2013 presumably works in his head as an automatic stabiliser in febrile political times. Bubbling grievances and anxieties are validated by one arm of the government, while the grown-ups work to keep the China relationship more or less on the rails, and duck to avoid being co-opted by the lunatic in the Oval Office, who would burn the world to the ground to survive his date with the ballot box in November. It\u2019s quite the game of chicken, this. Maybe it works, and Australia manages to weather the geopolitical storm. Or maybe things go to shit in a really big way, because China declines to be played off the break by Australia for domestic purposes, and the lunatic burns us all.",

      "bodyText": "Lola Greeno collects delicate, pearlescent shells she turns into jewellery, the way Tasmanian Aboriginal women have been doing for thousands of years. But this year Greeno has missed the spring tide on Flinders Island, one of the very few times to harvest them, because of Covid-19 travel restrictions. Greeno will have to wait until November, when the little rainbow kelp shells reappear in the shallows at the end of their breeding season. The knowledge and skill of shellwork is an otherwise unbroken tradition passed down through generations of women from the Furneaux Islands off Tasmania\u2019s north-east coast. Greeno, whose intricate work appears in all state and territory art gallery collections, says she learned from two great teachers of the art: her mother, Valerie Burgess, and her mother-in-law Dulcie Greeno, who is now 96 and in an aged care home. The art of shellwork was part of life growing up on Cape Barren Island. \u201cIt was just a common practice. It was all part and parcel of our life over there. \u201cLiving on Cape Barren was pretty isolated. We used to walk to school and walk home from school but we enjoyed it, because we enjoyed school. To us it seemed fine, but other people have said to me, \u2018Well, it must have been pretty difficult for your mother\u2019, because the Cape Barren Island Reserve Act was still in place until 1951.\u201d The Act, introduced in 1912, was modelled on Aboriginal protection legislation on the mainland, and gave authorities the power to remove Aboriginal children from their families. The Act recognised islanders as a distinct group but had strict control over their daily lives. \u201cIt was more difficult for families because they couldn\u2019t leave the island. There were still restrictions,\u201d Greeno says. \u201cYou could go outside the reserve once the sun was up but you had to be inside it before sundown. And it was silly to have that on an isolated island \u2013 you know, where could you go?\u201d Shell collecting, like muttonbirding, were traditional seasonal activities that were \u2013 and still are \u2013 fundamental to Aboriginal life on the island. \u201cTo get to get the best-quality maireener shells you need to go at a spring tide,\u201d Greeno says. \u201cWe\u2019re very limited to how many spring tides we have in a calendar year.\u201d At those times, Greeno says the shells are close to shore, clinging to the kelp. \u201cThey take on the colours of the coral and disguise themselves in rock pools. Then they go out into deeper water to breed and then they come back in again and they\u2019ve reached their full growing potential by the end of April. \u201cI\u2019m very careful about how much we take. We use little sandwich bags to measure how much we collect in a day. \u201cIf I miss this tide next week, that means I don\u2019t have any shells for the rest of the year. \u201cUsually I take my husband and my son and my grandchildren but you know, I\u2019m not going to be doing too many more, I\u2019m probably going to be sending them in future.\u201d The whole family join in collecting and they take enough to last 12 months. \u201cEverybody loves them, because they are very pearly, iridescent sort of colours, the bluey ones and the greeny ones.\u201d But they don\u2019t give themselves away too much. In the water they\u2019re usually covered in \u201ca little brown skin, like a little brown coating\u201d. \u201cWe bring them home and we \u2018rot them out\u2019 [lay them outside to let flies and insects do their work], so that the little fish are cleaned out. And we have to keep checking every few days and then they are rinsed and washed, and then we use a solution to get that outer coating off, to reveal that opalescence.\u201d Traditionally, Greeno says, women would put the maireeners in another big beach shell and put it in a fire and smoke them. \u201cAnd then they sat and rubbed the outer coating off, and that was their traditional way of cleaning them. They pierced the shells with the eye tooth of a kangaroo bone and threaded them on to [kangaroo] sinew. \u201cThat\u2019s a very ancient part of the practice. It\u2019s been there since the year dot as far as our people are concerned.\u201d Traditionally, the shells would be polished with muttonbird oil. \u201cThey say that we\u2019ve been here for 60,000 years. The women always dived in the water, the women always gathered berries, and diving in the water after abalone was a common practice for women in the earlier days. \u201cWomen had necklaces when the first explorers came in 1700s and exchanged with the French, they took some necklaces away with them. Covid-19 has added a new layer of homesickness for the nourishment that being on country provides. \u201cI still love going to the beaches. There\u2019s nothing like it. The thing is that walking on the beach, you\u2019ve got to have a walk with no shoes on your feet so all that lovely sand sort of rubs clean the soles of your feet. It just does something very good for you. \u201cIf I\u2019d been over there, I probably would have left the rest of the family in the bay collecting and I would have walked. I\u2019ve got a favourite bay that I walk around, go around to the end and then come back again. So we make the most of our time. \u201cYou never get those times back again. You\u2019ve just got to make the most of what you can and some good things will come out of this. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it will make families appreciate one another more.\u201d Read the rest of the series Old knowledge for the new normal",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been forced to cave into to Conservative backbench rebels opposed to the presence of Huawei in 5G networks and has drawn up plans to reduce the Chinese company\u2019s involvement to zero by 2023. The prime minister\u2019s retreat is designed to stave off what could have been an embarrassing defeat when his existing proposal to reduce Huawei to a 35% market share was to be voted on in the Commons. Although Johnson boasts an 80 strong majority, the number of Conservative MPs willing to rebel on the issue is now estimated to be 50 \u2013 enough in theory to defeat the government \u2013 as anti-Chinese sentiment hardens in the light of the coronavirus crisis. The mooted retreat will delight the White House which has been relentlessly campaigning against Huawei, but is likely to provoke a hostile reaction from Beijing, which has believed the UK was open to inward investment until now. The original plan was signed off as recently as January with the support of Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies. They argued that any risks that Huawei equipment could be exploited for mass surveillance could be contained. But political concerns about the Chinese company lingered. The rebels forced a vote on an unrelated telecoms bill in early March, and 38 Conservative MPs voted with the opposition after Johnson refused to slash Huawei\u2019s market share to zero. At the time, that was not enough to defeat No 10 but sources close to the rebels said a growing number of the 2019 intake of MPs were ready to vote against the government, in a sign of escalating geo-political tension with China. As the coronavirus crisis worsened, China has been accused of not being transparent about the early phases of the disease \u2013 while tension has also risen further as Beijing has recently threatened to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong. Senior ministers also want to reduce the UK\u2019s economic dependance on China for essential goods in the light of the crisis and have begun to draw up \u201cProject Defend\u201d aimed at boosting British self sufficiency in strategic medical and technological sectors \u2013 following warnings from intelligence agencies that the UK needed to reassess its relationship with China. Downing Street declined to comment although sources said the reports of the Johnson plan were accurate.
